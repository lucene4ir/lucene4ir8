# Data and Collections


This directory contains sample files for a few [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov)
Collections along with the full collection for CACM.

The samples are provided to test out the indexers and to play around
with getting some example statistics out.

If you have access to the full collections then you can update the file lists to point
to your collection, and then index all the documents in the associated collections.
