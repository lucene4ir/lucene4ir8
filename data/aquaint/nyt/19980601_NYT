KENNETH J. LENIHAN, SOCIOLOGIST WHO STUDIED CAUSES OF RECIDIVISM,
DIES AT 69

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenneth Joseph Lenihan, a New York research
sociologist who helped refine the scientific methods used in
criminology, died May 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenihan retired in 1995 as an associate professor of sociology
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He had joined the faculty
in 1980, after earlier stints as a researcher at Columbia
University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, the Vera Institute
of Justice in New York and the Bureau of Social Science Research in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his expertise to the study of recidivism rates among
criminal offenders. He conducted a study in Baltimore, called the
Life Project, for the U.S. Department of Labor in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A large research project, it measured whether and how giving
jobs or money to recently released offenders would affect the
chances of their becoming repeaters. That project and further
studies formed the basis of a standard work in the field, which he
wrote with P. Rossi and D. Berk, ``Money, Work and Crime''
(Academic Press, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   Lenihan was born in Queens, and graduated from Columbia's School
of General Studies in 1960. He also earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in
sociology at Columbia, the latter in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lenihan is survived by two sons, Andrew of Miami, and William of
Manhattan; a daughter, Jean Lenihan of Seattle; four sisters,
Eileen McEwan of Houston, Moira Earhart of North Carolina, Jean
Dobson of Bay Shore, N.Y., and Sue Adams of Cape May, N.J.; and
three grandchildren.

MEDALLIONS LOSE THEIR LUSTER AS CITY TIGHTENS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jack Lin heard his winning bid for a newly
minted taxi medallion announced at City Hall last September, he
felt a flush of love for his adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? As the Taxi and Limousine Commission's chairwoman,
Diane McGrath-McKechnie, had stated, ``Aside from being a
rock-solid investment for any potential small-business owner or
entrepreneur, taxicab medallions are literally a piece of the
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lin's heavily financed $231,791 investment has been looking
a little risky since Thursday, when the commission steeply
increased insurance requirements and dropped the thresholds at
which cabbies can lose their licenses. With a requirement to set
aside another $100,000 for accident victims and even lower
suspension thresholds likely to be voted on this month, it could
get riskier still.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city said how good it is to buy the medallion, how it
keeps its value, the price never goes down,'' said Lin, an
immigrant from Hong Kong and a New York cabdriver for five years,
speaking Sunday along a curb in the West Village. ``But they don't
tell you the rules were going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the tens of thousands of taxi and livery drivers and owners
having to deal with the commission's new safety regulations, the
5,000 owner-drivers of yellow cabs, who have neither bosses nor
workers to cushion the impact of the changes, have been hit the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is more bitter than the men and women who bought 400
new medallions at auctions in 1996 and 1997 _ except, perhaps, for
more recent buyers who paid even more money, up to $250,000 each
for pre-existing medallions, only to learn that prices have plunged
as much as $50,000 since the new rules were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says that cabbies who own their medallions are
the safest drivers because they have the most invested, both
financially and emotionally, in their business. But when they do
get into accidents, they tend to leave their victims even more
poorly compensated than the rest of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Big fleets, while they take great pains to hide their assets,
will sometimes pay fair settlements under sufficient legal
pressure. But a cabby who has mortgaged everything he has to buy a
medallion _ most of Lin's $30,000 down payment, for example, was
scraped up from friends and relatives, while the rest of the money
was borrowed from a lender _ has nothing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dilemma,'' said Sandra Silverman, a taxi commissioner
who voted for the new rules but whose reservations about the
$100,000 bond forced Ms. McGrath-McKechnie to postpone the vote on
it. ``If you look at it objectively, if you have someone driving
the public around in a car, there's no reason why that car
shouldn't be insured at the highest possible level. But the
detailed and subjective reality is what does this do to all those
people who are already in business and started operating under
another standard, playing by the old rules?''
</P>
<P>
   It costs them money, for one. The new insurance minimums _
$100,000 in liability coverage rather than $25,000, and $200,000 to
cover medical bills rather than $100,000 _ are expected to increase
owner-drivers' premiums, now typically $3,100 a year, to $6,000 or
more. The new penalty schedule, which raises fines several hundred
percent for infractions from smoking to speeding, can also cause a
driver to lose his license after only two tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the requirement that every medallion owner set aside
$100,000 in a bond _ which accident victims can collect if they get
judgments in excess of insurance coverage _ that worries drivers
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble generating $40,000 to put down on my
medallion,'' Johan Nijman, who bought his medallion in March for
$240,000, told the commission at its meeting on Thursday. ``How in
the world do you expect me to put up another $100,000? I have six
kids, two dogs and two cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxi industry leaders, who filed suit on Friday to overturn the
new rules, have asked the commission to consider alternatives to
the bond, like requiring owners to contribute to a pool of money to
compensate people with the most devastating injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie was unwavering. ``I think the bond is
going to pass as it is because it's an excellent proposal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether independent owners whose medallions were
already mortgaged to the hilt might find it impossible to come up
with another $100,000, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that many of them
were financing their medallions by choice, not by necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may have assets in other places and they have
chosen not to pay off the medallion or to put their assets
elsewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Greenbaum, a lender and broker who said he financed more
than 100 of the new medallion purchases, scoffed at her assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 10 percent of these guys have other assets,'' he said.
``Maybe less. Most of them came up through the ranks. They drove,
they bought their cars, then they bought their medallions. Where
would they be getting all this money from?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that in any case, a driver who
stretched himself paper-thin to buy a medallion was not acting
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenbaum noted that the commission, in promoting the
medallion auction, held seminars for bankers to encourage them to
lend money to medallion buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to make your auction bid legal,'' Greenbaum said,
``you had to either have a bond or have 70 percent of your bid
guaranteed by a lender. It's hard to believe they weren't promoting
the financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum and other brokers are feeling the pinch of the new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until a few weeks ago, I had a list of buyers and no
sellers,'' said Ronald Chipman, a broker at Westway Medallion
Sales. ``Now I have a list of sellers but no buyers.''

MUD ROUTE GETS FIRST STAKES WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Mud Route won The Californian on Sunday and
lost his claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Until he surged to the lead on the turn for home at Hollywood
Park and held off Deputy Commander by two lengths, he was the best
horse who'd never won a stakes race.
</P>
<P>
   Mud Route, ridden and trained by Hall of Famers Chris McCarron
and Ron McAnally, was an early West Coast favorite for the 1997
Kentucky Derby after swift maiden and allowance victories _ but
shin problems sidelined him until fall. At Santa Anita this winter,
the colt twice finished second to '97 Derby winner Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation preceded him to Arkansas, where he was favored in
the Oaklawn Handicap but ran fourth. A confidence-building victory
against cheaper horses last time out set him up for The
Californian, a $250,000 race whose 45 winners include 10 national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Mud Route ($3.80), once a speedball, stalked Worldly Ways for
most of the 1[-mile race. Deputy Commander, trying to find his
Travers- and Super Derby-winning form and carrying six pounds more
than the field, came wide and finished 2{ lengths in front of
third-place Worldly Ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not sure if he can beat Silver Charm,''
McAnally said of Mud Route, ``but at least he's won a stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is the June 28 Hollywood Gold Cup, where the question will
be if he can beat Gentlemen and Skip Away, and the popular answer
will be ``no.'' Also expected for that $1 million race are Malek,
Puerto Madero, Behrens, Bagshot and Deputy Commander.
</P>
<P>
   No Californian winner has captured the Gold Cup since Cutlass
Reality 10 years ago. This was the slowest Californian (1:48) since
Another Review's in '92.
</P>
<P>
   Mud Route has won five of 11 starts and more than $460,000 for
Janis Whitham. And finally, his resume includes black type.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, McCarron and McAnally teamed up again to win the
$150,000 Estrapade Stakes on the turf with late-running Proud
Fillie ($5.40). &QL;

CARDINAL LETS PASS A CHANCE TO TOSS THUNDERBOLTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The media turned out in force at St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday, anticipating yet another in what has lately
been a series of public pronouncements by Cardinal John O'Connor on
issues like Little League play on Sundays and domestic partnership
legislation. Perhaps he would weigh in on Terrence McNally's
controversial new play, or comment on some other pressing social
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal, however, stayed focused on Sunday's confirmation
Mass for 25 Catholics with severe disabilities _ although he did
manage to find a few opportunities to tweak the assembled
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media may be here because they expect me to say something
outrageous today,'' he said, provoking a ripple of laughter through
the cathedral. ``But I'm sorry to disappoint you. I wouldn't dream
of trying to upstage these magnificent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year on the Feast of Pentecost, St. Patrick's Cathedral
offers the Sacrament of Confirmation to people who have prepared
through the archdiocese's Office for Persons with Disabilities. The
cardinal told a bit about each of the people, some blind or using
crutches or wheelchairs: the 15-year-old who has spina bifida and
``loves animals, and feels he can talk to them''; the 8-year-old
who is autistic and loves to play on the swings; the 46-year-old
who has brain damage but knows the day of the week by the food he
is served.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets eggs on Tuesday,'' the cardinal said. ``I don't get
eggs on Tuesday unless we have visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cardinal introduced the confirmation candidates, he made
a couple of sly references to his recent statements that had gained
widespread attention. Talking about a 14-year-old with multiple
learning disabilities who plays baseball in a special Little
League, the cardinal said, ``But he never plays on Sunday
morning.'' A 10-year-old who has muscular dystrophy realizes he
cannot play baseball, so his dream is to be the manager for the
Yankees. ``And he will never play ball on Good Friday,'' O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, the congregation applauded.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor carried out his duties without special security
precautions after the police investigated a possible threat against
him uncovered Saturday. According to the police, a man had
approached a priest at St. Joseph's Catholic Church on East 87th
Street in Manhattan and said that someone ``was going to harm the
cardinal'' at the parish's 100th anniversary Mass, which the
cardinal was to celebrate that night. Additional police officers
were assigned, and the Mass was held without incident.
</P>
<P>
   No precautions were taken on Sunday morning beyond the several
police officers who are always on hand for Sunday Masses at St.
Patrick's. The cardinal, a former Navy chaplain, was unfazed by the
threat, said his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal used to celebrate Mass in foxholes and on the
back of jeeps in Vietnam,'' Zwilling said. ``He's a tough man to
rattle.''

SCHOOL DISTRICT MATH QUIZ: WHEN SHOULD CLASSES START? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn., Pa.)  (bb) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For education officials, setting the school calendar has become
as mind-boggling as solving a complex math equation. They have to
take into account religious holidays, federal holidays, contracts
with teachers, family vacations and local customs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they have one more consideration: Labor Day is
unusually late, falling on Sept. 7. And the date is playing havoc
with the decision on when to begin classes for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Norwalk, Conn., school will start Sept. 1, a bit later than
surrounding school districts, but before Labor Day, when many
families are still enjoying the last of their summer vacations. In
Farmingdale, on Long Island, students will return to classes on
Sept. 3, the first time they have done so before the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In Perth Amboy, N.J., school officials opted to convene classes
on Sept. 9, but to do away with vacation days for two Jewish
holidays. That has angered the teachers' union, which is enlisting
the help of Jewish groups and legislators to challenge the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where the teachers' contract says school
cannot start before Labor Day, classes will also begin Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   State laws dictate the number of days children must be in school
_ generally about 180. But in most states, local districts
determine when school starts, with the decisions setting the rhythm
of family life.
</P>
<P>
   As officials everywhere are realizing this year, any tinkering
with the first day of school affects every other holiday or day off
throughout the year. More important, the start date affects the
length of the summer break, the vacation most families still care
most about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we try something that impinges or infringes on that
traditional summer family vacation, it becomes controversial,''
said Orville Ballard, a regional liaison to the State Commissioner
of Education in Texas. ``People still expect summer to be vacation
time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nancy Powers, a sales director for a medical company in
Bucks County, Pa., the decision by the Pennsbury School District to
start school before Labor Day almost ruined her family's vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Powers said she and her family had paid a year in advance to
rent a beach house in North Carolina this August. But in December,
she learned that the district had decided to start school on Aug.
30, before her family was to return. Ms. Powers said the family had
trouble getting the rental agency to return the money and had to
pay twice as much to rent another house a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still going down there, and we're going to enjoy it,
but we had a traumatic change of plans for no reason at all,'' Ms.
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Norwalk, the calendar is set two years in advance, sometimes
three. Officials there begin school before Labor Day if the holiday
is late, and after if it is early. But unlike its neighbors,
Norwalk usually does not start school in August. And the district
continues to have two breaks in the spring, one in February and one
in March or April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love tradition here,'' said Dr. Susan Weinberger, public
affairs officer for the district. ``Parents don't want to lose
their vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual holidays and family vacations that a district
has to work around, setting the calendar can involve a range of
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut law, for instance, says school must end by June 30,
the last day of the state's fiscal year. That means many districts
begin classes in August.
</P>
<P>
   In Perth Amboy, the worry was having enough time to prepare for
the high school proficiency exam, a test on which the district has
performed poorly. Jack Roedecker, the assistant superintendent in
Perth Amboy, said his district did not want to start before Labor
Day and so to gain extra days decided to not close for two Jewish
holidays. That decision angered teachers, many of whom are Jewish.
Most of the students in the district are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as anybody kept track of the school calendar, the
Jewish holidays have always been observed here in Perth Amboy,''
said Norm Tankiewicz, the district representative for the Perth
Amboy Federation/AFT, the teachers' union. ``We're going to have a
significant number of teachers who will be absent anyway, so it's
going to be very chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, districts have different starting dates: Los
Angeles begins Sept. 9. Miami starts Aug. 31. In Kansas City, Mo.,
classes convene Sept. 1, the first time school has started before
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Districts that have chosen to begin school after the late
holiday have had to compromise on other days off. Most schools on
Long Island will begin classes before Sept. 7. In South Huntington,
though, the board decided to begin classes after Labor Day, but to
do away with part of the winter break in February.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents said they preferred starting after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had started before Labor Day, we would have had a lot of
absences,'' said Irene Cruikshank, president of the Council of
South Huntington PTA's. ``It would have been like starting school
twice.''

REACTION MIXED IN TOWN WHERE IMMIGRANTS LANDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With ALIENS-SMUGGLE) (bb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY HEAD, N.J. _ Residents of this wealthy seaside community
reacted Sunday with a mix of sympathy and flippancy as they learned
that 22 Chinese immigrants landed here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' said Kim Morris, owner of a fashion boutique
that sells Lilly Pulitzer clothes. ``They spend their life savings
to get here, they survive weeks on a boat _ not that I approve of
illegal aliens, but it's sad. They thought they were in Chinatown,
and here they were running around Bay Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Hoy said that the immigrants had probably paid
thousands of dollars to be smuggled into the United States. ``You
know how long it took them to make that money?'' Ms. Hoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, speculating that the boat that was carrying the
immigrants _ the Oops II _ had made a wrong turn, noted the irony
of economically desperate immigrants washing up in the borough of
Bay Head, where expensive cars are parked in nearly every driveway.
``It's just perfect,'' Katie Dempsey said. ``This is probably the
most affluent town on the Jersey Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Head, in Ocean County, encompasses only 1.3 square miles and
has a population of 1,100. Many residents referred to the
immigrants' landing as the ``Chinese invasion,'' and news of it
swept through town faster than word travels when the sea bass are
biting.
</P>
<P>
   By early Sunday afternoon, after the Oops II had been towed from
the beach, residents and tourists who stayed behind were doing
their best to come up with a good rumor to explain its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Smith, whose house sits atop the dunes at the foot of
Mount Street a few yards from where the Oops II ran aground, said
he was sure the immigrants must have come from a ``mother ship''
somewhere offshore. But he had another theory for why the boat ran
so far up the beach. ``They must have been chased by someone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, here's what happened,'' said Boyd Fletcher, visiting from
Portsmouth, Va. ``They were supposed to be going on to New York.
They paid $5,000 a person to get here. They had a contact on shore
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making it up,'' he added, ``but I also think it's true. I
think it happens all the time _ people paying skippers of these
boats under the table to bring them to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyndham Anderson of Princeton Junction, who had brought the
Fletchers to Bay Head, agreed. ``They were looking for the
subway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding her beach bonnet down to her ears with both hands in the
wind, Lorraine Nowicki of Whiting said she was glad all 22
immigrants had been detained, but surprised that they had made it
ashore. ``Where are all the patrol boats that are supposed to be
patrolling?'' she said. ``I think it's unfair that they should come
here, make our money, and send it back to China, while we're here
starving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzgerald, a 15-year-old skateboarder, said he thought the
whole thing was ``pretty crazy _ but it's exciting. Nothing much
ever happens in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   To Harold Seickendick, enjoying a Budweiser at Marlins a
restaurant on the edge of town, the landing of the Oops II was just
a bother. ``I fish off the Mount Street jetty. That's my spot. And
they ruined it,'' he said. ``I went up to check the fish at 7:30
this morning, and it was all closed off with police tape.''

   He took another long sip of his long-neck. ``It's a pretty nice
craft they wasted,'' he said of the boat. ``The Coast Guard has it,

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Visiting an editor at Random House, I stepped into a crowded
elevator and found myself pressed close to the control panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has everybody got their floors?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment's silence, a young female voice from the rear
said, ``His or her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg your pardon?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His or her. It's `Has everybody got his or her floors?' Your
pronouns don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And shouldn't it be `his or her floor,' not `floors'?'' a
young man piped up. ``Each of us gets off at only one floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And wouldn't it be better to say `Does everybody have?' rather
than `Has everybody got?''' a third voice chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   I stood corrected _ and red faced. But I was glad to know that
good grammar is alive and well.

   Daniele Di Piazza was walking along upper Park Avenue with her
son, Fabrizio, and his puppy named Squid, who as her name suggests
is as black as ink. A little girl, about 10, beautifully dressed,
accompanied by her father and walking toward them, spotted Squid
and began to jump up and down with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Daddy, that is the perfect dog,'' she exclaimed. ``I want
one just like that _ except in brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Anna Wintour?
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Dillon heard this one from her eye doctor: An Italian
friend of his was visiting after a long absence from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner, he talked about how impressed he was with the
cleanliness of the city and the quality-of-life campaign. However,
he said he was surprised that the campaign seemed to condone what
appeared to be a burgeoning of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   How had he come to that conclusion? his host asked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he said, everywhere he went there were groups of
well-dressed women idling in doorways smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up one surprising result of the city's anti-smoking
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The woman waiting to board the bus was obviously irritated at
the number of people using the entrance door to get off. As the
last to exit, a well-dressed middle-aged man, descended, she called
out: ``Why don't you get off at the back?'' He looked at her
indignantly: ``I'm not a tourist,'' he said.

<P>
   My father, Dr. Harry Goldin, a physician who died recently in
his 100th year, was renowned among his patients for his quick wit.
Over the week of our shiva observance, my brother, sister and I
were regaled with many anecdotes, but one stands out.
</P>
<P>
   A former patient told us that although she had moved away years
ago, she continued to consult my father by phone on all significant
issues relating to her health.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, she said, she called my father to ask his
advice on a course of treatment that had been recommended by her
regular physician. After hearing my father's views, she asked,
``Dr. Goldin, shouldn't I get a second opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he replied. ``Call me again tomorrow.''

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   Needing a tennis partner, I checked out the clubhouse bulletin
board where the players list themselves only by their first names.
I rang up ``Anita,'' giving her only my first name and, because she
had a young-sounding voice and I didn't want her to be aghast on
seeing my gray hair, added my age. That was OK, Anita said, and
she, too, offered her age.
</P>
<P>
   When she gave me her last name, I mentioned that was the same
name as the college I attended. She had attended it too, she said,
and after a brief pause, asked my last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you, Sara,'' she exclaimed. She gave her name.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that not only had we gone to the same college, but
we had both been part of the college theater group.
</P>
<P>
   And we knew that we had both lied about our ages!

   A further communique regarding sea gulls. Ellen Burke wasn't too
impressed about the story of the sea gull in Bayside that dropped a
sesame bagel. The action, she says, is in Robert Moses State Park
where apparently the gulls are not only fearless but deft _ one
recently swooped down, plucked her niece's hot dog right out of its
bun and soared off triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan birds are more discriminating. Mikel Stettner saw this
note attached to a bench in Central Park: ``The person who brings a
bagel every morning for the birds. Please don't bring `Everything
Bagels.' The birds don't like it. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Sullivan paid $1 for a secondhand address book recently,
and what an address book it turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
   He bought it at a yard sale in East Hampton at the home of a
famous theatrical couple, and he's still mesmerized by his glimpse
into another world, and the juxtaposition of the celebrated and the
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   There's Dick Cavett, Cy Coleman and Betty Comden next to Cable
Vision and the Cleaners, Joseph Heller and Don Hewitt along with
the Handyman and Hardware store, and Kurt Vonnegut listed with the
Villa sandwich shop. Why was Lauren Bacall crossed out _ a falling
out or a change of phone number? Why five masseuses? In fact, why
was the address book in the sale anyway? Talk about getting your
money's worth.

   On a recent trip to New York, I had occasion to visit the main

   Postal Clerk: ``We have books of 20 stamps for $6.40.''

SUBURBS REJECTING YESTERDAY'S ANSWER TO TODAY'S SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Pa., Calif., N.J.) (bb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLOATSBURG, N.Y. _ The law people cite most often in this
village these days is the one that says precisely what kind of
housing is allowed: single-family houses on lots of 40,000 square
feet, single-family houses on 30,000 square feet, single-family
houses on 15,000 square feet and single-family houses on 10,000
square feet. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``apartment'' appears only to describe something that
may exist on the second floor of a single-family house, and then
only by permit. Nowhere do the words ``big condominium town house
project'' appear, and villagers have been crowding town meetings
this spring to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to derail a plan by Mayor Samuel Abate to bring
the first multifamily housing to a village filled with people who
came here to get away from the very idea.
</P>
<P>
   Sloatsburgers are willing to have change and growth _ to a
point, said Becky Kern, a leader of the Little Town Forum for the
Historic Preservation of Sloatsburg, a group formed to resist
Abate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want change that will bring us to a future of jammed
roads, overcrowded schools, vinyl-clad boxes piled three and a half
stories high and a shopping center that looks like every other
strip mall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This view puts Mrs. Kern and her allies squarely in the
mainstream of a national reaction against high-density row house
developments like the one K. Hovnanian Enterprises, the biggest
town house developer in the country, hopes to build in Sloatsburg.
</P>
<P>
   It is an opposition that seems a far cry from an early
acceptance of suburban town houses, when they first began appearing
in large numbers in the 1970s, as sensible, affordable and _
because they reduced sprawl _ environmentally friendly starter
homes for young couples, or as step-down homes for empty-nesters.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of town houses has increased, complaints have
grown that town houses clog roads, send more children into local
schools than had been promised, depress the value of single-family
houses and too frequently become rental units.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Supervisors of Prince William County, Md.,
concerned about rapid growth, approved a zoning plan this spring
that reduces the number of future town houses that may be built by
10,000 units, or 40 percent. It did so by creating a zone excluding
town houses in the county's western reaches. Prince George's County
has already passed a law banning town houses in certain areas where
schools are overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors were responding to widespread complaints that
town houses were driving down property values and overcrowding
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Brian Sheerin won a seat on the town board in the
suburban Pittsburgh town of Ben Avon on the strength of a
last-minute write-in vote from neighbors opposed to a small,
15-unit town house project on Dickson Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   And in an early example that could have come from nearly
anywhere, the City Council of San Leandro, Calif., rejected a
36-unit row-house project in the northern part of town in 1992
despite a consensus from environmentalists that by filling vacant
space in a built-up area, the project was environmentally sensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how it is designed, where it is located, what it
costs and who is developing it,'' Bradley Inman, a real estate
writer, said in a commentary for The San Francisco Examiner.
``High-density housing almost always puts a scare into people who
live in nearby single-family neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   As in many many places, Sloatsburg residents opposed to
town-house developments said that single-family projects would be
fine. Mrs. Kern pointed to a planned development of large houses in
Tuxedo, the next village north along Highway 17. ``Why can't we
have that, and attract the same level of housing?'' Mrs. Kern said
in an interview. ``They would not have to be $350,000 houses _
$250,000 would be fine.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the suburbs' nearly universal resistance to town
houses is not hard to find, said James Hughes, dean of the School
of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Prosperity and
aging boomers have brought a change in the housing ideal, away from
the ``free and easy'' life promised by town-house advertising 20
years ago, to a more settled outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominant force in residential land-use matters is the
baby-boom generation, and to a large extent they have now settled
into communities where they are in for the long haul,'' Hughes
said. ``That's where they have decided to raise their children,
that's where they made that big investment, and they are not only
intent on protecting their investment, they are also getting
nostalgic, looking back at grandma's house and grandma's community
of single-family houses in a small-town setting _ even if they
themselves grew up in much tackier surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Huseth, president of K. Hovnanian Northeast Inc., said:
``With most towns, they just don't want anything that may generate
schoolchildren. They won't say that, but they'll whisper it to you
_ they don't want any kind of density that may give you school-age
children and they don't want any kind of housing that will generate
any more traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 Sloatsburg residents, including 800 registered
voters, signed a petition this spring opposing the mayor's plan for
a ``floating zone,'' which would allow the Mayor and the Village
Trustees to change zoning over a broad reach of the village on
their own, bypassing the Zoning Board of Appeals. Five large areas
could be thus rezoned for high-density housing, bringing in 700 to
800 new homes and 2,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   At one site, K. Hovnanian Enterprises has already filed plans
for a 340-unit town house project _ on a tract that had been
intended for 66 single-family houses _ and it is holding out a
sweetener to the town: a sewage treatment plant that would handle
both the new housing and most of the Route 17 business district.
</P>
<P>
   And after 18 years in office, Abate has learned how to make
things go his way. Over fierce opposition, he merged the police
forces of his village and the town of Ramapo and sold the village's
water supply system to a private water company. When asked what
would happen to Sloatsburg if he failed to get his way on the
floating zone, Abate was polite but firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea that it won't happen,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a greater mix of housing so our young people will be
able to stay in town,'' Abate said, noting that the village's
population had not budged since 1990. ``We need to expand our tax
base, because costs keep rising and the demand for services keeps
rising. And we need that sewer treatment plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloatsburg's single-family homes are cradled along the Route 17
corridor just north of the New Jersey line in Rockland County, and
in little valleys and hillsides in the Ramapo Mountains, which form
the village's western wall. A fair number of young families have
moved there from New Jersey and Westchester to find inexpensive
homes, average price still only $148,000, in an atmosphere that has
more of Vermont than a downstate New York commuter town, barely an
hour from Manhattan on the Short Line bus.
</P>
<P>
   But while its residential areas are fetchingly rustic,
Sloatsburg's main street, along Highway 17, is a gap-toothed
stretch of gas stations and shops, without a distinct downtown and
lacking any of the Main Street charm other rural towns have striven
to achieve. Opponents of the town house project say mass
development would only add to the downscale look of their town's
business stretch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kern and her husband, Greg, bought their old, gabled
Victorian fixer-upper seven years ago and now have two little
girls. Their home on Eagle Valley Road stands almost across from
where the entrance to a potential floating zone development could
descend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want growth _ I want development,'' Mrs. Kern said. ``But
not condos.'' Her neighbor, Bill Berntsen, expressed the surprise
many feel at being unable to stop a project that is manifestly
unpopular. ``Now you know your future is not your own,'' he said.
``It's in a developer's office.''
</P>
<P>
   At a packed public meeting on May 18, about 400 residents broke
the maximum occupancy rules at the Senior Citizens Center to
upbraid Abate and the three-member town board (one had resigned,
reportedly because of the pressure of the zoning issue).
</P>
<P>
   One speaker supported the change: Frank Dailey, a developer who
had been frustrated by the town before. Every other speaker was
opposed: Harrison Bush worried about sewer costs, Dan Simone said
the local schools would be destroyed, Rich Gurasser said young
people would be squeezed out of town and across the line into
Orange County, and Pat Kleese worried about the fate of the bear
that occasionally forages for garbage at the end of her road if the
Hovnanian project were built up to her lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look out my window and see my neighbors,'' Ms. Kleese
said, ``but I can't see what they're having for breakfast. That's
the way I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a more subtle note of concern, a note about what
kind of people might come, expressed by a speaker who asked whether
or not social service agencies would be allowed to rent any of the
new row houses for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Osborne, 28, a fifth-generation Sloatsburger, rents a home
for himself and his wife from a friend in the Flats, in the old
downtown section, while he builds his truck repair business. But he
rejected bate's contention that young families like his need new
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people are finding places to live without this
hange,'' Osborne said. ``That's why there is so much anger and
aggression against this. It's like three or four people trying to
determine the lives of 3,100 people.''

A HEAVY REGULATORY PRESENCE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BOXING-REVIVE) (bb) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHESTER, N.Y. _ Compared with small boxing events in other
parts of the country, the fights held here in April at the Capitol
Theater looked like a police officers' convention. Clumps of men in
sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission
emblems guarded the dressing-room doors. Corner inspectors in
surgical gloves leaned over the ropes to monitor the fighters and
their trainers between rounds, and were rotated at the bell, with a
new inspection team for each bout.
</P>
<P>
   That level of regulatory presence would be unthinkable in many
states. But whether it is zealous, invaluable attention to fighter
safety or wasteful extravagance is a question central to the debate
about what New York taxpayers get for their money in boxing
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the state athletic commission has been
criticized as a political patronage operation. Some boxing experts
have recently questioned the credentials of the commission's
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission has always been a dumping ground,'' said one
former senior New York boxing regulator, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when compared with other states, New York clearly
requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a
budget that dwarfs those elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's budget, which was seriously cut during the
economic recession in New York in the early 1990s, has ballooned
since, despite no growth in the number of events. In 1992, for
example, the commission spent $494,800 to regulate 31 boxing shows.
Last year it spent $841,000 to oversee 30.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the commission, Scott Trent, said most of the
spending increases were due to staff salaries being restored to
their former levels. But spending on supplies, materials, medical
testing, travel and equipment purchases grew as well, according to
commission budget documents.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, the question of just how serious an operation
the commission is was underscored with the appointment of Floyd
Patterson as chairman in 1995. The two-time heavyweight world
champion, who is 63, has memory problems. He resigned in March, but
had long been regarded within the sport as a $76,000-a-year
figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was warm, friendly and hospitable, but I knew very rapidly
that he was not really running the show,'' said Stanley Levin, an
attorney and promoter for Roy Jones Jr., a super middleweight who
fought in New York in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New York places more demands on fighters and promoters than most
states do, in both medical tests and fees. The state requires each
fighter to get a CAT brain scan, as well as an electrocardiogram
and an EKG once a year. It also collects a 5.5 percent tax on
tickets and a .55 percent tax on television rights. And boxers
generally have to be in the state for several days before their
fights.
</P>
<P>
   But even promoters who have been critical of New York say that
putting the state in a national context is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some commissions that are putrid, terrible,'' said
Mike Boorman, a spokesman for Main Events, a large boxing promoter
based in Totowa, N.J. ``If you did a bell curve, New York would get
an A.'' &QL;

AT BRONX HOSPITAL, SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES FACE NEW OBSTACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia began trickling
into the Bronx about 15 years ago, their minds and bodies scarred
by war, Montefiore Medical Center, a private hospital with a long
history of serving immigrant and indigent New Yorkers, established
a clinic to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   The federally subsidized clinic in East Fordham employed
full-time interpreters speaking Vietnamese and Khmer, the Cambodian
language. The interpreters scheduled the refugees' appointments,
helped them communicate with doctors and stood by them through Pap
smears, X-rays, MRIs and other unfamiliar rituals of Western
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, because of financial pressures, the hospital
reassigned its two full-time interpreters to clerical jobs. It now
relies on eight employees fluent in Khmer or Vietnamese who work in
other jobs at the clinic _ from filing medical records to serving
as medical assistants _ to translate as needed.
</P>
<P>
   The change has unleashed a flurry of protest by advocacy groups
and prompted an investigation by federal civil rights officials
into whether refugee patients are being denied ready access to
interpreters _ something Montefiore must provide as a condition of
receiving federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Velez, a spokesman for the office of civil rights at the
federal Department of Health and Human Services, said his office's
inquiry, which began after clinic staff members and patients filed
a complaint, was the first in recent memory examining the civil
rights of non-English-speaking patients at a New York City
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation at Montefiore, which has long been considered
a leader in caring for immigrant New Yorkers, is being watched
closely by other health care providers and by immigrants'
advocates, who hope to use it as leverage to bolster their demands
that hospitals and clinics improve their interpreting services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the city's hospitals and clinics rely on a patchwork of
bilingual staff members, volunteers and, at times, the children of
patients to do translation, said Francesca Gany, executive director
of the New York Immigrant Task Force on Health. This ad hoc system
frequently breaks down, she said, sowing confusion and making the
diagnosis and treatment of immigrants' health problems much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope that because of this,'' Ms. Gany said of the
inquiry, ``facilities will look at themselves more closely and do
what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, civil rights inquiries around the
country have prompted changes in the way health care providers
offer translation for patients. In Colorado, the state social
services agency was cited for allowing the friends and family
members of patients to translate during psychiatric evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, officials at Montefiore said the hospital
remained ``committed to providing quality care to all of our
patients, regardless of nationality or the language they speak.''
Of the 53,000 patient visits there in 1997, roughly 8 percent were
by Cambodians or Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, El Hong, 48, said that when he stumbled into the
clinic recently with severe diarrhea and stomach pain, he waited
seven hours until a translator could be found and he could be seen
by a physician. Hong later recalled the event, speaking through a
translator. He shook his head and said he did not know how he would
cope without the guidance of Ni Yann, a former translator who has
been reassigned as a medical records clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Hong, a former Cambodian soldier who has suffered seizures ever
since he was injured by a bomb blast in 1970, has high blood
pressure. His right thigh, punctured by a piece of shrapnel,
frequently swells up. He takes medication to control the seizures
and sees a psychiatrist once a month. Ms. Yann had always scheduled
his visits to doctors _ usually twice a month _ and called with
reminders. ``My life,'' he added, ``depends on a translator.''
</P>
<P>
   Government guidelines require all federally financed hospitals
and clinics to ``have ready access to, and provide services of,
proficient interpreters in a timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guidelines do not require all institutions to employ
full-time interpreters. They can rely instead on bilingual staff
members or a pool of qualified volunteers or they can contract with
outside interpreters. Montefiore officials said that at its two
Bronx hospitals, a bank of volunteer interpreters and bilingual
staff members, who represent 44 languages, provide translation as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Several staff members at the clinic on 193rd Street said the
reassignments were inefficient, forcing them to scramble to find
bilingual employees who may be busy tending to other tasks and
forcing their patients to wait.
</P>
<P>
   On Dr. Zach Rosen's shift a couple of weeks ago, for instance,
an elderly Cambodian woman with a history of hypertension came into
his office for a scheduled visit; neither spoke the other's
language. So, while the patient waited, Rosen said he ran around
looking for a medical assistant on the floor who spoke Khmer. She,
as it turned out, was busy translating for another physician down
the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets in the way of seeing people effectively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some staff members also said the full-time interpreters were
crucial in offering a sense of safety to refugees still traumatized
by war and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse practitioner, Nancy Tenney, said an elderly Cambodian
woman who had recently been assaulted came in complaining of
numbness in her arm. Ms. Tenney suggested an MRI, but when the
patient was told that Ms. Yann would be unable to accompany her,
she refused the test.

   Two Advertisers Decide on Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisers have made decisions on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Moviefone Inc. named Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York to
handle its account in a review that began in March, when Ryan
Drossman &AMP; Partners in New York, Moviefone's first agency, said it
was leaving the account after almost eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The review, managed by Sound Thinking, a New York consulting
company, had been narrowed to Mad Dogs and two other New York-based
finalists: the Grey Entertainment unit of Grey Advertising and
Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners. Moviefone's annual budget is
estimated at more than $25 million in a combination of paid
spending and barter, ads run in exchange for radio time or
newspaper space.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jarecki, chief executive of Moviefone in New York, said
Mad Dogs would develop strategy and consumer and trade campaigns
for the telephone service as well as the sibling online service,
Movielink.com (www.movielink.com).
</P>
<P>
   And Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon Inc. named Levenson &AMP; Hill
in Dallas as the first agency to handle its advertising. Though
billings were not disclosed, Adweek estimated them at $15 million
to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   John D. White, executive vice president and chief financial
officer at Lone Star in Wichita, Kan., said that Levenson &AMP; Hill
got the account after a review lasting two and a half months, but
he declined to disclose the other participants. Among the possible
contenders listed by Adweek were DeVito/Verdi in New York, the New
York office of Earle Palmer Brown and Fallon McElligott in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Two Agencies Agree to Merge
</P>
<P>
   Two interactive agencies _ Agency.com in New York and
Interactive Solutions in Boston _ have agreed to merge their
operations under the Agency.com name. Financial terms were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The combined agency has 375 employees at offices in Boston, New
York, Dallas, London and San Francisco, working on accounts with
estimated total revenue of $60 million. The accounts include
American Express, British Airways, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard
and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Butler, 43, president and chief executive at Interactive
Solutions, will become chairman of the merged Agency.com. Chan Suh,
36, chairman and chief executive at Agency.com, becomes chief
executive of the merged shop.
</P>
<P>
   Thor Johnson, 45, chief operating officer at Interactive
Solutions, becomes president of the Boston office of the merged
Agency.com. Two officers of Agency.com _ Kyle Shannon, 33, chief
creative officer, and Ken Trush, 42, chief financial officer _ will
retain those roles at the merged shop.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom Group in New York, which owns 40 percent of Agency.com,
will also own 40 percent of the merged Agency.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second deal in nine days for Agency.com, coming
after it took a 100 percent ownership position in Online Magic in
London; Agency.com already was a majority owner of Online Magic.

TWO KILLED WHEN THUNDERSTORMS TEAR THROUGH MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Raging winds, hail, and blinding thunderstorms pummeled
much of Massachusetts Sunday night, killing two people in a pickup
truck in Winchendon, Mass., cutting power lines, toppling tree
limbs, and threatening tornadoes for much of the night.
</P>
<P>
   With tornado watches in effect throughout the region at least
until early Monday, Doppler radar showed a twister may have touched
down in Worcester County Sunday night, the National Weather Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists could not confirm a tornado until ground damage
could be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a funnel cloud was spotted in Pittsfield, according to
Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, but there were no reports that
it had touched down.
</P>
<P>
   The storm swept eastward from New York state, but spared New
England much of the devastation it had wrought there. Trees blew
through homes and houses were leveled in Mechanicville, N.Y., north
of Albany, authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm was furious in its wrath here as well:
Golf-ball-sized hail tumbled from the sky above Walpole, N.H.,
leaving cars dented, said Marc Bennett, a Weather Services Corp.
meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, Mass., almost two-tenths of an inch of rain fell in
seven minutes _ a phenomenal amount of water, Bennett said. And
Worcester Airport recorded a 94 m.p.h. wind gust after 10 p.m.,
said Doug Cope, information officer for Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Winchendon, near the New Hampshire state line, two men
driving a pickup truck along Route 202 were killed when a pine tree
snapped and toppled onto the 1994 Toyota pickup, just after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the tree break and I knew somebody had hit it,'' said
Charlie Higgins, who lives with his wife at the site of the
accident. Estimating the tree to be 50 feet tall and two feet in
diameter, Higgins said the pine broke about 10 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, DanielMallet, 25, of Athol, and passenger Michael J.
Gulbicki, 27, of Winchendon, were pronounced dead at the scene,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pepperell, another fallen tree destroyed a car and slightly
injured a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the damage occurred in Franklin and Worcester counties,
where trees and power wires were downed. Greenfield reported a wind
gust of 68 m.p.h., according to Jennifer Kensy, a Weather Services
Corp. meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Electric Co. reported 11,000 customers losing
electricity, largely in the Merrimac Valley, the Worcester area,
and central Massachusetts, said spokeswoman Maureen McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, Western Massachusetts Electric reported 5,287
customers without electric, mostly in Greenfield, the Pittsfield
district, and later in west Springfield. Both utilities were
working to restore power last night.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, blown in from New York state after 5 p.m., first
attacked Pittsfield, then tracked more northeast, cutting a swath
of precipitation and wind across the top of the state and into
southern Vermont and New Hampshire, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of the same system that wracked South Dakota, said
Alan Dunham, meteorologist with the National Weather Service, of
the twisters that virtually leveled the town of Spencer, S.D.,
Saturday night. The storm then raged through the midwest, killing
several people.
</P>
<P>
   The torrential weather was expected to dissipate overnight.
Weather Services Corp. predicts sun and breezy conditions on
Monday, with a temperature of about 75 degrees.

QWEST EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Qwest Communications International Inc., which is preparing to
complete its $4.4 billion acquisition of LCI International Inc.,
plans to announce its new senior management team Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of LCI's top executives, including its chairman and chief
executive, Brian Thompson, will remain with Qwest. Thompson will
become Qwest's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have received all of the federal regulatory
approvals they require to complete their merger. Shareholders of
Qwest, based in Denver, and LCI are set to vote on the deal on
Friday. If Worldcom Inc.'s $37 billion acquisition of MCI
Communications Corp. wins government approval, the combined
Qwest-LCI will become the United States' No. 4 long-distance
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nacchio, who left AT&AMP;T Corp. after he was passed over for
that company's top job, will remain Qwest's president and chief
executive. Philip Anschutz, the Denver oil and railroad magnate who
controls Qwest, will remain the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bingaman, LCI's aggressive regulatory affairs chief, is the
most senior LCI executive who is not a member of the team that
Qwest plans to announce Monday. Before joining LCI last year, Ms.
Bingaman ran the Justice Department's antitrust division. Since
leaving the government she has become an outspoken foe of the Bell
local telephone companies, proposing that they each be split in
half.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the LCI acquisition, Nacchio will have 12
people reporting to him. Five of the people, including Lawrence
Bouman, LCI's senior vice president for engineering, will have come
from LCI.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ex-LCI executives, almost every member of Qwest's
top management team will have come from larger companies, including
AT&AMP;T, Lucent, GTE and U S West. The telecommunications industry is
one of the few sectors in which talented executives routinely
follow career paths in which they move from larger to smaller
companies.

CHAMPIONS CONFRONT MORTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subbing for rewriting throughout0 SPORTS COLUMN: DEFENDING(sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The game took 2 hours 34 minutes, and for Michael
Jordan, it had to feel like 15 brutal rounds, the way it felt years
ago for the aging Muhammad Ali. Jordan once flew the way the young
Ali danced, but at 35, against Larry Bird's swarming Indiana
Pacers, in the fourth quarter of a seventh game, Jordan had nowhere
to go but the clinches.
</P>
<P>
   He fought in flurries. He went to the boards. He drove the ball
into a crowd of hacking behemoths. He and his team won with heart
and guile and, like Ali until he had nothing left, because Jordan
had promised that was precisely what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the greatest,'' his coach, Phil Jackson, said
without prompting after Jordan and the Bulls won Game 7, 88-83, on
Sunday night and survived the Eastern Conference finals against an
opponent Jordan earlier in the series had mistakenly classified as
nothing more daunting than a ``bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Bulls began their ascent over this bump
when Jordan won a jump ball from a 7-footer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the middle of the fourth quarter and the Bulls were
sagging, with Jordan struggling, with their front line plagued by
fouls. They were trailing by 77-74. They were waiting for Jordan to
do something, anything, to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan drove into the lane against the long-armed Derrick McKey,
who reached in as Jordan neared the basket and stripped Jordan of
the ball. It rolled on the floor, toward Rik Smits. Jordan, falling
backward, reached around and, with Smits, got a hand on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan somehow won the jump. Steve Kerr wound up with an open
3-point shot on the right wing. The score was tied. The message was
sent. Jordan was going to drag his team to Salt Lake City, to its
sixth championship series. Twenty-eight points on a night when his
jump shot wasn't falling, when every advance to the basket brought
a double-team. Eight assists on a night when, more than ever, he
had to have help. Nine rebounds on a night when the Bulls
essentially won the game with second shots. With hustle plays. With
the directive to stop the whining over every call or play that
didn't go their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them to shut up and play,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The time had come for them to put aside the preoccupation with
their uncertain future and get in touch with the precious present.
Time to forget the insipid organizational feuds, their contractual
complaints and the overblown burden of being the Bulls. Time to
take any contribution they could get, including a 14-point
perimeter explosion by Toni Kukoc, the one-time obsession of Jerry
Krause, the general manager, whom Jackson, Jordan and Scottie
Pippen heartily despise.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks sooner than anyone thought was likely, the
time had come to stare down dynastic mortality, a predicament one
must inevitably confront without the spiritual aid of an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday night, with Jordan purifying their lineup the Bulls
had not even been extended to a seventh game of a playoff series
since 1992. That was when Pat Riley's New York Knicks put a
second-round choke hold on Pippen, but inevitably played Game 7 at
the old Chicago Stadium with an exceedingly motley crew that
featured a slow-footed point guard named Mark Jackson, whose push
shot often landed uglier than it took off.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a companion superpower to effect a balance of power
has created an annoying haughtiness about the Bulls, a wart that
seems to have become visible to the country during the Indiana
series. This particular Bulls championship quest has become as
emotional as a deposit into a savings account. And when the balance
sheet didn't add up, it was always the fault of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Jordan's Bulls haven't been pushed,
haven't flirted with the sudden-death dangers of a seventh game.
Someone in a national sports magazine commented last week that this
year's Utah Jazz might actually be determined enough to force a
truly competitive finals, forgetting that three of the Bulls' four
victories in last year's finals were undecided until the game's
final shot.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, usually Jordan, has made the big shot to save them the
humiliation of having to squirm the way they did on Sunday night,
big time in prime time. Pippen or Horace Grant or Dennis Rodman has
come up a big defensive play. One season's finals opponent would
fade away, not to be heard from again. A new challenger would step
up the following season. Suddenly, the year Bulls management has
been threatening, win or lose, to dismantle its aging champion,
John Stockton and Karl Malone are waiting in Salt Lake City, with
the home-court advantage. With many observers, this one included,
believing this is Malone's and Stockton's year to get over a pretty
big hump themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is some of the swagger gone?'' Jordan said, after admitting
what a chore this night really was. ``Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, instead of just expecting to win, the Bulls
had to get in touch with their vulnerable side to clear the bump at
home. Now on to Salt Lake City, to see if Jordan can still scale a
mountain.

GRANT SEEMS HEADED FOR TITLE SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all those who doubted that Michael Grant was the heir
apparent to the current heavyweight champions, Evander Holyfield
and Lennox Lewis, Grant showed his best against Obed Sullivan on
Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Grant overcame an early cut over his left eye, took as much
punishment as Sullivan could dish out and then prevailed over the
former Marine when referee Tony Orlando stopped the bout at 2
minutes 16 seconds of the ninth round. Grant was ahead on all three
judges' cards when the bout was stopped. He had knocked down
Sullivan with a blistering left-right-left combination to the chin
at 1:50 of the round, a right hand whistling past Sullivan's head
as he was falling back to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was so happy with the victory that he raced across the
ring, jumped into the air as if he were going to hurdle the top
rope and then fell flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about jumping over the top rope,'' Grant said.
``I just pulled myself back before I hurt myself. I didn't want to
land on some spectators and take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's record improved to 27-0 with 20 knockouts and he seems
to be on a collision course for a title shot against Lewis or
Holyfield. Lewis has always bemoaned the fact that he has never
been able to test himself against the best of his contemporaries,
such as Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe. He might as well
look to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush for me,'' Grant said of getting a title shot
soon. ``Staying in the gym is the key for me now. I hope and pray
that I stay humble and hungry and accept all the advice that I'm
getting from people like Don Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, Grant's co-trainer, calls him ``a work in
progress.'' Turner, Grant's head trainer, has hired Robert Lee, who
once trained Hector Camacho, to work with Grant on the sport's
nuances. Grant tried to deploy one of the new techniques against
Sullivan, who sought to fight inside most of the night. He had
mixed success with the maneuver, throwing a hook off the spin move.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was thinking about the move, Obed was hitting me with
shots,'' Grant said. ``I just have to keep doing it, so that it
comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner believes that Grant is already in the same class as the
top-flight heavyweights, but thinks he needs one or two more fights
before he is ready for a title shot. The candidates mentioned are
Larry Donald, Kirk Johnson and Michael Moorer. Turner said that
Grant, who had 12 fights as an amateur (11-1), had less experience
than any of the other young heavyweights _ David Tua and Chris Byrd
_ on Saturday night's card and even if he were to win the
championship after his next two or three fights, he would still
need more seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd (25-0), who admitted that he was lackluster in his 10-round
unanimous decision over Eliecer Castillo (14-1), was booed by the
crowd. Although he is a skilled boxer, Byrd lacks pizzaz and it
might hurt his television appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Castillo wasn't a great opponent, he was right
there in front of him,'' Lou DiBella, the vice president of
programming for HBO Sports, said of Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Tua (31-1) was impressive in knocking out a flabby Nate Tubbs
(17-4) at 2:12 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention from DiBella or Dino Duva, the president of
Main Events and the promoter of the card, regarding Tua or Byrd
fighting Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like to fight Grant, Byrd said: ``I'd have to
think a lot in a fight against Mike, because if I didn't he'd run
over me.''

have no other singer'' eulogies and by the cultural studies,
conferences and papers still to come.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll never stopped me from loving the truly wonderful
Sinatra recordings of the 1950s. And loving those recordings never
stopped me from lamenting and resenting the songs, the singing and
the persona that appeared in the mid-'60s and prevailed until his
death. The voice and the man grew coarse. The easy swagger became
belligerent, and the melancholy turned brashly sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   Artists don't need to be remembered for anything but their best
work. But they don't need to have that work enshrined in a
mythology that places them above all others and will soon pass into
(and pass itself off as) history and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Jule Styne was a good songwriter, but how can anyone let his
famous comment about Sinatra stand? Sinatra brought style to
popular singing, Styne proclaimed: ``Before Sinatra, songs were
just sung straight and without much panache. Crosby had a little
sense of style, but Sinatra was the one who went the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   This is stupefying. The tradition of popular and jazz singing
that produced Sinatra was invented in the 1920s by Louis Armstrong,
Bing Crosby and Ethel Waters, with major input from assorted blues,
nightclub and musical-theater performers.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition was extended and developed in the 1930s when
Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald led the innovations, with
significant contributions from Connee Boswell, Mildred Bailey, Lee
Wiley and Jimmy Rushing. (Rushing was largely a blues singer; and
it's true that Sinatra didn't sing blues. But we're going for a
full aerial view here, and the blues, with its mingling of lyricism
and bravado, is a crucial part of the mix.)
</P>
<P>
   This was a golden age of singing, and it was filled _ crammed,
bursting _ with panache, invention and all kinds of style.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that before Sinatra, singers tended to sound as
though they barely knew the band they were working with. And of
course that was true of mediocre to bad singers. It certainly
wasn't true of the singers just named. Nor was it true of fine
singers a cut or two below. Ivie Anderson certainly knew Duke
Ellington's band, Helen Humes knew Count Basie's and Helen Forrest
knew Benny Goodman's.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was certainly the man when it came to reviving a
big-band tradition that had all but capsized during World War II.
And when it came to what the critic Gary Giddins has aptly called
the rhythmic midground between pop gentility and jazz swing,
Sinatra had the taste, skill and clout to bring audiences there,
away from a mainstream glutted with slush and treacle.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the first to discover that fruitful ground, but he
retooled and refreshed it. He didn't invent dramatic naturalism
either, but he deepened and extended its range and became our best
singer in that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Lee is a close second. Her phrasing and rhythm are just as
good, her intonation is better, and she can trump him in subtlety,
but she doesn't have his vocal or temperamental force. And let us
not forget that there is another song tradition that Sinatra
admired and learned from but does not belong in: the
non-naturalistic, call it abstractly expressionist, tradition
fathered by Armstrong and developed in quite different ways by
Holiday, Fitzgerald and in Sinatra's era by Nat ``King'' Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Innovative jazz and mainstream popular music grew further and
further apart in the 1940s and '50s. Jazz singers still had their
pop hits, but you certainly couldn't say that singers like Anita
O'Day, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan or Mel Torme were at the
center of the culture's consciousness; they were on its vigorous
borders or in its vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Of the mainstream performers who made their names in the war and
postwar years, Sinatra, Ms. Lee and Cole (despite the trash he
sometimes had to record) were the hit makers who kept the jazz-pop
links center stage. (Doris Day was a very good singer, but she
concentrated on movies, not recordings.)
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's other great gift, of course, was his sexual charisma.
Whatever he sang, it was there. The jaunty manliness was sexy; so
was the melancholy introspection; so was the edgy rebelliousness
one saw most clearly in his best film performances. He was a star,
and he had what real stars have: the ability to take their gifts,
their limitations and their influences and mold them into a unified
whole called My Personality. The force of that personality is what
makes Sinatra unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   But why claim, as some do, that Sinatra was the first popular
singer to think of himself as an artist? Surely we don't still
believe, given the evidence of the work they put in (the
practicing, the jam sessions, the attention paid to opera singers,
actors, horn players and their own own peers), that the masters of
the preceding generation didn't know they were artists.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday, Armstrong and Mabel Mercer _ the English song-actress
nonpareil whom Sinatra called a major influence along with Holiday
and Tommy Dorsey _ all wore an armor of modesty in public, but that
shouldn't fool us anymore. They knew their worth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It has been very unpleasant reading these eulogies to see how
segregated, racially and sexually, views of popular music remain.
And wearying to have to note that nearly all of the pre-Sinatra
innovators who are left out of this musical hagiography are blacks
and women. In my generation this is called the Elvis Presley
syndrome. The setting: a fertile but largely unformed musical
world. The action: He arrives.
</P>
<P>
   It makes one remember that preferential treatment based on race
and gender has always been the norm in American life; it is only
the beneficiaries who have changed in the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his talent and drive, Sinatra benefited greatly from
the preferential treatment given his race and gender, as if by
natural right in those days. (So, for all of his greatness as a
dancer, did Fred Astaire.) Not only did Sinatra have unparalleled
power in the music industry, but he got to act out a lavish drama
of masculinity that thrilled the entire culture.
</P>
<P>
   What black man could have gotten away with such cocky brashness
and become a star of that magnitude? (Witness the unusually passive
public demeanor of Cole.) What woman of either race could have?
They simply could not have seized the imagination and approval of a
mass audience with such open displays of power and nose-thumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was a great performer because he joined kinetic musical
force to what looked and sounded like pure naturalism. It was also
his great good fortune to come of age in a time when the world
still considered whiteness and maleness the best and most natural
of states.

JOHNSON TRADE TALK QUIETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Unless the Mariners lower their
fair-value-in-return expectations, they apparently will have a hard
time granting left-hander Randy Johnson's request to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson has pitched superb back-to-back games since
having a meeting with manager Lou Piniella in Texas nearly two
weeks ago and being told the best way to get traded is to pitch
better, the flurry of recent trade talk hasn't materialized into a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers rejected a proposal that would send
right-handed pitcher Darren Dreifort, along with
infielder/outfielder Wilton Guerrero to the Mariners, and the New
York Yankees refuse to deal left-hander Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Yankees said Sunday that starting pitcher
Ramiro Mendoza and minor-league outfielder Ricky Ledee have been
offered, but the M's insist on getting Pettitte, off limits despite
having a sub-par season (6-5 record).
</P>
<P>
   The source said general manager Brian Cashman is interested in
Johnson, but in no hurry to make a deal. The Yankees are runaway
leaders in the American League East and believe the Mariners will
take less for Johnson closer to the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers also apparently ready to wait for the price to
come down, the trade talk that was roaring last week has quieted
and Johnson appears to be getting anxious.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Piniella again Sunday for nearly 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would discuss the gist of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just talked about whether my next start would be in
Baltimore (tomorrow) or in Seattle on Wednesday,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   For forty-five minutes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty long, huh?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``If Randy wants to talk about (the meeting), he
can. As far as I'm concerned, what we talked about can stay here
(in the manager's office).''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the vice president of baseball operations,
returned to Seattle on Sunday and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, said, ``I don't know if the
Mariners are making a legitimate offer (to other teams)'' and
wouldn't comment further until he had a chance to talk to his
client.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, scheduled to start against the Anaheim Angels Wednesday
night at the Kingdome, has been much more demonstrative in his past
two starts than any of the previous 10 this season. He struck out
15 Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a complete-game victory on May 24 at the
Kingdome and beat the 'Rays again Friday night at Tropicana Field,
allowing one earned run and striking out 10 in an eight-inning
stint.

RED SOX RIDE 11-RUN INNING TO SPLIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the usual definition, scoring 11 runs in the third
inning, the biggest inning against the Yankees in 55 years, and
winning by six constitutes a laugher.
</P>
<P>
   Then why wasn't anyone wearing a Red Sox uniform laughing Sunday
afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Because before the end of a 13-7 win over the New York Yankees,
slugger Mo Vaughn was mad at his teammates, pitcher Pedro Martinez
was mad at plate umpire Jim Joyce and Yankee outfielder Bernie
Williams, and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was mad at the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley, meanwhile, was too drained to express either
mirth or anger. The Eck was just relieved to have survived the
seventh inning, when the Yankees drew to within 11-7, loaded the
bases, and had the tying run at the plate with no outs. That's
right, no outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about them coming back from 11-0,'' Eckersley said.
``That would have been humiliating. That would have been the
ultimate. You never forget something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God the kid made the big play. It was huge. Maybe that
play turned my whole season around. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who already had walked home a run and given up a
ground-ball single that made it 11-7, was referring to the
face-saving play made by the Framingham Kid. Second baseman Lou
Merloni made a sprawling backhanded stop of pinch hitter Jorge
Posada's smash and flipped the ball while still on his stomach to
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who threw out Posada for an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ever think that game should have come down to
something like that,'' said the Red Sox rookie, who had a direct
hand in both weekend wins over the Yankees, having singled home the
deciding run in Boston's 3-2 win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni's words apparently echoed Vaughn's thoughts, because
when the Red Sox came off the field after that inning, one in which
two relievers, John Wasdin and Ron Mahay, came and went without
getting anybody out, Vaughn had a meltdown in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing furiously, Vaughn paced from one end of the dugout to
the other, his voice at a decibel level normally associated with
aircraft engines, before knocking a cooler off the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just snapped, I guess,'' Eckersley said. ``I don't really
know what he was saying. That game was about to get away from us. I
guess he was trying to wake people up.''
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of Mount Mo, a public display with little precedent
in recent Red Sox annals, appeared to have the desired effect. The
Sox had managed just Darren Bragg's infield single in the four
innings following the third, which began with a broken-bat single
by rookie Jason Varitek off Yankees lefthander Andy Pettitte and
ended 43 minutes and 76 pitches later, after 16 batters, 9 hits,
and 3 walks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Boston's biggest inning in 12 years, one in which both
Garciaparra (two-run double, RBI infield hit) and rookie Varitek
(the broken-bat single, two-run double) had two hits apiece, Darren
Lewis walked twice, and Varitek, Lewis, and John Valentin all
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   But after Vaughn's diatribe, the Red Sox opened the eighth with
three straight hits. They didn't score because Lewis was tossed out
stealing and Vaughn and Troy O'Leary grounded out, but they finally
put the game out of reach in the top of the ninth with four more
hits, including Lewis's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it defied belief that manager Jimy Williams had to have
his closer, Tom Gordon, warming up in a game in which staff ace
Martinez was staked to an 11-run lead. But Martinez was gone with
the score 11-4 and two out in the sixth. He was lifted because Joe
Girardi hit his 130th pitch for a three-run home run, but he was
livid because of Joyce's pitch-calling and what he viewed as Bernie
Williams's stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to fly through this game,'' Martinez
said. ``I was throwing strikes. I can see the strike zone better
than anybody. But the third strike is hard to get in this league.
They'll call strike one, strike two, but they won't call strike
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he said anything to the umpire, Martinez said: ``I
would never do that. He should know himself. Once he sees the
highlights play tonight, he can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who felt he was squeezed on the bases-loaded walk he
issued to pinch hitter Tim Raines, smiled broadly when told that
Martinez had complained about the umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did?'' Eckersley said, eyes widening. ``Good. The umpire
squeezed him. And that guy (Joyce) has a big (strike) zone,
supposedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez wasn't smiling when he complained that Williams, who
had four hits Sunday and 10 hits in his last 12 at-bats against the
Red Sox, continued to step in and out of the batter's box against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him in Spanish, `Batea, batea (hit, hit),'''
Martinez said, talking about Williams's at-bat in the fourth
inning, when he singled. ``The game was 11-0. He knew I was going
to throw the ball over the plate. He put his hand out to me and
said, `Hold on.' I'm laughing at him. He knows I'm not going to
pitch when he's not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan accused the Yankee hitters of trying to play ``mind
games'' with Martinez, and wondered why just a few days ago, AL
president Gene Budig praised the Red Sox for the up-tempo way they
play, but doesn't tell his umpires to make hitters stay in the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very frustrating experience, that the game was three
hours (actually 3:45),'' Martinez said. ``I don't think I've ever
pitched a three-hour game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two things in mind when I pitch: Lose it quick, or win
it quick.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a game for the quick, nor the dead. With the lava
of Mount Mo still cooling, it was on to Toronto.

VAUGHN DELIVERS SLAM IN RED SOX DUGOUT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mo Vaughn snapped. After watching his team nearly
blow an 11-0 lead, and wind up facing the tying run at the plate in
the bottom of the seventh Sunday, the big guy couldn't take any
more. When the inning was over, he came off the field and tore into
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   It was a first-class, five-star, Jack Nicholson nutty. It will
go down as the water-cooler-flyin', F-bombs-flyin',
dugout-roof-shakin', don't-be-jakin', buns-toastin', rump-roastin',
Mo Vaughn Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Mo wasn't Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. No. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The tirade turned things around for the Red Sox. Boston got back
on track and scored a couple of more runs to finish off a 13-7,
face-saving, series-squaring victory over the hated first-place New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mo didn't want to discuss his dugout implosion, and wouldn't
specify what was said, but admitted, ``I just get upset when I
don't feel we're being aggressive enough. Sometimes the only way to
get things done is to go at people. When I feel that approach is
lost, that's when something's gonna happen. If I have to do that
every day, it will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive tantrum, mildly reminiscent of Terry
O'Reilly taking the tire iron to a car in Hartford, and Bruce
Armstrong wielding a baseball bat while challenging his Patriot
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had humbled the haughty New Yorkers, routing the
estimable Andy Pettitte and scoring 11 times in the third inning.
But the Yankees started to creep back and in the seventh they cut
Boston's lead to 11-7 and had the bases loaded with no outs. It
wasn't until People's Choice Lou Merloni saved the day with a
spectacular backhanded stab that led to an inning-ending double
play that the Sox got back to the safety of their dugout.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't safe for long. Mo looked like Curley when he hears
``Three Blind Mice'' in the Stooges boxing episode. Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The big first baseman started yelling at no one in particular.
His language was loud and foul. He stormed up and down the dugout,
then toppled a green water cooler. Not since Ed Romero flung the
Gatorade here in 1989 (Romero was upset that Joe Morgan had the
audacity to pinch hit for him) had a Boston player been so angry in
the Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni and Pedro Martinez _ another key player on this wacky
day at the Zoo _ both thought the diatribe was effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' said Merloni. ``It needed to be said. We can't
win like that. We need to be aggressive. You could sense that we
lost that. He's the leader of this team and he got into it a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very good,'' added Pedro. ``'Cause it got us back into
the same mood as when the game started.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said he didn't mind a team leader making a
statement. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said, ``I've seen a couple
like that. Everybody just went about their business. They just went
out and played their game. I didn't see anybody panicking out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley, who was on the mound for four of the eight
batters in the inning and got out of the jam, said it was possible
that some players might interpret the outburst as finger-pointing,
but said, ``I didn't think he was talking to anyone in particular.
He has a right to do what he wants. Guys who play every day, they
get crazy sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin, Ron Mahay, and Eckersley all struggled in the
sinful seventh, and Vaughn's blasts probably were aimed at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a team like that down, you've got to keep them
down,'' said Vaughn. ``We're up a bunch of runs and all of a sudden
we're giving guys free passes for no reason. We've discussed
staying focused for nine innings. We couldn't let this one slip
away. Today we got off to a nice start, but we went to sleep for a
little while.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mo woke everybody up. And it worked. What could have been the
most demoralizing loss of the season wound up being a team-lifting
win.
</P>
<P>
   The insufferable New Yorkers may indeed have the best team in
baseball, the Team of the Century, and the team against which all
future juggernauts will be measured. They may finish with a better
winning percentage than the 1906 Cubs (116-36, .763) and they
actually might do the unthinkable and satisfy George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   But let the record show that for one day, the Red Sox finally
beat up on the Yanks. On the last day of May, in front of a
capacity crowd in the House That Ruth Built, your Red Sox
administered a butt-kicking that could carry them into the summer
with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are still 7 1/2 games behind New York (nine in the
loss column), but the final two games of the home-and-home series
served to remind New Yorkers that Boston will not go down gently
and that any team with Martinez and a healthy Bret Saberhagen is
dangerous in a short, October series.
</P>
<P>
   And for at least a little while longer, Mo Vaughn is around to
make sure the Sox don't lose their way.

PATRIOTS RUN DOWN OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots are raw at running back this
season. Real raw. In fact, by the time this week's rookie camp and
next weekend's full-squad camp end, the team will have looked at
nine backs.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined NFL experience?
</P>
<P>
   Seven years.
</P>
<P>
   When rookie camp begins Monday at Foxboro Stadium, the team's
coaching staff and management will be hoping that Robert Edwards,
Sedrick Shaw, Harold Shaw, Derrick Cullors, Tony Carter, Chris
Floyd, Marrio Grier, and two others can make up for the losses of
Curtis Martin, Sam Gash, Keith Byars, and Dave Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was the team's No. 1 draft pick, the 18th player taken
overall. He is the odds-on favorite to be the starting halfback and
projects a tougher runner than Martin, hitting the holes better.
But he never has played in an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw started his only NFL game in the Jan. 3 7-6 playoff
loss to Pittsburgh. Before that, the third-round pick from Iowa
primarily had been on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shaw is a sixth-rounder from Brett Favre's alma mater,
Southern Mississippi State. He's a 6-foot, 228-pounder who runs
straight ahead, and has been termed the sleeper in the group by
some Patriots officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors saw his first action last year filling in for Martin
when he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet at the moment is fullback Carter, who played three
years for the Chicago Bears before being signed by the Patriots to
replace the popular Gash.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, who can play fullback and halfback, has been around for
two seasons, used mostly as a special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, from Michigan, is considered a good blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the running back mix is rookie free agent Rodney Byrd, a
6-2, 245-pound halfback/fullback from Illinois (where he played
with Robert Holcombe, who was taken in the second round by St.
Louis). Mike Geter of North Carolina (5-10, 215) is not to be
mistaken for Gash, whose No. 33 he will wear.
</P>
<P>
   Those nine have rushed for a career 563 yards on 162 carries (a
3.47-yard average). Grier is the most experienced with 77 carries
for 203 yards. After carrying 22 times during the regular season,
Cullors ran 29 times for 104 yards in the postseason, including a
22-carries-for-86 yards effort against Miami in the wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has 30 career carries for 133 yards. And Sedrick Shaw
carried 10 times for 22 yards in the Pittsburgh game.
</P>
<P>
   Is there reason for concern?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have young players at that position and we'd like to see
how they perform in these camps,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``We
wished we'd given Sedrick a little more playing time during the
season last year in retrospect, but we decided to go with Derrick
when Curtis went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have talent. The experience isn't there, but with
Robert Edwards and Sedrick and Derrick, there's ability that just
needs time-tested NFL experience for those talents to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the reason the Patriots haven't pushed the panic button
and signed a veteran running back yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait until our camps are over so we can assess what we
have and what we feel we need, if anything,'' said vice president
of player personnel Bobby Grier.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will consider veterans, some of them free agents
who haven't been signed right away such as Terry Kirby, Erric
Pegram, Greg Hill, Raymont Harris, and Robert Green. They also will
check the waiver wire this week for veterans who may be dumped for
salary cap reasons _ possibly someone such as Ronnie Harmon, who
can add a third-down pass-receiving threat (filling the role of
Meggett and Byars).
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Patriots believe Edwards and Sedrick Shaw will be
able to handle the load as the primary halfbacks and that Carter
and Floyd can be the blocking fullbacks they need.
</P>
<P>
   The one question is how well Edwards and Shaw block. Often it's
the running back who makes the last key block to allow the
quarterback time to make a pass. Will those two, with their lack of
experience, be able to pick up blitzes?
</P>
<P>
   There are many questions about the backfield that will remain
unanswered until the raw talent gets some experience. The Patriots
took a chance on an unproven back when they drafted Martin and it
panned out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong missed the entire offseason strength and
conditioning program, as is his custom. According to Armstrong's
agent, John Geletka, ``He's taken great care of himself and has
worked out very consistently.'' ... The Patriots weren't able to
get their other starting tackle, Zefross Moss, into camp early to
check out his weight and conditioning. According to Carroll, Moss,
who also skipped the strength and conditioning workouts, has told
him that he's in shape and not to worry. Last summer, Moss reported
to camp overweight ... One Jets executive, not Bill Parcells, said
the team has no interest in Meggett because it has Leon Johnson,
whom Parcells brought along last year. But the final word hasn't
come from His Tunaship yet.

REVOLUTION SCRAMBLE FOR TIE, LOSE SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Revolution coach Thomas Rongen continues to preach
patience but his team continues to falter.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution scored a late goal to tie the score, 1-1, against
the New York-New Jersey MetroStars Sunday, but lost in the shootout
to remain in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 10 points
in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Even more discouraging for the Revolution is that they have held
the lead for only three minutes of the last 450 played.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few games we haven't been able to take the lead
and we have ended up scoring in a desperate fashion,'' Rongen said.
``But we have enough firepower to be able to get the lead and hold
onto it. And this team will show it can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have scored 19 goals, which is more than previous years.
And, with resilience, we are capable of scoring goals and we are
capable of scoring early.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Revolution's Alberto Naveda scored a hat trick in
a 3-1 victory over the MetroStars to give them 13 goals in 11
games. But the Revolution had 17 points in the standings and seemed
well-placed to qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Revolution have improved their skill level and tactical
awareness, even without players such as Jair (broken ankle), and
Mike Burns and Joe-Max Moore, who are heading to the World Cup. But
the intangibles that contribute to success appear to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   They again fell behind, as Brian Kelly finished a quick strike
started in the MetroStars' half by Jim Rooney in the 69th minute.
Eduardo Hurtado touched Rooney's pass from just over the halfway
line on the left side, and Kelly ran onto it and poked a shot past
Ian Feuer with the outside of his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution rallied desperately, and Raul Diaz Arce scored
his seventh goal of the season, heading in a Ted Chronopoulos cross
in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the shootout, Tony Meola saved Richard Goulooze's final
attempt as the MetroStars improved to 16 points, 5 ahead of
fourth-place Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gorter provided entertaining touches as well as midfield
direction in the first half. But after Ivan McKinley was ejected
for a deliberate handball to prevent a goal, Gorter moved into a
sweeper position as the Revolution played with 10 men.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter set up Janusz Michallik and Imad Baba for the best
first-half chances. But Meola aggressively dove at Michallik's feet
in the 12th minute, then blocked Baba's point-blank volley and
Dahir Mohammed's rebound in the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars took command late in the half. Mohammed blocked a
Paul Dougherty header on the line, then McKinley made a diving
clearance of a Kelly shot in the 44th minute of a 50-minute half.
Referee Paul Tamberino signaled a penalty, and, after consulting
with linesman Richard Eddy, red-carded McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   This was McKinley's second ejection and he will be suspended
from the Revolution's visit to Los Angeles June 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution was rescued by Feuer, who dove low to his
left to stop Giovanni Savarese's penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution made major adjustments in the second half. Evans
Wise replaced Michallik, who had been injured in a first-half
collision with Feuer. Within minutes, Wise nearly set up a goal. He
held possession for what seemed like hours on the left side,
allowing Gorter to advance from a deep defensive position. Then,
Gorter curved a long drive toward the far upper corner, which Meola
saved.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution switched from strictly zonal defense to man
marking with Mohammed and Brian Dunseth. The simpler system led to
fewer miscommunications, but there were enough breakdowns to cause
concern, even before McKinley departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the performance of the defense,'' Rongen said.
``Savarese and Hurtado didn't get a shot on goal. This was our best
defensive effort in the last three or four games.''

`GODZILLA' STILL TOPS, BUT HUGE TAIL IS DRAGGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The monster lizard again failed to deliver monster
ticket sales as the second weekend of ``Godzilla'' took in an
estimated $18 million at 3,310 theaters nationwide during the
Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The total gave Sony's much-hyped extravaganza $99.3million after
13 days _ an impressive total for most films but a disappointment
for one featuring the largest promotional campaign ever with
promises that ``Godzilla'' would become a must-see blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Business for ``Godzilla'' had been expected to fall quickly but
its 59 percent decline from its opening Friday-Sunday was
significantly steeper than last year's 53 percent fall for ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park'' during the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's dino-sequel eventually took in $229 million
domestically while ``Godzilla's'' final U.S. gross is likely to
come in around $150 million, half what many forecasters expected
before the opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Godzilla' results are very soft for the second weekend
and it looks like there's no repeat business,'' said analyst Arthur
Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica. ``Many people
who saw it are disappointed because it doesn't deliver the goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, a former studio executive, said Sony may have erred by
pushing ``Godzilla'' too aggressively. ``What they needed was to
create a campaign that made you want to see the film, not one with
the message that you must see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business was ahead of the same weekend last year as
rival releases posted relatively strong numbers, led by 20th
Century Fox's opening of Sandra Bullock's ``Hope Floats'' with
$14.7 million at 2,367 theaters. The total for the romance was well
ahead of expectations, which had been held down by the prospect of
``Godzilla'' dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's'' performance was also hampered by solid
competition from Paramount's fourth weekend of ``Deep Impact'' with
$10.1 million at 3,280 theaters, boosting its 24-day take to $112
million, and Disney's third weekend of ``The Horse Whisperer'' with
$7.3 million at 2,189 sites.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hope Floats' obviously had a big appeal to females and `Deep
Impact' and `The Horse Whisperer' are perceived as quality films
and are continuing to draw very good business,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth'' finished fifth with a moderate $5
million at 2,051 sites in its second weekend of nationwide release
by 20th Century Fox. The film's performance has been lukewarm
despite reviews that were stronger than ``Wag the Dog'' and
``Primary Colors,'' underscoring the difficulty in marketing the
political genre.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``I Got the Hook-Up,'' starring rapper Master P in a
comedy about phone scams, opened respectably in sixth with
$3.4million at 655 theaters, followed by Warner Bros.' debut of the
late Chris Farley's last film, ``Almost Heroes,'' with a
disappointing $2.8 million at 2,048 theaters. Expectations had been
fairly limited for the latter, in which Farley played an explorer
out to beat Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's third weekend of ``The Quest for Camelot'' finished
eighth with $2.3 million at 2,449 theaters, followed by Paramount's
24th weekend of ``Titanic'' with $1.73 million at 1,562 theaters.
The epic has topped $579 million after 164 days and leads ``Star
Wars'' as the best domestic grosser by $118 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' edged Universal's second weekend of ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas'' with a downbeat $1.6 million at 1,130
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's limited opening of ``The Last Days of Disco''
performed well with $275,000 at 22 theaters. The romantic comedy
will be expanded in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's'' reign as king of the box office will likely end
next weekend as Paramount opens ``The Truman Show,'' an offbeat Jim
Carrey comedy already drawing rave reviews.

LALAS DOESN'T SEE RED IN CALM RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ MetroStars defender Alexi Lalas claimed that
Sunday's game against the Revolution, his former team, was no
different than most. It was an away game against an Eastern
Conference opponent below New York-New Jersey in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two great years here and the fans came to the stadium
and were great to me,'' said Lalas. ``It wasn't an opportunity to
get revenge or anything like that. There's no ill will between me
and the organization or Thomas (Rongen) or any of the players.
We're friends on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lalas said hello to Rongen, and the Revolution coach
said hello back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and I still talk and I value him as a friend and as
someone that gives good advice,'' Lalas said after his team's
shootout win over the Revolution following a 1-1 regulation tie.
``He's a class coach and a class individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, who performed well, looked different than when he played
here. His distinctive red hair is much shorter these days, cut in
San Diego two weeks ago. ``It's a big change, boredom, all that
combined,'' he said. ``It was a result of living my life in other
cities, so my only form of entertainment is the local mall. I got a
haircut because I had seen all the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   His long goatee remains, however. As do Lalas's numerous fans
here, particularly those in the end zone, one of whom continues to
wear a red wig of about the same length as Lalas's former
hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas wasn't trying to gain revenge on the Revolution for
trading him or trying to look good for the US national team, for
which he'll probably be a reserve in the World Cup. ``I don't have
to prove myself to anybody, I've been around long enough,'' he
said. ``I know what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems Lalas much prefers to play in front of the New England
rooters than those who watch the MetroStars at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different than New York, the people who come to the
game, there's a lot less pressure on a player here,'' Lalas said.
``The expectations are kind of different here, and that makes it
easier to play. Playing in New York, for that type of fan, with
such incredible expectations, also makes it an incredible feeling
when you have that support when they finally give it to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting,'' he added, half-chuckling. ``But I think
it's going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, who still lives in Weston during the offseason, was in
the spotlight at times Sunday. In the 74th minute, he and
Revolution defender Dahir Mohammed were given yellow cards, after
Lalas sat on Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a punk,'' said Lalas of Mohammed. ``He's got no
respect. The only reason that the whole thing happened was he
started kicking (goaltender) Tony (Meola), and as a defender I have
to defend my goalkeeper. I can't let anything happen, so I sat on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas was his team's seventh shooter in the shootout, the teams
tied at 2 at the time, but his bid was knocked down by Revolution
goalkeeper Jeff Causey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to push it by him and I waited a second too
long,'' Lalas said. ``When you're my size'' _ 6 feet 3 inches _
``waiting a second compared to waiting a second for someone Johnny
Torres's size'' _ Torres is 5-6 _ ``is two totally different
things.''

MARTINEZ BELIEVES WIN WAS TOO LONG COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Winning is everything to Pedro Martinez, that's the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But despite being the winning pitcher in a 13-7 decision over
the Yankees before a crowd of 55,711 Sunday, Martinez left in the
sixth when he lost a chunk of an 11-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was happy that the Red Sox held on, but after the game he
lashed out at the umpiring crew he believes made his early exit
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In his 5 2/3 innings, Martinez threw 130 pitches, 84 of which
were deemed strikes. But Martinez believes he threw many more
strikes than that but was not getting the calls from plate umpire
Jim Joyce, although he was careful not to mention him by name.
</P>
<P>
   He had another criticism of the crew, which also included crew
chief Al Clark, John Hirschbeck, and Ted Barrett. Martinez, who
improved to 6-1, believes they allowed the Yankees' Bernie Williams
to ignore the new directive designed to speed up games. Williams,
Martinez claimed, was allowed to step out of the box at will, often
after Martinez was set on the mound. This made for longer at-bats
and contributed to the game lasting 3 hours 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the first time ever I threw in a game over
three hours, ever,'' said Martinez. ``I pitch quicker than anybody
on this team and this might be the longest game we played this
year. You're trying to speed up the game and they don't want to.
Sometimes it seems the game is very long. But oftentimes, it's not
our fault. I keep urging Williams to get into the box. (Joyce) gets
on me and protects Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is no fool; he knows such remarks will get back to
Joyce, who had departed when an attempt was made to get a response
to the remarks. But even though Martinez is fresh from the National
League, he still wants American League umpires to treat him with
the respect that goes with being a Cy Young winner with a
reputation for pitching quick games.
</P>
<P>
   True, it took the Red Sox 43 minutes to score 11 runs in the
third inning. Manager Jimy Williams said if there would have been a
rain delay that long, he wouldn't even have sent his ace
righthander back out there. But Martinez said he was undaunted by
the delay and came out throwing strikes, or so he thought. Such an
outing was personally embarrassing, he said, especially since he
gave up four runs, three on a homer by New York's Joe Girardi in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't tense when I came back,'' said Martinez. ``That's why
I was pretty upset to be pulled out in that inning. I did
everything I can do to get the three outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the strike zone better than anybody. And I'm not
crying about any particular strike. But some of those pitches were
right there. All it did in an 11-1 game in the fifth inning was
slow down the game. We ended up winning the game and I ended up the
getting the win. But the game took three hours, almost four.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez wasn't the only member of the Red Sox to criticize the
umpiring. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan also thought Joyce's strike
zone was more narrow than usual. He was even more incensed by the
conduct of Williams in the batter's box. Just last Wednesday, the
Red Sox received congratulations from AL president Gene Budig for
their efforts to speed up their games. An outing like this, said
Kerrigan, defeats the whole purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we have tried to get our pitchers to work fast,''
said Kerrigan, ``And to throw first-pitch strikes. The pitchers
should dictate the game. The hitter should not be allowed to step
in the box and step back out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 55,000 people here. I don't think they came to see
Bernie Williams stepping in and out of the batter's box. That's bad
for the game, bad for the industry. And the umpire let him do it.
We're trying to follow the directive of the AL by working fast and
have a good tempo. The nature of the game is that the pitcher has
the ball and he controls the pace of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley issued a bases-loaded walk on a borderline
pitch to Tim Raines in a three-run Yankee seventh. But after giving
up a single, he got out of the inning with a strikeout and a double
play that halted a threat with Boston ahead, 11-7. New York never
came close again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of having a veteran like Eckersley on your
staff,'' said Kerrigan. ``He doesn't let umpires upset him. He just
keeps throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says he will do the same thing next time. He just hopes
for better results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything I needed today,'' he said. ``I had a breaking
ball, a changeup, a good fastball. I felt stronger than the
previous two outings when I felt a little tight. I thought I was
going to fly through the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long inning was no problem. I went out there and threw
strikes. That's your main concern. Once you get the runs, you want
to throw strikes and forget about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too bad things didn't work out the way I thought.
When you see Eckersley, who averages half a walk per nine innings,
getting squeezed at the plate, it's unbelievable. I understand you
can have a bad day at the plate. But if you're going to (miss) it
five or six times ... you've got to do better than that. Not only
on us, but also on the other team, too.''

THIS BULLS TRIUMPH WAS PREORDAINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was after an NBA playoff game in 1986 that
Larry Bird talked about God being disguised as Michael Jordan.
Jordan had just scored 63 points for the Chicago Bulls in a loss to
Bird and the rest of the Boston Celtics. Twelve years later, Bird
was back and so was God, this time with nine disciples in tow.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday, the crusaders otherwise known as the Chicago
Bulls had made believers out of Bird and his Indiana Pacers and
anyone who had doubted them. After turning back the Pacers 88-83 in
a stirring seventh and final game in their Eastern Conference
finals, the Bulls' claim to a sixth NBA title suddenly doesn't seem
the least bit blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   Like a latter-day Elijah, Jordan predicted the outcome, then
made it happen by going out and collecting 28 points, nine rebounds
and eight assists. He couldn't have done it without his teammates,
who provided the support that was too often lacking in the first
few years of Jordan's ascension.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it; the Bulls are four wins away from a
third straight NBA title because they have not only the best player
in the game but one heckuva team. With apologies to the Utah Jazz,
the Bulls' front office may be the only ones capable of stopping
these Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, leave it to the Jerrys to put the nasty in dynasty.
Jerry Krause, the Bulls' vice president of basketball operations,
and team chairman Jerry Reinsdorf hold the future of the franchise
in their hands and they seem eminently capable of dribbling it off
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent-to-be Scottie Pippen already has been rumored to have
checked out real estate in Phoenix, having concluded the Bulls
aren't going to meet his market price. If Reinsdorf can open the
vault for the White Sox's Albert Belle, why not Pippen, who proved
his worth again on Sunday by marking Mark Jackson on defense and
keeping the Bulls close early while Jordan was struggling to find
his rhythm?
</P>
<P>
   Pippen accounted for nine of the Bulls' 19 points in the opening
12 minutes on his way to 17 and a team-high 12 rebounds. It hasn't
always been easy, playing second fiddle to a one-man symphony
orchestra, but Pippen has persevered for 11 years and all the Bulls
have prospered, none more so than Jordan. Left to do it all his
first few years in the league, Jordan put up wondrous numbers _
like those 63 points against Bird's Celtics _ but the Bulls
collectively were no match for the likes of the Celtics or the
Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   In the four seasons leading up to the Bulls' first NBA
championship appearance, in 1991, Jordan accounted for nearly
one-third of Chicago's scoring. His 28 points on Sunday represented
31.8 percent of the Bulls' total but didn't begin to tell the whole
story of the seventh-game success.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls would be scattering like last year's Florida Marlins
if not for the rebounding and sheer energy of forward Dennis
Rodman. The first time he checked into the game, the Bulls were
trailing by 13 points and looking flatter than a casino chip. The
Bulls proceeded to cash in on Rodman's boundless energy, drawing to
within six. When the first quarter ended, the Bulls still were
down, 27-19, but they no longer looked tentative and tense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls would be as dead as the U.S. men at the French Open if
not for guard Toni Kukoc, who was 5 for 5 from the field in the
third quarter and collected 14 points in that 12-minute span.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls would be as passe as the Lakers' Showtime era that
Jordan and his teammates had ushered out in 1991 if not for the
performance down the stretch of supporting cast members Luc
Longley, Steve Kerr and Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   More than once in the final minutes, Jordan drew double coverage
and found his teammates, entrusting them with the ball, yes, but
also with all that was riding on the game's outcome. They rewarded
his faith in them by keeping alive his legacy and quite possibly
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had all but assured a victory on the eve of the game,
explaining that the team had a confidence ``we've built over time
in pressure situations.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Bulls came through in the clutch, which is why
Jordan today is at the gates of his heaven on Earth.

MASSCAP SEEMS TO BE ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ When Puerto Madero took to the track for the
Massachusetts Handicap Saturday, John Murphy had the same thought
as did many of the 17,754 fans at Suffolk Downs. Fan after fan
thought what Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a beautiful-looking horse,'' said Murphy, the owner of
Formal Gold who lost to Skip Away by a neck in the stirring 1997
MassCap. ``You won't find many who look better than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And jockey Kent Desormeaux aboard Puerto Madero thought his
horse was running as beautifully as he looked as Desormeaux made
his move to catch Skip Away on the far turn. ``I thought I really
had him,'' said the hottest jockey in the United States. ``I made
up 4 lengths on him and I thought I was getting to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Skip Away ``hit that next gear,'' as the jockey put it,
and Desormeaux learned as so many others have learned, that Skip
Away is more, much more, than he looks. Skip Away jogged away from
Desormeaux and Puerto Madero in the stretch drive, leaving the
jockey to say, ``I guess we'll have to get him the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance, for Puerto Madero had an edge on Skip Away Saturday
that he never will have again _ Skip Away carried an extra 14
pounds _ and Skip Away will go on, a horse who never looks as good
as he is. Skip Away's trainer, Sonny Hine, was asked just how good
that is as his prized horse joined three of the all-time greats _
Whirlaway, Seabiscuit, and Cigar _ as a two-time winner of the
MassCap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' said Hine, who then recounted a recent
discussion with a friend. The friend is an avid devotee of Len
Ragozin's ``Sheets,'' a complicated measure of how fast a horse
runs that is arcane but has devotees who swear on a stack of mutuel
tickets that the ``Sheets'' are one of the most accurate measures
of a horse's ability. The ``Sheets'' assign a numerical rating to a
horse's performance in a race, with higher numbers being poor and
low numbers, such as a 5 or a 7, considered very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even read the Sheets,'' said Hine, ``but I was told
that Skip Away has so many 1s on his Sheets and they tell me that
1s are about as fast as you can go. And (Hine's friend) told me
that not since Dr. Fager has a horse had so many 1s on his Sheets
as Skip Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fager, of course, was a giant of American racing from 30
years ago and is considered one of the fastest American horses _ if
not the fastest _ in the last half-century. Dr. Fager also amassed
a ton of fame, glory, and legendary tales, while Skip Away has
received little of that and is regarded by some as just another
very good horse.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same could be said about Saturday's MassCap itself, a
race that has become much better than it is regarded across the
country. For the fourth straight year, the MassCap was won by the
best horse in America, Cigar twice and now Skip Away twice.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the race hinges on decisions made by the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association, a new group designed to
unite and promote the industry. Lou Raffetto, the executive vice
president for racing at Suffolk Downs, has been fearful that
Suffolk might be pushed aside if a larger track such as Churchill
Downs schedules a lucrative race for older horses in late May or
June.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill already has increased the purse of the June 13 Stephen
Foster, a heretofore nondescript race, from $150,000 to $800,000 to
lure Silver Charm, the only top handicap horse in America other
than Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Smith, the head of the NTRA, was in Boston Saturday,
immediately went to Raffeto's office at Suffolk Downs, and assured
Raffetto that the MassCap and Suffolk ``will be guaranteed'' a spot
in the series of races for older horses that the NTRA will put
together for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen 10 different schedules for races that have been put
together,'' Smith said later, ``and in all 10 of them, Suffolk
Downs is included. The important thing is we want to cover all the
markets for racing and, to us, Boston and New England is one of the
important markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Smith, the NTRA will not become a play toy for the
largest race tracks in the country to the detriment of the midsized
tracks such as Suffolk Downs. ``This is a great market for
racing,'' Smith said of Boston and New England. ``It would be silly
for us to overlook this market. The MassCap is in all our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffetto said he was pleased with his conversation with Smith,
even though the NTRA head said it is too early to say how the
schedule will be played out next year and whether the MassCap might
have to move to another date. ``We're flexible,'' said Raffetto,
``and we'd listen to all suggestions; the important thing is the
MassCap be guaranteed its place.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hine's fiery words about Bob Baffert, the trainer of
Silver Charm, have ignited a blaze that will smolder until the
Breeders Cup in November. Hine called Baffert ``a coward'' for
choosing not to run against Skip Away and it is unclear if the two
will meet before the Breeders Cup. Hine will bring Skip Away into
Baffert's backyard at Hollywood Park for the Hollywood Gold Cup
later this month and will remain in Baffert's California bastion
for the Del Mar Classic in August at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   If Baffert keeps Silver Charm away from Skip Away even though
Skip Away has traveled to California for two big races, then those
words first uttered in Boston by Hine (``A coward never wins'')
will grow hotter and hotter.

JORDAN ERA SURVIVES AS BULLS OUTLAST PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There were frayed edges on his greatness and dents in
his mystique, but Michael Jordan did not care about appearances at
this moment. He dropped the finesse and elegant beauty of his game
on Sunday night and barged in between the Pacers and their grasp on
the Bulls' dynasty like a bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident in the last three tense minutes in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals played out before an unsettled crowd at
the United Center. There was the moment when Jordan tossed his
tired body into the air and crashed into the chest of his series
menace, Derrick McKey. Jordan was the one left standing. There was
the instant that he sneaked inside of the brawny Dale Davis and
grabbed a rebound off a missed free throw by Scottie Pippen. A
possession was saved.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the polished Jordan, not when he made 9 of 25 shots
on his way to 28 points, but there was the poise of the ultimate
winner when face to face with a game that could have meant the end
to the Bulls' era. A loss and this team might have been dismantled
on the spot. But there was an 88-83 victory and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people will say, and I've heard it asked, if the
swagger is gone from the Bulls,'' Jordan said. ``Probably. But no
one has taken anything away from us. We still have an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit tired and worn, the Bulls will drag themselves to Utah for
Game 1 of the National Basketball Association finals on Wednesday
night. Jordan put them in position to win a sixth title with the
aid of Toni Kukoc's 21 points. As usual, Pippen was right there for
Jordan, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had 12 rebounds as part of a 50-34 rebounding edge that
left the Pacers shaking their heads after pushing the Bulls to the
brink. The Pacers had a 1-point lead with 7 minutes left in the
game. Jordan later tied it, and a jumper from Pippen gave the Bulls
a lead with 4 minutes 45 seconds left that was threatened but never
overtaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the toughest playoff series of my career,''
Pippen said. ``There was the pressure, and being expected to win.
They gave us everything we could ask for. We just tried to make
this one game the biggest game of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   And of their lives. Jordan did not give a career performance,
but he found his teammates when he had to in a tight game. They had
wrestled with the Pacers before in this series and lost. But a
close game is what the Bulls had. So they surged ahead and fell
behind with Jordan being less than superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   But so was Reggie Miller. He scored 22 points, but none came in
the fourth quarter, and would not be able to save the Pacers. He
would not be able to give Coach Larry Bird a trip to the finals in
his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable that this team could win a championship,''
Bird said. ``I didn't get them to where I wanted to take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat to a lot of loose balls. They took care of us on
the board. The little things beat us tonight. They seemed like they
were quicker to the ball. The number of offensive rebounds ripped
our hearts out. I knew I'd get the effort, but we needed a couple
of stars to play big.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller could not get loose after scoring the third quarter. Rik
Smits scored when he was in the game, but could not maneuver with
five fouls on him for most of the fourth quarter. Without Miller or
Smits, there would be no miracle and no shock to the system of all
of those conditioned to seeing the Bulls in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   There was something unsettling and unfamiliar seeping into the
atmosphere surrounding the Bulls as they took the floor faced with
this kind of fate-determining game: insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   This unlikely trait manifested itself as it does with anyone.
Instead of giving their opponent credit, the Bulls offered
put-downs these past two weeks, treating the Pacers as a disposable
little nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the defending champions belittling the Pacers when
Jordan referred to his team's loss in Game 3 as a ``bump in the
road.'' Here was a dynasty led by a coach, Phil Jackson, who
refused to credit the Pacers by shrugging his coat-hanger shoulders
as he blamed officials for their lack of courage and ``swallowing
their whistles'' in each Bulls loss. And after Game 6, Jordan piped
up to announce that the Bulls ``will win Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this thinly veiled bravado was a gilded team that
was afraid of the end, afraid of what would come next if its
championship run to five titles would come to a halt. A day before
Game 7, in a sudden drop of the arrogant shield, Jackson must have
sensed the unease creeping into his players' minds, and he offered
this advice in dealing with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them you can lose,'' Jackson said. ``Anything's
possible. You can lose a game like this. But if you give your best
effort, there's nothing frightening about losing. Fear is something
worse than the actual thing itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's motivational speech?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't choke,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing uptight about the Pacers as this game began.
They came out with cast-iron stomachs. After hitting their first
eight shots and taking a 13-point first-quarter lead, the Pacers
learned about the resolve of the Bulls, particularly Jordan. With a
flurry of energy in the second quarter, he shooed away the
butterflies and carried the Bulls to within 3, at 48-45, at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, leaning on the hot shooting of Kukoc, took a 8-point
edge in the third quarter on Kukoc's 3-pointer. But the Pacers came
back to tighten things after a couple of turnovers by the Bulls in
the final two minutes of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That lapse by the Bulls, playing that last stretch with Jordan
on the bench, allowed the Pacers to get perilously close. The Bulls
held just a 69-65 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were not in a groove to begin the game. The Pacers
began the night by taking the ball right to the Bulls' weak link on
defense, using Dale Davis to post up Kukoc. Davis hit his first
four shots and led the Pacers on a tear that left them up by 13 in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jordan restored calm in the second quarter. Quickly, there
was an 8-point Bulls lead. The Pacers were flustered and out of
sync. Game 6's hero, Travis Best, was launching 3-pointers way off
the mark as the Pacers went through a dizzying spell of misses. At
one point, they were 3 of 18 and down by 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it looked as if the Bulls were taking control, Miller
sprang loose to hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the last minute of
the half. Miller's output pulled the Pacers within, 48-45 at the
half.

LONG BEACH STATE SIMPLY RESILIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; OMAHA, Neb. _ The first rule of Dirtbag baseball is that
nothing ever comes easy. The second rule is that it takes someone
tough to deal with rule number one.
</P>
<P>
   And as editions of 49er baseball go, the 1998 team has qualified
as one of the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, facing elimination here in the College World
Series, the 49ers dug themselves a 4-0 hole against Florida State
but then rallied for a 7-4 win that gains them a rematch against
Miami Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   This is the team which began the season 2-8 and had its right to
be known as Dirtbags questioned by Coach Dave Snow. Qualifying for
the CWS earned it a place in the Dirtbag Hall of Fame. Staying
alive in it moves it into more select territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been resilient all season,'' said Snow afterward. ``This
is what I would call a good team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they lost Friday (to Miami), they came back with an
attitude of no fear. That was the perfect attitude, and the one I
wanted to see. They put it all on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   If Snow and his team were to ever win the lottery, it would take
them three days to find the winning ticket. But they would spare no
sweat looking for it. They're like the best friend who is often
late, but that you know will always show up.
</P>
<P>
   Snow never gets tired of the one-step-back before
two-steps-forward pattern, perhaps because college is supposed to
teach character and tenacity in the face of adversity. He's found
that it works for him personally and for his teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep looking at the back of my shirt to see if it's wet
from the paint on the wall,'' he joked. ``This team is starting to
remind me of the 1993 team (which came an inning away from playing
in the CWS title game. ``It has a certain teamsmanship, and they
feed off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game proved that point over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Snow. He posted a lineup early in the day, but
changed his mind once he got to Rosenblatt Stadium. The wind was
blowing out to right field, so he inserted Mike Hota into the DH
spot in place of Jason Berni.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not a bit that Hota had started two games all
season. Snow wanted an extra left-handed bat in the lineup with the
wind blowing to right. Naturally, Hota winds up driving in two runs
with a bases loaded single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out about an hour before the game,'' said Hota. ``But
the coaches had told me to be ready to swing the bat with the wind
blowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the decision to start Scott Redfox at second
base. That was a no-brainer, Snow said, because he felt the need
for more offense after watching all the batting thunder in other
games. But even he didn't expect what he got. Redfox, with one home
run all season, took a 3-2 fastball over the right field fence for
a three-run home run in the seventh that proved to be the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only hit home runs in batting practice when the wind is
blowing out the way it did tonight,'' said Redfox.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also pulled off a delicious pick off play in the
seventh that stopped a Seminole rally dead. First baseman Jason
Yount, with two extra base hits in his last 23 games, homered in
the fourth and made two great defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   The way the team hung in emotionally, too, after leaving the
bases loaded in the fifth and sixth also proved crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dugout is huge for us,'' said Hota, who has spent most of
his 49er career coming out of the dugout as a pinch-hitter and
utilityman deluxe. ``We get a lot of our energy from the guys on
the bench who always stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team likes to do the small things. Like, we thrive on
guys getting hit by a pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After those two innings,'' said Snow, ``I noticed the dugout
didn't letdown or get frustrated. There's a mentality this team
has: it accepts what happens and goes on to the next thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing is Miami, again. The nervousness the 49ers showed
in their opener has now dissipated fully. In the last four innings
Sunday, the Dirtbags were having fun playing ball and getting their
jerseys dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about this series,'' said Snow. ``Guys
who have played minimal rules get a chance to come up big. But it's
too early to start calling anyone stars or heroes. We won just one
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's tough love. But then it's a tough team.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Republican or Democrat? David Haro of North
Hollywood isn't quite sure which he wants to be yet.
</P>
<P>
   But with the primary election coming up Tuesday, he is feeling
pressure from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer Connie Begg coaxed him in Spanish to register to vote
as a Republican at a Los Angeles Convention Center naturalization
ceremony last week that drew hundreds of new citizens.
</P>
<P>
   At the booth next door, Kathy Checchi, wife of gubernatorial
candidate Al Checchi, used her fluent Spanish to win over new
voters to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos, your vote is your voice,'' bellowed a Democratic
recruiter in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Begg responded in Spanish, ``You can register with us, it
doesn't take much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is California's first open primary, in which people may
vote across party lines regardless of their registration.
</P>
<P>
   But like never before, Latino voters are being courted,
bilingually, by political parties eager to recruit this growing
segment of the electorate. Traditionally, registration drives have
been used to recruit new voters. Now, radio spots, glossy mailers
and especially television commercials are being more widely used,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Gregory Rodriguez, a research
fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy and an expert
on Latino politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time Latinos have been courted with such
intensity and it's the first time that Spanish-language ads have
been bought at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi has taken the lead, spending 15 percent of his $20
million television budget solely on Spanish commercials, said Elena
Stern, his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent Jane Harman followed suit with advertisements that
began airing in March. And though the less-wealthy Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis will not be airing TV commercials in Spanish, he did begin
airing Spanish-language radio spots last Friday, according to his
campaign press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi began airing his English and Spanish-language
commercials the same week, showing the equal importance he placed
on both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads in Spanish are specifically geared toward the Latino
community, they are not simply translations,'' said Stern.
</P>
<P>
   And showing just how serious he is about speaking directly to
Latino voters, Checchi opened Get Out the Vote offices in 12 Latino
neighborhoods throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe Latinos are so key for the future of
California and will be even more important as we move into the 21st
century,'' said Kathy Checchi, who has appeared in numerous
commercials telling voters in Spanish about her husband's strong
Italian immigrant roots.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back up the dollars. According to the Southwest
Voter Registration Education Project, there were 1.35 million
registered Latino voters in the state 10 years ago. Of those,
705,000 voted in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 1.55 million Latinos registered to vote, while 1.05
million voted. The numbers significantly increased in 1996 when 2.1
million Latinos registered to vote and 1.35 million voted.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by strong anti-Republican sentiments created over
Proposition 187 in the Latino community, in the past the Republican
Party shied away from recruiting voters at naturalization
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never made it a concerted part of our strategy,'' said Mike
Madrid, political director for the state Republican Party. ``But we
realized there was nothing to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Republican recruiters speaking Spanish, Tagalog and
Korean, the results of the party's efforts are impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Republicans registered 2,000 voters at the
convention center over two days. Friday, 1,300 &UR;  &LR; more were added.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren, who launched his
Spanish-language commercials last week, also offers Internet
browsers a chance to hear his biography with Spanish-language
audio.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lungren's) very serious about asking Latinos to vote for him
and that is accomplished in part through advertising in
Spanish-language media outlets,'' said campaign director David
Puglia.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez believes the increasing number of Latino voters makes
it cost-effective for candidates to make their case in Spanish.
This year, Latinos are likely to make up 13 percent of the
California electorate, up from 7 percent in 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bigger return for your money and it's significant
enough of the electorate that you're willing to have separate
campaign strategies,'' said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez believes Spanish-language strategies are not
necessarily the wave of the future. He points to a Latino Issues
Forum survey done earlier this year by political scientist Fernando
Guerra that found only 18 percent of the Latino electorate is
likely to get their news from Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see ethnic targeting marketing in the
future,'' said Rodriguez. ``You'll see Latinos being courted in
English.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrid, who authored the ``Media and Campaign Strategy for the
California Latino Voter,'' said in his report that the greatest
number of Latino votes can be garnered by utilizing English
speaking media, supplemented by a secondary effort in Spanish
media.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls conducted by the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project, 32 percent of Latinos who cast
votes in 1996 got their information from Spanish
language-resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, voters didn't watch Spanish television,''
said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project, a nonpartisan group in Montebello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 5 percent of the electorate was watching Spanish TV, but
today you have 25 to 30 percent watching,'' he said. ``I think you
have a new pattern emerging since 1996 with the campaigns and
parties and candidates really taking note of the big turnout of
Latino voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Often both monolingual and bilingual speakers exist within a
Latino family, resulting in a ripple effect for Spanish-language
advertising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is considered to be a way of showing respect and appealing
to the Latino electorate and has significance beyond the very
important numbers that are now watching,'' said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reach Spanish-speaking voters, the Christian
Coalition of California has begun distributing Spanish voter guides
in churches throughout California, including the Fuentes de Vida
church in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The voter guides are part of an ``unprecedented'' effort to
communicate the message that the Coalition and Latino Catholic
voters share many of the same values, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, campaign deputies were reluctant to talk
about strategy targeting Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   But state Senate candidate Richard Katz, for instance, offers
his biography and mailers in Spanish. His opponent, City Councilman
Richard Alarcon has also sent out mailers in Spanish, according to
his political consultant, Richie Ross.
</P>
<P>
   That type of campaigning can only benefit local candidates, said
Estela Lopez, a communications consultant for Estela Lopez
Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only politically correct, but politically smart to
set money aside for campaign outreach in Spanish,'' said Lopez.
``Whether it's an issue or candidate, you can't run in Los Angeles
without something in Spanish.''

LAWYERS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING DROPPING PART OF CLINTON FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers are considering whether
to drop his planned appeal of a federal judge's rejection of his
claims of executive privilege in the investigation into his
relationship with a former intern, people familiar with their
deliberations said on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers planned to make a final decision Monday,
administration officials said, in time to meet a 4:30 p.m. deadline
imposed by the Supreme Court for a response to a request by Kenneth
Starr, the independent prosecutor, to speed up the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new legal strategy, Clinton would continue to appeal
some of Starr's questioning, but only by invoking his
attorney-client privilege, Clinton's allies said on Sunday night.
White House lawyers could argue that Clinton's use of the
attorney-client privilege raised no constitutional issues and
therefore would not require the extraordinary kind of accelerated
review that Starr has requested.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge, Norma Holloway Johnson, had consolidated the
two privilege claims in her ruling. In effect, by switching
strategies now, Clinton would be claiming victory and withdrawing.
All along, the White House has insisted that it was simply out to
uphold the principle that the president is entitled to an executive
privilege, a position that Judge Johnson upheld even as she ruled
that in this instance Starr's need pursue his investigation
outweighed that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has asked the Supreme Court to short-circuit the normal
appellate process and consider a White House appeal right away. His
request put the White House in the difficult position of possibly
opposing such an expedited review, a move that officials
acknowledged would lend weight to criticism that Clinton was trying
to impede the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the appeal of executive privilege altogether, the
White House would avoid that fight, without depriving the president
of the shield of attorney-client privilege. The tentative new White
House strategy was reported in the early editions on Sunday night
of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invoked the privileges to prevent Starr from
compelling testimony from two senior aides, Sidney Blumenthal, a
senior communications adviser, and Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White
House counsel. If Clinton dropped his appeal on executive
privilege, Starr could call Blumenthal to testify immediately. But
Clinton may invoke attorney-client privilege to block some
questioning of Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has granted expedited review only a handful of
times this century, in cases like labor strikes or when crimes have
been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said, ``No final decision
is expected until the attorneys meet at least one more time, most
likely tomorrow morning.''

LONG BEACH STATE ELIMINATES FLORIDA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ &UR;  &LR; For half a dozen innings Sunday night, Long Beach
State's 49ers tried to play Snow Ball, and it wasn't getting them
much.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the seventh, they resorted to what has become
college baseball's all-too-familiar weapon: the three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   And because of it, the 49ers have a Snow Ball's chance at the
52nd College World Series after all.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State's 7-4 victory over third-seeded Florida State
the result of Scott Redfox's second career homer, a three-run shot
that snapped a 4-4 tie earned the 49ers a rematch with No. 2-seeded
Miami on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And it sent Florida State, a first-round loser to Arizona State,
packing, the first team ousted from the double-elimination
tournament. Nothing new there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on that early flight back home so many times I even
know when to set the alarm clock,'' said FSU coach Mike Martin, a
punch-in the-belly reminder that the Seminoles have made more trips
to Omaha, 16 now, than anyone else without landing a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't overmatched,'' said Martin, ``we just got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redfox really surprised us,'' Martin admitted. ``He had one
homer going in ... but he really put a charge into that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Snow, the 49ers' coach, had been looking for some kind of
offensive charge, especially after the Dirtbags managed just four
singles in their 3-1 loss to Miami in the first round. Snow also
was quick to take note of the wind when he arrived at Rosenblatt
Stadium, which so far, in only six games, has helped produce the
staggering total of 23 home runs. With a stiff wind blowing toward
right field, he juggled his original lineup slightly, getting
lefty-swinging Chuck Lopez into the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   And he started Redfox at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some big hits for us lately, he's had a hot bat,''
Snow said of Redfox, who started only a handful of games until late
in the season, but has been on fire in the post-season: 12 for 31
(.387). ``He didn't start the first game (against Miami) just
because it was the first game and (Curt) Lee is a little more of a
stabilizer on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Snow added, ``with the wind, it was an easy
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, as usual, dug themselves a hole, falling behind, 4-1,
after only four innings. FSU's freshman right fielder, Matt Diaz,
walloped a three-run homer in the top of the fourth off starter
Caleb Balbuena. First baseman Jason Yount, who'd managed only two
extra-base hits in his last 23 games, homered in the 49ers' fourth,
a solo shot.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers tied the score with a three-run fifth, the key hit a
two-run, bases-loaded single by designated hitter Mike Hota another
spit in the wind by Snow, who'd started Hota just two other games
all season.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers left the bases loaded in the fifth, and again in
the sixth, stranding no fewer than 10 baserunners the first six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dugout didn't let down, even then,'' Sbnow said. ``We
didn't get frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers (42-22-1) certainly frustrated the Seminoles
(53-20) in the top of the seventh. Balbuena hit the first batter of
the inning, Kevin Cash, then gave up a single to Karl Jernigan the
Seminoles' only hit over the last five innings.
</P>
<P>
   That brought sinkerballer Darren Merrill out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a bunt, the 49ers put on a play. Paul Day charged
from third base, and shortstop Justin Hall dashed toward third.
Cash, on second, bit. He took off for third along with Hall.
Merrill before he'd so much as thrown a pitch to the plate whirled
and fired to Redfox, who'd slipped in to cover second. Cash was
out, ``a bonehead play on my part,'' he said, and soon the 49ers
were out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the 49ers' seventh, one-out infield singles by Yount and Hall
brought Redfox to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up trying to get a good swing and go with the pitch,''
said Redfox, who hit his only other collegiate homer two months ago
against New Mexico State. ``I got my hands extended and got it up
in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   And into the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Redfox was mobbed by his teammates once he reached home plate,
finally breaking into a smile once he reached the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure right now that it really happened,'' Redfox
said later, still stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he actually saw the ball carry into the stands, Redfox
admitted he watched it as best he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to hit one out of here,'' he said, smiling, ``I
kind of wanted to see it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill (7-0), who's worked four hitless innings in two CWS
appearances emerged the winner. Jason Marr hurled a 1-2-3 ninth for
his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   So far in their two games, the 49ers' pitching has been superb,
allowing just seven runs on 14 hits over 17 innings, a far cry from
everyone else here, who averaged better than 18 runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gallo, who pitched into the seventh inning on Friday
against Miami, is one of Snow's choices to start Tuesday's rematch
against the Hurricanes, an elimination for both teams (Miami lost
to unbeaten Arizona State, 9-2, earlier Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll have to talk to him,'' Snow said. ``We could go with
(freshman right-hander Jeff) Leuenberger and bring Gallo in from
the bullpen if we have to. He's used to getting the ball as a
reliever, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers got one other major break, in the third inning, when
Jose Zapata tried to score from third on what appeared to be a wild
pitch. Only the ball caromed straight back to catcher Bryan Kennedy
and, as Zapata explained later, ``I was out by a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snow: ``I thought for a minute we were playing handball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nah, just Snow Ball.

SABRES RELAXED DESPITE TRAILING IN SERIES WITH CAPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The pressure is off of the Buffalo Sabres now.
There is no one outside of the Sabres' locker room, not even the
fans in Buffalo, according to coach Lindy Ruff, who expect the
Sabres to come back against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   And as if a huge weight had been lifted from their collective
shoulders, the mood at Sunday's practice was light, despite a
discouraging 2-0 loss to the Capitals on Saturday night at Marine
Midland Arena, a loss which put the Sabres down 3-1, a game away
from elimination from the NHL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moping, casting their heads downward, or showing any
of the telltale signs of surrender, the players filled Midland
Arena with boisterous laughter as they skated through an easy
workout, concentrating mostly on correcting the team's struggling
power play. The Sabres went 0- for- 7 with the man-advantage on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dominik Hasek, the Sabres goalie, who allowed a 70-footer
into his goal on Saturday and subsequently took the brunt of the
blame for the loss, was wearing a smile Sunday. He was also wearing
a sign made of tape on the front of his helmet. It said,
``Sorrento,'' which is the name of a local cheese company. Wait,
there was more. On the goalie's back was written ``Kramer,'' as in
the character from ``Seinfeld'' who Hasek resembles so much, but
who also dislikes it when teased by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign on the back of Hasek's jersey read, ``Swiss
cheese,'' as in what Hasek resembled after allowing the Capitals'
Joe Juneau to score from behind the blue line. It was Hasek's
strange _ and humorous _ way of apologizing for his miscue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have fun today,'' said Hasek, who has allowed
nine goals in the last three games. ``There are many holes in Swiss
cheese. It was fun for my teammates. I like to make fun of myself
sometimes. It's behind me now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dominik gets all of the credit for the success we've had,''
said Ruff. ``Now he's also taking some of the blame. He's huge
enough of a man to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek carried the Sabres during the regular season and in the
early rounds of the playoffs, but has been criticized in the past
for not playing well when the stakes are raised. And Hasek has not
been in form recently, allowing a few soft goals. At least his
attitude was good, an that was taken by his teammates as an
encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question Dominik was getting hammered on the
radio, on television and in the newspapers about last night's
game,'' said Dixon Ward. ``There are two directions you can go in
when you're getting barraged like that. You can curl up and hide,
or you can have fun with it. We're all proud of Dom for the way he
is handling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fun, yes, they were doing that. But the Sabres are
certainly not waiving the white flag. They have beaten the Capitals
at the MCI Center. And the Sabres know they are only one Hasek hot
streak way from pulling to within one game of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech today was that three wins is not insurmountable,''
said Ruff. ``We're approaching this next game like we have three
weeks left.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling in the Sabres' locker room was that the pressure has
now shifted to the Capitals, who were the higher-seeded team and
are haunted by their long history of failure in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that,'' said Matthew Barnaby, who upset the Capitals
with his taunts and post-goal celebration in Game 2 at the MCI
Center. ``It definitely plays in our minds.'' &QL;

DECIDING ON DEATH OR LIFE FOR A KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One juror, an unemployed resident of Red Hook,
Brooklyn, said that he believed the death penalty made criminals
``think twice before committing heinous crimes,'' but that he would
not automatically vote to execute every killer, because it
``depends on how and why the murder was committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, a medical technician from Bedford-Stuyvesant said
that her first husband had been killed in a 1981 shooting, but that
her decision on whether to impose capital punishment in a murder
case ``would depend on the evidence presented.''
</P>
<P>
   A third juror, an administrative assistant from Bensonhurst with
a doctorate in English literature called her feelings about the
death penalty ``sobering,'' saying the ``responsibility for
someone's life is an awesome one.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Brooklyn residents are among the 12 jurors who are
expected this week to begin determining whether a former jail
guard, Darrel K. Harris, will be the first person sentenced to
death under the law that reinstated capital punishment in New York
State three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements came from questionnaires they filled out and in
replies to questions by the judge and prosecution and defense
lawyers during jury selection for Harris' trial. He was charged
with killing three people during a 1996 robbery at an illegal
social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and on May 19 the jury convicted
him of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Now the seven women and five men on the panel must perform the
second task that the 1995 capital punishment law sets out for them:
sentencing the 40-year-old Harris to death by lethal injection or
to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The life sentence is an option if the jurors find it warranted
by so-called mitigating factors, which can include positive aspects
of Harris' background and character, and his state of mind at the
time he committed the killings.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Harris was publicly honored as a hero for saving a
fellow correction officer during an inmate riot at a Brooklyn jail.
In the trial's penalty stage, which opened on Tuesday, his lawyers
are offering this as one among several mitigating factors.
</P>
<P>
   Others include an argument that Harris is a seriously disturbed
man whose murderous explosion was fueled by stresses stemming from
his upbringing and his former work as a jail guard, combined with
drug and alcohol abuse. His drug use ended his career with the
city's Correction Department in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The mitigation testimony continues Monday before Acting Justice
Anne Feldman, as arguments and testimony are also to begin in
Poughkeepsie in the second death penalty trial under the 1995 law,
that of Dalkeith V. McIntosh, charged with murdering his estranged
wife and her daughter by a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And jury selection began last week for the third death penalty
trial, and the second in Brooklyn _ that of Jermaine Page, who
prosecutors contend murdered a man execution style after robbing
him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Harris' trial this week, after the defense finishes
presenting witnesses _ who have included the jail guard Harris
saved _ the jury will hear the prosecutors' arguments that any
mitigating factors do not offset what they have termed cold-blooded
killings committed to eliminate witnesses to Harris' robbery. He
shot two victims _ Michael Harris (no relation) and Jerome Sims _
in the head and fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis after running out of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who will assess all this, whose identities the court
has kept confidential, range in age from the 30s to the 60s and
include five people in health related jobs, four in office or blue
collar employment, a science teacher, a retired woman and the
unemployed man who last worked as a truck driver. Five of the
jurors have college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Racial influences on the jury that lawyers sometimes fear when
the defendant and the victim are of different races, are not a
factor in this case. Harris is black, as were all his victims.
Eight of the jurors are black, three are white and one is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   On their questionnaires, four of the jurors indicated a firm
belief that some killings demand the death penalty, seven did not
express vigorous feelings about capital punishment, one way or the
other, and one, a medical technician from East Flatbush, simply
said, ``It is the law in New York State.''
</P>
<P>
   But all said that they would assess the circumstances of the
killings, as well as Harris himself, and would consider both life
in prison without parole and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 35-year-old office worker from East New York said
on her questionnaire that she favored capital punishment ``if a
person willingly and knowingly plans to murder another person
without any remorse whatsoever and for no reason.'' But she also
said that she would want to know the ``defendant's state of mind at
the time of the murder, the reason for the murder and did the
defendant think of the consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a 49-year-old laboratory assistant from
Bedford-Stuyvesant, who wrote ``open mind'' when asked her current
feelings about the death penalty, also said that in deciding a
sentence she would want to know ``the state of mind of the
defendant at the time of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   The last execution in New York State was carried out in 1963, in
an electric chair. In 1984 the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals, declared the remaining provision of the state's previous
death penalty law unconstitutional.

RUN OF BULLS NOT OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They have never had to fight so long, so hard, and, at
times, so futilely, simply to take the next step. Their warts and
blemishes exposed for all the world to see, their swagger reduced
at times to juvenile behavior, the world champion Bulls
nevertheless have earned the right to defend their title.
</P>
<P>
   They did so Sunday night with a day-at-the-dentist, 88-83
victory over an Indiana Pacers team that probably deserved a better
fate. The NBA Finals open Wednesday night in Salt Lake City and no
one who witnessed Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals at the
United Center could have not felt that in another time or place, it
would have been Larry Bird preparing his team for the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say the best team won,'' said Scottie Pippen in what,
for the Bulls, was a rare moment of humility. For most of this
series, they have acted like petulant adolescents when they lost
and imperious blackguards when they won. ``I have a lot of respect
for Indiana. They gave us a lot. I feel both teams deserve to go to
the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one will, of course, and that one is the same one that
has represented the East six times in the 1990s. The Bulls labored
through this one, looking a lot like some of those Celtics teams in
the 1980s that simply found a way to win when everything appeared
to be pointing to a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago shot 38 percent from the field and 59 percent from the
line. Messiah Michael Jordan went 9 for 25 from the field and
bricked five free throws. Pippen was 6 of 18. Luc Longley made a
single basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a great game,'' said Chicago coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory was forged by will and aggression. The Bulls got
the loose balls. The Bulls got the loose (and tight) calls. And the
Bulls dominated in one category that jumped out from the final box
score: rebounding. Chicago outrebounded the Pacers, 50-34, but the
real whopper was on the offensive boards, where the Bulls collected
22 to the Pacers' four.
</P>
<P>
   That not only led to a 24-6 difference in second-chance points,
it also gave the Bulls extra possessions and, by extension, time
off the clock. Down the stretch, that was almost as vital as
scoring points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the little things beat us,'' Bird said. ``The
offensive rebounding just ripped our heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was on the other side of similar games in Boston, such as
Game 7 against the Bucks in 1987 and Game 7 against the Lakers in
1984. The Celtics shot poorly in those games, but prevailed, in
large part due to rebounding. They also were the home team, which
again proved to be an invaluable asset in a seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls needed everything to survive and there were moments
where at least the fans might have wondered if this was, indeed,
the end. They started out terribly, yielding a 16-2 Indiana run
that put them in a 13-point hole. They got a 15-point second
quarter from Jordan and survived some Reggie Miller heroics to lead
by 3 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 4 entering the fourth, then the Pacers, to the
astonishment of most of the 23,844 in attendance, regained the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   They did it without Miller, who had only one shot in the fourth
quarter (an airball) and no field goals in the final 18 minutes. He
still led the Pacers with 22 points. They did it without one-time
heroes Travis Best and Jalen Rose, who were inconsistent Sunday
night. But they led, 73-68, with 7:37 left and 79-77 after Antonio
Davis powered over Pippen with 5:50 to play.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, the Bulls went 4:20 without a point. They
had gotten help from a wide variety of sources, from Toni Kukoc (14
of his 21 in the third) to Steve Kerr (a huge 11 points) to Jud
Buechler (11 minutes, doubling his time for the first six games).
But they needed more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried,'' Jordan said. ``At no time did I allow any
negativity to enter my thought process.''
</P>
<P>
   At 79-77, the Bulls started to close down on the Pacers the way
one of those insect-devouring plants has its dinner. The Pacers'
next seven possessions resulted in four turnovers, one missed shot,
a Miller airball that Antonio Davis redirected, and two Rik Smits
free throws. Smits struggled all night with fouls (he had five) and
shooting (3 of 7), and lost a critical jump ball to Jordan in the
fourth, tipping it the wrong way. That led to a Kerr trey.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls tied the game at 79 on two Jordan free throws and took
the lead for good on yet another second-chancer, this one by
Pippen. Longley then chose the right time for his only hoop, making
it 83-79. The Bulls defense held on _ barely _ for the rest of the
evening.

JORDAN GOT BY WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ladies and gentlemen: May we present ``The
Jordanaires, featuring Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't one of those ``MICHAEL JORDAN and someotherguys''
affairs. This was one of the hard-est games Michael Jordan ever has
had to play. He will be getting on a plane for Salt Lake City
Tuesday only because members of what he long ago referred to as his
``supporting cast'' picked him up on a night when he was
exceedingly mortal with a basketball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Chicago's 88-83 Game 7 victory over the Indiana
Pacers, he did flirt with a triple-double (28 points, 9 rebounds, 8
assists). He did put the flypaper defense on Reggie Miller in the
fourth quarter, limiting the Indiana Stickman to one field goal
attempt. Once you got past his 9-for-25 shooting, the fact that
Jordan only made one jump shot in the entire second half, and the
fact that he was uncharacteristically pedestrian at the free-throw
line (10 for 15), he did other things to help his team win the
game, things that offer testimony to his true greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw is why he's the best player in the league, and
why he's the best player ever,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``I
know that when my shooting was off I tried to get on the boards and
make passes. That's what he did, and at the end of the game he just
put his head down and tried to get to the foul line. He understood
that he needed to find another way for his team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but none of this would have been enough. Jordan's
season would be over right now if it weren't for the contributions
of a Croatian, a little blond guard, a graceful Arkansas guy who
couldn't even get a college scholarship coming out of high school,
a veteran multi-purpose do-the-dirty-work guard who had entered the
NBA billed as a pseudo-Michael, and an almost-forgotten backup
forward who basically had watched the action for six games until he
was called upon in the most important game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that the Bulls really are a basketball
team, and not just an excuse for Jordan to play basketball in a
formal setting, they were eliminated Sunday night. If you had just
dropped in from Uranus, you wouldn't have realized you were looking
at the greatest player of all-time. You could only appreciate what
Jordan did to distinguish himself if you were a reasonably advanced
scholar of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Uranus resident would have watched the third period and
said, ``Hey, that tall guy with the goatee really can throw that
round thing through the orange ring.'' It wouldn't have taken much
basketball sophistication to notice that in the third period Toni
Kukoc drilled five baskets in five attempts, three of them
murderous 3-pointers. It didn't seem to matter whether he was open
or shooting with a hand massaging his whiskers. He was, as they
say, in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the Kukoc explosion this interplanetary visitor
also would have noticed three great 3-point shots by Steve Kerr,
each a major dagger in the Indiana heart. The first came in the
middle of a Chicago comeback run, pulling the Bulls within 28-26
after they had trailed by as many as 13 (20-7). The second made the
score 36-32. The third was real-l-l-l-ly big, tying the score at 77
with 6:11 left.
</P>
<P>
   Our friend also might have noticed the relentless hustle of
Central Arkansas' Scottie Pippen, who, like Jordan, struggled from
the floor (6 for 18), but who transferred his interest and energy
to every other phase of the game. Pippen was the game's leading
rebounder with 12, half of which came on the offensive boards,
where the Bulls annihilated Indiana, 22-4 (good for a 24-6
second-chance point advantage). He might have seen the big
defensive plays submitted by Ron Harper, who came into the league
as a minor league Jordan and who now must content himself with a
shot every seven minutes _ if he drinks his milk to the bottom of
the glass and remembers to say please. But Harper always is ready
to make a play, and he made a huge one when he tipped and caught a
Mark Jackson entry pass intended for Rik Smits with 1:20 remaining
and the Pacers down 4 (87-83), with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is doubtful the space visitor would have noticed Jud
Buechler, but Phil Jackson certainly did. On a night when both
teams were in severe foul trouble _ there were 63 personals and at
one point late in the game six of the 10 men on the floor had five
fouls _ Jackson had to go deep enough into his bench to summon
Buechler, who had been a series-long MIA candidate. Buechler gave
the Bulls five rebounds in 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan remains the best player in basketball because he is the
most well-rounded and resourceful player, but he is now fallible.
After Game 4, everyone said, ``Ooh, Michael will be good for 35 to
40 in Game 5 _ easy.'' It didn't happen. The same was said after
Game 6. It didn't happen. And who among us expected anything less
than a virtuoso scoring performance in Game 7? That didn't happen,
either. The breakout scoring game never came.
</P>
<P>
   We got something else. We got to see how a smart player reads a
situation and makes adjustments. Michael's Game 7 was something the
late-career Bird could relate to. It was a game the late-career
Magic could relate to. It was probably not a game the spoiled,
star-struck United Center crowd could relate to.
</P>
<P>
   But they'd better get used to it. Michael Jordan had to work
very hard just to get through this series, and there is an even
tougher confrontation in store when the Finals commence Wednesday
night in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned in this series that I have to trust my bench more,''
said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic mortality is setting in. The only way Michael Jordan is
going to get a sixth ring is if the Jordanaires are good enough
against the Jazz to help him get it.

A COMPETITOR REFUSES TO LET GO OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Bird was wrapping it up, having acquitted himself well
under difficult circumstances. ``The number of offensive rebounds
ripped our heart out,'' he said on Sunday night, his voice trailing
off. A fawning reporter finally thanked him for his candor, adding,
``You've been a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' he said, ``but the referees still stink.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-liner from Coach Bird. Emotion at last.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls began to sweat on Sunday night. Bird? He was the stoic
farmer waiting for the wheat to grow tall. His demeanor in the most
stomach-gnawing of times ran somewhere between dispassionate and
downright bored.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of America watched his Indiana Pacers come within 6
points of possibly re-retiring Michael Jordan, Bird walked along
the sideline with his hands stuffed in his pockets. You wanted to
shake him, to tell him that these were the Eastern Conference
finals, not some after-school pickup game at Springs Valley High.
</P>
<P>
   The moment his team went down hard in Game 7, he merely walked
over to Phil Jackson, shook hands with the Chicago coach and kept
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was a player and not shooting well,'' Bird
said, referring to Michael Jordan's resolve. ``I had to help in
other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In ways he will never admit, Bird got to play again. Six years
after a debilitating back injury took the game away from him, he
ended up on the biggest basketball stage imaginable _ Jordan's
stage. And Bird's imperfect team almost pulled it off, the way he
almost pulled off his aw-shucks act.
</P>
<P>
   The focus has remained on the world's greatest player and his
potential decline. Michael this, Michael that. He is still the most
compelling figure in any arena. Yet rooting for Jordan has become
like rooting for Microsoft; he has a monopoly on winning in the
playoffs, killing off everyone else's product. That's compelling?
</P>
<P>
   So many people in this most provincial of big cities are
mourning the eventual loss of the dynasty and the deity. Yes,
Jordan perhaps nearing his last game is a huge story, with all
kinds of ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird finding the competition he craved and had missed was a
better one, lost amid the Jordan hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Bird once said that part of the reason he returned to coach
after retiring as a player in 1992 was that his children wanted to
know why their daddy didn't work and everybody else's daddy did.
People close to him know better.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's coming back was not about earning a paycheck. It was
about refusing to let go of a game that wouldn't let go of him.
Great player or 12th man, it is about being as close to the game as
you can once you are not able to touch it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He may have retired six years ago, but Bird picks up a
basketball occasionally and squares his body to the rim. The Pacers
assistant Dick Harter said one such occasion happened last fall as
the rookie free agents were working at the Indiana Basketball
Academy in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Before he reported for training camp with the Spurs in San
Antonio, the veteran shooting guard Chuck Person showed up.
Person's first-round shootout with Bird in the 1991 playoffs is
part of Larry lore. Person, then with the Pacers, was talking the
whole series, making 3-pointers from unimaginable spots on the
floor. Bird responded with a Game 5 masterpiece, coming back from
injury during the game to lead the Celtics into the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Person wanted one more crack at the legend last fall. The two
began playing horse, nailing different shots until one of them
missed. Bird won five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck shows up and makes a mistake of getting in a little
shooting game with Larry,'' Harter said. ``Maybe he thought he was
out of shape. Maybe he thought he could take Larry. Of course,
Larry talks and destroys him.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that in his last game at Boston Garden, Bird
delivered 16 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists in a do-or-die
playoff victory over Cleveland? His heart was still in the sport,
but his body could not take the pounding anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In the final five minutes on Sunday night, the Pacers committed
four turnovers and made several mental errors under the weight of a
stifling Chicago defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson could not get an entry pass into the post, turning
the ball over to a leaping Ron Harper. Rik Smits tipped a jump ball
he had won against Jordan right into Scottie Pippen's hands. Travis
Best kept picking up his dribble and running over defenders instead
of going by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, we practice our free throws,'' Bird said,
referring to Indiana's 23-of-37 output from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the difference between losing a game of this magnitude as
a player and losing it as a coach, he added: ``Well, it feels about
the same, really. I felt we had a good enough team to win this
series. Coming in here today, I felt like I got them ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird barely winced as his team self-destructed and gave away its
season on Sunday night, and it seemed oddly appropriate. He
understands: when you don't suit up anymore, there really is
nothing to get worked up about.

DEMOCRATS RENEW PUSH FOR HORMEL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope to breathe new life this week into
the moribund nomination of San Francisco philanthropist James
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, embarking on a strategy that
could elevate a low-level diplomatic appointment into a
battleground over gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, is
threatening to attach an amendment calling for Hormel's
confirmation to any bill that reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House is looking for an appropriate forum for
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to push for the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   The White House recently made a high-profile push for another
embattled nominee _ Bill Lann Lee, the administration's choice as
the Department of Justice's civil rights chief _ and is preparing
to do the same with Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, the vice president, and the secretary of state
continue to take every opportunity to push the leadership of the
Senate,'' said Clinton aide Richard Socarides. ``They will start to
do that more publicly when the Senate comes back'' from its recess
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel is the nation's first openly gay nominee for an
ambassadorship, a post that requires Senate confirmation. Although
he appears to have the support of a majority of senators, a handful
of Republicans have voiced objections to Hormel's long-standing
support for gay causes and used a procedural maneuver to prevent
the full Senate from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The clash could quickly grow into a high-profile showdown over
gay rights, reminiscent of former San Francisco Supervisor Roberta
Achtenberg's fight to win confirmation for a high-ranking post at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that I have not heard one good reason why he is
not qualified, I have to be very concerned that it is because of
blatant discrimination,'' Wellstone said Friday in an interview.
``I think what is happening is shameful.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said that once the Senate finishes its work on the
tobacco bill, he will introduce a series of amendments in the hopes
of forcing a vote on Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
who has refused to schedule a vote, offered a cool response.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sen. Wellstone wants to hold up appropriations bills that
provide for keeping the federal government open. ... that's
certainly his business,'' said Lott spokeswoman Susan Irby.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination
16 to 2 last fall. But opponents, encouraged in part by
representatives of the religious right, quickly emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a variety of reasons _ Hormel's generous financial
contributions to gay causes, his establishment of a gay and lesbian
learning center at the San Francisco library that bears his name,
and his refusal to denounce the Catholic-mocking ``Sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence'' _ Hormel's adversaries said his confirmation
would be an affront to the people of Luxembourg, who are 95 percent
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the Senate floor last month, Sen. James Inhofe,
R-Okla., one of at least four senators blocking the nomination,
read from a Chronicle article in which a gay leader called Hormel's
appointment a ``reward to gays and lesbians for their support'' of
Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to oppose the confirmation of individuals who
are nominated for various positions if I believe, in my own heart,
that that individual is not going to represent the best interests
of America and has his own personal agenda in advance of
Americans,'' said Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, heir to a meat-packing company fortune and a major
contributor to the Democratic Party, has the support of at least 44
Democrats and 14 Republicans _ easily enough to win confirmation _
according to aides to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein recently
presented with a letter signed by 41 of her colleagues calling for
a vote and has discussed the matter with him at least four times.

GOVERNOR'S RACE ENDS WITH TUB-THUMPING BARNSTORMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 and ROBERT B. GUNNISON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the frenzied closing hours of this year's gubernatorial
primary, four battling candidates delivered what has been largely
lacking in the 1998 TV-dominated campaign: color, excitement, talk
about issues and face-to-face appearances before thousands of real
live voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic front-runner Gray Davis was fired up and emotional
Sunday before a receptive congregation at the First African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles _ and talking like a
winner. A spirited Rep. Jane Harman, fueled by internal polls
suggesting she is gaining on Davis, barnstormed the state in a
six-seat airplane filled with powerful female backers, arguing for
``bold leadership'' on education, gun control and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Al Checchi finished up a statewide school bus tour _
seemingly oblivious to polls showing him in last place _ with a
push for the Latino vote, crooning ``Guantanamera'' to the strains
of a mariachi band in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state Attorney General Dan Lungren, all but unopposed
for the Republican nomination, was relaxed enough to joke about how
his campaign against Davis might go.
</P>
<P>
   As an estimated 6 million California voters prepare to go to the
polls Tuesday, the final weekend marked a clear departure from the
carefully crafted barrage of 30-second TV spots that have defined
the political season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the candidates at last let their guard down _ giving
voters a glimpse of the personalities and passion at the heart of
their quests.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were most dramatic in Los Angeles, where Davis
and Checchi nearly crossed paths at morning services at the First
African Methodist Episcopal Church, a powerhouse of social and
political activism.
</P>
<P>
   The church's pastor, the Rev. Cecil ``Chip'' Murray, had
endorsed both candidates _ and both delivered memorable campaign
moments at two different morning services.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, accused of blandness throughout his campaign,
abandoned &UR;  &LR; his usual restraint _ raising his arms with the choir on
the church dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise the Lord and thank the Lord for this great church, this
great ministry and your great pastor!'' said Davis before several
hundred worshipers at the 8 a.m. service.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Roman Catholic, took on an evangelical air, telling
churchgoers that his wife, Sharon, ``brought me back to the Lord a
few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a governor who will bring us together. We've had
enough of the division,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life in service to you. I went to Vietnam
30 years ago,'' he reminded them, adding that he also worked for
former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and former Governor Jerry
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe how you live your life counts on at least two
days,'' Davis said, ``Judgment Day and Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi, who polls show has left a sour taste in voters' mouths
with his $30 million spent on mostly negative TV advertising,
changed tactics. His campaign pulled harsh attack ads from some San
Francisco television stations, and in other areas of the state
substituted more homey spots, like one starring kids mispronouncing
his name.
</P>
<P>
   At the First AME, Checchi, also a Catholic, shared a prayer book
with hometown Congresswoman Maxine Waters _ whose autographed
8-by-10 glossy photo ``suitable for framing'' was mailed statewide
to voters with her endorsement of Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the cadence of a preacher, Checchi talked about the
state's $4 billion surplus as he delivered one of the most
passionate and effective speeches of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be a professional politician, but I'm not blind,''
he told churchgoers. ``We do not have a surplus of classrooms. We
do not have a surplus of teachers. We do not have a surplus of
educated children. I go to these communities, and the only thing I
see is a surplus of jails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a surplus of programs after school,'' Checchi told
them. ``I don't see a surplus of drug treatment programs. ... I
don't see a surplus of anything except wedges and meanness. And I'm
telling you, we can't have another 25 years like the last years.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, with state Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, he let
loose again, crooning with a mariachi band, holding babies, and
handing out copies of his 90-page ``Checchi Plan'' at El Mercado, a
favorite Latino marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Harman's weekend marathon by small plane was also full of spunk
and vigor _ clearly energized by what her campaign manager, Bill
Carrick, said were internal polls suggesting the candidate was
within 5 points' striking distance of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she barnstormed the state _ from Los Angeles and
Santa Barbara to San Jose, Sacramento, Oakland and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, she hammered on themes that studies show women care
most about _ gun control, health care reform, reproductive choice,
education, and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Harman abandoned her more cautious speaking style for outright
passion, repeating four questions at each stop: ``Who offers bold
leadership? Who will heal this state? Who has run a positive
campaign? And who can beat Dan Lungren?''
</P>
<P>
   The three-term congresswoman was upbeat as she crisscrossed the
state. At her side was Ellen Malcolm, the founder and president of
Emily's List, the influential Democratic pro-choice women's
political action committee. Joining them at various stops were
Congresswomen Zoe Lofgren and Anna Eshoo of San Jose, Lois Capps of
Santa Barbara and Juanita Millender-McDonald of Torrance. San Jose
Mayor Susan Hammer, retired Rep. Ron Dellums, and state Sen. Hilda
Solis of Los Angeles, also appeared along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want the limp of Davis, the lip of Checchi, or the
soup-warmed-over of Lungren,'' Millender-McDonald yelled to the
crowd at a Santa Barbara park. ``It's not just because she's a
woman, but I'm happy that she is.''
</P>
<P>
   In a community center of ``Sal Si Puedes,'' the San Jose Latino
heartland, Solis urged immigrant voters to support the candidate
whom she said could work with both political parties and yet had
 &LR; ``el corazon de una madre,''  &LR; the heart of a mother.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, Harman told supporters not to believe the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, no one thought I could win,'' Harman said. ``Most of
the likely voters are still undecided _ and undecided is not going
to beat Dan Lungren.''
</P>
<P>
   Harman's personal appeals clearly moved some off the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely with her,'' said Toni Wellen, co-chairwoman of
Santa Barbara Women Against Gun Violence, who watched Harman give a
strong anti-gun talk. ``Hearing her made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Sacramento, the candidate had a craving for ice cream and
stopped at Vic's, a local institution. The young woman behind the
counter dished her up a mocha swirl and said, ``I'm voting for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican Lungren took some time to joke about the
medical marijuana guru who is his ``main'' rival on Tuesday's
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to get past this guy from San Francisco, Dennis
Peron,'' Lungren told a GOP rally in Torrance. ``I confess, I did
indict him. But that was before he was a candidate and also before
he was a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren barnstormed across Los Angeles on Saturday, hinting
about his possible strategy against Davis. ``I thought I was going
to have to spend millions of dollars reminding people that he
worked for (former Democratic Governor) Jerry Brown and he brought
it up three times in the first debate,'' Lungren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have some fun out there.''

Bullish Jordan Has the Final Say  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan tried so hard not to call it a
``guarantee'' or a ``promise.'' Whatever term he wanted to use for
his prediction _ ``We're going to win Game 7,'' he had said two
nights earlier _ he backed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Not with one of his vintage scoring outbursts, but with alert
passing, timely rebounding and a complete handcuffing of his
nemesis and the Indiana Pacers' sometimes-hero, Reggie Miller.
Jordan did all that, and because he did, the gimping, geezing
Chicago Bulls are still defending their NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls on Sunday night won the seventh and deciding game of
the Eastern Conference finals 88-83, and finally moved on to play
the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals that open in Salt Lake City on
Wednesday. The Bulls, faced with playoff elimination for one of the
very few times since they began their string of titles in 1991,
needed every jumper, every loose ball, every defensive stop and
every whistle in their favor to hold off the Pacers before an
alternately tense and raucous United Center crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, they needed Jordan, who had only played in one
Game 7 during the championship years (in 1992, when the Bulls
defeated New York in the second round). He delivered with 28
points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and kept Miller scoreless
in the fourth quarter. Jordan shot &LR; ju  &LR; 9-for-25 from the floor and
10-for-15 from the line, but he also grabbed two crucial rebounds
in the final two minutes. The first was after Scottie Pippen missed
a free throw after a basket that gave the Bulls an 87-83 lead, and
the second came with 17 seconds left and the score the same, after
the Pacers' Derrick McKey missed a desperate 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jordan did not have to eat his words, spoken Friday night
after his stumble while driving for a potential game-tying basket
sealed the Pacers' Game 6 win in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think positive. You can't come into a game and put
yourself into a position where you're going to have negative
thoughts,'' Jordan said afterward. ``That's why I had to say, as a
leader, that we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Bulls lost, their quest for a sixth championship, and a
third in a row, would have ended. So, most likely, would Jordan's
career, as well as the tenures of Pippen, Dennis Rodman and coach
Phil Jackson, in the management-mandated breakup that has been
hinted at all season. But, Jordan said, ``At no point in time,
during the course of the 48 minutes, did I think negatively . . . I
never thought anything negative about what we could accomplish as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates chipped in just enough. Toni Kukoc made up for his
serious defensive deficiencies by scoring 21 points, 14 in the
third quarter. Steve Kerr knocked down three 3-pointers, two in the
second quarter, to help the Bulls overcome the Pacers' early 20-7
lead. Pippen shot 6-for-18 but grabbed 12 rebounds and hit two huge
baskets in the fourth to finish with 17 points. Even with Dennis
Rodman limited by fouls to six rebounds, the Bulls crushed the
Pacers on the glass 50-34, 22-4 on the offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 22 points through three quarters were not nearly
enough, and his teammates didn't make up the difference. Travis
Best, one of Game 6's heroes, was invisible with four points and
one assist. Dale Davis missed seven of 10 free throws. Rik Smits
played only 28 minutes because of foul trouble and managed just 13
points. Unlike Game 6, McKey was unable to contain Jordan down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing finish for the Pacers, who lost a seventh
game of the East finals on the road for the third time in five
years. ``It's pretty bad in there,'' said Mark Jackson, nodding
toward the locker room. ``We knew we were the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sloppy game on both sides: the two teams combined to
miss 33 of 78 free throws, and the Bulls' 38 percent shooting was
negated by the Pacers' 13 turnovers, five in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made the difference, in a performance so complete, it
reminded Pacers coach Larry Bird of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's the best player in the league, and why he's
probably the best player ever,'' said a downcast Bird, who came up
one win short of leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals in
his first year as a coach. ``If I was having a bad shooting day (as
a player), I always tried to pass and I always tried to rebound.
And Michael's the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Bulls getting a little bit from everybody, the
Pacers still led 72-69 with 8:54 to go, and they were up 79-77 with
5:47 to go. But they managed only one basket the rest of the way,
and in one gruesome stretch of four possessions they turned the
ball over three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get the effort but we got beat to a lot of loose balls,
a lot of rebounds slipped out of our hands _ a lot of little things
beat us,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the little things were provided by Jordan, the biggest
star on the court. Because of that, Phil Jackson pointed out,
``We've got another series, a new life.''

2 AUSSIES LOCK UP ALCATRAZ VICTORIES 
BY DAN GIESIN
</HEADLINE>
 TRIATHLON-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was something old, something new Sunday at
the Escape From Alcatraz triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCormack, a rookie Escapee, held off fellow Australian
Greg Welch to win the swim-bike-run competition in 1 hour, 59
minutes, 56 seconds, just six seconds in front of the defending
champion. Meanwhile, Michellie Jones, another Aussie, took control
of the women's competition on the eight-mile run leg and coasted to
her second straight Alcatraz victory with a 2:12:55 clocking,
nearly a minute and a half ahead of runner-up Barb Linquist of
Wilson, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack's and Jones' victories were in the come-from-behind
category, and it was the opening swim phase, a 1.5-mile trudge
through the waters of San Francisco Bay, that separated the two
from the other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a hard swim,'' said McCormack, a 25-year-old from the
Sydney area who has been competing in triathlons for four years.
``I didn't know where I was. I got lost, and I didn't know where to
go. I was really annoyed. I spent the whole swim alone.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCormack finally emerged from the Bay, he was in sixth
place, nearly a half-minute behind Welch, who led the record field
of 759 competitors into the 18-mile bike leg. But McCormack put the
hammer down, and finally caught Welch and co-leader Wes Hobson of
Boulder, Colo., a couple of miles from the end of the leg. The
three men were stride-for-stride heading out for the deciding run
from the Marina Green to Baker Beach and back.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who had overtaken Welch during the bike phase and
actually had a small lead before being reeled in, was the first to
drop off the pace during the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two miles into it, Greg put on a small surge and Chris
went with him. I didn't,'' said Hobson, who faded to fifth place
overall, 3:22 behind McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, whom two-time champion Mike Pigg once referred to as ``a
thoroughbred on the run,'' then tried to ditch McCormack, but the
younger Aussie wouldn't have it and the two headed into the final
200 meters dead even. But McCormack took an inside track around the
final corner, and Welch found himself at a disadvantage and,
ultimately, out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up the pace at Crissy Field, and I thought I would be
better off,'' said Welch, who also won this event in 1992. ``But he
kept with me, and when we came into that turn I was out of
position. I didn't try to catch him, because I knew I was going to
come in second anyway. No use busting a gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones didn't have to bust a gut, she had to work to
overcome Linquist's huge early lead, which was nearly two minutes
at the end of the swim leg and 1:45 before the run. But in a
situation that nearly duplicated the 1997 event, Jones grabbed the
lead at the four-mile mark of the run and coasted to her second
straight Alcatraz win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barb definitely has a weak leg and that's the run,'' Jones
said, seemingly oblivious to the pun. ``I knew I just had to be
patient until I took over. And I caught her at exactly the same
spot as last year. I was just like deja vu.''
</P>
<P>
   Linquist, a former All-America swimmer at Stanford, once again
put her finely honed swimming ability to good use, coming out of
the water 34 seconds behind Welch. She maintained her advantage
over Jones through the bike leg, but it didn't come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier for me to have a carrot out in front,''
Linquist said. ``Every spot that I could have eased up ... I had to
tell myself to keep pushing. I had to tell myself that every five
seconds counts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, perhaps the best all-round female triathlete, gobbled
up those precious seconds on the run, and when the inevitable
happened, all Linquist could utter was a good-natured ``oh nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hold her off longer than last year,'' Linquist
said. ``Because I knew that unless something bad happened, I wasn't
going to catch her. Her strength is she doesn't have any
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; NOTES:  &LR; The choppy waters of Bay played havoc with two race
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Pigg, who won 79 of the 141 races he entered from 1987-1996,
suffered through the opening phase, coming out of the water 2:06
behind Welch and about 20 racers down. ``I took some time off when
my twins were born (last December), and I haven't got the miles in.
I was playing catch-up all day,'' said Pigg, who finished in
seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Sian Welch, Greg's wife, said the cold water affected her feet,
which in turn affected her bike leg and part of the run. ``I had
problems getting my feet warm,'' said Welch, who finish sixth, more
than seven minutes behind Jones. ``I was a little sluggish until
four miles into the run.''
</P>
<P>
   The top amateur finishers were a couple of Bay Area folks: Peter
Kain of Half Moon Bay was 10th overall, while San Francisco's
Michelle Deasy was eighth among the women. . . . Highlights of
Sunday's event will be televised in a one-hour special on June 28
at 3 p.m. on Channel 7.

BENDER DIED OF SEIZURE, FAMILY SAYS 
BY RON KROICHICK
</HEADLINE>
 BENDER-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ An empty, wrenching feeling revisited the
Raiders this weekend, after the sudden and unexpected death of
rookie defensive tackle Leon Bender.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine years ago, in the summer of 1989, safety Stacey
Toran died in a car accident. Now owner Al Davis and his team mourn
the loss of Bender, the victim of an apparent seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al was devastated, like everyone is,'' club executive Bruce
Allen said Sunday. ``He had such high hopes for Leon. . . . He
(Davis) just wants to make sure everyone sticks together and helps
the family as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender, 22, was found dead Saturday in Marietta, Ga. He
collapsed in the home of Terry Bolar, an associate of Bender's
agent, Eugene Parker. Bolar discovered Bender's body in the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Bender's family and Parker _ in a statement issued after
Sunday's preliminary autopsy _ said Bender died ``from
complications resulting from a seizure.'' He had had an epileptic
condition since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said, ``Although the final and conclusive
report will not be available for two weeks, the coroner at this
time has ruled out foul play, drugs or alcohol as factors in his
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County (Ga.) police said autopsy results were inconclusive.
According to a recorded message left by police spokesman Robert
Quigley, ``no foul play is suspected'' in Bender's death.
</P>
<P>
   Bender took regular medication to control his epilepsy, in part
at the urging of his wife, Liza. Bender spent the past two weeks of
his life away from Liza, working out with a personal trainer near
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Cobb County medical examiner's office said
there was no indication that medication contributed to Bender's
death. More test results will become available later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Raiders were aware of Bender's medical condition
when they selected him in the second round of the NFL draft on
April 18. Bender had at least one seizure during his days at
Santana High School, near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had not been a problem at all during most of his college
career,'' Allen said. ``With the proper medication, it appeared to
be under control. Everyone on our medical staff was confident of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender was eager to join the Raiders. He signed a five-year,
$3.45 million contract on May 12; the deal included a $1.2 million
signing bonus. Bender was paid the bonus before his death.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bender was a large (6-foot-5, 320 pounds) and
gentle man. Janay Leddy, the graduate assistant in Washington
State's sports information office, referred to Bender's
``infectious'' smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you looked him in the eye, he had a sparkle,'' Allen
said. ``They were happy eyes. He didn't mind smiling or laughing
out loud. His enthusiasm was very contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender's demeanor was evident April 23, at the Raiders' practice
facility in Alameda. That day, the team formally introduced its top
four draft choices to the local media.
</P>
<P>
   Bender sat at a table alongside fullback Jon Ritchie, offensive
tackle Mo Collins and cornerback Charles Woodson. Most questions
sailed toward Woodson, last year's Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when someone addressed Bender, he took a playful dig at
Woodson. Bender sarcastically referred to the referees prematurely
walking off the field in the Rose Bowl game, as his WSU team staged
a belated comeback against Woodson and Michigan. Woodson laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Bender wore a wide smile throughout the press conference on that
day, barely more than five weeks ago. He seemed almost giddy,
clearly excited about his impending career playing professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly and suddenly, Bender's career ended before it ever
started.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Emanuel
Baptist Church in Pullman, Wash. Funeral arrangements in San Diego
are pending.

A'S BLOW ANOTHER ONE IN K.C. 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ One of the sarcastic young ciphers on
``SportsCenter'' cracked the other night: ``Convicted felons should
be forced to watch the Royals and the A's.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the obvious question: Did someone send ESPN an
advance tape of the Royals' 10-4 win over the A's Sunday at
Kauffman Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The A's bullpen fell apart again, this time taking the brunt of
an eight-hit, seven-run outburst in the seventh inning that turned
a perfectly tidy game into something more like a toxic waste dump.
Since last Sunday, the A's bullpen has a hideous 7.80 ERA and that
doesn't begin to convey the horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is getting down,'' left-hander Buddy
Groom insisted. ``We showed earlier in the month we can put some
scoreless innings together. So I don't think there's any reason to
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure thing, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of culprits, but T.J. Mathews (3-4) was the man
who earned the loss. And boy did he ever earn it. All with just
four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Kenny Rogers never looked quite in sync and gave up a
single and a run-scoring double to start the seventh, trimming the
A's lead to 4-3. Mathews came on in relief and just needed to throw
a pitch over the plate so No. 9 hitter Shane Halter could bunt.
</P>
<P>
   This Mathews failed to do. He missed four times in a row, and
faster than you can say ``Light a match,'' Halter was down at first
and Mathews was out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to throw a strike right there,'' Mathews said.
``Everybody knows it. He's bunting. . . . I think it had been seven
or eight days since I threw in a game. It's tough in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much set the tone. Champion teams like to talk about
how good teams make their own good luck. Less often discussed is
the way bad teams make their own bad luck. If it's not a question
of offending the baseball gods, it's something awfully close.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible inning would have been merely bad if Johnny Damon
had not gotten in the way of Ryan Christenson's throw from center
as he was sliding into third base, trying to advance on Jose
Offerman's single up the middle. That play, charged as
Christenson's first major-league error, cost the A's a run and
enabled Damon to score to make it 5-4 Royals. They never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a break when the kid kicked the ball away,'' A's
manager Art Howe said. ``The inning snowballed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy was, up until the seventh the game looked like a
blueprint for a new and different A's team that would not have to
make any apologies. Shortstop Miguel Tejada has played just two
games for the A's since being called up from Double-A Huntsville
and already it seems hard to imagine anyone else being out there.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada, sleek and edgy, started a double play to end the first
inning without Offerman scoring, despite a one-out triple, and
Tejada started another double play in the fifth. Both were plays
only a good shortstop makes. Tejada also reached out and poked a
high Tim Belcher pitch to right for a ground-rule double that
scored two runs and put the A's up 4-1 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was helmet-high,'' A's designated hitter Matt Stairs said
of the pitch to Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chest high,'' Tejada insisted. ``I saw it like it was
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Christenson also made a great play in center to snag Mike
Sweeney's drive to the wall in the fourth inning, saving at least
two runs. That's just how Christenson plays, all-out, but having
both him and Tejada up the middle gives the A's a whole different
look. Tejada went 2-for-3 and hit both balls hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he even hit the pitch he hit for a double,''
Howe chuckled. ``He turned some nice double plays. He's got a lot
of energy out there. He's off to a great start with us.''

GIANTS MAKE MAY A WINNER 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ June has arrived with a schedule full of land
mines for the Giants. They have three more games at St. Louis,
where Mark McGwire plays even bigger than his frame. They have
seven meetings against the first-place San Diego Padres, and four
interleague games against the A's, who always find a way to give
them a searing pain behind the temples.
</P>
<P>
   The best thought the Giants can carry into battle this month is
the knowledge that they just completed a 19-11 May despite some
visible chinks in their armor.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days they have put on a Monty Python clinic on
how not to run the bases. First baseman J.T. Snow and right fielder
Stan Javier still haven't found their strokes, and catcher Brian
Johnson is just beginning to rediscover his, as he showed with two
solo homers in Sunday's 7-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   If the question is whether the the 33-24 Giants are playing as
well as they can, manager Dusty Baker would answer with an emphatic
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind we're not on a great run yet,'' he said. ``We're on
a good run, but we could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Baker said when the Giants finished April
14-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along we were better than how we were playing. It
was just a matter of time before we got some timely hits. As long
as our pitching staff stays intact and we keep away from injuries,
the sky's the limit as far as how high we can go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a complete return to 1997 form by Shawn Estes, it's
hard to imagine the pitching staff being any better than it was in
May. While Orel Hershiser deservedly got most of the ink for his
5-0 record and 0.67 ERA, left-hander Kirk Rueter has won four of
his past five starts to sneak into a tie for the National League
lead in victories with seven.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a six-hitter and allowed one run over seven innings
against the Diamondbacks on Sunday. In his typical praise-others
style, Rueter (7-3) insisted it meant little to him sharing the NL
victory lead with Pittsburgh's Jason Schmidt, Houston's Mike
Hampton and the Atlanta quartet of Tom Glavine, Kevin Millwood,
Greg Maddux and Denny Neagle, who failed to earn his eighth win
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at that,'' Rueter said. ``So much goes into
getting a win that's out of my control. The last time, Bill Mueller
hit a three-run homer to put us ahead in the seventh. Today B.J.
gets two home runs to put us ahead when I was losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing on our tour of the May honor roll, closer Robb Nen
started the month with four saves and finished with 14, leaving him
one short of the league lead held by Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw and San
Diego's Trevor Hoffman. Although Nen allowed 10 hits during May, he
struck out 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the best performance in May belonged to Barry Bonds: a .373
average, eight doubles and nine homers among his 37 hits and 30
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bonds was no factor Sunday as the Giants finished the month
with their third straight win against Arizona after the D-backs
took the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson led off the third with a homer that tied the game 1-1,
then opened the fifth with a much longer blow that put the Giants
ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   They added three runs in the fifth off Jeff Suppan on singles by
Jeff Kent and Javier, an encouraging RBI double from Snow and a
two-run bloop single by Rich Aurilia. They also scored twice in the
eighth on a two-error play for a 7-1 lead, which became a 7-4 final
when Arizona scored three runs off Julian Tavarez in the ninth with
the aid of two bad-hop hits.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is on one of his home-run jags, with five in his past
five games. He was struggling at .193 when he went on the disabled
list May 8 with a fractured hand. Since his return on May 21 he has
hit .323.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may have benefited from the mental break as much as his
physical recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard on the DL,'' he said. ``It was a terrible time
for me. I really wasn't happy with the way I started, compounded
with getting hurt. The team was playing well and I felt left out. I
loafed around a little bit when I was home, but it was a good
learning experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   May in turn was a good learning experience for the team, which
now knows, if there was any doubt before, that it belongs in what
promises to be a tough division race.

LEAVE YOUR REGRETS IN MILWAUKEE AND HEAD FOR SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not looking for your sympathy when I reveal that several
times in my life I have found myself in Milwaukee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is an occupational hazard for journalists. Keep at this
oddness long enough and eventually you find yourself in Milwaukee.
And sooner or later you will regret something about Milwaukee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best time I ever had in Milwaukee was in 1976 when I
was trailing around the late Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who was running
for president again with no hope of winning but with too many good
ideas to go to bed at night without having shared them with
somebody who could vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were in the kitchen of someone's Milwaukee house for a
fund-raiser, and McCarthy was regaling the crowd with spectacularly
funny baseball stories from back when he played in the Sioux League
or some such in Minnesota or wherever. As you can tell, details of
McCarthy's baseball stories have become far too sketchy for me to
recount here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, by the way, that spending campaign time
entertaining people in Milwaukee kitchens with hilarious baseball
stories is no way to get to the White House. Remember that if you
long to be the most powerful human being in the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My regret about Milwaukee, however, has nothing to do with 1976.
Rather, it has to do with 1998. That's because I failed to be in
Milwaukee recently for the International Space Development
conference at which former astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin spoke
about space tourism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark this down: Space tourism is an idea whose time will come,
and Buzz Aldrin's promotion of the idea will be seen one day as the
turning point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Space tourism: Houston, we have an idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my message to the astronauts,'' Aldrin said. ``If they
want to go to the moon or Mars, they better get behind (space)
tourism.'' It's the only way, he said, to create ``a great
consensus of people'' behind the nation's space program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am almost immediately attached emotionally to the idea of
vacationers taking off in rocket ships. For one thing, imagine the
cool message you could leave on your answering machine: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. This is Bill. I can't come to the phone right now because
I'm traveling at 22,000 miles an hour on a spacecraft toward the
planet Tralfamador in the X220PU Galaxy. Leave a message at the
beep. Remember to tell me what year you called.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tell me you wouldn't love to be able to greet callers with that
message. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, of course, there will be limited space (what irony,
eh?) available at first for space tourists. At least until
Southwest Airlines, say, buys NASA and starts selling $79 tickets
to Pluto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin's answer the the space problem is to create a lottery
system that would pick who gets to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, that might work, but if it were up to me I think I'd
decide on the basis of an essay contest. I don't mean that people
would write the essays saying why they want to go. Rather, I'd have
others write essays telling why they wanted to get rid of someone
by sending him or her into space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In essence, we'd be searching for the country's most annoying
people and then unloading them into the cosmos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder why I was imagining my own answering machine
message if the idea is to find the most annoying people. Surely,
you're thinking, I don't count myself among the most annoying. No,
but if I continue to devote the first third of my columns on
something else to Milwaukee, you may. &QL;

 &HT;    Albino raccoon saves his skin
 &HT;    By Africa Ragland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENACRES, Fla. _ It's not easy being different _ just ask Al,
the 2-year-old albino raccoon. His blonde hair and light-colored
eyes probably made him a little easier to spot than his dark-haired
relatives, and trapper Ed Frederick caught him at the Falls Country
Club here recently.
</P>
<P>
   But being different and kind of cute may have saved Al, because
instead of ending the raccoon's life, Frederick will donate him to
the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've come across, we've never seen anything like
it,'' said Frederick, who has operated Animal Trapping Unlimited
for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coughlin, a wildlife biologist with the Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission, said true and partial albinos are
genetically different and are rare in animals, just as they are in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most often what you'll see is a partial albino, which is still
rare,'' he said. ``Most albinos are not very healthy animals that
don't live much past birth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Al is full grown, with the teeth and somewhat wary
disposition to prove it. The raccoon has gotten used to his cage,
Frederick said, but still hisses and grunts a little when people
get too close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done OK out there on it's own, and we'd love to see the
animal returned to the wild, but we have to abide by state rules,''
said Busch director David Hitzig, noting that state law does not
allow trappers to catch a raccoon and release it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Busch is building a new facility in Jupiter and will provide a
habitat for the raccoon. Until the new center is finished, Hitzig
will find temporary digs for Al.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give it a home,'' Hitzig said.

 &HT;    CIGNA to defend coverage decision in court after woman's death
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ In 1995, Patty Branham was told her colon
cancer had spread to her liver. Her doctors said the only treatment
that would keep her alive was a surgery that would destroy tumors
by freezing them.
</P>
<P>
   But the 35-year-old woman never got the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Branham's managed-care health plan, CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio,
refused to pay for the surgery, saying it was too ``experimental
and investigational.'' It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision
and another month to review Branham's appeal, which CIGNA rejected,
even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Branham's tumors, meanwhile, doubled in size. And four months
after her initial request for coverage _ while still battling the
insurance company _ she died.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham's husband,
Craig, has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause
requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore
non-binding.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Paul Pfeifer, who wrote the court's majority opinion,
said her ordeal is the very scenario that frightens so many
Americans, who worry about whether their coverage will be enough to
see them through a time of real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a terribly sick person is denied treatment, there is a
breakdown in the process that ought to concern us all,'' Pfeifer
said. The country ``seems to be taking a step backward in the way
we make treatments and cures available to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Drescher, a CIGNA spokesman, declined to comment on the
case, saying only that it ``in no way reflects the philosophy or
standard operating procedures at CIGNA.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Ohio legislators _ as well as officials in New York,
California, Texas, Florida and North Carolina _ agree with Pfeifer.
They are pushing to change state laws to give patients more
leverage when dealing with managed-care health plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio alone, three bills have been introduced that would,
among other things, allow patients who have been denied necessary
care the right to sue their managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say such legislation will make insurers afraid to turn
down requests for unnecessary tests or treatment, driving up costs
and forcing employers to choose plans that offer fewer benefits.
That would defeat the purpose of managed-care systems, which were
set up in response to escalating health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The right to sue ``may actually reduce access to affordable
health care coverage,'' said Mary Yost, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohio Rep. Jeff Jacobson (R-Phillipsburg), who is sponsoring
one of the bills, said patients like Patty Branham need more
protection than current law provides.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in managed-care plans in Ohio has jumped
from 1.7 million to 4.2 million in the last four years. Those
people are paying for insurance and it ought to be there when they
need it, Jacobson said. And if it isn't, he said, they ought to be
able to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen any issue that provokes as much unanimous
outrage as the idea that health insurance companies are turning
down people's needed and covered medical care just to save a few
dollars,'' Jacobson said. ``The mere fact that they could get sued
for making bad medical decisions will maybe stop them from making
those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said the provisions in many HMO contracts that require
disputes to be settled in arbitration instead of court are unfair,
especially if they require a lengthy process which is difficult for
sick patients to work through. His bill would void such clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's bill also would allow patients who've been denied
coverage to appeal the denial to an independent group of medical
experts chosen by a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the same people who had a financial stake the first
time coverage was denied get to decide whether to overrule
themselves,'' Jacobson said. ``There is something wrong with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Rep. Don Mottley (R-West Carrollton), supports Jacobson's
bill and said that in order for health care plans to work for
patients, states must create laws holding HMOs more responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the insurers have an incentive to say no to expensive
treatment because they know they aren't held to the same standard
of accountability as doctors,'' Mottley said. ``Right now, the
incentives are all in the direction of denying care, when it should
be the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Maglione, director of legislative affairs for the Ohio
Medical Association, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a doctor makes a mistake, a doctor will be held accountable
either through the state medical board or civil justice system. If
an HMO errs, it should be accountable as well.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials in Ohio and around the country say HMO reform is
wildly popular, HMO organizations and business groups issue dire
warnings if one of the civil-liability bills becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation comes down to the bottom line for employers,
said Denise Wible, spokeswoman for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.
``Insurers are not going to eat that cost (of increased liability).
Who gets socked with it? It's the employer and ultimately the
employee that pays the price.''
</P>
<P>
   She said employers are also worried about their own liability
under the proposed bills. Language to exempt employers from being
sued for choosing a particular insurance company is too vague, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts will end up making the decisions and, frankly, courts
are not traditionally friendly to business in cases like this,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wible said lawmakers are losing sight of the positive care
health maintenance organizations provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've all heard the stories about problems with HMOs _
and they are extremely painful to listen to _ a lot of folks out
there have had wonderful experiences,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbons, director of government relations for the
Cleveland-based Medical Mutual of Ohio, said an Ohio law that
becomes effective in November already tightens standards for HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The new law requires health plans to respond to claims involving
life-threatening illnesses in three business days and gives
insurers just four business days to make referrals to specialists.
The law also sets up specific standards that HMOs must follow in
reviewing cases.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons predicted that going beyond those provisions and making
HMOs civilly liable for not following careful procedures will cause
them to practice ``defensive medicine.'' Just as fear of lawsuits
encourages doctors to order unnecessary tests and other treatments,
so will HMOs, Gibbons said. ``Then the hue and cry will start over
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson is skeptical of those claims. He said insurance
premiums are based on the company's knowledge that it must pay for
a certain number of surgeries and other treatments each year.
Services they decline to pay for can end up as extra profit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say insurance costs will go up if we do this,'' Jacobson
said. ``Well, the fact is, costs will go up no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Merry, a Columbus attorney representing Craig Branham, said
his law firm has a growing number of clients who want to challenge
HMO decisions. People are getting fed up with the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody either has experienced or knows somebody who has
experienced problems with HMOs and managed care,'' Merry said.
``These HMOs make a lot of money. They are making executives very,
very rich and shareholders very, very wealthy by making a lot of
decisions about health care based on cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry said Patty Branham's surgery would have cost $80,000 to
$100,000, and laws should force insurers, when looking at such high
costs, to consider whether it would be more expensive to deny
coverage or to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of clients who find themselves having to devote
as much time fighting the insurance company as they do fighting
their illnesses, and that's a tragedy,'' Merry said. ``Insurance
companies are not in the business of controlling health costs, they
are in the business of making money. So the only way to motivate an
HMO to give people the care they need is to give them the threat of
getting hit with a huge verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an argument Merry will no doubt make during Craig
Branham's trial against CIGNA, which is expected to start next
month in Ross County, Ohio. Branham, a 29-year-old prison guard,
hopes the trial makes insurance companies think twice the next time
they deny critical care.
</P>
<P>
   He said his wife realized her cancer could always come back, but
her tumors had begun to shrink and she had high hopes the surgery
would destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair that an HMO has the last word on a decision
about coverage, especially when you're talking about surgery in a
life-threatening situation,'' Branham said. ``To me, it was cruel,
what they did to my wife. I just hope some good comes out of it.''

 &HT;    Web offers alluring sites for fishing enthusiasts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your next fishing partner may have a 17-inch screen
and a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers
and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a much better job
of representing the non-technical side of life. Take fishing, for
instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer
fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about the hottest
lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing
Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html. Because this is a
national site, you start by clicking on the section of the country
where you live. Besides offering fishing tips for that section of
the country, you'll find some links that would be helpful to most
fishermen, including ways to get local weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Another good general interest site is called The World of
Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/. Some of the news stories
and information here seems to be aimed at the professional bass
fishermen and those who follow the action at bass tournaments. But
there are also sections that offer listings of fishing guides and
others that take you to classified ads for used fishing equipment.
There also are links to the sites of several manufacturers of
fishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful part of this site is the section that offers
forums on various types of fishing and fishing-related information.
You'll be able to use these forums to discuss subjects such as
lures, outboard motors and fishing spots with other anglers. And if
there is anything fishermen like as well as fishing, it's talking
about fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing can almost seem like a separate sport. Avid
fly-fishermen often look down their noses at those who merely drown
worms. And learning to fly-fish is a lot more difficult, too. But
the rewards are enormous for those who enjoy it. The art of making
a delicate cast to just the right place is almost as much fun as
catching a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is famous for some great fly-fishing rivers including the
Rogue, McKenzie, Smith and Umpqua. So an Oregon-based site called
the McKenzie Page is a terrific place to go. You'll find it at
http://zebu.uoregon.edu/cgi-bin2/Mckenzie/Mckfrontend.pl. A lot of
the information is specific to Oregon rivers, but you'll also find
some general information, including some great photography of
flies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's final site _ Flyfishing.com at http://www.flyfishing.com
_ is much more general in nature and has lots of instructional
material for beginners and seasoned fly-fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   One especially good feature of the site is the database of
information about various flies. Even veteran fly-fishermen will
enjoy looking through the many attempts to create a lure that looks
just right to a trout.

 &HT;    Mac Report: Software makers hold key to Macintosh's fate
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing
software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who will make
or break this computer.
</P>
<P>
   With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will
thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one
wants to write software for the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't there is no software for the Mac. Apple
Computer counts some 12,000 existing titles. Yet this number is
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It says nothing about the vibrancy of the market, how many
titles are new, how many are regularly improved. Software grows old
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies the problem. Two years ago, 70 percent of all
developers wrote either original Mac titles or Mac versions of
Windows software. Today, that number has dwindled to 20 percent.
That means a lot of those 12,000 titles are getting long in the
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant, continually renewing roster of software titles is
especially important in the home market. Its growth has been driven
by exciting new computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, most game developers are not writing for the Mac _ sadly,
for good reason. It's very difficult to sell Mac titles.
</P>
<P>
   Take id Software, developer of the popular shoot-'em-up game
``Quake.'' It did a Mac version of the original game but sold only
50,000 copies. Not surprisingly, it didn't bother with a Mac
version of ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month I take a look at the number of Mac titles sold,
and it is not good,'' says Luc Barthelet, general manager of game
maker Maxis. ``Sales are still declining month to month.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Barthelet has not decided yet whether Maxis
will release a Mac version of its upgrade to ``SimCity,'' scheduled
for release next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis is not alone. Scores of developers never even bother with
a Mac version of their games. And many of those who do wait a year
or more before releasing Mac versions.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mac users rarely can play the hottest games on the
market. They're second-class citizens in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that must be solved. Apple Computer thinks the
key is its sizable presence in schools. It's nice that Apple
Computer continues to be the largest supplier to the educational
market, but this means little to kids.
</P>
<P>
   What they want at home is not the same computer as in school but
one that plays the most and the newest hot games. Unfortunately,
Macs are a distant second in this contest.

 &HT;    Poverty, isolation sparking wildfires
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico _ There are no fire hydrants in this village
on the edge of the rainforest. There are also no telephones and no
electricity. Miles of twisting, unpaved mountain roads separate the
town from the nearest city.
</P>
<P>
   If the 55 families who live here lose control of the annual
fires they light to burn away the stubble of last year's crop, they
have no way to quickly notify anyone. They are largely on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tiny communities like this are scattered across the
state of Chiapas, places where families grow maize and coffee and
graze cattle on steep hillsides, using ancient slash-and-burn
methods to prepare the soil for planting or to coax grasses out of
the ground. The vast majority of the people have neither tractors
nor plows to till the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children walk along the dirt roads, carrying bundles
of firewood on their backs supported by straps stretched across
their foreheads. In the mountains around them, plumes of white
smoke rise lazily in the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cerapio Hernandez Heleria usually would have burned his plots of
land by now. But the continuing drought, plus the fear of losing
control of the flames and starting an enormous fire like the one
now burning in the nearby El Ocote wilderness preserve, keeps
Hernandez uncomfortably idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody in this area is burning,'' Hernandez, 48, said
as young turkeys pecked at the dirt at his feet. ``We're waiting
for it to rain. There's been too many fires already.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackened fields dotting the mountains on the eastern edge
of the rain forest show that few communities are following
Cuauhtemoc in its self-imposed burning ban. On Sunday, men and boys
could be seen on steep hillside fields, hacking at weeds and brush
with machetes as they prepared to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The government has blamed the farmers and ranchers for starting
the fires, which have scorched thousands of acres of sensitive rain
forest in the Chimalapas region west of here and have contributed
to the choking smoke that fills the valleys of Chiapas and has
blown north to Texas and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But government environmental officials also have said they
realize there is no way to stop agricultural burning, and until
this year, there has been little incentive to try. The rains have
always been dependable before, keeping the jungle wet and fireproof
and stopping any wayward field fires before they spread too far.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the rains haven't come. The countryside, even the
rainforest, dried out, and the winds gusted. When the fields began
burning, the fires jumped the narrow strips of bare earth that
farmers typically clear around their land. And there was no way to
stop the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia Murillo, an official with Mexico's environmental
and wildlife department who is helping to coordinate the
firefighting effort in western Chiapas, said poverty is the true
cause of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The growing population is stretching the land's capacity, Garcia
said. Farmland in the valleys is becoming less productive with more
intensive use, he said, and more farmers and ranchers are
encroaching on the rain forest, looking for better land.
</P>
<P>
   When agricultural fires jump out of the fields and into the
forest, often the farmers and ranchers don't alert the government,
Garcia said. That's not surprising in Chiapas, where many people
have a deep mistrust of the government and where the Zapatista
rebels staged a revolt in January 1994, decrying what they said was
long-standing mistreatment by the government and the state's large
landholders.
</P>
<P>
   But as it faces the worst fires in its history, the government
has relied heavily on the people in the surrounding communities to
help fight them. Together with soldiers who have been ordered to
remote outposts in the mountains, the villagers form the backbone
of the untrained firefighting force.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he joined about 45 of his neighbors in Cauhtemoc
when the government asked for help fighting the flames in El Ocote
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered food and water, nothing else,'' he said. ``After
we finished working, we got on our horses and went out using
machetes and rakes to clear away the dry layer of vegetation on the
jungle floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in another small village, Elias Martinez said
people have been careful when they burn, but the unusual conditions
have made runaway fires inevitable. He's a little annoyed that the
government says agricultural burning started the fires. How do they
know it wasn't a carelessly tossed cigarette?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to start fires,'' said Martinez, who runs a small
ranch. ``The wind and the dryness _ they are things that can't be
controlled. It's too bad that things are burning, but there's no
other way to prepare the land. Once we get some rain, everything
will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mountains glow around them at night from fires that have
yet to be contained, Martinez and others who live off the thin,
rocky soil are more concerned about how they will survive if the
skies don't bring relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't plant yet. The ground is too hard,'' said Alejandro
de la Cruz, who grows maize and coffee in Rancho Carrizal, a small
community of 32 people. ``When it starts to rain, we start to
plant. If it doesn't rain, we don't eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the fires are a sign of the end of the
world,'' he added. ``I think so, too.''

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Let someone else clean the smudges off Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. My guess is that the
publicity about the company's problems with the Justice Department
will end up hyping sales.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most home users will figure a program that attracts
so many headlines must be danged important. So my job today is to
be a real TechnoBuddy and urge you not to rush to buy Windows
during the first month or so.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing at all to do with the merits of Windows 98.
Sooner or later, you'll upgrade. But there are compelling reasons
to wait out the initial rush to install the newest version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can expect the technical support telephone lines at
both Microsoft and even at retailers will be jammed with calls for
help during the first few weeks Windows 98 is available.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a new operating system is like dumping two jigsaw
puzzles into one box and then trying to separate them. There are
literally thousands of chances for conflicts with installed
programs and hardware devices. You can bet lots of folks will be on
the phone in the days after Windows 98 is available trying to put
the pieces of the puzzle back together.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait a month or so, the initial rush should calm down and
you'll have a better chance of getting help by telephone. Remember
that _ worst case _ you can put your computer out of commission
when you install any new operating system. So unless you're
prepared to get sore ears while you're on hold waiting for help,
then don't join the initial rush.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while all companies _ including Microsoft _ do the best
they can to test new software for bugs, there will be some
unpleasant surprises when undiscovered flaws are discovered. All
new programs have enough bugs to populate a good-sized rotten log.
The beta testing program catches some of them, but when Windows 98
gets on the market, many more will be discovered. Let your friends
and neighbors find them, let Microsoft correct them, and then buy
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me make a safe assumption. Plenty of you are going to
ignore this advice. Heck, if the tables were turned, I might do
that, too. Some of us can't help getting caught up in the
excitement of trying something new that we've heard a lot about.
</P>
<P>
   So let's talk about some of the ways to protect yourself if you
do install Windows 98 in the first mad rush.
</P>
<P>
   The most important safeguard is to make a complete backup of
your hard disk. That way _ worst case _ you'll be able to put your
computer back the way it was before the installation. Windows 98
has an uninstall option that, in theory, will do the same thing.
But be safe and make a backup yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Also, follow the on-screen advice you'll get while you're
installing Windows 98 and take the options to make a recovery disk
as well as asking your computer to make a backup copy of your old
system files. Both of these steps can help you undo any problems
caused by the installation.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Follow my advice to wait a while if you can. And if you
insist on walking the high-tech tightrope, at least use a safety
net.

 &HT;    Tech Report: 200 CDs, accessible by a touch
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of
compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop
it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to just
tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. One of the key
advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random
access _ the ability to play the track you want without first
listening to a bunch of other stuff. The new Kenwood line means to
take that idea one step further by making the CD player your
storage unit as well.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't
want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes? Each of the
new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in
data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed
categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.). Then if you wake up
Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the
Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the
Motown genre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you want to play DJ for friends dropping
by late some night, you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks
that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to
Percy Sledge. Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded
in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class, ranging from $230
to $500 in list price. The top of the line, the CD-2280M, can play
two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms. For
more information, contact Kenwood USA, Box 22745, Long Beach,
Calif. 90801.
</P>
<P>
   Burn your own
</P>
<P>
   The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is still illegal, of course, to make those recordings and
sell them without a license from the owner of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections
in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton,
Miles Davis or Brahms would be. Digitization of music is making it
possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put
on disc, or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in
their own CD collections, then rearrange them in the right order,
there are CD recorders. Popular Science in its June issue offers a
primer on recording CDs, with sidelong glances at other formats
like DVD and mini-disc.
</P>
<P>
   But say you want to select from a much larger database than you
have on your shelves. How about choosing from tens of thousands of
songs? Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the company's business is the logic of Internet
commerce: the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will
soon be done over the Net. But the Net is not merely the conduit,
since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many
arrangements that can play to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of Custom Revolutions
(http://www.customdisc.com), consumers are invited to select as
many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library,
which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes
it has licensed. Each 10-track CD costs $18 plus shipping, and
customers are also offered the option of ``personalizing'' the art
for the case. Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of
the tunes before buying, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse
list, leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far. Named by
the company are Buddy Guy, Charlie Parker, Hot Tuna, Jim Croce and
Nat King Cole.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Custom Revolutions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and identify
</P>
<P>
   Just how picky are you about phone calls?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a
telemarketer, eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not
to mention the boss. The question is, just how much screening do
you want your machines to do?
</P>
<P>
   And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before
you will deign to pick up your phone?
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, which shows you the caller's number as the phone
rings, is the most obvious option and is available from your local
phone company for a monthly charge. But maybe that is not enough
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of
Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says
``Please enter the four-digit pass code''? If the caller doesn't
have your code, the phone doesn't ring and the call is
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Edge Co. (1-800-732-9976) or visit the
company's site (http://www.edgeco.com).
</P>
<P>
   VCR verbal
</P>
<P>
   The videocassette recorder, despite its near-ubiquity in the
homes of America, just might be the least understood of our most
well-used products. You can pop in a movie, but can you actually
record on your VCR? Can you set it to tape something next week?
</P>
<P>
   Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature, an addition to its
VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the
process of recording. It works something like calling an office
voice mail.Bela Lugosi
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $170 to
$250. For more information, visit the Zenith site on the Net
(http://www.zenith.com).

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Family tree programs excel at different tasks
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer
programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an excellent
program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes much of its
popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs
that come with the deluxe version.
</P>
<P>
   Her report:
</P>
<P>
   You get the Family Finder index (a list of 130 million people
who can be traced through birth, marriage, census and miscellaneous
records); the Social Security Death Index (birth and death dates,
Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people);
and the World Family Tree (130 million people on family trees
submitted by 27,000 family researchers). Another 13 World Family
Tree discs are available, 18 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version _ 4.4 _ comes with expanded online services.
You can search the Internet for every name in your file, add a
Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a
free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a home page was easy _ and free. I included our
immigrants by surname, where they settled, when they immigrated and
where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can have the ``agents'' on Family Tree Maker's Web
page search for every name in your file, there wasn't much point to
look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name. At
FTM's suggestion, I scaled my search down from 3,700 names to 185.
I will be notified by e-mail when matches turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information is intuitive _ the family group screen
includes information on both the husband and wife: birth, death and
marriage dates, parents and children. You can also include sources,
notes and facts.
</P>
<P>
   The program will help you print your book, and even check it for
spelling. You choose which reports you want to include and in what
order. You can even request a table of contents and index. Most of
FTM's reports are excellent, but each time a new version comes out
I have to figure out all over again how to print an ancestor tree
with multiple pages.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree Maker lured me back into genealogy a couple of years
ago. I've used it to gather, record and share information. However,
two other programs, Generations and Ultimate Family Tree, are also
good.
</P>
<P>
   Your choice pretty much comes down to which approach is right
for you. I would recommend Family Tree Maker (about $90) for anyone
whose primary interest is gathering material _ not only are the
World Family Tree discs rich in information, but the publisher,
Broderbund, offers another 100 databases of government and
historical records. Although much of the material on the World
Family Tree needs to be verified, it will give you a starting point
for your search.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Family Tree's premiere version is an ideal choice for
anyone whose emphasis is on organization and verification, and a
bargain at $60. The program not only lists sources but rates them:
Is the source primary or secondary, and is there corroborating
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Generations should appeal to those who are interested
in producing a book, and it's also a bargain at $50. The reports
are outstanding and intuitive; I particularly like the fact that
Generations saves reports in my word processor.

 &HT;    Texas has early warning system on line for E. coli
 &HT;    By Leigh Hopper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In April, the country's biggest meat-packing
company recalled more than 282,000 pounds of ground beef after a
virulent strain of E. coli bacteria was found in a package. That
same month, two children in Abilene and four in Greenville became
ill with E. coli. On Tuesday, in nearby Grayson County, a
33-year-old Denison man died from E. coli infection.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials have been working to rule out a
connection among the cases _ one that would point to a common food
source still endangering other people. Coming to the
epidemiologists' aid is a new, nationwide early alert system for
identifying E. coli 0157:H7, the bacterium that in 1993 killed four
children and was traced to Jack in the Box restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to act while the meat is still out
there,'' said Virginia Headley, a public health bacteriology
specialist for the Texas Department of Health. ``By being able to
get it off the market, we'll be able to prevent cases. That's the
ultimate goal -- to react in a quick enough time to make an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health is one of 16 state labs
participating in PulseNet, a computer database network linked to
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that can rapidly compare
different strains of E. coli from different sources. At its most
deadly, E. coli causes bloody diarrhea and severe dehydration. The
system, unveiled by Vice President Al Gore in Washington last week,
utilizes DNA fingerprints, which resemble bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say the system, which will eventually
incorporate other germs, such as shigella, which causes dysentery,
and a common strain of salmonella, is an important defense against
the growing threat of food-borne disease. The medical sleuthing
that once took months can be sped up to a matter of weeks -- or a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to put things together in a lot less time than
we were before,'' said David Maserang, bureau of laboratories chief
at the Texas Department of Health, the first lab to go on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. coli is a very dangerous organism. Kills people. Or
physically affects them for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, food-borne illness outbreaks were local events. For
example, everyone who ate potato salad at the office picnic became
ill. Today, with meat and produce companies distributing over large
areas, contaminated food has the potential to make thousands of
people sick all over the country. Last summer, Hudson Foods Co. had
to recall a record-breaking 25 million pounds of beef in 34 states
after E. coli sickened people in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne illness such as shigellosis can be spread with
alarming ease. Maserang cited the example of a food worker who
fails to wash his hands after a trip to the bathroom. Millions of
shigella germs, invisible to the eye, cover his fingers. He holds a
potato, slices it, then tosses it into the potato salad where the
germs, now on separate pieces of potato, continue to multiply and
grow. Using the contaminated knife and cutting board, he spreads
the bacteria to the rest of the food he is preparing.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli, found in cattle feces, can contaminate meat during the
slaughtering process and be spread through grinding and packaging.
Thorough cooking kills the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that food-borne illnesses -- such as E. coli,
salmonella and others -- contribute to hundreds of deaths and
millions of illnesses in the United States each year. PulseNet,
which originated in Texas, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington
state, will eventually link agencies in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest significance (of PulseNet) hinges on the fact we
have such a huge network of food distribution in this country. We
don't locally produce and consume our food,'' Headley said. ``The
animals are grown in one area; they go someplace else for
slaughter, another for grinding. ... Trace-backs get real
complicated. When you have a large manufacturer of a product, it
gets distributed quickly over a large portion of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carolyn Fruthaler, director of the Grayson County Health
Department in Denison, where the 33-year-old man died, welcomed the
availability of PulseNet. Right now, she knows of no contaminated
food in her area, but she said she's on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``(E. coli) has been connected to so many foodstuffs, it's
getting to be quite interesting and, in a way, scary. Maybe cooking
your meat all the way through isn't going to be enough to protect
you,'' she said. ``(PulseNet) sounds like a wonderful tool that's
going to be very helpful when we do have outbreaks,'' she said.
``If either one of (the specimens) comes back positive, we'll be
having to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six children struck in Abilene and Greenville, all have
survived, although two are still in the hospital, said Brad Walsh,
regional epidemiologist for Texas Department of Health in
Arlington. Three of the children suffered kidney failure in the
course of their illness.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to DNA fingerprinting technology, Walsh said, he was able
to rule out a connection between the Abilene and Greenville cases
early on. None of the cases appear to be related to the recent meat
recall or the Denison death.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is still trying to figure out how the two families in
Greenville -- who don't know each other -- may have encountered the
germ.

 &HT;    Developers plan to build on historic Ford Plantation
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND HILL , Ga. _ Henry Ford, billionaire titan of the
Industrial Age, once found 1,800 acres' worth of tranquillity along
the shores of the Ogeechee River outside Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of developers hopes those same acres will offer
vacation homes, as well as chic and sporty diversion to new Wall
Street millionaires of the Technology Age. Construction on the
first houses is expected to begin in mid-June, pending approval by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Variously called Dublin Plantation, Sterling Bluff and Richmond
Plantation, the property now renamed the Ford Plantation will be
the first development of its kind in the Savannah area.
</P>
<P>
   A group of South Carolina investors called Sterling Bluff
Associates is positioning it as the Bar Harbor of the South or the
Ocean Reef Club of Georgia, offering second or third homes and
presumably attracting families of wealth and station similar to
those that frequent the Maine and Key Largo, Fla., resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many people that fit that profile. Buyers
will either add this to their list of destinations, or forsake an
existing resort for this ... (but) it sounds like it would sell,''
remarked Eric Kennedy, editor of the duPont Registry, a magazine
catering to buyers of million-dollar residences.
</P>
<P>
   The developers include co-managing directors Steve Schram and
Peter Pollak. Schram is the agent for Sterling Bluff Associates,
which was incorporated March 19 in Hilton Head, S.C. Along with a
third director, Chip Dolan, he and Pollak plan to take the Georgia
plantation _ which predates the Revolutionary War _ and transform
it into an exclusive, guarded-and-gated, $400 million vacation
community with 385 houses and amenities compatible with a four-star
to five-star resort.
</P>
<P>
   These features include a 261-acre Pete Dye golf course and 248
acres of freshwater lakes, some of which are former rice ponds.
Targeting youthful, active executives, both male and female, who
still perhaps have children at home, developers say they will offer
a deep-water marina equipped with slips for large yachts, along
with the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stables, a paddock and eight miles of waterfront trails
</P>
<P>
   _ Fishing and swimming
</P>
<P>
   _ Squash, tennis and a spa.
</P>
<P>
   _ A full-time naturalist and field guide; fishing expert; riding
instructor; massage therapists; and nutritionist
</P>
<P>
   _ An executive chef and a director of operations to oversee food
service, limited lodging for residents' guests and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece is the 9,000-square-foot Georgian house that
Detroit automobile magnate Ford and his wife moved from Savannah,
restored and visited between 1937 and 1947. A farm-style plantation
house, a paddock and oddities _ such as the oyster house where
Henry Ford entertained his cronies _ sit nearby under canopies of
17th-century live oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   There are unrestricted views for miles around, provided in part
by federally protected marshes flanking the river. The developers
already have passed muster for yacht-slip permits, said Stuart
Stevens, a marine ecologist based in Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The initial 200 or so lots to be developed will consist of two
to six acres and will cost between $275,000 and $1 million. That's
before building begins.
</P>
<P>
   The developers themselves will build _ using an in-house
architectural and construction outfit _ 185 others. To come are
``golf cottages'' starting at $575,000 and ``marina houses''
ranging from $600,000 to more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Residents will pay, noted Pollak and Schram during a recent
interview, a one-time initial membership fee of $75,000 to partake
of all the activities.
</P>
<P>
   The developers purchased the site for a reported $47 million.
</P>
<P>
   The seller was a holding company, InterRedec, once connected to
Ghaith Pharaon, the Saudi Arabian businessman. In 1992, Pharaon was
indicted in federal court in Georgia on fraud and racketeering
charges related to the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. Pharaon is currently a fugitive, said a spokesman
for the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   However, during his heyday as a Georgia-based banker and
deal-maker, Pharaon bought the Ford estate. Around 1981 he set
about restoring the house, festooning it with tassels, palm trees
and European statuary. He put in the golf course. He commissioned a
coffee-table book, ``The View From Sterling Bluff,'' describing the
property and his role in saving it. Although the book is now being
used as a marketing tool, Pollak said Pharaon and his family are no
longer involved with the Ford Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak and Dolan are South Carolina resort-real-estate salesmen
and managers. Pollack and Schram, a former Morgan Stanley
investment banker and former co-chairman of the Boston Celtics
Limited Partnership, were vague as to the number of investors they
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say it is something under 50 handpicked individuals,''
Pollak said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, how does Old Savannah feel about tomorrow's view from
Sterling Bluff?
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Moore Barto, whose family has lived along the Southeastern
coast for generations, does not like the idea at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it was Hilton Head, then Daufuskie Island (that were
overdeveloped). I am getting personally weary of people coming in
from the outside and using us to make money. We have been
overwhelmed,'' Barto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost so much of the true South,'' she continued,
``(and) every time we try to control it, to live peacefully and let
them do business, they ruin it. It has gotten so out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Ford Plantation project brings in its wake remains
to be seen. But with its amenities, it is expected to appeal to
younger families, well-heeled by Wall Street in a boom economy.
</P>
<P>
   Said the duPont Registry's Kennedy: ``You are talking about
people with average annual incomes of $600,000 to $700,000. There
are more millionaires roaming around our country than ever, and
many of them are being made by their mid-40s ... I can visualize 9-
or 10-year-old children running around this place.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Enough memories to fill a book
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By VICKI MARSH KABAT
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In my day, they were called scrapbooks. They were bound with
twine and had big, black pages. You used Elmer's Glue, those little
triangular picture tabs and a white pencil to write your captions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're called Memory Books. Having just compiled one for
our newly graduated high schooler, let me assure you, I made some
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my first tip for would-be Memory Book makers: Don't wait
until three days before presenting it to start the project. Bad
idea. You need at least three months. If you want it to be a
surprise, you also need a separate, locked room in your house in
which to assemble it.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Memory Book seemed like a good idea. Blithely, I
went off to the craft store, selected a big, red book, an array of
colorful acid-free papers, stickers and glue sticks. The acid-free
designation is critically important. Don't ask me why, it just is.
Come to think of it, it was an important designation back in the
'60s, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty dollars later I had a huge sack of ... stuff, all of which
was unorganized, unassembled and unlikely to get any other way.
What in the world had I gotten myself into?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I dug in. I went through box after box of photos
recounting the first 18 years of our son's life. While I was
sitting in the middle of the floor, surrounded by pictures,
kindergarten papers, blue ribbons, piano recital programs and grade
cards, he suddenly pounded on the front door, which I had
dead-bolted so he couldn't unlock it. Throwing myself against the
little window in the door so he couldn't look in, I yelled, ``What
do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want in,'' he hollered back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come in. Sit on the front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Befuddled, he sat while I hurriedly threw everything into a sack
and hid it under our bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I said, unlocking the door. ``You can come in now.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me askance and then said, ``I don't even want to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. You don't need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep into the second night of the project, I was only up to his
elementary school years. Peeling the acid-free glue from my
fingers, I hollered for my husband, who so far had studiously
avoided me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick, run to the craft store and get three more sheets of the
blue cloud paper, two with a sports theme, one more of the music
and the super-size glue stick. All acid-free!'' I shouted as he
bolted out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Our two younger sons developed a secret knock for our bedroom
door, behind which I was sequestered. Tap, taptaptap. ``Mom,'' came
the furtive whisper. ``It's me. Let me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathered around me as I glued and snipped, captioned and
stickered, the boys were duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, are you going to do this for us, too?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes widened in horror. Of course I would have to, wouldn't
I? When you have three kids, once is never enough. Remember that
when you get these harebrained, spur-of-the-moment ideas.
</P>
<P>
   My husband returned from the craft store, a harried look in his
eyes. Handing me the sack, he said, ``I got lost in the potpourri
department and couldn't get out. Don't make me go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, I slapped down the last decorative
frame and slipped the last plastic protective sheet in place. Paper
scraps were piled ankle-high around me. But in my hands was a
masterpiece that contains the milestones of our son's life.
</P>
<P>
   In my heart, however, there was much, much more. The memory of
first discovering we were pregnant, the thrill of the doctor saying
``It's a boy!'', the exultation of the grandparents and family, our
son's first words and first shaky steps, the first day of school, a
medical crisis and the harrowing days that followed, his first
piano recital.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the book holds a lot of memories, but not all of them. And
those I hold in my heart don't need any acid-free guarantee to
preserve them.

 &HT;    Consumer Watch: Learn about mass marketing _ so you can get off
the list
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct mail and
telemarketing lists?
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways, easy ways, to get on the lists. To get off
the lists _ and stay off _ is not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   One way of getting on lists was revealed this month when
American Express announced it would sell certain purchasing
information about its card holders to retailers, who could then
send advertisements or other sales promotions to them.
</P>
<P>
   But American Express card holders should not feel alone. Every
time you provide your name and address to buy a product or service,
including many bank credit card purchases, there's a good chance
you eventually will be added to other marketing lists.
</P>
<P>
   Lists of names and addresses and telephone numbers are compiled
by marketers from countless sources, including the telephone book.
Such a list, of course, is too general for most marketers who want
more specialized ``response'' lists of consumers who have bought
certain kinds of merchandise that indicate they might respond to
similar offers.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous telemarketers and direct mail firms, including some
mail order catalogs and magazines, sell, rent or ``share'' their
lists. If you are a customer of one mail order company, you are
likely to receive promotions from other mail order companies. If
you subscribe to a cooking magazine, you may soon receive mail
order catalogs for kitchen supplies.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to get your name deleted from many mail and
telephone lists, but it takes persistence. Even then, there is no
guarantee that the plague won't return.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of information about individuals is part of the public
record that's available to anyone, and there's nothing you can do
to stop marketers from gathering such information, which includes
home sales and birth, marriage and death records.
</P>
<P>
   Other public domain information includes high school and college
directories of alumni with names, addresses and phone numbers. If
you are a doctor, lawyer, dentist, engineer or teacher, you
probably belong to one or more professional societies with
directories showing your name and address.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers also gather your name and address and other personal
facts about you from sources that you can restrict to some degree
if you are aware of what's happening. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most sweepstakes and contests require you to fill out
applications listing names, addresses and phone numbers, and some
request other personal information such as salary range and
education level. Guess what happens to this information?
</P>
<P>
   _ Some charities, nonprofit organizations, clubs and
associations rent or sell their membership and supporter lists as a
way to bring in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you fill out a warranty card for an appliance or other
product, it often requests information, such as salary range and
hobbies, that's not needed for warranty protection. This
information may be sold for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To control the release of such personal information, there are
two things you can do that will help some. First, provide as little
personal information as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Second _ and this is something you likely will have to do
repeatedly _ contact organizations you join, magazines you
subscribe to, charities you support, your credit card issuers and
other creditors and ask them to delete your name from lists they
might rent or sell to other merchants and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There are two major ``shotgun'' actions you can take that are
your best bets for substantially reducing unwanted mail promotions
and telemarketing calls: Contact the Direct Marketing Association
and the three major credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   The Direct Marketing Association offers its Mail Preference
Service and Telephone Preference Service, which removes your name
from the mail and telemarketing lists of its members, most of whom
are major national marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Mail Preference Service at P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale,
N.Y. 11735, and Telephone Preference Service at P.O. Box 9014,
Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735. This will not stop mail or calls from
charities or small marketers who are not DMA members, but it will
stop a major portion of direct mail solicitations and telemarketing
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to ``opt out'' of lists
of consumers that credit bureaus provide to banks, retailers,
credit card companies and other firms that intend to make
unsolicited offers of credit by mail or phone. If you don't want to
be included on such lists, call Equifax at 1-800-556-4711,
TransUnion at 1-800-680-7293 and Experian at 1-888-567-8688. If the
system works as it is supposed to, you need call only one of the
bureaus to be taken off the lists by all three.
</P>
<P>
   One final help in stopping telemarketing calls is the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act, which requires telemarketers to maintain
``don't call'' lists of customers who don't want to be called. But
you have to tell each telemarketer who calls that you don't want to
be called again _ and the law doesn't apply to charities and
political groups.

 &HT;    Web offers alluring sites for fishing enthusiasts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your next fishing partner may have a 17-inch screen
and a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers
and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a much better job
of representing the non-technical side of life. Take fishing, for
instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer
fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about the hottest
lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing
Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html. Because this is a
national site, you start by clicking on the section of the country
where you live. Besides offering fishing tips for that section of
the country, you'll find some links that would be helpful to most
fishermen, including ways to get local weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Another good general interest site is called The World of
Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/. Some of the news stories
and information here seems to be aimed at the professional bass
fishermen and those who follow the action at bass tournaments. But
there are also sections that offer listings of fishing guides and
others that take you to classified ads for used fishing equipment.
There also are links to the sites of several manufacturers of
fishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful part of this site is the section that offers
forums on various types of fishing and fishing-related information.
You'll be able to use these forums to discuss subjects such as
lures, outboard motors and fishing spots with other anglers. And if
there is anything fishermen like as well as fishing, it's talking
about fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing can almost seem like a separate sport. Avid
fly-fishermen often look down their noses at those who merely drown
worms. And learning to fly-fish is a lot more difficult, too. But
the rewards are enormous for those who enjoy it. The art of making
a delicate cast to just the right place is almost as much fun as
catching a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is famous for some great fly-fishing rivers including the
Rogue, McKenzie, Smith and Umpqua. So an Oregon-based site called
the McKenzie Page is a terrific place to go. You'll find it at
http://zebu.uoregon.edu/cgi-bin2/Mckenzie/Mckfrontend.pl. A lot of
the information is specific to Oregon rivers, but you'll also find
some general information, including some great photography of
flies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's final site _ Flyfishing.com at http://www.flyfishing.com
_ is much more general in nature and has lots of instructional
material for beginners and seasoned fly-fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   One especially good feature of the site is the database of
information about various flies. Even veteran fly-fishermen will
enjoy looking through the many attempts to create a lure that looks
just right to a trout.

 &HT;    Mac Report: Software makers hold key to Macintosh's fate
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing
software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who will make
or break this computer.
</P>
<P>
   With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will
thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one
wants to write software for the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't there is no software for the Mac. Apple
Computer counts some 12,000 existing titles. Yet this number is
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It says nothing about the vibrancy of the market, how many
titles are new, how many are regularly improved. Software grows old
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies the problem. Two years ago, 70 percent of all
developers wrote either original Mac titles or Mac versions of
Windows software. Today, that number has dwindled to 20 percent.
That means a lot of those 12,000 titles are getting long in the
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant, continually renewing roster of software titles is
especially important in the home market. Its growth has been driven
by exciting new computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, most game developers are not writing for the Mac _ sadly,
for good reason. It's very difficult to sell Mac titles.
</P>
<P>
   Take id Software, developer of the popular shoot-'em-up game
``Quake.'' It did a Mac version of the original game but sold only
50,000 copies. Not surprisingly, it didn't bother with a Mac
version of ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month I take a look at the number of Mac titles sold,
and it is not good,'' says Luc Barthelet, general manager of game
maker Maxis. ``Sales are still declining month to month.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Barthelet has not decided yet whether Maxis
will release a Mac version of its upgrade to ``SimCity,'' scheduled
for release next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis is not alone. Scores of developers never even bother with
a Mac version of their games. And many of those who do wait a year
or more before releasing Mac versions.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mac users rarely can play the hottest games on the
market. They're second-class citizens in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that must be solved. Apple Computer thinks the
key is its sizable presence in schools. It's nice that Apple
Computer continues to be the largest supplier to the educational
market, but this means little to kids.
</P>
<P>
   What they want at home is not the same computer as in school but
one that plays the most and the newest hot games. Unfortunately,
Macs are a distant second in this contest.

 &HT;    Wall Street: Market technicians win on strength of analysis
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Score one for the technicians.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stock market wizards who practice technical
analysis, an approach based on the idea that supply and demand
explain the price movements of a stock or the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians look at factors that can be quantified, such as
volume, the number of new highs and new lows, price-to-earnings
ratios, 200-day moving averages and a host of others.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sullivan, who writes one of the better Wall Street market
letters, had this astonishing sentence in a recent edition of The
Chartist newsletter: ``It's not important to know what business (a)
company is in.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he suggested, it might be better not to know, since an
investor might get emotionally involved with the company and do
something stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The other school of thought is fundamental analysis. It looks at
the relationship between investment markets and such factors as
management changes at a company, new products, economic growth
rates, inflation and political events.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is political, social and other events influence the way
people behave, and one form of behavior is investing in stocks _ or
bonds, or real estate or art.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalists have been saying for some time that dismal
profit growth this year would cause people to pull back from the
market: Those in the market would sell some of their holdings to
raise cash; those not in it would park their money in cash or bonds
until the right moment arrives for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the Commerce Department reported last week
corporate profits declined 2.2 percent in the first quarter after
falling 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first instance of back-to-back profit declines since
the 1990-92 recession. It reinforces the forecast that profit
growth will be disappointing this year _ certainly less than it has
been for most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd never know profits are down by looking at the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 are up just about 12.5 percent so far this year, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is up just over 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If disappointing profit growth is such a bad thing, wouldn't the
market be expected to rise more slowly, or even decline?
</P>
<P>
   Not if billions and billions of dollars continue to flood into
stocks from investors buying mutual funds or stashing retirement
funds away in 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Fund flow is a technical, not a fundamental, factor and does a
good job of explaining the market's rise this year. The $26.6
billion investors put into stock funds in April brought total
mutual fund assets of all types to more than $5 trillion _ that's
trillion with a ``t'' _ for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fundamentalists will say, people put money in mutual funds,
but they did because the economy is growing, inflation is down,
yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter, say the technicians. What counts is it was
the flow of money into the market that pushed stocks higher, not
the shrewd, brain-teasing analysis of corporate decisions, GDP
growth, Asian flu or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   It's an endless argument.
</P>
<P>
   Are technical and fundamental analysis as far apart as this
scenario suggests?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Technicians will tell you they look at
fundamental factors, and fundamentalists look at lots of technical
factors. The market is too complicated to be explained by any one
theory alone.

 &HT;    Money Talk: Guesswork on college costs is fairly accurate
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A report last week from an educational trade
association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of
the cost of college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But a second look shows that we actually have a reasonable idea
of the total cost _ not just tuition _ of a year in college.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Education's study says that tuition at
four-year public colleges averages $3,111. In a telephone poll,
respondents guessed an average of $9,694.
</P>
<P>
   That guess is not far off from the total cost, including
tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069.
</P>
<P>
   The council's study did illuminate American attitudes toward
college and their kids. The majority believe college is worth the
price and it is a top concern for their own children. Most families
think they can afford to pay for college. But they think other
families can't.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the study was like a noisy alarm clock on Monday
morning. You may dread hearing it, but it tells you that you've got
to get started on some important business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start early on, paying for college is not
overwhelming,'' said Michelle A. Smith, managing director of the
Mutual Fund Education Alliance in Kansas City, Mo. ``It is
manageable if you start early and stay focused and invest all along
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three main steps to getting started:
</P>
<P>
   Step one, starting when the kids are young, is to begin a
college saving program and start investing the money. Step two,
when your child is in high school, is to shake the financial aid
machine for all the outside help you can get. Step three is to
borrow the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Far and away, step one is the most rewarding. It gives you some
control over what can be an expensive undertaking, as well as a
sense of achievement. And for kids as well as parents, it signals a
commitment that college is important enough for the family to make
some sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   You might be surprised at how much money you can put away, even
with a modest investment program. Uncle Sam will even help you out,
at least a little bit, through the newly established education
IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   You can put $500 a year _ that's about $42 a month _ into an
education IRA for each child. You don't pay income tax on the
earnings each year, and you don't pay taxes or penalties when you
take the money out, assuming you spend it for education.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you make an 8 percent return each year. If you start at
birth and put that money in every year, you will have about $20,200
when your child turns 18. It may not cover everything, but it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have to pay taxes on your earnings each year, the
compounded growth gets impressive. Suppose you put away $50 a month
starting when your child is born. Suppose you raise the ante each
year, putting in $60 a month the second year, $70 the third year
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming your investments return 8 percent a year, and assuming
you pay 34 percent back in federal and state taxes, you still could
accumulate about $44,300 by your child's 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old story of deferred gratification. Maybe for now you
give up one night on the town each month. That money works for you,
and it will make you very happy when you need it later.
</P>
<P>
   When you move to step two, you're stepping into somebody else's
machine. It's a big one: Financial aid totaled $50 billion last
year, nearly a third of the $160 billion spent for education at
3,000 institutions. Financial aid includes grants, scholarships,
loans and part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like any big machine, it runs by its own rules and at its own
speed. You fill out a long, standardized form that reveals your
family finances in great detail. From that information, colleges
figure out how much your family can reasonably be expected to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is your need, and colleges attempt to come up with a
package of scholarships, loans and the like that match that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it may be loans, which you or your child will have to
repay. That's step three.
</P>
<P>
   Many people finance their education with loans. And there's an
amazing array of loan programs. A number of them are backed by the
federal government and impose low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For many families, these programs help make a college degree
possible. It boils down to how hard you're willing to dig: for
scholarships rather than loans, for low-interest loans _ and how

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Let someone else clean the smudges off Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. My guess is that the
publicity about the company's problems with the Justice Department
will end up hyping sales.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most home users will figure a program that attracts
so many headlines must be danged important. So my job today is to
be a real TechnoBuddy and urge you not to rush to buy Windows
during the first month or so.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing at all to do with the merits of Windows 98.
Sooner or later, you'll upgrade. But there are compelling reasons
to wait out the initial rush to install the newest version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can expect the technical support telephone lines at
both Microsoft and even at retailers will be jammed with calls for
help during the first few weeks Windows 98 is available.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a new operating system is like dumping two jigsaw
puzzles into one box and then trying to separate them. There are
literally thousands of chances for conflicts with installed
programs and hardware devices. You can bet lots of folks will be on
the phone in the days after Windows 98 is available trying to put
the pieces of the puzzle back together.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait a month or so, the initial rush should calm down and
you'll have a better chance of getting help by telephone. Remember
that _ worst case _ you can put your computer out of commission
when you install any new operating system. So unless you're
prepared to get sore ears while you're on hold waiting for help,
then don't join the initial rush.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while all companies _ including Microsoft _ do the best
they can to test new software for bugs, there will be some
unpleasant surprises when undiscovered flaws are discovered. All
new programs have enough bugs to populate a good-sized rotten log.
The beta testing program catches some of them, but when Windows 98
gets on the market, many more will be discovered. Let your friends
and neighbors find them, let Microsoft correct them, and then buy
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me make a safe assumption. Plenty of you are going to
ignore this advice. Heck, if the tables were turned, I might do
that, too. Some of us can't help getting caught up in the
excitement of trying something new that we've heard a lot about.
</P>
<P>
   So let's talk about some of the ways to protect yourself if you
do install Windows 98 in the first mad rush.
</P>
<P>
   The most important safeguard is to make a complete backup of
your hard disk. That way _ worst case _ you'll be able to put your
computer back the way it was before the installation. Windows 98
has an uninstall option that, in theory, will do the same thing.
But be safe and make a backup yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Also, follow the on-screen advice you'll get while you're
installing Windows 98 and take the options to make a recovery disk
as well as asking your computer to make a backup copy of your old
system files. Both of these steps can help you undo any problems
caused by the installation.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Follow my advice to wait a while if you can. And if you
insist on walking the high-tech tightrope, at least use a safety
net.

 &HT;    Tech Report: 200 CDs, accessible by a touch
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of
compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop
it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to just
tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. One of the key
advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random
access _ the ability to play the track you want without first
listening to a bunch of other stuff. The new Kenwood line means to
take that idea one step further by making the CD player your
storage unit as well.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't
want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes? Each of the
new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in
data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed
categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.). Then if you wake up
Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the
Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the
Motown genre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you want to play DJ for friends dropping
by late some night, you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks
that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to
Percy Sledge. Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded
in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class, ranging from $230
to $500 in list price. The top of the line, the CD-2280M, can play
two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms. For
more information, contact Kenwood USA, Box 22745, Long Beach,
Calif. 90801.
</P>
<P>
   Burn your own
</P>
<P>
   The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is still illegal, of course, to make those recordings and
sell them without a license from the owner of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections
in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton,
Miles Davis or Brahms would be. Digitization of music is making it
possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put
on disc, or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in
their own CD collections, then rearrange them in the right order,
there are CD recorders. Popular Science in its June issue offers a
primer on recording CDs, with sidelong glances at other formats
like DVD and mini-disc.
</P>
<P>
   But say you want to select from a much larger database than you
have on your shelves. How about choosing from tens of thousands of
songs? Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the company's business is the logic of Internet
commerce: the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will
soon be done over the Net. But the Net is not merely the conduit,
since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many
arrangements that can play to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of Custom Revolutions
(http://www.customdisc.com), consumers are invited to select as
many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library,
which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes
it has licensed. Each 10-track CD costs $18 plus shipping, and
customers are also offered the option of ``personalizing'' the art
for the case. Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of
the tunes before buying, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse
list, leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far. Named by
the company are Buddy Guy, Charlie Parker, Hot Tuna, Jim Croce and
Nat King Cole.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Custom Revolutions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and identify
</P>
<P>
   Just how picky are you about phone calls?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a
telemarketer, eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not
to mention the boss. The question is, just how much screening do
you want your machines to do?
</P>
<P>
   And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before
you will deign to pick up your phone?
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, which shows you the caller's number as the phone
rings, is the most obvious option and is available from your local
phone company for a monthly charge. But maybe that is not enough
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of
Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says
``Please enter the four-digit pass code''? If the caller doesn't
have your code, the phone doesn't ring and the call is
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Edge Co. (1-800-732-9976) or visit the
company's site (http://www.edgeco.com).
</P>
<P>
   VCR verbal
</P>
<P>
   The videocassette recorder, despite its near-ubiquity in the
homes of America, just might be the least understood of our most
well-used products. You can pop in a movie, but can you actually
record on your VCR? Can you set it to tape something next week?
</P>
<P>
   Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature, an addition to its
VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the
process of recording. It works something like calling an office
voice mail.Bela Lugosi
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $170 to
$250. For more information, visit the Zenith site on the Net
(http://www.zenith.com).

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Family tree programs excel at different tasks
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer
programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an excellent
program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes much of its
popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs
that come with the deluxe version.
</P>
<P>
   Her report:
</P>
<P>
   You get the Family Finder index (a list of 130 million people
who can be traced through birth, marriage, census and miscellaneous
records); the Social Security Death Index (birth and death dates,
Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people);
and the World Family Tree (130 million people on family trees
submitted by 27,000 family researchers). Another 13 World Family
Tree discs are available, 18 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version _ 4.4 _ comes with expanded online services.
You can search the Internet for every name in your file, add a
Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a
free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a home page was easy _ and free. I included our
immigrants by surname, where they settled, when they immigrated and
where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can have the ``agents'' on Family Tree Maker's Web
page search for every name in your file, there wasn't much point to
look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name. At
FTM's suggestion, I scaled my search down from 3,700 names to 185.
I will be notified by e-mail when matches turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information is intuitive _ the family group screen
includes information on both the husband and wife: birth, death and
marriage dates, parents and children. You can also include sources,
notes and facts.
</P>
<P>
   The program will help you print your book, and even check it for
spelling. You choose which reports you want to include and in what
order. You can even request a table of contents and index. Most of
FTM's reports are excellent, but each time a new version comes out
I have to figure out all over again how to print an ancestor tree
with multiple pages.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree Maker lured me back into genealogy a couple of years
ago. I've used it to gather, record and share information. However,
two other programs, Generations and Ultimate Family Tree, are also
good.
</P>
<P>
   Your choice pretty much comes down to which approach is right
for you. I would recommend Family Tree Maker (about $90) for anyone
whose primary interest is gathering material _ not only are the
World Family Tree discs rich in information, but the publisher,
Broderbund, offers another 100 databases of government and
historical records. Although much of the material on the World
Family Tree needs to be verified, it will give you a starting point
for your search.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Family Tree's premiere version is an ideal choice for
anyone whose emphasis is on organization and verification, and a
bargain at $60. The program not only lists sources but rates them:
Is the source primary or secondary, and is there corroborating
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Generations should appeal to those who are interested
in producing a book, and it's also a bargain at $50. The reports
are outstanding and intuitive; I particularly like the fact that
Generations saves reports in my word processor.

 &HT;    Francly, euro may be off the mark
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe, roughly a million vending
machines dispense Coca-Colas. That's a pretty tame business; people
drop in their coins and Cokes come out. What could go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everything. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the machines are set up to accept coins minted by
the many different countries of Europe. But starting Jan.1,
Germany, France, Spain, Italy and seven other European nations will
launch a massive effort to withdraw all existing coins and bills
and replace them with a single new currency, called the euro.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversion is completed in 2002, there will be no more
Italian lira, or German marks or French francs. Only the euro will
be used to conduct business in all 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
   That means workers who service Coke machines must convert the
coin mechanisms to recognize the new currency. How much will that
conversion cost? How long will it take? How frustrated will
consumers get during the transition? No one is quite sure what
impact the euro conversion will have on profits in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, U.S. business leaders cheered the plans
to create the euro because they wanted to end the accounting
hassles associated with earning money in many different currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the deadline growing closer, the details of
conversion are creating real headaches. As businesses gear up for
the change, they are realizing that the euro may be the equivalent
of the year 2000 computer bug. That glitch, known as ``Y2K,''
already is causing huge problems as corporations race to reprogram
their computers to correctly interpret dates after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, computer programmers are facing Y2K squared. Not only
will they have to prepare for Dec. 31, 1999, but they will have to
make computers comprehend the symbol for the euro, which I would
show you if only my computer were programmed to make the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with all of these technical difficulties, many
economists believe the introduction of the euro eventually will
have a very positive impact on the global economy. By making it
simpler for international companies to sell goods and services in
Europe, the euro could ignite trade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of debating whether it's worth the trouble to do
business in Luxembourg, U.S. corporations will be more inclined to
see Europe as one huge market united by a single currency. Taken
together, the 11 countries adopting the euro have about 288 million
people who generate nearly 20 percent of the world's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that with a unified currency, the new European
Central Bank will be able to create a low-inflation, high-growth
environment that knocks down trade barriers. Anything that boosts
tourism, trade and productivity in Europe will be good for U.S.
companies such as Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, which have
extensive operations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The euro does hold great promise. But making the transition at
the very time computer programmers are struggling with the Y2K bug
may be very bad timing. If technical difficulties trip up the
conversion process, distrust and bickering could break out among
Europeans, who have a nasty habit of going to war with each other
every few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Americans have given the euro little or no thought,
its introduction into the global economy could have an enormous
impact on U.S. businesses. It could spur a golden era of
trans-Atlantic trade, or trigger an economic crisis that will make
Asia's current troubles seem mild.

 &HT;    Experts can be at loss when it comes to vehicle repairs
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For many people, the most frustrating part of vehicle
ownership is getting quality service at a fair price. Because most
of us are not certified automotive technicians, when we talk to our
technician about vehicle repairs, it's not unlike trying to feel
knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I feel confident about automotive topics, but a recent
experience proved that under some circumstances, I can be just as
lost at the repair shop as the next guy.
</P>
<P>
   I own a 1978 crew-cab dual rear wheel pickup truck. Obviously,
it is not new, but it is in excellent shape. With tender loving
care, I don't see why I can't expect to drive it another 217,000
miles.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, it started to develop a front-end shimmy.
When it started to eat up front tires, I decided it was time to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Usually all work is done on my truck by one technician. He
worked at the dealership when I bought the vehicle two decades ago.
I was so impressed with the quality of his work that when he
changed locations, I followed him.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he opened a small shop, and I have been a loyal
customer for years. Because he is a one-man operation and mine is
such a big truck, I decided to take it to the dealer for the
front-end repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Having known the dealership's service writer for years, I told
him to do whatever was necessary. I also mentioned that I needed
the truck back quickly. Two days later, I got a phone call saying
the truck needed to have its whole front end rebuilt. The estimate
was $1,200 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   My husband threw up a stop sign, thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   To the dealership's credit, the service writer did call me. I
had made a big mistake when I told them to fix whatever was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to my old mechanic. After inspecting the truck, he
said the sway bar bushings were worn and it appeared to be out of
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him to fix the bushings, pack the front wheel bearings
and check the shocks just to be on the safe side. My total bill,
including four new premium-brand gas shocks, was $261. He
apologized that he couldn't do the alignment, but located a shop
that could and sent me on my way.
</P>
<P>
   At the alignment shop, I explained my situation and told them
also if they found anything wrong to let me know. I picked the
truck up four hours later with a bill for $72. All it needed was an
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership's service writer was fair to me, but someone in
the shop either didn't want the job on such a big truck or didn't
know what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If you go in for service _ to a dealer, an
independent shop or a franchise repair shop _ and they throw out a
number you find objectionable, don't hesitate to get a second
opinion. After all, if you went to the doctor with a corn and he
wanted to cut your leg off, you'd go elsewhere.

   EZZARD-COLUMN _ Sooner or later, Madeleine Albright was bound to
have a public brush with chauvinism. Surely there was a touch of it
in the comments of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) when he
declared for the benefit of the world _ and especially Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more
than an ``agent of the Palestinians.'' Can anyone imagine Gingrich
saying that about Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker III,
Warren Christopher? (Ezzard, Atlanta -Journal Constitution)

 &HT;    Gingrich no statesman on Middle East
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sooner or later, Madeleine Albright, the first female
secretary of state, was bound to have a public brush with
chauvinism. Surely there was a touch of it in the comments of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) when he declared for the benefit of
the world _ and especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more than an ``agent of the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone imagine Gingrich saying that about Henry Kissinger,
George Shultz, James Baker III, Warren Christopher? The historical
myth that prevented women from serving in high foreign-policy
positions is that they would be too easily influenced, too weak. It
was a gender thing.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from picking on Albright, Gingrich, the history professor,
knows the first lesson of statesmanship is to share foreign policy
concerns of a delicate nature with the secretary or the president
privately. But Gingrich hardly qualifies for the list of Georgians
in Congress who have distinguished themselves on foreign policy:
Sen. Walter George, who won high praise from President Dwight D.
Eisenhower for his bipartisan approach; Sens. Richard Russell and
Sam Nunn, for instance, both of whom advised Republican and
Democratic presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich claims to have learned a number of lessons the hard way
in his book,''Lessons Learned.'' Now we all know one lesson he
didn't learn. He might have taken a cue from respected GOP
colleagues, Sen. Bob Dole and former President George Bush. Bush
once declared he would never oppose openly the foreign policy of a
seated president. He never has. And Dole won Democratic kudos on
numerous occasions for his bipartisan approach, most recently when
he supported President Clinton in retaining U.S. troops in Bosnia
past a prior congressional deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has left himself open to speculation that he had an
even more troubling motive for publicly bashing U.S. policy in the
Middle East at a delicate time for reviving peace negotiations:
fund raising back home.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Israeli Political Action Committees are no small
campaign donors, funneling millions each year into candidate and
party coffers. Federal candidates in both parties make command
appearances before the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee,
the powerful pro-Israel lobbying force that alerts a network of
Jewish PACs about politicians' remarks and votes. Those PACs are
such a well-established part of Washington fund raising that
despite recent concerns about the illegal money influence on
American foreign policy, no one seems to care about the ``legal''
PAC influences.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's latest candidate disclosure reports reflect almost no
contributions from pro-Israel PACS, though his separate ``Monday
Morning PAC,'' from which he assists other GOP candidates, has
collected some pro-Israel money. (The pro-Israel PACs are difficult
to identify in campaign filings because, like other interest
groups, they have neutral names: `` Washington PAC'' and
``Americans for Good Government,'' for example.)
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Democrats have collected more money from Jewish
PACs than have Republicans. Maybe Gingrich will change that, but he
isn't likely to change his image as the ultimate partisan to the
kind of statesman Americans prefer in high office.

 &HT;    Francly, euro may be off the mark
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe, roughly a million vending
machines dispense Coca-Colas. That's a pretty tame business; people
drop in their coins and Cokes come out. What could go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everything. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the machines are set up to accept coins minted by
the many different countries of Europe. But starting Jan.1,
Germany, France, Spain, Italy and seven other European nations will
launch a massive effort to withdraw all existing coins and bills
and replace them with a single new currency, called the euro.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversion is completed in 2002, there will be no more
Italian lira, or German marks or French francs. Only the euro will
be used to conduct business in all 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
   That means workers who service Coke machines must convert the
coin mechanisms to recognize the new currency. How much will that
conversion cost? How long will it take? How frustrated will
consumers get during the transition? No one is quite sure what
impact the euro conversion will have on profits in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, U.S. business leaders cheered the plans
to create the euro because they wanted to end the accounting
hassles associated with earning money in many different currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the deadline growing closer, the details of
conversion are creating real headaches. As businesses gear up for
the change, they are realizing that the euro may be the equivalent
of the year 2000 computer bug. That glitch, known as ``Y2K,''
already is causing huge problems as corporations race to reprogram
their computers to correctly interpret dates after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, computer programmers are facing Y2K squared. Not only
will they have to prepare for Dec. 31, 1999, but they will have to
make computers comprehend the symbol for the euro, which I would
show you if only my computer were programmed to make the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with all of these technical difficulties, many
economists believe the introduction of the euro eventually will
have a very positive impact on the global economy. By making it
simpler for international companies to sell goods and services in
Europe, the euro could ignite trade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of debating whether it's worth the trouble to do
business in Luxembourg, U.S. corporations will be more inclined to
see Europe as one huge market united by a single currency. Taken
together, the 11 countries adopting the euro have about 288 million
people who generate nearly 20 percent of the world's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that with a unified currency, the new European
Central Bank will be able to create a low-inflation, high-growth
environment that knocks down trade barriers. Anything that boosts
tourism, trade and productivity in Europe will be good for U.S.
companies such as Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, which have
extensive operations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The euro does hold great promise. But making the transition at
the very time computer programmers are struggling with the Y2K bug
may be very bad timing. If technical difficulties trip up the
conversion process, distrust and bickering could break out among
Europeans, who have a nasty habit of going to war with each other
every few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Americans have given the euro little or no thought,
its introduction into the global economy could have an enormous
impact on U.S. businesses. It could spur a golden era of
trans-Atlantic trade, or trigger an economic crisis that will make
Asia's current troubles seem mild.

 &HT;    The stare-down, and Owls blink
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ This was battle of pocket dynasties, big
doings on a modest scale. A meeting of the two biggest goggle-eyes
in the goldfish pond, a collision of the two hottest Hyundais on
the lot.
</P>
<P>
   To Saturday's Division II baseball championship, Tampa brought
its rendition of David Wells. Only in college, those applying for
perfection have an actual waistline. Mike Valdes is a junkballer of
note, capable of doing more damage by deception than most do by
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Kennesaw State countered by assembling all the college-eligible
youth of Cobb County, Ga. capable of putting a metal truncheon to
good use. The roster that features seven starters from Cobb hit a
combined .344 this season, and had scored an average of 11 runs in
the three national tournament games leading to Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   This was to be the only possible matchup that could be certified
a true championship, No. 1-ranked Kennesaw State against No. 2
Tampa, strength going against strength. This was to be one of those
inevitable stare-downs that are intense, no matter the division.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Owls blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (15-1) was perfect for 4 2/3 innings, and close enough
the rest of the way to assemble the seventh straight complete-game
victory by Tampa's starters. A home run by Kennesaw designated
hitter Pat McPhee was the only meaningful blemish on Tampa's 6-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kennesaw returned home with a bad case of ringing in
the ears, the result of 14 Tampa hits pinging off metallic bats.
Its own ace, Chris Bowen (12-2), was ineffective for a second
tournament start. Add the fact that the Spartans ran down every
rumor of a hit _ ''the best defensive team we've run up against, by
far,'' said Owls left fielder Jason Jones _ and at least Kennesaw
State had the comfort of knowing that it was beaten by neither
fluke nor fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Owl colors are left to balance the best season any of
them are likely to know against the single most crushing loss they
have yet experienced on a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll always be disappointed in losing the last game,'' said
third baseman Nathan Cothran.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a Kennesaw State bunch that won an amazing 92 percent
of its games this season (61-5), a plundering that no one else has
approached in the decade. The Owls were ranked No. 1 for much of
the year only because there was nothing better available. They'd
trade off the bulk of the 61 for just one at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ```Unfulfilling' is the word you'd use for what we feel right
now,'' said coach Mike Sansing. Having gorged themselves all year
long, they still go away hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The championship game was a completely new experience for
Kennesaw State this season. It had lost to no one by more than four
runs until Saturday, and had never walked away from one muttering,
as did Sansing Saturday, ``I don't think we ever threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, greatness does not allow a night off.
</P>
<P>
   At stake here was the condensed version of that classic title,
``Team of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennesaw State and Tampa now have accounted for five of the last
seven Division II championships. There are 224 programs attempting
baseball at this modest level, meaning that these two have left
cleat marks upon many shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa took it all Saturday. It is the baddest poodle in the
pound.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A short guide to the nouns of summer
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One neat thing about summer is the way it can be put in front of
another word to suggest something fleeting and not to be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Is that literature? No, it's summer reading.
</P>
<P>
   Are those kids getting serious? No, it's just a summer romance.
</P>
<P>
   Is this an engaging and thoughtful film that shimmers with
unexpected insights into the human condition? Naw, just a summer
movie.
</P>
<P>
   You mean he's finally getting to work at school? No, he just
wants to hang out in the student union and meet girls in summer
dresses in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Are you going to work at a video store all your life? No, it's
just a summer job.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing similar in the other three seasons. No fall
romances, winter reading or spring jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure fall romances exist, but the language doesn't support
them. Such lovers are unsanctioned and probably in for a long, cold
winter. Spring jobs may work out that way but aren't generally
entered into with that idea. Winter reading is too grim to
contemplate except for a degree.
</P>
<P>
   We use ``summer'' as a modifier because it conjures brighter,
happier, more irresponsible images than any other season. It should
be used more widely if we are going to give summer its due. Here
are a few suggestions for starts:
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER NEWS -- Stories that only gain attention because it's a
slow news cycle. The major institutions of government are on
vacation or at half-speed. In the Sunbelt, the heat can even slow
down outdoor criminal activity because it just requires too much
exertion. Summer news is big on lottery jackpots, Beanie Babies,
anniversaries, proto-trends, pre-pre-election handicapping and
celebrities of the second-tier, rediscovered or recovering kind.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER SOFTWARE -- Clever, cheap and not overly practical
programs, usually downloaded from the Internet and installed for
only a few months. Example: a program that simulates the old Magic
Eight Ball. Click and it will display messages like: ``Concentrate
and Ask Again.'' And ``Signs Point to Yes.'' It will be off the
hard drive before the lunch boxes hit supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER SHOCK -- The sudden realization that school will be over
in only a few weeks and you have no idea what you'll do with the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER HIT -- Every summer there will be one song, one happy,
light song that will be played on seemingly every radio station in
the country as well as on MTV, VH-1 and the stereo in the next
apartment. Its simple, infectious tune will induce `It's a Small
World After All' Syndrome and come to you unbidden in your sleep.
Its first three bars will have the ability to make you climb walls
by August, begging to be put out of your misery. Then, by
September, all trace of it will vanish from the earth for 20 years.
After that time, it will be converted to a piece of amusing campy
nostalgia for kids. (This should not be confused with summer music,
which is just about anything by Jimmy Buffett.)
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER PROJECT -- An oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of ``summer'' is ``power.''
</P>
<P>
   People put the word ``power'' in front of perfectly harmless
nouns to suggest an activity more purposeful, self-improving and
dynamic than you would otherwise suspect.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a ``power breakfast'' puts a whole new spin on a
bowl of cereal. It is supposed evoke hitting the ground running
instead of sitting and staring into the scrambled eggs. I would
counter it with a ``summer breakfast'' which is never served before
10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power napping'' is supposed to show that you are recharging
for the next task. ``Summer napping'' is best done in a place where
nobody can find you for the next task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power walking'' is fast-paced, timed and on a set course.
``Summer walking'' might take you just about anywhere and make you
late for everything else.
</P>
<P>
   I could write about this more comprehensively, but that would be
contrary to the spirit of the season. This is only meant to be a
summer column.

 &HT;    Patience, tried and tested
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This isn't the time for manager Jack McKeon to
pull a Mount St. Helen's. Blowing his top isn't going to right
what's wrong with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, what you're seeing is what you'll get.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a championship team. This is not a .500 team. Nobody
promised a rose garden. Too many weeds.
</P>
<P>
   What you're getting is what $21 million will buy. It gets you
ten defeats in 13 games. It gets you 52 errors in 54 games. It gets
you five double play grounders in one game.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets you a 67-year-old manager who knows good card
players can't bluff with a bad hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as bad as we're playing right now,'' he said. ``And
when you are going bad, you can't browbeat them. You try to be
patient, try to console them, try to pick 'em up. If I thought they
weren't trying, it would be different. Hey, you evaluate your
assets, see what you got and go on. You don't beat 'em down, you
try to keep 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when you don't have much.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to make them 10 to 15 percent better as we go
along,'' McKeon said. ``Make 'em a little bit better as you go
along.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, it can test a man's constitution and Thursday
night was a difficult exam. The Reds hit into five double plays,
stranded 12 runners and failed to make two defensive plays in the
ninth inning that led to a 4-3 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon and some of his coaches were up after the game until 2
a.m. (5 a.m., eastern) rehashing what has been going on.
</P>
<P>
   It's very simple. Good pitching. Poor defense. Absolutely zero
clutch hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give our pitchers any breathing room,'' he said. ``If
they make one mistake, they get beat and that mistake is
magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon admits that even though he has a young team, there is
some dead kindling hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'd just like to back up the truck, load 'em up
and ship 'em out,'' McKeon said. ``Sometimes you'd take a lump of
coal or an old shoe for some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did when he took over the San Diego Padres in
1980. The team was flopping around in last place with some fading
veterans. He got rid of first baseman Willie Montanez, third
baseman Aurelio Rodriguez, second baseman Dave Cash, outfielder Von
Joshua, infielder Fred Kendall, pitcher Bob Shirley _ all guys who
had been good major-league players but were doing not much more in
San Diego than enjoying an extended vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought up our young players like Tim Flannery and Luis
Salazar and Dave Dravecky,'' McKeon said. ``The next year we were
at .500 and in 1984 we won the National League pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   And he had done it before. Charles O. Finley dismantled the
great Oakland teams of the early 1970s and turned over a team of
Triple-A players for McKeon to manage in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys like Scott Winchester and Eddie Priest and Jon
Nunnally and Chris Stynes. . .that team was very much like this
one,'' McKeon said. ``We made some trades and the young kids began
developing. I got fired in 1978, but Billy Martin used my players
to win the division in 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   So McKeon sees the 1998 Cincinnati Reds in much the same light
as the 1977 Oakland A's or the 1980 San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why he can't explode over inefficient play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not trying, that's different,'' he said. ``If
they're dogging it, that's different. I get upset if they don't
give me effort. This team is giving me all the effort it has.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon paused for a long puff on his always-present cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there always comes a time when you've seen enough.
And you blow your top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And games like Thursday's push the thermometer to the popping
limit. It's called growing pains, but it sometimes gives McKeon a
pain where he sits.

 &HT;    SHORT TAKES: Author, author _ kill, kill
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't usually hand out bold advice I wouldn't take myself.
Still, I was glad to hear the Manhattan Theater Club of New York
City, which has a reputation for presenting new plays and talent,
has decided to go ahead with a touchy play after getting threats
said to come from Catholic extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The play was fated for controversy. Details are sketchy. The New
York Times hears the play is about 13 gay men celebrating the
passion of Christ and sex is involved. Furious protests arrived
punctually, threatening death to playwright, theater staff and
actors. The play was canceled, then reinstated a week later after
intellectuals squawked censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics are hardly alone in objecting when values are
affronted. Name an ethnic or religious group, and you'll find an
insult that cannot be trivialized out of existence. Blacks, the
Irish, the churched and unchurched, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics,
gays, you name it, have lines that cannot be crossed. And the lines
are movable, one person's insult being another's political
correctness. I would not find a jolly parody of Auschwitz a
liberating aesthetic experience.
</P>
<P>
   As a response, violence raises the stakes far too many notches.
Art is judged by its content and moral underpinnings. If playwright
Terrence McNally has gone too far, he will be found out, and
rejected in the marketplace. The only lesson to be learned as
things now stand is that someone has invented the ultimate
heckler's veto.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Gore's all-important Internet can't replace a good
teacher
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Schoolteaching is not necessarily a conduit
to the world of metaphysics, but my colleagues and I have had a
revelation. Vice President Gore is full of baloney. Hooking kids up
to the Internet is not the universal remedy for what ails
education.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gore is, of course, sincere in his belief that high-tech
communications and information systems are going to ``fix what's
broke'' in our schools. Sincere, but misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Pudgy little hands manipulating mice (mouses? meeses?) are
impressive, but not indicative that the brain attached to the hand
is learning anything more than how to surf for cartoons or vaporize
space marauders.
</P>
<P>
   When I was five, my father spread out a schematic on the dining
room table and taught me how a Pullman car's cooling system worked.
I caught on quickly _ that's what kids do best _ sponge up data
bits. In short order, I was a parlor trick for dinner guests,
tracing and naming all of the components and their functions. But
that was all I could do. I couldn't explain (ITAL)why(END ITAL) the
system worked any more than I could have come up with an improved
design for a new one, because I had no basic knowledge. In other
words, I was uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Time, Mr. Gore wrote: ``Children in
technology-rich learning environments ... developed better writing
skills. ... Already, America is sharply divided between those with
access to computers and the Internet and those without it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right about the last part, of course. Kids without access
to the Internet can't pull up porn pics and run copies of naked
ladies in living color to share with 50 of their closest friends.
Nor can they hook up with ``chat rooms'' that thrive on the
semi-literate blatherings of a bunch of bug-eyed folks who exist
only when they're online.
</P>
<P>
   But as for writing better? I don't think so, Mr. Veep. Your
statistics don't match our experience.
</P>
<P>
   My colleagues and I have found that computers do not create
serious writers, they only enable them. Students who are still in
the mastery phase of their writing skills do a much better job when
the words flow from brain to hand to paper than they do when
they're tapping out their essays on a keyboard. We're not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because writing by hand gives the learner more time
to concentrate on content, more time to think as he works.
</P>
<P>
   Most appear to value their handwritten work much more than they
do computer-generated copy. Maybe because they see their writings
as a more direct extension of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For a few, it's a mistrust of the machine and a pervasive
concern with the vagaries of a contraption that has once too often
jumped up and
</P>
<P>
   bitten them.
</P>
<P>
   But we believe the biggest mistake comes in the way children are
introduced to computers _ with games. It's a tough mind-set to
break.
</P>
<P>
   And what about concentration? Focus is tough enough to develop
in kids without the added distraction of glitzy screens that flash
by on command. An already (naturally) limited attention span
shrinks with every click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Serious writers begin with fat pencils, wide-lined paper, and a
teacher who encourages, cajoles, illuminates, and occasionally
yells at a budding Hemingway to ``shut up and write.'' Yep, I do
that, and I've yet to run into a kid without the humor to handle
it. They tell me they like
</P>
<P>
   the attention.
</P>
<P>
   After a combined half-century of experience, my colleagues in
the classroom and I are constantly reminded that we're dealing with
people _ unique creations, who need face-to-face communication and
human feedback (loads of it), and machines, no matter how
'up-market' or high-tech, or well-connected, cannot get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mr. Gore, forget the phone tax and let's get computers into
perspective. They're tools _ not teachers.
</P>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ultra-partisan politics devouring us
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, June 3, 1998.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political carnivorousness remains unabated, partisan appetites
never satiated. Hypocrisy _ a technical-sounding term for the
droppings of a male cow _ is the main ingredient of much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Two great recent examples are the incongruous rantings of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich as he spews his double-speak bile about the
Middle East _ a breach of U.S. political ethics _ and last
weekend's so-called response to President Clinton's Saturday radio
address.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter, Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) used his time to assault
the Clinton administration for turning ``a blind eye to the evils
of illegal drugs.'' That this was a ``response'' and that Clinton's
Saturday talk had nothing to do with illegal drugs and everything
to do with prayer in the schools only documents that these
responses are not responses at all but planned political strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's script was not unique to Republicans; Democrats employed
the same tactics during the years of Reagan-Bush. If the opposition
party cannot respond meaningfully to what the president is talking
about, then it ought not respond at all.
</P>
<P>
   What made Bond's response so distasteful to me was that for all
the years (12) of the Reagan and Bush administrations, whatever
attention they gave to their highly publicized war on drugs met
with failure. Bush pumped millions into the war, trying to head off
the drugs at their origins. It was a colossal failure, partly
because it was trying to stem a tidal wave with a sponge and partly
because his hand-picked drug czar, former Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez, ran a sloppy shop fraught with political patronage. While
the nation remained a dumping ground for illegal drugs, Martinez's
office became a dumping ground for people with friends in high
places.
</P>
<P>
   Bond could have mentioned that but he didn't. His role was to
skewer the president.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gingrich, who has done much to fan the crisis
between the United States and Israel over the Palestinian
situation. On the eve of his trip to the Middle East, Gingrich
began promoting his own foreign policy, squarely on the side of the
Israelis and castigating Secretary of State Madeline Albright for,
he said, being on the side of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Constitution, in an editorial, briskly reminded
Motor Mouth of a 1984 article he wrote for the newspaper that
condemned legislative meddling in U.S. foreign policy. According to
the Constitution, Gingrich said such intrusions were dangerous,
unpatriotic and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gingrich was being critical of 10 congressmen who
wrote a letter to Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega criticizing the
Reagan administration for its policy toward Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich wrote that the letter crossed the bounds of legitimate
opposition to American policy. So did what he had to say about the
need for the U.S. to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal capital of
Israel, even though you may agree with him. It was a foreign policy
statement that crossed the bounds.
</P>
<P>
   As to his remarks about Albright, it not only was wrong but it
was highly personal, insulting and treacherous. That Gingrich later
took a photo opportunity, shaking hands with Yasser Arafat, simply
documents his duplicitous personality and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   I must repeat: The GOP does not have an exclusive on the purely
partisan tactics that are so erosive of our national integrity.
Somewhere between the radicalism of both sides sit the American
people, being lied to and deceived year after year, confused by
distorted accusations often fostered by paid political lobbyists
who really run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, in his response that wasn't, laid a lot of the blame of
violent crime on young kids using drugs. He never mentioned
anything about young kids using guns. I wonder why?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In the future, everyone will have a league of their
own
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not clear that any survey of the population would reveal a
deep yearning for another professional football league, but it
looks as though we may be getting one anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Aced out of their traditional role in televising NFL games in
the last, breathtakingly costly round of bidding for those rights,
NBC and Turner broadcasting have announced plans to create a league
of their own so as not to deny their viewers the ration of football
they have been conditioned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The two mean to bring some 10 to 12 franchises on line, perhaps
as early as the fall of '99. Previous, similar undertakings
flopped. Remember the World Football League? Neither does anyone
else. The U.S. Football League was taken off the gridiron in 1996
after failing to sizzle in three years. The attempt to interest
U.S. viewers in the affairs of the Canadian Football League
foundered on the thoughtful American conviction that Canadians
could not possibly have anything useful to do with football.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner see better prospects for their venture because by
owning the teams outright they will be able to keep salaries down,
and if that would seem to promise games that are mainly comedies of
error -- blooped punts, fumbled passes, half-fast backs -- the same
proprietorship also would let the owners script the games for
thrills. It works for the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan usefully tests basic questions of physics and sociology
that scientists have wondered about for years: How much sports can
you load on a population before the population breaks and runs
screaming into the woods? Can any game offend a viewership that
will sit still for arena football?
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there are several national cable sports channels and
scads of regional ones. Other cable channels take up sports
part-time, and the broadcast networks _ well, see above: ``bidding,
breathtakingly costly.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has swollen to 31 teams, making what used to be the
simple arithmetic task of keeping track of the standings an
exercise that now requires a background in calculus. Basketball,
which at one time was sensibly confined to plugging the few weeks
after it got too cold for football and before it was warm enough
for baseball, now sprawls all over the calendar. Hockey is played
into weather that would make short work of the polar ice caps.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dedicated television viewer, and one with the most
practiced clicker hand, can successfully fishtail among the
channels in search of content that does not require scorekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   For every Hallmark Hall of Fame drama there are a thousand
clashes between colleges you never heard of over things like
lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sports is only sports, so where's the harm? Just hope
that any success in creating their own sports exclusives doesn't
give NBC and Turner other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It will be time to worry when we hear that NBC News and CNN are
building villages near active volcanoes or arming small, nastily
disposed nations with battlefield nukes. Or slipping Hooters
trainees into the Oval Office.

   &UR; NAKED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Sedaris. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This funny, venomous and at times sad collection of 17
autobiographical essays focuses on the author's many bizarre
experiences, like a week at a nudist trailer park, as well as on
his family, particularly his witty, acerbic mother. ``Even the
bleakest of them contain stuff you shouldn't read with your mouth
full,'' Craig Seligman wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Arundhati Roy. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old woman returns to her formerly elegant home in
southern India to be reunited with her haunted twin brother, whom
she hasn't seen since a calamitous event drove them apart and
blighted their lives almost 25 years earlier. Part political fable,
part psychological drama, part fairy tale, this first novel is a
devastating meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family.
The quality of Roy's narration ``is so extraordinary _ at once so
morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple _ that the reader
remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish,''
Alice Truax said in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TROUBLE WITH PROSPERITY - A CONTRARIAN'S TALE OF BOOM,
BUST, AND SPECULATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Grant. Times Business/Random House, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic bear warns that Americans are far too smitten with the
stock market, and with an eye toward past economic cycles, he
argues that what goes up must come down. The result is ``a witty
and informative'' book, John Rothchild wrote here in 1996. In  &UR; THE
BIG TEN: THE BIG EMERGING MARKETS AND HOW THEY WILL CHANGE OUR
LIVES &LR;  (Basic Books, $14), Jeffrey Garten, a former top trade
policy adviser to Clinton, argues that 10 countries _ ranging from
India to Turkey _ are rapidly becoming major forces in the world
economy. Last year, our reviewer, Alan Tonelson, said that even if
the power of these nations is exaggerated, the book ``is a welcome
... corrective'' to the administration's Pollyanna-ish views. The
moguls behind today's global communications empires are the focus
of  &UR; THE HIGHWAYMEN: WARRIORS OF THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY &LR; , by
Ken Auletta (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13). The author of this
collection of 17 profiles, which has been updated and features a
new chapter on Microsoft, ``is a superb reporter and seems happiest
explicating the nuts and bolts of a company,'' Judith Newman said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE WITHOUT WATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Peacock. Bantam, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl named Cedar, growing up on a primitive commune in
North Carolina, describes how she and her mother survived the false
utopias of the '60s, and in the process digs deep beneath the peace
and love platitudes of the time. In 1996, our reviewer, Francine
Prose, called this a ``deft, sly, unassuming first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALVIN AILEY: A LIFE IN DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jennifer Dunning. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   This unflinching portrait of the brilliant but deeply tormented
choreographer is also a study of black dance in America during much
of the century and a social history of the turbulent theatrical
world of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. The author, a dance critic for
The New York Times, has written a ``compassionate and painstakingly
reported biography,'' Mindy Aloff wrote here in 1996. The same
publisher has issued another profile of a legendary dancer and
choreographer,  &UR; ALL HIS JAZZ: THE LIFE &AMP; DEATH OF BOB FOSSE &LR; , by
Martin Gottfried ($16.95). The outsize figure that emerges here was
furiously driven and immensely gifted in both dance and filmmaking
but was also tormented by depression and self-loathing. ``The
cardinal virtue'' of this account is the author's ``intimacy with
the show-business scene that was Fosse's chrysalis,'' Ronald Bryden
said in the Book Review in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOUNTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Derek Walcott. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This volume of poetry ranges from an elegy on the poet's mother
to fresh visits to such old haunts as New England, Europe, and his
home island, St. Lucia. While generally unimpressed with the
author's longer works, William Logan said here last year that
``Walcott is a master of ... easy, careless abundance'' and admired
``the stunned eloquence of his lines.'' The same publisher has
issued another retrospective volume by a major poet,  &UR; HISTORY OF MY
HEART &LR; , by Robert Pinsky ($12), which includes portraits of the
author's family and boyhood neighbors, among others. ``Pinsky has a
rare gift ... for action, character and atmosphere clearly and
buoyantly proportioned,'' R.W. Flint wrote in these pages in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLUB DUMAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Arturo Prez-Reverte. Translated by Sonia Soto. Vintage
International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Corso, a cynical Spanish mercenary specializing in hunting
down rare books, gets into trouble when he agrees to authenticate
both a missing chapter of ``The Three Musketeers'' and a
17th-century manual for summoning the Devil. The result is an
``intelligent and delightful novel,'' Margot Livesey said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T ERASE ME: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn Ferrell. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The eight tales in this debut collection focus on urban young
people, describing, for example, the survival techniques of a
homosexual black teen-ager, and a woman's path to becoming HIV
positive. ``It's intimate in the way you used to hope a good book
could be,'' our reviewer, Katharine Whitemore, wrote in 1997.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 23, 1998,

subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   AUTHOR-GIBBONS _ For authors, landing a spot on Oprah's Book
Club is akin to winning a literary lottery. Last fall, North
Carolina writer Kaye Gibbons went from being a critically acclaimed
author to best selling celebrity. Since then, she has been besieged
with phone calls and mail from writers who want to get in touch
with Oprah, or who want Gibbons to do for them what she did for
Charles Frazier. As a result of the pressure, Gibbons suffered
blinding migraines and insomnia, and in January threw out 900 pages
of her own Civil War novel. After weeks of around-the-clock
rewriting, she finished ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon''
and is now on tour. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MASTERP _ When ``I've Got the Hook Up'' hits the top-ten list of
box office receipts, many people (most probably over 25 years old)
will scratch their heads wondering what the heck is a ``Master P''?
We provide the answer in a bright, explainer of just who this New
Orleans rapper is and why he's so incredibly popular (his video was
No. 1 for weeks in sales selling more than 1 million copies, his
albums don't stay in the stores). (Murray, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   WOOD -- Jack Warner's woodworking column will resume next week.
(Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. The publicity about the
company's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping
sales. After all, most home users will figure a program that
attracts so many headlines must be danged important. So my job
today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first
month or so. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _
use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a
much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
Take fishing, for instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites
that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about
the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as
well. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MACREPORT_ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing
software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who will make
or break this computer. With useful, entertaining and progressive
software, the Mac will thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a
Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform.
Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED

<P>
   TECHREPORT02 _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack
of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for,
pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to
just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing? You can,
if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player.
(Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy
computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an
excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes
much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the
nine CDs that come with the deluxe version. (Warner, Atlanta

   CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct
mail and telemarketing lists? There are many ways, easy ways, to
get on the lists. To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so
simple. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade
association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of
the cost of college tuition. But a second look shows that we
actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just
tuition _ of a year in college. The American Council on Education's
study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages
$3,111. In a telephone poll, respondents guessed an average of
$9,694. That guess is not far off from the total cost, including
tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069. (Ezell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED

   KABAT-COLUMN _ In my day, they were called scrapbooks. They were
bound with twine and had big, black pages. You used Elmer's Glue,
those little triangular picture tabs and a white pencil to write
your captions. Now, they're called Memory Books. Having just
compiled one for our newly graduated high schooler, let me assure

   AUTHOR-GIBBONS _ For authors, landing a spot on Oprah's Book
Club is akin to winning a literary lottery. Last fall, North
Carolina writer Kaye Gibbons went from being a critically acclaimed
author to best selling celebrity. Since then, she has been besieged
with phone calls and mail from writers who want to get in touch
with Oprah, or who want Gibbons to do for them what she did for
Charles Frazier. As a result of the pressure, Gibbons suffered
blinding migraines and insomnia, and in January threw out 900 pages
of her own Civil War novel. After weeks of around-the-clock
rewriting, she finished ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon''
and is now on tour. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   MASTERP _ When ``I've Got the Hook Up'' hits the top-ten list of
box office receipts, many people (most probably over 25 years old)
will scratch their heads wondering what the heck is a ``Master P''?
We provide the answer in a bright, explainer of just who this New
Orleans rapper is and why he's so incredibly popular (his video was
No. 1 for weeks in sales selling more than 1 million copies, his
albums don't stay in the stores). (Murray, Atlanta

   TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. The publicity about the
company's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping
sales. After all, most home users will figure a program that
attracts so many headlines must be danged important. So my job
today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first
month or so. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _
use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a
much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
Take fishing, for instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites
that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about
the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as
well. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED

   MACREPORT_ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing
software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who will make
or break this computer. With useful, entertaining and progressive
software, the Mac will thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a
Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform.
Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go. (Haddad, Atlanta

   TECHREPORT02 _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack
of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for,
pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to
just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing? You can,
if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player.

   TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy
computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an
excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes
much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the
nine CDs that come with the deluxe version. (Warner, Atlanta

   CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct
mail and telemarketing lists? There are many ways, easy ways, to
get on the lists. To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so
simple. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, f) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade
association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of
the cost of college tuition. But a second look shows that we
actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just
tuition _ of a year in college. The American Council on Education's
study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages
$3,111. In a telephone poll, respondents guessed an average of
$9,694. That guess is not far off from the total cost, including
tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069. (Ezell,

   KABAT-COLUMN _ In my day, they were called scrapbooks. They were
bound with twine and had big, black pages. You used Elmer's Glue,

compiled one for our newly graduated high schooler, let me assure
you, I made some memories. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

<TEXT>
<P>
   In politics, as in science, pundits are always on the lookout
for a unified theory, preferably a single idea that binds together
an otherwise disparate constellation of facts and events. For the
seemingly endless stream of revelations that constitutes America's
campaign finance scandal, no explanation is as seductively simple _
or sinister _ as the China plot.
</P>
<P>
   It has all the elements of a Manchurian Candidate remake: The
mink-coat-wearing daughter of the top Chinese general. A frantic
search for satellite technology and missile guidance systems.
Intercepted communications that suggest a Beijing-directed scheme
to suborn American politicians. And lurking behind the scenes, the
People's Liberation Army, a one-time peasant force that some see as
the American military's one potential peer in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Look through the eyes of those who follow China most closely,
however, and the best of those plot lines falls flat. ``I was a
skeptic from the beginning and I remain a skeptic,'' says James
Mulvenon of the Rand Corp. in California, a specialist on the
Chinese military and its commercial ventures. ``When you have a
sense of how China works, it is hard to see these scandals as
anything but an unfortunate series of coincidences, not a plot.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by many American scholars and diplomats who
focus on China. Many say they are wary of appearing to apologize
for China's military, which has a staunch anti-American faction and
a long history of activities that promote arms proliferation. None
suggests that involvement in American politics by Chinese people
with ties to government-run businesses is either legal or proper.
And few would rule out the possibility that some element of the
military has commercial ambitions that ties to President Clinton
might help advance.
</P>
<P>
   But they question some of the received wisdom in Congress and
the media that underlie the plot theory: that China's military is a
monolith; that the army has wealth and discipline to match its
size, and that China's military, foreign ministry, defense
industry, intelligence gatherers and Cabinet can be assumed to act
with anti-American singlemindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Chas Freeman, a longtime American diplomat and China watcher,
argues that plot-seekers usually ignore the complexities of the
Chinese system. ``Unless and until there is something more concrete
linking these different stories, I cannot accept that there is a
plot,'' he said. ``This scandal is about us, not about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several of the main players in the drama are Chinese. One
of the most prominent foreigners to have sought audiences with
Clinton during the last election was Liu Chaoying, an aerospace
company executive and child of the Chinese army's most senior
general, Liu Huaqing. Mrs. Liu was reported to have given money to
the Democratic National Committee through a Taiwanese-American
fund-raiser, Johnny Chung. The People's Liberation Army also has a
vested interest in launching more foreign satellites and, of
course, in acquiring American missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of connecting those strands of information is
complicated by the fact that China's military, though it remains
opaque and wary of outsiders, does not follow the totalitarian
model, at least when the model suggests unity and discipline of the
first order. In fact, the army is closely watched these days for
the high command's attempts to steel the ranks against an insidious
foreign force: capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, a time of budget cutting, the late patriarch
Deng Xiaoping pushed military units to support themselves by doing
business, and by the end of last year the army could claim some
10,000 business enterprises within its domain, according to Jane's
Defense Weekly, an industry journal. They make phones and cars,
operate cruise ships and hotels, and own companies with listings on
domestic and foreign stock exchanges. They also produce armaments,
but some estimates put their arms-related manufacturing business at
a small fraction of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The military's vast commercial side sometimes supports national
defense, but not always. Central military authorities have
struggled to get officers to focus less on money making and more on
military preparedness. And one expert on the Chinese military, Tai
Ming Cheung in Hong Kong, says the bulk of money earned by military
companies is invested in new businesses, or used to buy luxury
goods for senior officers, or laundered overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Even further removed from the army's direct control are defense
contractors, including the China Aerospace Corporation, the parent
of Mrs. Liu's company. It reports to the government's Cabinet, not
to the generals, and is considered a commercial enterprise, albeit
with some military manufacturing duties. It has a subsidiary that
has issued shares publicly, and that company is Mrs. Liu's direct
employer, China Aerospace International. It has its headquarters
and its stock listing in Hong Kong, making it subject to the former
British colony's corporate disclosure rules. Its business line
includes telecommunications, auto parts and real estate, but not
military manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture is the fact that the companies
rarely draw sharp lines between military and commercial businesses.
China Aerospace, for example, controls Great Wall Industries, which
manages China's Long March commercial rockets and solicits launch
business from foreign satellite companies. Long March technology
overlaps that of China's nuclear-tipped missiles. But China
Aerospace and its subsidiary are also developing a separate and
purely commercial television satellite business to serve Chinese
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Those degrees of separation make it even harder to piece
together why Mrs. Chaoying might have forayed into American
politics. Was she working on behalf of Great Wall Industries and
the Long March rocket, or China Aerospace's satellite plan, or its
auto parts, or none of the above? No one knows for sure, says
Mulvenon of Rand. He also said it would not be unusual for such a
person to seek contacts or publicity in America for an entirely
separate reason, like a personal venture.
</P>
<P>
   He considers highly unlikely one other scenario _ that she was
working on behalf of her father, the now retired chief of the army,
to acquire American military technology. Or that she was on a
mission to persuade President Clinton to relax export controls on
dual-use, civilian-military goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can say with some certainty is that China is not
run like Iraq, and Liu Huaqing is not Saddam, relying on his own
children for sensitive missions,'' Mulvenon said. ``China is much
more institutionalized, not a capricious tin-pot dictatorship.'' He
said the ministry of state security would jealously guard its right
to manage an espionage mission, and the Foreign Ministry would be
unlikely to charge an aerospace company executive with an important
diplomatic duty, even if the executive had a high rank by birth.
</P>
<P>
   None of that disproves a plot by the Chinese military, these
experts say. But it raises the bar a notch for those who seek to
show that one exists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ruins of crony banks and businesses built on corruption and
special favors litter the devastated economies of Southeast Asia,
making it easy to notice what the region's leaders did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But buried under the rubble are a number of things that these
societies did right _ steps they took, or societal strengths they
preserved, that may soften the trauma of the economic crisis they
are going through. These are characteristics largely unmatched by
Latin American, African and South Asian nations like India and
Pakistan. And they may well serve as a cushion on which the
societies of Southeast Asia can bounce back once the economic panic
recedes.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president for East
Asia and the Pacific, cites three major achievements. The most
obvious is ``the good macroeconomic management that prevailed in
the region for 20, 30 years _ tight monetary policy, no fiscal
deficits, a kind of caution in the way public affairs were run,''
he said. ``Unlike the Latin American countries, this will be the
cushion that will allow them to absorb better the costs of
financial restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Second was the ``outward looking'' character of many of the
region's economies, which took to the export trade with alacrity.
Even though trade within Asia has crashed for now, they do not need
to learn how to live in a global market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Severino cited ``the tremendous investment they have
made in education'' and the quality of economic, business and
government management it has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Southeast Asia's economic crisis began with a
meltdown of Thailand's banking system last summer, it has been
tempting to envision economic catastrophe followed by
uncontrollable political turmoil. The forced resignation of
Indonesia's President Suharto strengthens that impression. Last
week, tens of thousands of South Korean workers went on strike to
protest layoffs even as Hong Kong's stock market plunged 5.3
percent and economists talked of a ``contagion'' that has now
helped undermine Russia's financial reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the economic slide can be halted? Is there a base on
which recovery might be easily built, making political stability
more likely? A number of experts think there is.
</P>
<P>
   Take education. By the mid 1990s, nearly all of Southeast Asian
children of primary age were in school, and college enrollment
rates were considerably higher than in the India-Pakistan area _ as
was literacy, especially among women. And the people of Indonesia,
the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore had at least
twice _ in some cases 60 times _ as much income per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Thailand, several Southeast Asian nations have also cut
birth rates substantially by making safe family planning methods
readily available to most ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Nolt, assistant professor of political science at the
New School and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute in New
York, said educational investment has produced not only managers
and competent public officials but also a large pool of skilled
engineers and technicians. ``These gains will survive the economic
crisis and allow these countries to be competitive producers
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with such educated managerial and middle classes, he said,
``the old forms of political rule are more subject to challenge
than they might have been in a more traditional, agriculture-based
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of politics toward multi-party democracy has been
most striking in Thailand, traditionally a self-contained monarchy.
John Bresnan, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's
East Asian Institute, said Thailand ``has had enormous success in
the last nine months,'' having headed off martial law, adopted a
new constitution, changed governments, removed the head of the
central bank and recovered some economic ground.
</P>
<P>
   Noeleen Heyzer, a Singaporean who is executive director of
Unifem, the United Nations development program for women, says
educational spending _ 20 percent or more of the budget in some
countries _ did not bypass the grass roots, as it did in many other
regions.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to rural education in Malaysia, which lured American
and other computer giants to provide the kinds of jobs that would
bring social development. Visitors to the country's free trade zone
on Penang Island a decade ago, for example, could see demure Muslim
women in head scarves at work on circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had women and men who were able to build up strong
economic assets,'' Ms. Heyzer said. ``And in introducing the idea
of computers to rural women, a mind-set was changed. So when you
get information technology, it is not something dramatically new.''
Meanwhile, she said, Singapore was moving ``from a trading center
to a labor-intensive industrial structure to a more high-tech
economy and eventually to service-information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore, under the socially visionary but politically
intolerant Lee Kuan Yew, took another step not emulated by its
Asian neighbors. It sought to eliminate corruption _ ``Asian
business practices,'' they were called _ which sapped the strength
and spirit of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Nihal Jayawikrama, executive director of Transparency
International, a private group based in Berlin that fights
corruption worldwide, said that both Singapore and Hong Kong
tackled corruption in ways his organization would not advocate _ by
fiat rather than through the natural cleansing process of open
elections, a strong and independent judiciary and a free press.
``But I think the fact that the currencies of those two countries
were affected least last year seems to suggest that there is a link
between corruption and economic crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia has a lot of other unfinished business, most
experts agree. The specter of racial attacks on wealthy Chinese
minorities who have had important economic roles hang over
Indonesia and to a lesser extent Malaysia, where laws that give
native Malays economic privileges are now being rethought.
Everywhere social services are weak, the poor are often without
health care and the unemployed have no source of compensation. The
relative equality and mobility of women has often led them into
exploitation in the sex industry or domestic servitude. And
traditional family support systems are under stress in rapidly
industrializing and urbanizing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the foundations of the economic miracle remain, said
Severino of the World Bank. ``They are the rocks on which we can
build hope for the recovery of the region.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ON their northern border, high in the Himalayas,
India and Pakistan have for years been fighting for position and
not much else along a glacier that is virtually uninhabitable. On
mountains reaching 20,000 feet, their armies snipe and trade
artillery blasts, if the weather allows. By most definitions, it is
war, but a small war. Each side loses as many soldiers to altitude
sickness as to combat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's nuclear tests by Pakistan _ coming two weeks after
India's own tests _ have abruptly and fundamentally changed the
confrontation between India and Pakistan, which had become a
limited, relatively low-intensity military standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Although both countries have had covert nuclear programs for
decades, the tests brought both much closer to actually putting
nuclear weapons in their arsenals and, worse, on the potential
battlefields along their hotly disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   That is why arms-control experts say the truly alarming thing
that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government announced on Thursday
was not that Pakistan had successfully conducted its own tests.
Rather it was the declaration that Pakistan was already fitting
nuclear warheads on top of a missile, tested only last month, that
is capable of striking most of India.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, the president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an
independent research institute here, said the development of
nuclear weapons progressed in clear stages: from research to design
to tests to the making of the bombs or warheads themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crucial threshold has been crossed, if it's true,'' Krepon
said of Pakistan's declaration about fitting its missile. ``And
that means we have only two thresholds left: deployment and use.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the rhetorical bluster by both sides, though, there is
still a large gap between conducting successful tests and building
effective, usable weapons. And that is where officials in
Washington and around the world are looking these days for a
glimmer of hope that there is still time to head off a terrifying
spiral of escalation that could draw in India's other enemy, China.
</P>
<P>
   India is said to have enough fissile material for perhaps 50
nuclear devices, maybe more. Pakistan has enough for perhaps 12.
Experts have long assumed that both can make Hiroshima-scale bombs
to drop from planes, but that is considered an unreliable way to
deliver nuclear weapons since planes can be shot down.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no evidence that either country has mastered the
ability to make warheads small enough to fit on missiles, though
not for lack of trying. Senior administration officials cast doubt
on Pakistan's claims to have already fitted its longest-range
missile with nuclear warheads. ``That would be a fateful and
foolish step,'' one official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the mere claim was sure to leave India's nuclear
strategists wondering, intensifying already inflamed emotions. And
the experts agreed it is only a matter of time before both can
field nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years both India and Pakistan have come to rely more
and more on their strategic forces. Pakistan, in particular, has
poured its scarce resources into developing nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles, purchasing equipment and technology from China,
as well as North Korea. (More than a quarter of Pakistan's federal
spending goes to defense, compared to 14 percent for India.)
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has taken this route to compensate for an overwhelming
disadvantage in conventional forces. India has twice as many
soldiers _ nearly 1.2 million to about 600,000 _ and twice as many
combat aircraft. What's more, much of Pakistan's population and
economic heart lie within easy striking distance of India's border,
leaving it vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   While Pakistan has a number of short-range missiles, it tested
its first longer-range missile just last month, a test that India
cited as provocation when it conducted its nuclear tests.
Pakistan's missile is said to have a range of 900 miles, which
would bring most of India's major cities within striking distance.
Although built with North Korean help, Pakistan named it the
Ghauri, after a Muslim warrior who defeated a 12th-century Hindu
ruler of India named Prithvi.
</P>
<P>
   While Pakistan lags behind India in conventional forces, many
experts say it may have an edge in missiles. India's most effective
missiles, the Prithvi series, have relatively short ranges. And
while India has tested a longer-ranged missile, called the Agni, it
has yet to complete its development.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the United States and other countries are
scrambling to stop South Asia's suddenly revived arms race before
it escalates any further. On Friday, the United Nations Security
Council called on India and Pakistan to sign the treaties against
the spread and testing of nuclear weapons that, until now, had
limited the world's declared nuclear powers to the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and China.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that India and Pakistan will call a halt to their
nuclear programs where they now stand, although neither has so far
shown much willingness to heed the world's pleas. The Pakistanis
``are ready to die for their respect,'' Sharif warned in a
televised address to his nation, brushing aside the sanctions the
United States imposed only hours later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the best hope may lie with the fact that a fundamental
taboo has existed against the use of nuclear weapons ever since the
world learned what those weapons could do when the United States
dropped them on Japan to end World War II. That and the prospect of
``mutually assured destruction,'' known widely by the grim acronym
MAD, kept the United States and Soviet Union from firing them
throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But India and Pakistan have suddenly made the specter of a
nuclear exchange seem less remote. The United States and the Soviet
Union, after all, never shared a border. Nor did they directly
quarrel over a territory as volatile as Jammu and Kashmir, the
predominantly Muslim enclave carved up after India and Pakistan
gained independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unresolved disagreements, deep animosity and distrust, and the
continuing confrontation between their forces in disputed Kashmir
make the subcontinent a region with a significant risk of nuclear
confrontation,'' the Pentagon concluded in a report published
before this month's tit-for-tat tests.
</P>
<P>
   Arms-control experts now worry that the world could be closer to
nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis in
1962. That was the only time in the 53 years of the nuclear age
when it seemed likely that any two nuclear powers might descend
into direct large-scale hostilities with each other. American and
Chinese troops fought in the Korean War, but that was long before
China had nuclear weapons; China and India fought a border war in
1962, but that was before either went nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   In those same 53 years. India and Pakistan have fought three
wars and have perpetually seemed on the verge of a fourth _ never
with more devastating potential consequences than now.

<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Between retrieving thrown juice cups and
cleaning up crushed cookies, the moms in the mother-toddler program
at the Irish Community Center here talk about home. But unlike
generations of homesick Irish women before them, many of them
aren't just talking. They're going.
</P>
<P>
   With the Irish economy thriving and now an agreement for peace
in the long-bloody North _ resoundingly ratified in a referendum
last weekend _ the motherland's pull on its exiles in America seems
more powerful than ever. Many young Irish adults are breaking with
earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United
States for good: The Irish government reports that over the last
two years, 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America
than went the other way.
</P>
<P>
   That reversal breaks with previous decades of Irish immigration
to the United States, one of the oldest, largest, most sustained
and most culturally influential migration flows of American history
_ reaching nearly a million in the 1850s after the Irish potato
famine, but dwindling lately to just a few thousand a year.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years now, the Irish have been celebrating the
surprising return of their countrymen from England and Australia as
well as America, a trend that the peace agreement seems sure to
accelerate. Now the Irish in America, who once saw little choice
but to come here, are confronted with a happy dilemma: choosing
between this land of opportunity and a land more familiar to them
that has been newly vested with promise.
</P>
<P>
   To economists, Ireland is now ``the Celtic tiger.'' Thanks
largely to American and other foreign investments in high-tech
manufacturing plants for computers, pharmaceuticals and other
products, newly created jobs have brought unemployment in Ireland
down to 9 percent from nearly 16 percent in 1993. Investors, in
turn, are bullish largely because next year Ireland (unlike
neighboring Britain) will adopt the European Union's unified
currency, the euro. Participation in the euro imposes economic
discipline on countries using it and is expected to reduce the cost
of doing business within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry J. Sexton, a labor-market specialist for the Economic and
Social Research Institute in Dublin, said most of those returning
from the States are in their mid-20s to mid-30s, and typically have
some education or skills.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, his assessment is affirmed in interviews
with Irish immigrants. James Dalton, an Irishman who owns Dublin
Construction Inc. in Queens, N.Y., said he typically employs 20 of
his countrymen as carpenters or laborers _ and typically one leaves
for home every week. After spending the day refitting a pub in
mahogany, two of his 20-year-old carpenters _ both out of Ireland
just two months _ ordered a round of Guinness and confided their
dream: saving enough money to start a construction business back
home.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the Irish bars that dot New York, similar stories are
being told, some that sound much like the fantastic tales that
envious dreamers in the Old World once told about America. Seamus
Gillespie, a 44-year-old asbestos remover who was sharing a pint
and a cigarette with a co-worker and his fiancee at another bar in
Woodside, leaned in to give the news about the Irish economy.
``They're not building houses,'' he said. ``They're building
mansions!''
</P>
<P>
   Historians of American immigration say revolving-door migrations
like this one are nothing new, despite popular myths about America
as the promised land. But they note that the Irish exodus is
unusual in that it seems to involve whole households (as opposed to
men without families), making the departure of the Irish more
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kerby Miller, a history professor at the University of
Missouri who specializes in Irish immigration, calls the turnabout
simply astonishing for a people long motivated by starvation and
political and religious repression to forsake their homeland. In
the past, he said, ``Irish immigrants longed to return, at least
sentimentally, but they realized it was impractical or
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors motivating the new Irish returnees, Irish
immigration counselors say, are frustrations and delays in winning
American citizenship, given the United States' current
anti-immigrant political climate. Lately, though, the peace
agreement for the British province of Northern Ireland provides
another positive for those already weighing a decision to return.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Irish Community Center in Yonkers to pick up his
wife and young son, Andrew Convery, a taxi driver from the Bronx,
said the prospects for peace are a big factor in their decision to
return. A Catholic from Northern Ireland, he came here six years
ago in search of the American dream, and met his future wife,
Kerry, a Catholic from Dublin, when he picked her up as a fare. Now
they are moving back so their 1-year-old, Ciaran, can be raised the
way they were. But without the bombs. ``Before, there wasn't much
to go back to,'' Convery said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish exodus raises as yet unanswerable questions about the
subtler cultural effects on two countries that have long drawn on
the richness of the other. Lately in the United States, Irish
culture, once shunned by the upper crust, has enjoyed a broad
revival. ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning
memoir of growing up poor in Limerick (interestingly enough, after
his family returned from America), has been on The New York Times
Best-Seller List for 89 weeks. And in recent years, ``Lord of the
Dance,'' the choreographed extravaganza created by Michael Flatley,
an Irish-American, has made Irish folk-dancing almost hip.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish cultural vibrancy here could be diluted by Ireland's
new drawing power, says Dr. Timothy J. Meagher, the director of the
Center for Irish Studies at Catholic University in Washington.
``Now these people are going back,'' he said. ``If you lose the
immigrant base, it threatens the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Irish from the United States can be expected to
increase as the Irish government and business groups rev up the
welcome wagon. Ireland's Department of Social Welfare, which
earlier published ``Thinking of Going to London?'' and ``Thinking
of Going to the United States?'' last year switched gears and put
out ``Thinking of Returning to Ireland?'' _ a guide to housing,
pensions and workers' rights.

   Russian Economic Woes Spark Investor Panic
</P>
<P>
   Panic swept through Russia's financial markets as foreign
investors feared that the ruble would be devalued. Interest rates
tripled and the stock market plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   From the White House to the Kremlin, officials were concerned
that the setback could destabilize the new Russian democracy. By
the end of the week, there was some good news: the International
Monetary Fund said it would provide the next $670 million
installment of its $10 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin government officials were worried that the IMF money
was too little, too late. It sent a team to Washington to discuss
the need for billions of dollars in additional financing.

   U.S. May Have Helped India Hide Nuclear Test Sites
</P>
<P>
   An intelligence board will report this week on why the United
States failed to foresee this month's nuclear tests by India, which
spurred tests in Pakistan and incited what President Clinton calls
a ``dangerous arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington may have unwittingly schooled India in the art of
deception. In December 1995, spy satellites saw India preparing for
a nuclear test. United States diplomats showed the spy satellite
photos to Indian officials in persuading them not to test.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a triumph of diplomacy may have been an
unintended gift to India. Some government officials now say that
showing those photos to the Indians revealed how the United States
spied on the test site, and thus enabled India to conceal its
preparations this time around.

   Court Backs Police In High-Speed Chases
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people die every year as the result of
high-speed police chases. A Supreme Court decision has now reduced
nearly to the vanishing point the chance that any of their families
will be able to collect damages, even for police behavior that is
reckless to the point of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously ruled that only a chase undertaken with
``a purpose to cause harm'' can be found to violate the
constitutional guarantee of due process. The justices overturned a
ruling by the federal appeals court in California _ home of the
televised high-speed chase _ that had set the more
plaintiff-friendly standard of ``deliberate indifference'' as the
measure of police liability. Deliberation was not a sensible test
for a situation that calls for split-second judgment, Justice David
Souter said.

   Starr Wants Quick Decision
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, asked the
Supreme Court to rule quickly on whether two of President Clinton's
aides must appear before the grand jury investigating the Monica
Lewinsky matter. A federal judge in Washington had ordered the
aides to appear, but the White House is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, Sidney Blumenthal and Bruce Lindsey, have refused to
answer some questions _ citing executive privilege and
attorney-client privilege _ about conversations they had with the
president, the first lady and other officials and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky stopped by the local FBI office to give handwriting
samples and fingerprints to investigators who have spent the last
few months attempting to corroborate some of the things she said
about the president in conversations recorded by her former friend,
Linda Tripp.

   Lyme Disease Vaccine Gets Cautious Push
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United
States, and its sometimes debilitating symptoms _ arthritis and
damage to the nervous system and heart _ underscore the need for a
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration
recommended approval of the first such vaccine, but with
ambivalence about its safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It takes three injections and a year to gain maximum protection,
about 80 percent. But no one knows how often booster doses will be
required or whether repeated shots will be safe. Also uncertain is
whether the vaccine is safe for those with arthritis or undetected
Lyme disease. The committee called on the manufacturer, SmithKline
Beecham, to continue testing the vaccine, particularly in children.
For now, it is recommended only for people from 15 to 70.

   Making Money at Home
</P>
<P>
   Even as the tides of free trade, globalized investments and
regional currencies are washing over every continent, there are
islands of resistance.. In 66 towns and villages in Canada and the
United States, people are printing their own money _ from Sand
Dollars in Bolinas, Calif., to Mountain Money in Hot Springs, N.C.,
to Thread City Bread in Willimantic, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   All of these currencies, printed in kaleidoscopic colors, tend
to be denominated in hours, with one hour worth $10. But they are
not simply displays of design and engraving.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a system designed to promote the use of a
scrip that can only be used locally, so that trade will stay a bit
more securely within the communities.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Ithaca, N.Y., where the system has been running
for seven years, the equivalent of millions of dollars in business
has been done in the local currency, Ithaca Hours, and it is
accepted by a local hospital, a federal credit union, grocery and
book stores, hair salons and chiropractors.

   A Growing Case Against Swiss Banks
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited report sponsored by the Swiss government
confirmed the central bank's complicity in accepting gold looted
from Holocaust victims, bolstering allegations by Jewish groups
that Switzerland traded in wartime misery. Not only did Swiss
bankers ignore the gold's origin, they also considered melting it
down to disguise it, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report, produced by a panel of nine Swiss and
international historians, discounted profit as a motive, it noted
the Swiss National Bank was Germany's biggest client, buying gold
that would be worth $2.5 billion today. The study, meant to show
Switzerland's willingness to come clean on its wartime record, only
upped the ante for Jewish leaders, who intensified demands for
reparations.

<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Talk about political culture shock. A day after
votes were counted in the Northern Ireland peace referendum, I flew
from Belfast to San Francisco to catch the final week of the
California primary campaign. After a month immersed in the low-tech
modesty of Irish politics (and writing about it for The New York
Times), I was greeted at the airport by an electronic stand-in for
the mayor and chief municipal showboat, Willie Brown Jr. In a
message that boomed from above, and over and over, in the
international arrivals terminal, Brown introduced himself and
welcomed each and every visitor (and prospective voter) to what he
grandly called ``My city.''
</P>
<P>
   Had I not been in Ireland 14 hours earlier, I would not have
thought twice about this bold piece of self-promotion by a
politician who is not even up for re-election. But I arrived in
California with a fresh perspective: Only days earlier, strategists
for the Yes campaign in Northern Ireland bickered for 20 minutes
(with reporters in the room, no less) over whether it would appear
too cynical to print T-shirts with a big, bold, ``YES'' emblazoned
across the front. (They went ahead with the idea and it did not
seem to put off voters; the referendum passed easily.)
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unfair to compare two election campaigns that not
only are half a world apart but could not be more different. In
Ireland, voters were trying to resolve one of the bloodiest, most
enduring conflicts of this century. The voting in California on
Tuesday is, to put it gently, not nearly as historic. Voters here
are being asked to elect nominees for governor, the Senate and the
House, and choose an array of initiatives and local candidates.
Important? Sure. War and peace? No.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for a reporter who has witnessed dozens of American
elections over the last two decades, watching the campaign unfold
in Ireland was a refreshing civics lesson, if also an ultimately
depressing one. While the Irish appeared hopelessly, even
laughably, naieve about how to campaign, their approach seemed
closer to genuine democracy. By contrast, the American system looks
worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of politicians to break through to American voters
has been an undercurrent of campaigns for years, particularly in
California, where the beaches are a more powerful draw than
politics. But the depth of indifference here is even more striking
when contrasted to Ireland. While people there were not
particularly optimistic that the referendum would change anything,
they had enough hope in their politicians and the process that they
were not about to pass on voting altogether. By contrast,
Californians simply don't think it's important to vote. After a
reasonably deep conversation here last week with a friend who is
well educated and well-versed in current events (he once lived in
Washington), he asked, ``When's the election, anyway?'' It was a
question I never encountered _ not once _ in hundreds of
conversations in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Some politicians
groused that the turnout in the Irish Republic was only about 60
percent of the voting-age population. In California, experts
predict turnout could sink below 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While it is to be expected that voting for the more
consequential Ulster peace accord would draw more attention, the
Irish turnout was no anomaly. Irish voting has remained relatively
constant over the years, while turnout in California keeps
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast I mocked the primitive way in which the campaign was
conducted. Rather than buying television commercials, both sides
fought with rudimentary placards hung on lampposts. The Yes
campaign's poster was a particularly easy object of ridicule. It
was intended to look like a road sign, but instead resembled an eye
examination chart.
</P>
<P>
   Here, by contrast, candidates for governor and Senate have
pumped tens of millions of dollars into pelting one another with
30-second commercials that, with their screaming red headlines and
threatening attacks, are intended to sway the tiny minority that
will actually vote. After nearly a week of exposure to those
pitches, I still do not feel I have a grasp of just what these
politicians would do if elected.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland there was no political television advertising, but
the referendum dominated news and public affairs programs. In
California it is possible to watch hours of local news here without
knowing there is an election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   American voters and political reporters, wise to the techniques
of modern politics, are often numb to the consequences of campaign
by focus group. So it was cheering to visit a place where even a
whiff of manipulation rankled voters. The biggest controversy
involving strategy in the Irish campaign came when the press got
hold of a memorandum written by the communications director of the
Northern Ireland Office of the British government that outlined how
to win passage of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, the memorandum was pretty tame, with
suggestions of a ``daily handling meeting'' to plot strategy for
``exerting some influence on the content and quality of media
coverage.'' There was such outrage over what people viewed as
unprecedented manipulation that the Northern Ireland Office backed
off some of its plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unremarkable,'' Kathleen Stevens, the United
States Consul General in Northern Ireland, said of the document.
``But it did a lot of damage. It made everybody shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to campaigns here, where every uttered word, every
slogan is tested and vetted and tested again. Al Checchi, a
multimillionaire businessmen seeking the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, started his advertising by not mentioning his party and
making broad bipartisan appeals. Then he abruptly shifted,
presenting himself as a proud Democrat. No one thinks Checchi's
turnabout reflected a genuine change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Ireland were refreshing to interview because, while
they were suspicious about the peace treaty itself, there was
little grousing about politicians or the political process.
Virtually every person I confronted on the street for any interview
was cheerful and happy to talk. One elderly couple invited me to
their house for tea on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The friendliness no doubt reflects the culture, even in a place
where people have been at war for years. But it also may reflect
the fact that people in Ireland do not live in a world of 30-second
attack commercials. Irish voters may hate each other, but this
time, at least, their politics wasn't hateful.
</P>
<P>
   My journey to Ireland left me longing for a simpler American
politics, one where heartfelt speeches mean more than television
spots, where it is possible to interview a candidate without having
to calibrate the gap between spin and truth. Like the Irish, I hope
things will change. Like them, I doubt they will.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'll dwell on the benefits of this country's
high-tech wizardry. In Ireland, we had to wait an excruciating day
for officials to tally yes-or-no ballots. There is no such dallying
in this land of short attention spans. As I write this sentence,
the experts have already projected most of the victors on Tuesday.
Come Wednesday, I'll be long gone, on to the next campaign.

   Godzilla was going about his business in a Times Square theater
one afternoon last week when he discovered a murdered infant
godzilla and shrieked in anguish (118 decibels). Then he was
strafed by fighter jets (105 to 115 decibels for five minutes).
Finally, he died (67 decibels).
</P>
<P>
   As a wave of ear-splitting summer movies arrives at theaters,
ears ache or hiss or buzz the way they do after a rock concert. The
moviegoers to whom they are attached wonder whether it's just their
imagination or whether the volume of the soundtrack was at
jet-engine levels. Almost: Jets take off at an eardrum-rupturing
150 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course movies are louder than they used to be,'' said
Leonard Maltin, the critic for the television program Entertainment
Tonight. ``It's a question of whether it's an entertainment or an
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is the result of the digital-sound age, which has
brought hiss-free soundtracks and multi-channel systems with more
knobs and meters than an airplane cockpit. And there are giant
subwoofers under seats and speakers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not just with the equipment in theaters. When
big-budget films are mixed in a way that makes gunfire
crystal-clear but muffles the speech, some frustrated moviegoers
see a metaphor for everything that is wrong with Hollywood. They
long for perfectionist projectionists like the Philippe Noiret
character in ``Cinema Paradiso.''
</P>
<P>
   Uneasiness about ear-splitting volume in movie theaters prompted
a panel discussion at the Cannes Film Festival this month titled,
``Are Movies Too Loud?'' The consensus seemed to be yes, according
to Variety, the show business newspaper that was a sponsor of the
session. It said that creative types and executives shared a common
concern about too-loud soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the movies for a bigger experience than other
entertainment,'' Variety quoted Mario Van Peebles, the director of
the 1991 drug-world drama ``New Jack City,'' as saying, ``but they
have to be able to hear the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   How loud the sound should be is already an issue for the Newport
International Film Festival in Rhode Island, and it doesn't even
open until Tuesday. The festival's organizers have been holding
test screenings in their rented theater, a gilt-trimmed relic from
the days of pipe organs and uniformed ushers. They listen for a
minute or two, then ask each other, Is that too loud?
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect a movie now to be like a roller coaster ride,''
said Christine Schomer, the festival's executive director. ``With
these summer movies especially, every one has to out-top each
other, and the only way to do that is to make them as loud as
possible. And the thing is, the movie costs so much, they're
tricking us into thinking it's more entertaining the louder it
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   How loud? At a showing of ``Quest for Camelot'' in Stamford,
Conn., the decibel level was in the 70 to 75 range, with 85- to
90-decibel bursts. But the previews were even louder: one for
``Rugrats'' registered 80 decibels, except when it surged to 87.
The moment it started, a 4-year-old clamped her hands over her ears
and kept them there. ``Put it softer, Mommy,'' she implored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth,'' in a New York City theater, was in the 68- to
70-decibel range. But during the louder sequences when Warren
Beatty was delivering line after line of rapping rhyme, the meter
climbed to 106, even 109 at one point. That is significantly louder
than a garbage truck (85 decibels), jackhammer (88 decibels) or a
car alarm (80 decibels).
</P>
<P>
   But going strictly by numbers misses a more fundamental point.
Several times at a another showing of ``Bulworth,'' one back-row
moviegoer repeatedly asked her husband what Beatty had just said.
Patricia King Hanson, the editor of the American Film Institute
Catalog, sees irony in the notion that Beatty has become hard to
hear. He was, she said, ``one of the great pioneers in having this
ultraloud sound in `Bonnie and Clyde.'''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Godzilla'' is what ``Bonnie and Clyde'' has wrought. But
too-loud soundtracks are about more than monsters that are longer
than the lines outside the theater. Noise causes stress, even
hearing loss. Various studies have linked prolonged exposure to
noise of between 85 and 115 decibels with an assortment of
physical, mental and social problems ranging from hypertension to
helplessness, from learning disabilities to birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday noise can send a sound-level meter into the overload
zone, and there is no question that entertainment is noisier than
it was before the invention of electric guitars. But Tom Horral,
the technical director of Acentech, an acoustical-engineering
company in Boston, blames the complaints about overly loud movies
on 1990's technology that eliminated so-called residual noise,
making the soundtrack purer. In the bass range, for instance,
sounds that once were distorted into noise by increasing the volume
can now be played loudly without significant distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplexing has created another problem: Sound spills into the
theater next door. ``In the building and planning of multiplexes,''
Maltin said, ``they think they take this into account. What they
haven't taken into account is the vibrations caused by the ever
more sophisticated sound systems. When Godzilla stomps its mighty
foot, they want the theater to shake from not just the sound but
the tremor.''  &QL;

   Carol Hersh-Weiss collects, and then some. To enter her
sprawling New York City apartment is to venture into the nooks and
crannies of her decidedly idiosyncratic mind. Along one wall are 19
pairs of shoes, a small part of a collection of black shoes.
Elsewhere soda bottles bearing forgotten brand names like ``Cheer
Up,'' ``Dream'' and ``Just Whistle.'' Hidden in a drawer are
thousands of erasers, including one shaped like Ronald Reagan's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Antique quilts are everywhere, well over 100 the last time
anybody counted. They have multiplied in value 10 times over in the
last 15 years, with many worth more than $1,000. Mrs. Hersh-Weiss,
a professional potter, has told her husband, Norman, a
mathematician at Queens College, that quilts beat the stock market
hands down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make more money on my quilts than he can on Microsoft
and Intel,'' she said. ``He's not going to double his money and I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersh-Weiss's optimism is shared by millions of other
Americans who are taking advantage of the strong economy to collect
stamps and coins as well as used beer cans in the hope that they
will increase in value. One in three Americans collect something.
Most of them don't care that collectibles, which is a term for
items made solely for the enjoyment of the collector, have
historically decreased in value than increased. They are more
concerned about the proliferation of fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Trade magazines estimate the collectibles market to be
approaching $10 billion in annual sales, and stories of resale are
legend. The Jetsons lunch box bought for $1 at a garage sale in
1980 fetching $200 today. The 1955 Murray fire truck that sold for
$50 in 1993 worth $250. The unused Hawaiian missionary stamp
selling for $575,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the collectibles action is on the Internet, where
millions participate in auctions held at hundreds of sites. It
helps to be in the news. Frank Sinatra memorabilia is suddenly hot.
All things connected with the millennium items will be collected.
</P>
<P>
   But white-hot publicity can be as fleeting as a sound bite: When
Princess Diana died, autographed pictures that had been worth
$1,500 immediately jumped to $50,000. The price has since drifted
back to about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the amount of material related to the events surrounding
Princess Diana's death and burial, it is safe to assume that supply
will exceed demand for centuries, not decades, to come,'' wrote
Harry L. Rinker in Antiques &AMP; Collecting Magazine. ``Even if 90
percent ends up in the landfill, supply will exceed demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the supply-and-demand equation more in evidence than
in the area of instant heirlooms. The Franklin Mint sells them by
the hundreds of thousands, including its non-firing replica of
Wyatt Earp's six-shooter and a 24-inch porcelain doll of Marilyn
Monroe in a feathered headdress. The company is in the business of
selling the glorious illusions that most resonate with the average
person. It bought Jacqueline Onassis's faux pearls for $211,500 at
auction and made replicas that became runaway best sellers at $195
each.
</P>
<P>
   But true value hinges on scarcity _ a bitter truth learned by
the 17th-century Dutch when speculators drove the price of tulips
to astronomic levels, only to see it crash with an abundant tulip
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Today collectors seem motivated more by love, often tinged with
nostalgia, than by thoughts of making a killing. ``People end up
buying themselves a present in a way that means something,'' said
Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center who has personally collected 25,000 comic books; baseballs
autographed by Babe Ruth, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle and Yogi
Berra, and Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers ray guns. Still, Manevitz
worries that people, including some of his patients, become  &UR; too &LR; 
obsessed. ``You shouldn't define yourself through your things,'' he
said, sounding almost convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lose myself in it,'' said Hank Seiden, an avid
collector who runs an advertising agency in his spare time. From
the time he bought bought an F.D.R. autograph for $5 as a
teen-ager, he has always set a goal in his collecting. He now owns
the signatures of all United States presidents, and all members of
Yankees teams in 1927, 1941, 1951 and 1961. ``I'm not a nut,'' he
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Luck matters in collecting. On May 24, Yankee Stadium offered a
free Beanie Baby to every child. Produced in limited quantities,
other versions of the plush toys have gotten prices of nearly
$3,000, but the financial windfall, finally, seems to be ebbing.
Except perhaps for the free teddy bears given out by the Yanks:
Each of these carries a certificate with the date of the game when
David Wells pitched a perfect game. A cuddly, properly dated
specimen already resides in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

   With its brassy boardwalk, bar and shopping-mall culture, New
Jersey is the ancestral home of the attitudinal T-shirt _ the ones
that say things like ``I'm Not as Think as You Drunk I Am'' in
blurry letters.
</P>
<P>
   Little surprise, then, that Gov. Christie Whitman chose to
proclaim her state's border victory over New York last week by
gleefully displaying a T-shirt that said, ``Ellis Island, N.J.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was celebrating a triumph in a once-obscure dispute
between New Jersey and New York over boundaries in the middle of
the Hudson River. In a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that
24.2 acres of Ellis Island landfill were actually in New Jersey,
and not in New York as everyone had assumed since the island was
expanded starting in the late 19th century to process the arrival
of 12 million immigrants. The original 3.3 acres _ on which the
main hall and immigration museum stand _ remain in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which state map it is on, Ellis Island is a national
park, owned by the federal government. Each year 1.6 million
tourists visit it. Last week, reporters dispatched to the island to
get reaction to the border victory found a wall of people who might
as well have been wearing those T-shirts that say, ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the public seemed to care little about state
sovereignty over the revered pile of land (and landfill) with the
breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan
skyline _ the place where the ancestors of an estimated 40 percent
of today's Americans first set foot in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, politicians and their amen choruses among the
news media seemed to care quite a lot. Mrs. Whitman, for example,
proclaimed herself ``delighted that the Supreme Court has
officially recognized New Jersey's place in history,'' and
triumphantly set off for a Republican Party fund-raiser in Ohio,
where she asserted that the Ellis Island victory was proof that she
still had relevance as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to remain on the sidelines, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York City scoffed at the idea that New Jersey had any valid
claim on the island's mythology. Giuliani said he was certain his
immigrant grandfather hadn't told himself, ``I'm coming to New
Jersey'' when he boarded a ship in Genoa. ``He knew he was coming
to the streets of New York,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Finnegan, a professor of politics at Stone Hill College
in Easton, Mass., said, ``It seems to me there was a lot of `My
state can lick your state' in all this.'' Finnegan said he was
astonished at ``the exaggerated attention to a matter that most
people think is pretty minor at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we aren't exactly talking the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act
here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case took five years and generated 2,000
documents and 4,000 pages of testimony, prompting Justice David
Souter to remark ruefully in his majority opinion on the
``succession of legal fees and expenses arising from interstate
boundary disputes.'' The litigation undoubtedly cost New Jersey
taxpayers far more than can ever be recouped from the state's newly
staked claim to a portion of the sales tax revenue generated by
island's gift and snack shops.
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan said he was intrigued by the Ellis Island news bubble
because of its similarity to another recent scene in modern
political theater. He was referring to a ploy by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., who earlier this year slipped the following words
into a routine bill authorizing federal money for research on the
Great Lakes: ``The term Great Lakes includes Lake Champlain.''
Thus, Lake Champlain, a comparative sliver of water between Vermont
and New York, suddenly became the sixth Great Lake _ to the delight
of regional politicians, area Chambers of Commerce and the local
news media, but to the horror of national geographers and
historians.
</P>
<P>
   The law was quickly rewritten to withdraw the distinction, but
the brouhaha lifted Leahy's stock. In the end, Finnegan said, both
the Lake Champlain and Ellis Island furors were prime examples of
what he called ``policy as entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ellis Island commotion really represents the
infantilization of politics,'' he added, ``driving it down to the
seventh-grade level: `My state whipped your state.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some reaction in New Jersey seemed to support that notion.
``It's about pride,'' crowed an editorial celebrating the Ellis
Island victory in The Star Ledger of Newark, New Jersey's largest
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really about respect, not money,'' said Bret
Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, who nevertheless noted that
Ellis Island, N.J., now falls within his city's boundaries and is
potentially part of Jersey City's urban empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of commercial development is barely submerged under
any discussion of change in landlords on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has not indicated whether it might pressure the
National Park Service to allow more development on Ellis Island,
N.J. But preservationists have been fretting for years about the
fate of that part of the island, which contains the medical
buildings where the sick and contagious were once treated. In 1992,
preservationists blocked a Park Service plan that would have
allowed a developer to demolish the old buildings and build a hotel
or conference center. Now they fear similar proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Ellis Island as a national park that needs money for
historical preservation has been swamped by the hoopla in the past
week, said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk has been bragging rights and sales tax and who
gets what _ but we're missing the history part,'' she said. ``Ellis
Island is the only national park in the country that some people
look on as a development site waiting for a hotel and conference
center.''

<P>
   All the brouhaha last week over the dropping of remedial classes
at the City University of New York, one of the nation's largest
systems, would make many people think that remediation was a
multicultural course invented by CUNY professors.
</P>
<P>
   They would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 78 percent of America's colleges offered such classes,
up from 73 percent in 1988. Although they were most prevalent at
public community colleges (96 percent of them offered these courses
in 1995), they were common at four-year colleges, too, with 72
percent offering the courses.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of
Education, found that almost half of all college students took at
least one class to prepare them for college-level work. At CUNY
last year, 46 percent of students entering four-year colleges
failed one or more of the placement examinations in reading,
writing and math. At the California State University System, about
half the freshmen need such classes to acclimate them to the rigors
of academia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ivy League, the official line is that there are no
remedial courses or underprepared students, but these institutions
typically provide help in different guises. Harvard and Yale, for
instance, offer peer tutors and a writing center. At the University
of Chicago, a handful of students are directed each year to a
course called essential mathematics that begins with arithmetic,
algebra and geometry _ comparable to the remedial math courses at
CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   So why are so many high-school graduates unprepared for college?
</P>
<P>
   One explanation, educators say, is that there is a gap between
what many secondary schools expect their students to know and what
college professors require, and that there has not been enough
coordination between them. Another is that many high schools offer
preparatory courses but students fail to take them, either because
they are not planning to go to college or because they think they
can get by without them. In some cases, they get weak instruction;
sometimes they do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have been allowed to coast,'' said Joseph Creech,
director for educational policies at the Southern Regional
Education Board in Atlanta. ``If students are going to have to be
able to do certain things when they get to college, then we have to
make these expectations clear in high school, and even in middle
school.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time many of these ill-prepared students simply did not
go to college. But in a technology-driven, information-based
economy, where a college diploma is a passport to a higher standard
of living, more students are continuing their education.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of university administrators and college
officials do not see this trend as good news. To them, each
remedial student represents a failure, and wasted resources _ a job
that has to be done at least twice thus diverting colleges from
their real mission of providing higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Remediation is such a dirty word that some colleges will not
even admit to offering it, although their catalogs list courses in
algebra, grammar and other subjects many students routinely take in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that it is despoiling the environment,'' said
H. Patrick Swygert, president of Howard University in Washington.
``Remediation _ the word _ is verboten on this campus because it
carries with it all the stigma that its opponents have trotted out
that students who need it are less than fully qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do not qualify intellectually or have the
inclination to do the hard intellectual work required in college,''
Swygert added. ``The great tragedy is that by removing remedial
classes, that is not who is being screened out. The numbers suggest
that once students navigate the remedial classes, many go on to
successful college careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Few colleges have approached moving remediation off campus with
the fervor of the trustees at the CUNY, who despite widespread
protests from faculty and students, voted last week to phase out
remedial classes at their four-year colleges by 2001. Students
failing placement exams will be directed to intensive summer or
weekend classes, or to the two-year community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of these students would be able to
complete these courses quickly, how many will opt for community
colleges or how many will choose other four-year colleges or simply
drop out in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But CUNY is not alone in trying to reduce its remediation.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities, like the University of Maryland, are trying
to foster closer coordination between secondary schools and
colleges about what ground will be covered in certain courses.
</P>
<P>
   The California State University, the largest public university
in the country with 360,000 students, has set a goal of reducing
the percentage of freshmen needing remediation to 10 percent by
2007 from more than 50 percent now. The trustees, who had hoped to
move faster, scaled back in the face of criticisms that they would
penalize immigrants and minority students who had attended poor
high schools and fared poorly in placement exams.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reed, who became chancellor of California State
University system in March, said he would like to follow a program
similar to the one he introduced at the University of Florida in
1985, where it offers no remedial courses; students needing them
must go to community colleges or other institutions. The students,
however, can still register for university classes at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be some students who need
remediation,'' Reed said. ``But universities are not as well
prepared to do remediation as the community colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critical part of the plan, he said, is to give the
college placement tests to high school students _ preferably by the
10th grade _ ``as a wake-up call.'' That way students can see where
they are weak and still have time to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work in Florida? Partly.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Florida say that only 10 percent
of the students need remedial work _ well below the figure at CUNY
and Cal State. The figure is lower in part because the university
takes in many of its students after they have already completed
some credits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But even under the Florida system, students do not always whiz
through their remedial courses. Chuck Lindsey, director of general
education at Florida Gulf Coast University, said that some students
simply skip the hours they should spend learning basics and
computer skills. ``They just keep taking the class until they pass
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Florida has taken one more step. The state recently passed a
law requiring that students taking remedial courses repeatedly will
be charged the full price of the course, not the subsidized price
available to local students.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Reed said, the number of students needing
remediation at Florida's community colleges continues to grow.

   CHICAGO _ Merger mania may be running amok in the world of
commerce, but in the world of civics the opposite seems to be
happening. Cities and counties dotting the country are in the grip
of secession fever.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the San Fernando Valley has been brazenly
unfaithful to the city of Los Angeles, doing all it can to get a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in New York, the rural East End of Long Island filed
suit, trying to force the State Legislature to allow it to secede
from Suffolk County and form Peconic County.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, a legislator submitted a bill last year seeking to
study the feasibility of making northern Maine the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland lawmaker recently asked his Legislature to let
Eastern Shore residents decide if they want to form their own
state.
</P>
<P>
   And in March, seeking attention over a nettlesome fishing
dispute, people in a sliver of Minnesota called the Northwest Angle
got their congressman to propose a constitutional amendment
allowing them to secede from the United States and join Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue, perhaps, from places like Scotland and Quebec,
break-up talk is bleeding into legislatures and city halls. Some of
it is intended to draw attention to neglected issues. But most of
it stems from a serious desire for more local autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, as Staten Island learned in its failed secession battle
five years ago, these movements have dim prospects because they
usually must be approved by governing bodies of the very places
they want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The only movement currently given a fighting chance is in the
San Fernando Valley, the suburban sprawl of 1.4 million people that
spawned the nasally hip Valley Girl. An organized campaign by
constituents who believe they receive too few city services for
their high taxes is seeking to create what would be the nation's
sixth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The effort gained ground in October with a law that bars city
councils from vetoing secession initiatives, though there are still
hurdles: petition signatures of 25 percent of registered voters, a
viability study and a majority vote for secession in both the
Valley and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that they're not getting a fair shake in the
existing arrangements,'' said Richard Briffault, a professor at
Columbia University Law School who has written about legal issues
in secession but is neutral on its desirability. ``Usually, it's a
group that's a population minority in the larger entity. They are
also different in some significant way, whether it's based on
ethnicity or based on politics or based on economics.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the conservative Eastern Shore has chafed under
state laws on gun control and wetlands preservation, but ``the
straw that broke the camel's back,'' said State senator Richard L.
Colburn, a Republican, was the response when a toxic microbe killed
thousands of fish in Chesapeake Bay last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the problem to manure runoff at chicken farms, the major
Eastern Shore industry, the governor proposed stricter
environmental regulations costly to the poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we should control our own destiny,'' said Colburn, who
introduced a bill this session that was buried in committee but may
resurface. Colburn wants to call the new state Delmarva (after the
peninsula shared by Delaware and Virginia), and said it would have
no sales tax, loose environmental regulation and a blue flag with
one star like the Bonnie Blue flown by some southern states in the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists and politicians see secession as a movement whose
time has come, a welcome backlash to the consolidation that began
earlier in the century, when most cities grew by annexing
territory. A few cities, like Indianapolis and Nashville, have
merged with their suburbs in recent years, but some experts say the
pendulum is swinging the other way. In Los Angeles, which has
always been a diffuse collection of neighborhoods, Venice, San
Pedro and other communities are also talking secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fracturing cities might be the best way to form more efficient
governments,'' said Howard Husock, director of case studies and
public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
government. He also favors a ``quasi-secession'' movement in Dade
County, Fla., where four unincorporated areas near Miami have voted
to turn themselves into municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small municipalities can control things like schools, zoning
and other functions, and form compacts with other communities for
other services, like fire departments,'' Husock said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McClintock, a Republican Assemblyman who co-wrote the
California law opening the door to secession movements, puts the
argument in grander terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large, centralized command-and-control structures were very
much a 20th-century phenomenon, actually a throwback to medieval
governing modalities,'' he said. ``We have been re-learning the
lessons of the Enlightenment, that human institutions produce far
more satisfactory results when powers are decentralized and
disbursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Starr, a California historian who is the state librarian,
fears that breaking up Los Angeles would leave behind a shell of a
city. He said he saw some secession movements as ``a kind of shock
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a married couple when one person doesn't really want
a divorce but moves out,'' he added. ``Everybody starts rethinking
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents claim they reap benefits even if they don't gain
independence because the media attention forces elected officials
to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without Peconic County being formed, we have seen a lot
of attention,'' said Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican
from Sag Harbor, N.Y., who twice introduced legislation asking for
a binding referendum on forming a new county, to no avail. Thiele
believes the threat of secession has prompted politicians to favor
his constituents on issues like farmland preservation and
real-estate transfer taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, State Representative Henry Joy, a Republican who
introduced the secession study bill, said forest and land
regulations were restricting economic growth in northern Maine. He
said the bill generated ``hearings around the state to discuss the
feasibility of economic development in rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It also convinced Joy to run for governor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Collin Peterson, the Democrat who introduced the
constitutional amendment in Minnesota, said the 100 residents of
the Northwest Angle didn't really want to leave the country _ only
to solve their problems with Ontario over regulation of the Lake of
the Woods, which dips into Minnesota. He acknowledged that
secession publicity got him a meeting with Canadian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the Northwest Angle decided the only way to get
something resolved was to create an international incident,''
Peterson said. ``Initially, their idea was to blockade a train.''

   If there is one national issue emerging from the hodgepodge of
political campaigns that will take shape with primary elections in
eight states on Tuesday, it is health insurance. Health maintenance
organizations have taken over, and voters don't like it. So
politicians are promising to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates this fall for the Senate and House as well as
governor and state attorney general are rallying behind legislation
percolating in Congress and in state legislatures that promises to
force HMOs to pay for more care, to expand patient choice and to
require health plans to document how well they treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   Political marketing consultants have given these proposals a
consumer-friendly name: the ``patients' bill of rights'' _ an idea
embraced last week by President Clinton and by his commission on
managed care. Patients' rights have broad support among health
policy experts who say they will make insurance companies
accountable for the quality of care they provide.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts also know something the politicians won't say.
These bills of rights, the product of a consumer backlash against
restrictions imposed by the HMOs, are almost certain to do the
opposite of what consumers say they want. Rather than expand
consumer options, they will drive patients into restrictive types
of HMOs that limit patients to a small roster of doctors. The bills
could also wipe out old-fashioned fee-for-service health insurance,
which puts medical choices completely in the hands of doctors and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would tighten the grip of managed care because they
impose elaborate record-keeping requirements on the health plans,
aimed at making them publicly accountable for how well they
prevent, treat and cure illness. What the politicians won't yet
admit is that accountability clashes with something else something
else patients prize: choice. The more freedom patients have to
choose doctors, the more difficult it becomes for plans to keep
track of their doctors and remedy mistakes. Accountability
undermines choice. Many experts say that is a bargain worth making.
But more choice, not less, is what politicians are promising.
</P>
<P>
   The patients' rights bills would demand substantial
record-keeping. Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the
association representing the country's Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans, points to provisions in several bills and the report of
President Clinton's commission that would require plans to track
medical treatments. The language is vague; the holes will be filled
by regulatory agencies if the bills become law. What the proponents
have in mind is requiring health plans to reveal, for example, how
many of its youngsters receive vaccinations, how many diabetics are
checked for high blood pressure and how many coronary patients take
beta blockers to prevent recurrent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bills go further, requiring plans to measure
outcomes. In practice, that might mean reporting the percentage of
coronary patients who suffer continual chest pain or repeated heart
attacks. How many of the plan's asthmatics return to normal work
schedules without repeated visits to hospital emergency rooms? How
many of the plan's diabetics successfully control their blood
pressure? The idea is that if every plan reports clear data on
mortality, morbidity and patient satisfaction, consumers can reward
the best plans with their business.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs can handle demands for extensive data collection, typically
by steering patients to a small roster of doctors and by using
``gatekeepers'' to intervene between patients and specialists.
Gatekeepers anger patients when they block access to doctors the
patients want to see. But gatekeepers serve two important
functions. They direct patients only to those specialists who
practice medicine the way the plan thinks best. They also provide
the plan a single place to find any patient's complete medical
record. That makes tracking outcomes possible.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, looser forms of managed care, like Preferred
Provider Organizations, allow patients to see nearly any doctor,
but require them to pay more for those who are not members of the
plan. The larger of these looser plans do business with tens of
thousands of doctors and assign no gatekeepers. There is no one
place to find a patient's complete record, so plans must sift
through claims submissions to figure out which treatments their
patients received. Ms. Lehnhard says claims data only go so far.
They might show how many diabetics were tested for high blood
pressure. But claims data would not show how many of these
diabetics had dangerously high blood pressure, or how many women
succumbed to breast cancer because the disease was diagnosed late.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lehnhard's point is not that looser forms of managed care
offer shoddy health care; some have stellar quality improvement
programs. But, she says, managed care plans that are required to
track the treatment of each customer will almost certainly choose
to make the job easier by imposing some of the limitations that
create frictions between HMOs and patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the easiest way for plans to guarantee that each of
its diabetics is checked for high blood pressure is to restrict
enrollees to doctors the plan knows routinely perform the right
tests. And any problems that managed care plans face in tracking
treatment outcomes would be that much worse for fee-for-service
plans, which impose virtually no limits on where their enrollees
seek treatment. With little or no contractual relationship to
doctors, fee-for-service plans cannot possibly control the quality
of care provided their members. To meet the demands of patients'
rights legislation, they too would be forced to limit the number of
doctors to choose from or to impose other restrictions. Ms.
Lehnhard fears such measures could enrage the 30 million or more
enrollees in Blue Cross/Blue Shield who have avoided HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   When legislators in Congress and elsewhere wake up to the
tradeoff between accountability and choice, they will face
unpleasant options. They can insist that all plans track medical
treatments and outcomes, but then patients will squawk when they
find their loosely structured plans cracking down on physician
choice. Lawmakers could bend to pressure to exempt loosely
structured plans from heavy data collection. But that would put
legislators in the embarrassing and contradictory position of
imposing a regulatory burden only on HMOs, thereby punishing the
only health plans equipped to give patients the data they need to
make smart choices.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers could instead drop accountability from health-care
reform. HMOs, it would reason, are already moving to reporting on
medical outcomes without Congress' shove. Loosely structured plans,
on the other hand, are in effect telling enrollees that they are on
their own. They, not the plan, are responsible for picking
high-quality doctors. The flaw in this argument is that individuals
cannot choose smart doctors if health plans neither collect nor
report the data on which informed judgments would have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma is accountability versus choice. Virtually
everybody's health care hinges on that conflict, yet nobody in
politics is talking about it.

   &UR; NAKED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Sedaris. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This funny, venomous and at times sad collection of 17
autobiographical essays focuses on the author's many bizarre
experiences, like a week at a nudist trailer park, as well as on
his family, particularly his witty, acerbic mother. ``Even the
bleakest of them contain stuff you shouldn't read with your mouth
full,'' Craig Seligman wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Arundhati Roy. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old woman returns to her formerly elegant home in
southern India to be reunited with her haunted twin brother, whom
she hasn't seen since a calamitous event drove them apart and
blighted their lives almost 25 years earlier. Part political fable,
part psychological drama, part fairy tale, this first novel is a
devastating meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family.
The quality of Roy's narration ``is so extraordinary _ at once so
morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple _ that the reader
remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish,''
Alice Truax said in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TROUBLE WITH PROSPERITY - A CONTRARIAN'S TALE OF BOOM,
BUST, AND SPECULATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Grant. Times Business/Random House, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic bear warns that Americans are far too smitten with the
stock market, and with an eye toward past economic cycles, he
argues that what goes up must come down. The result is ``a witty
and informative'' book, John Rothchild wrote here in 1996. In  &UR; THE
BIG TEN: THE BIG EMERGING MARKETS AND HOW THEY WILL CHANGE OUR
LIVES &LR;  (Basic Books, $14), Jeffrey Garten, a former top trade
policy adviser to Clinton, argues that 10 countries _ ranging from
India to Turkey _ are rapidly becoming major forces in the world
economy. Last year, our reviewer, Alan Tonelson, said that even if
the power of these nations is exaggerated, the book ``is a welcome
... corrective'' to the administration's Pollyanna-ish views. The
moguls behind today's global communications empires are the focus
of  &UR; THE HIGHWAYMEN: WARRIORS OF THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY &LR; , by
Ken Auletta (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13). The author of this
collection of 17 profiles, which has been updated and features a
new chapter on Microsoft, ``is a superb reporter and seems happiest
explicating the nuts and bolts of a company,'' Judith Newman said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE WITHOUT WATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Peacock. Bantam, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl named Cedar, growing up on a primitive commune in
North Carolina, describes how she and her mother survived the false
utopias of the '60s, and in the process digs deep beneath the peace
and love platitudes of the time. In 1996, our reviewer, Francine
Prose, called this a ``deft, sly, unassuming first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALVIN AILEY: A LIFE IN DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jennifer Dunning. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   This unflinching portrait of the brilliant but deeply tormented
choreographer is also a study of black dance in America during much
of the century and a social history of the turbulent theatrical
world of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. The author, a dance critic for
The New York Times, has written a ``compassionate and painstakingly
reported biography,'' Mindy Aloff wrote here in 1996. The same
publisher has issued another profile of a legendary dancer and
choreographer,  &UR; ALL HIS JAZZ: THE LIFE &AMP; DEATH OF BOB FOSSE &LR; , by
Martin Gottfried ($16.95). The outsize figure that emerges here was
furiously driven and immensely gifted in both dance and filmmaking
but was also tormented by depression and self-loathing. ``The
cardinal virtue'' of this account is the author's ``intimacy with
the show-business scene that was Fosse's chrysalis,'' Ronald Bryden
said in the Book Review in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOUNTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Derek Walcott. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This volume of poetry ranges from an elegy on the poet's mother
to fresh visits to such old haunts as New England, Europe, and his
home island, St. Lucia. While generally unimpressed with the
author's longer works, William Logan said here last year that
``Walcott is a master of ... easy, careless abundance'' and admired
``the stunned eloquence of his lines.'' The same publisher has
issued another retrospective volume by a major poet,  &UR; HISTORY OF MY
HEART &LR; , by Robert Pinsky ($12), which includes portraits of the
author's family and boyhood neighbors, among others. ``Pinsky has a
rare gift ... for action, character and atmosphere clearly and
buoyantly proportioned,'' R.W. Flint wrote in these pages in 1984.

   &UR; THE CLUB DUMAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Arturo Prez-Reverte. Translated by Sonia Soto. Vintage
International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Corso, a cynical Spanish mercenary specializing in hunting
down rare books, gets into trouble when he agrees to authenticate
both a missing chapter of ``The Three Musketeers'' and a
17th-century manual for summoning the Devil. The result is an
``intelligent and delightful novel,'' Margot Livesey said here last
year.

<P>
   &UR; DON'T ERASE ME: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn Ferrell. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The eight tales in this debut collection focus on urban young
people, describing, for example, the survival techniques of a
homosexual black teen-ager, and a woman's path to becoming HIV
positive. ``It's intimate in the way you used to hope a good book
could be,'' our reviewer, Katharine Whitemore, wrote in 1997.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In politics, as in science, pundits are always on the lookout
for a unified theory, preferably a single idea that binds together
an otherwise disparate constellation of facts and events. For the
seemingly endless stream of revelations that constitutes America's
campaign finance scandal, no explanation is as seductively simple _
or sinister _ as the China plot.
</P>
<P>
   It has all the elements of a Manchurian Candidate remake: The
mink-coat-wearing daughter of the top Chinese general. A frantic
search for satellite technology and missile guidance systems.
Intercepted communications that suggest a Beijing-directed scheme
to suborn American politicians. And lurking behind the scenes, the
People's Liberation Army, a one-time peasant force that some see as
the American military's one potential peer in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Look through the eyes of those who follow China most closely,
however, and the best of those plot lines falls flat. ``I was a
skeptic from the beginning and I remain a skeptic,'' says James
Mulvenon of the Rand Corp. in California, a specialist on the
Chinese military and its commercial ventures. ``When you have a
sense of how China works, it is hard to see these scandals as
anything but an unfortunate series of coincidences, not a plot.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by many American scholars and diplomats who
focus on China. Many say they are wary of appearing to apologize
for China's military, which has a staunch anti-American faction and
a long history of activities that promote arms proliferation. None
suggests that involvement in American politics by Chinese people
with ties to government-run businesses is either legal or proper.
And few would rule out the possibility that some element of the
military has commercial ambitions that ties to President Clinton
might help advance.
</P>
<P>
   But they question some of the received wisdom in Congress and
the media that underlie the plot theory: that China's military is a
monolith; that the army has wealth and discipline to match its
size, and that China's military, foreign ministry, defense
industry, intelligence gatherers and Cabinet can be assumed to act
with anti-American singlemindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Chas Freeman, a longtime American diplomat and China watcher,
argues that plot-seekers usually ignore the complexities of the
Chinese system. ``Unless and until there is something more concrete
linking these different stories, I cannot accept that there is a
plot,'' he said. ``This scandal is about us, not about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several of the main players in the drama are Chinese. One
of the most prominent foreigners to have sought audiences with
Clinton during the last election was Liu Chaoying, an aerospace
company executive and child of the Chinese army's most senior
general, Liu Huaqing. Mrs. Liu was reported to have given money to
the Democratic National Committee through a Taiwanese-American
fund-raiser, Johnny Chung. The People's Liberation Army also has a
vested interest in launching more foreign satellites and, of
course, in acquiring American missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of connecting those strands of information is
complicated by the fact that China's military, though it remains
opaque and wary of outsiders, does not follow the totalitarian
model, at least when the model suggests unity and discipline of the
first order. In fact, the army is closely watched these days for
the high command's attempts to steel the ranks against an insidious
foreign force: capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, a time of budget cutting, the late patriarch
Deng Xiaoping pushed military units to support themselves by doing
business, and by the end of last year the army could claim some
10,000 business enterprises within its domain, according to Jane's
Defense Weekly, an industry journal. They make phones and cars,
operate cruise ships and hotels, and own companies with listings on
domestic and foreign stock exchanges. They also produce armaments,
but some estimates put their arms-related manufacturing business at
a small fraction of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The military's vast commercial side sometimes supports national
defense, but not always. Central military authorities have
struggled to get officers to focus less on money making and more on
military preparedness. And one expert on the Chinese military, Tai
Ming Cheung in Hong Kong, says the bulk of money earned by military
companies is invested in new businesses, or used to buy luxury
goods for senior officers, or laundered overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Even further removed from the army's direct control are defense
contractors, including the China Aerospace Corporation, the parent
of Mrs. Liu's company. It reports to the government's Cabinet, not
to the generals, and is considered a commercial enterprise, albeit
with some military manufacturing duties. It has a subsidiary that
has issued shares publicly, and that company is Mrs. Liu's direct
employer, China Aerospace International. It has its headquarters
and its stock listing in Hong Kong, making it subject to the former
British colony's corporate disclosure rules. Its business line
includes telecommunications, auto parts and real estate, but not
military manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture is the fact that the companies
rarely draw sharp lines between military and commercial businesses.
China Aerospace, for example, controls Great Wall Industries, which
manages China's Long March commercial rockets and solicits launch
business from foreign satellite companies. Long March technology
overlaps that of China's nuclear-tipped missiles. But China
Aerospace and its subsidiary are also developing a separate and
purely commercial television satellite business to serve Chinese
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Those degrees of separation make it even harder to piece
together why Mrs. Chaoying might have forayed into American
politics. Was she working on behalf of Great Wall Industries and
the Long March rocket, or China Aerospace's satellite plan, or its
auto parts, or none of the above? No one knows for sure, says
Mulvenon of Rand. He also said it would not be unusual for such a
person to seek contacts or publicity in America for an entirely
separate reason, like a personal venture.
</P>
<P>
   He considers highly unlikely one other scenario _ that she was
working on behalf of her father, the now retired chief of the army,
to acquire American military technology. Or that she was on a
mission to persuade President Clinton to relax export controls on
dual-use, civilian-military goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can say with some certainty is that China is not
run like Iraq, and Liu Huaqing is not Saddam, relying on his own
children for sensitive missions,'' Mulvenon said. ``China is much
more institutionalized, not a capricious tin-pot dictatorship.'' He
said the ministry of state security would jealously guard its right
to manage an espionage mission, and the Foreign Ministry would be
unlikely to charge an aerospace company executive with an important
diplomatic duty, even if the executive had a high rank by birth.
</P>
<P>
   None of that disproves a plot by the Chinese military, these
experts say. But it raises the bar a notch for those who seek to
show that one exists.

WEATHERING THE STORM: SOUTHEAST ASIA DID SOME THINGS RIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ruins of crony banks and businesses built on corruption and
special favors litter the devastated economies of Southeast Asia,
making it easy to notice what the region's leaders did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But buried under the rubble are a number of things that these
societies did right _ steps they took, or societal strengths they
preserved, that may soften the trauma of the economic crisis they
are going through. These are characteristics largely unmatched by
Latin American, African and South Asian nations like India and
Pakistan. And they may well serve as a cushion on which the
societies of Southeast Asia can bounce back once the economic panic
recedes.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president for East
Asia and the Pacific, cites three major achievements. The most
obvious is ``the good macroeconomic management that prevailed in
the region for 20, 30 years _ tight monetary policy, no fiscal
deficits, a kind of caution in the way public affairs were run,''
he said. ``Unlike the Latin American countries, this will be the
cushion that will allow them to absorb better the costs of
financial restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Second was the ``outward looking'' character of many of the
region's economies, which took to the export trade with alacrity.
Even though trade within Asia has crashed for now, they do not need
to learn how to live in a global market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Severino cited ``the tremendous investment they have
made in education'' and the quality of economic, business and
government management it has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Southeast Asia's economic crisis began with a
meltdown of Thailand's banking system last summer, it has been
tempting to envision economic catastrophe followed by
uncontrollable political turmoil. The forced resignation of
Indonesia's President Suharto strengthens that impression. Last
week, tens of thousands of South Korean workers went on strike to
protest layoffs even as Hong Kong's stock market plunged 5.3
percent and economists talked of a ``contagion'' that has now
helped undermine Russia's financial reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the economic slide can be halted? Is there a base on
which recovery might be easily built, making political stability
more likely? A number of experts think there is.
</P>
<P>
   Take education. By the mid 1990s, nearly all of Southeast Asian
children of primary age were in school, and college enrollment
rates were considerably higher than in the India-Pakistan area _ as
was literacy, especially among women. And the people of Indonesia,
the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore had at least
twice _ in some cases 60 times _ as much income per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Thailand, several Southeast Asian nations have also cut
birth rates substantially by making safe family planning methods
readily available to most ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Nolt, assistant professor of political science at the
New School and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute in New
York, said educational investment has produced not only managers
and competent public officials but also a large pool of skilled
engineers and technicians. ``These gains will survive the economic
crisis and allow these countries to be competitive producers
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with such educated managerial and middle classes, he said,
``the old forms of political rule are more subject to challenge
than they might have been in a more traditional, agriculture-based
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of politics toward multi-party democracy has been
most striking in Thailand, traditionally a self-contained monarchy.
John Bresnan, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's
East Asian Institute, said Thailand ``has had enormous success in
the last nine months,'' having headed off martial law, adopted a
new constitution, changed governments, removed the head of the
central bank and recovered some economic ground.
</P>
<P>
   Noeleen Heyzer, a Singaporean who is executive director of
Unifem, the United Nations development program for women, says
educational spending _ 20 percent or more of the budget in some
countries _ did not bypass the grass roots, as it did in many other
regions.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to rural education in Malaysia, which lured American
and other computer giants to provide the kinds of jobs that would
bring social development. Visitors to the country's free trade zone
on Penang Island a decade ago, for example, could see demure Muslim
women in head scarves at work on circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had women and men who were able to build up strong
economic assets,'' Ms. Heyzer said. ``And in introducing the idea
of computers to rural women, a mind-set was changed. So when you
get information technology, it is not something dramatically new.''
Meanwhile, she said, Singapore was moving ``from a trading center
to a labor-intensive industrial structure to a more high-tech
economy and eventually to service-information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore, under the socially visionary but politically
intolerant Lee Kuan Yew, took another step not emulated by its
Asian neighbors. It sought to eliminate corruption _ ``Asian
business practices,'' they were called _ which sapped the strength
and spirit of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Nihal Jayawikrama, executive director of Transparency
International, a private group based in Berlin that fights
corruption worldwide, said that both Singapore and Hong Kong
tackled corruption in ways his organization would not advocate _ by
fiat rather than through the natural cleansing process of open
elections, a strong and independent judiciary and a free press.
``But I think the fact that the currencies of those two countries
were affected least last year seems to suggest that there is a link
between corruption and economic crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia has a lot of other unfinished business, most
experts agree. The specter of racial attacks on wealthy Chinese
minorities who have had important economic roles hang over
Indonesia and to a lesser extent Malaysia, where laws that give
native Malays economic privileges are now being rethought.
Everywhere social services are weak, the poor are often without
health care and the unemployed have no source of compensation. The
relative equality and mobility of women has often led them into
exploitation in the sex industry or domestic servitude. And
traditional family support systems are under stress in rapidly
industrializing and urbanizing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the foundations of the economic miracle remain, said
Severino of the World Bank. ``They are the rocks on which we can
build hope for the recovery of the region.''

ITS A TEST, NOT A WEAPON. BUT THAT'S AWFULLY CLOSE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ON their northern border, high in the Himalayas,
India and Pakistan have for years been fighting for position and
not much else along a glacier that is virtually uninhabitable. On
mountains reaching 20,000 feet, their armies snipe and trade
artillery blasts, if the weather allows. By most definitions, it is
war, but a small war. Each side loses as many soldiers to altitude
sickness as to combat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's nuclear tests by Pakistan _ coming two weeks after
India's own tests _ have abruptly and fundamentally changed the
confrontation between India and Pakistan, which had become a
limited, relatively low-intensity military standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Although both countries have had covert nuclear programs for
decades, the tests brought both much closer to actually putting
nuclear weapons in their arsenals and, worse, on the potential
battlefields along their hotly disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   That is why arms-control experts say the truly alarming thing
that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government announced on Thursday
was not that Pakistan had successfully conducted its own tests.
Rather it was the declaration that Pakistan was already fitting
nuclear warheads on top of a missile, tested only last month, that
is capable of striking most of India.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, the president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an
independent research institute here, said the development of
nuclear weapons progressed in clear stages: from research to design
to tests to the making of the bombs or warheads themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crucial threshold has been crossed, if it's true,'' Krepon
said of Pakistan's declaration about fitting its missile. ``And
that means we have only two thresholds left: deployment and use.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the rhetorical bluster by both sides, though, there is
still a large gap between conducting successful tests and building
effective, usable weapons. And that is where officials in
Washington and around the world are looking these days for a
glimmer of hope that there is still time to head off a terrifying
spiral of escalation that could draw in India's other enemy, China.
</P>
<P>
   India is said to have enough fissile material for perhaps 50
nuclear devices, maybe more. Pakistan has enough for perhaps 12.
Experts have long assumed that both can make Hiroshima-scale bombs
to drop from planes, but that is considered an unreliable way to
deliver nuclear weapons since planes can be shot down.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no evidence that either country has mastered the
ability to make warheads small enough to fit on missiles, though
not for lack of trying. Senior administration officials cast doubt
on Pakistan's claims to have already fitted its longest-range
missile with nuclear warheads. ``That would be a fateful and
foolish step,'' one official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the mere claim was sure to leave India's nuclear
strategists wondering, intensifying already inflamed emotions. And
the experts agreed it is only a matter of time before both can
field nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years both India and Pakistan have come to rely more
and more on their strategic forces. Pakistan, in particular, has
poured its scarce resources into developing nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles, purchasing equipment and technology from China,
as well as North Korea. (More than a quarter of Pakistan's federal
spending goes to defense, compared to 14 percent for India.)
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has taken this route to compensate for an overwhelming
disadvantage in conventional forces. India has twice as many
soldiers _ nearly 1.2 million to about 600,000 _ and twice as many
combat aircraft. What's more, much of Pakistan's population and
economic heart lie within easy striking distance of India's border,
leaving it vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   While Pakistan has a number of short-range missiles, it tested
its first longer-range missile just last month, a test that India
cited as provocation when it conducted its nuclear tests.
Pakistan's missile is said to have a range of 900 miles, which
would bring most of India's major cities within striking distance.
Although built with North Korean help, Pakistan named it the
Ghauri, after a Muslim warrior who defeated a 12th-century Hindu
ruler of India named Prithvi.
</P>
<P>
   While Pakistan lags behind India in conventional forces, many
experts say it may have an edge in missiles. India's most effective
missiles, the Prithvi series, have relatively short ranges. And
while India has tested a longer-ranged missile, called the Agni, it
has yet to complete its development.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the United States and other countries are
scrambling to stop South Asia's suddenly revived arms race before
it escalates any further. On Friday, the United Nations Security
Council called on India and Pakistan to sign the treaties against
the spread and testing of nuclear weapons that, until now, had
limited the world's declared nuclear powers to the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and China.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that India and Pakistan will call a halt to their
nuclear programs where they now stand, although neither has so far
shown much willingness to heed the world's pleas. The Pakistanis
``are ready to die for their respect,'' Sharif warned in a
televised address to his nation, brushing aside the sanctions the
United States imposed only hours later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the best hope may lie with the fact that a fundamental
taboo has existed against the use of nuclear weapons ever since the
world learned what those weapons could do when the United States
dropped them on Japan to end World War II. That and the prospect of
``mutually assured destruction,'' known widely by the grim acronym
MAD, kept the United States and Soviet Union from firing them
throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But India and Pakistan have suddenly made the specter of a
nuclear exchange seem less remote. The United States and the Soviet
Union, after all, never shared a border. Nor did they directly
quarrel over a territory as volatile as Jammu and Kashmir, the
predominantly Muslim enclave carved up after India and Pakistan
gained independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unresolved disagreements, deep animosity and distrust, and the
continuing confrontation between their forces in disputed Kashmir
make the subcontinent a region with a significant risk of nuclear
confrontation,'' the Pentagon concluded in a report published
before this month's tit-for-tat tests.
</P>
<P>
   Arms-control experts now worry that the world could be closer to
nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis in
1962. That was the only time in the 53 years of the nuclear age
when it seemed likely that any two nuclear powers might descend
into direct large-scale hostilities with each other. American and
Chinese troops fought in the Korean War, but that was long before
China had nuclear weapons; China and India fought a border war in
1962, but that was before either went nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   In those same 53 years. India and Pakistan have fought three
wars and have perpetually seemed on the verge of a fourth _ never
with more devastating potential consequences than now.

LEAVING AMERICA FOR IRELAND, THE NEW PROMISED LAND

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Between retrieving thrown juice cups and
cleaning up crushed cookies, the moms in the mother-toddler program
at the Irish Community Center here talk about home. But unlike
generations of homesick Irish women before them, many of them
aren't just talking. They're going.
</P>
<P>
   With the Irish economy thriving and now an agreement for peace
in the long-bloody North _ resoundingly ratified in a referendum
last weekend _ the motherland's pull on its exiles in America seems
more powerful than ever. Many young Irish adults are breaking with
earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United
States for good: The Irish government reports that over the last
two years, 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America
than went the other way.
</P>
<P>
   That reversal breaks with previous decades of Irish immigration
to the United States, one of the oldest, largest, most sustained
and most culturally influential migration flows of American history
_ reaching nearly a million in the 1850s after the Irish potato
famine, but dwindling lately to just a few thousand a year.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years now, the Irish have been celebrating the
surprising return of their countrymen from England and Australia as
well as America, a trend that the peace agreement seems sure to
accelerate. Now the Irish in America, who once saw little choice
but to come here, are confronted with a happy dilemma: choosing
between this land of opportunity and a land more familiar to them
that has been newly vested with promise.
</P>
<P>
   To economists, Ireland is now ``the Celtic tiger.'' Thanks
largely to American and other foreign investments in high-tech
manufacturing plants for computers, pharmaceuticals and other
products, newly created jobs have brought unemployment in Ireland
down to 9 percent from nearly 16 percent in 1993. Investors, in
turn, are bullish largely because next year Ireland (unlike
neighboring Britain) will adopt the European Union's unified
currency, the euro. Participation in the euro imposes economic
discipline on countries using it and is expected to reduce the cost
of doing business within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry J. Sexton, a labor-market specialist for the Economic and
Social Research Institute in Dublin, said most of those returning
from the States are in their mid-20s to mid-30s, and typically have
some education or skills.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, his assessment is affirmed in interviews
with Irish immigrants. James Dalton, an Irishman who owns Dublin
Construction Inc. in Queens, N.Y., said he typically employs 20 of
his countrymen as carpenters or laborers _ and typically one leaves
for home every week. After spending the day refitting a pub in
mahogany, two of his 20-year-old carpenters _ both out of Ireland
just two months _ ordered a round of Guinness and confided their
dream: saving enough money to start a construction business back
home.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the Irish bars that dot New York, similar stories are
being told, some that sound much like the fantastic tales that
envious dreamers in the Old World once told about America. Seamus
Gillespie, a 44-year-old asbestos remover who was sharing a pint
and a cigarette with a co-worker and his fiancee at another bar in
Woodside, leaned in to give the news about the Irish economy.
``They're not building houses,'' he said. ``They're building
mansions!''
</P>
<P>
   Historians of American immigration say revolving-door migrations
like this one are nothing new, despite popular myths about America
as the promised land. But they note that the Irish exodus is
unusual in that it seems to involve whole households (as opposed to
men without families), making the departure of the Irish more
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kerby Miller, a history professor at the University of
Missouri who specializes in Irish immigration, calls the turnabout
simply astonishing for a people long motivated by starvation and
political and religious repression to forsake their homeland. In
the past, he said, ``Irish immigrants longed to return, at least
sentimentally, but they realized it was impractical or
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors motivating the new Irish returnees, Irish
immigration counselors say, are frustrations and delays in winning
American citizenship, given the United States' current
anti-immigrant political climate. Lately, though, the peace
agreement for the British province of Northern Ireland provides
another positive for those already weighing a decision to return.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Irish Community Center in Yonkers to pick up his
wife and young son, Andrew Convery, a taxi driver from the Bronx,
said the prospects for peace are a big factor in their decision to
return. A Catholic from Northern Ireland, he came here six years
ago in search of the American dream, and met his future wife,
Kerry, a Catholic from Dublin, when he picked her up as a fare. Now
they are moving back so their 1-year-old, Ciaran, can be raised the
way they were. But without the bombs. ``Before, there wasn't much
to go back to,'' Convery said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish exodus raises as yet unanswerable questions about the
subtler cultural effects on two countries that have long drawn on
the richness of the other. Lately in the United States, Irish
culture, once shunned by the upper crust, has enjoyed a broad
revival. ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning
memoir of growing up poor in Limerick (interestingly enough, after
his family returned from America), has been on The New York Times
Best-Seller List for 89 weeks. And in recent years, ``Lord of the
Dance,'' the choreographed extravaganza created by Michael Flatley,
an Irish-American, has made Irish folk-dancing almost hip.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish cultural vibrancy here could be diluted by Ireland's
new drawing power, says Dr. Timothy J. Meagher, the director of the
Center for Irish Studies at Catholic University in Washington.
``Now these people are going back,'' he said. ``If you lose the
immigrant base, it threatens the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Irish from the United States can be expected to
increase as the Irish government and business groups rev up the
welcome wagon. Ireland's Department of Social Welfare, which
earlier published ``Thinking of Going to London?'' and ``Thinking
of Going to the United States?'' last year switched gears and put
out ``Thinking of Returning to Ireland?'' _ a guide to housing,
pensions and workers' rights.

   Russian Economic Woes Spark Investor Panic
</P>
<P>
   Panic swept through Russia's financial markets as foreign
investors feared that the ruble would be devalued. Interest rates
tripled and the stock market plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   From the White House to the Kremlin, officials were concerned
that the setback could destabilize the new Russian democracy. By

   U.S. May Have Helped India Hide Nuclear Test Sites
</P>
<P>
   An intelligence board will report this week on why the United
States failed to foresee this month's nuclear tests by India, which
spurred tests in Pakistan and incited what President Clinton calls
a ``dangerous arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington may have unwittingly schooled India in the art of
deception. In December 1995, spy satellites saw India preparing for
a nuclear test. United States diplomats showed the spy satellite
photos to Indian officials in persuading them not to test.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a triumph of diplomacy may have been an
unintended gift to India. Some government officials now say that
showing those photos to the Indians revealed how the United States
spied on the test site, and thus enabled India to conceal its
preparations this time around.

   Court Backs Police In High-Speed Chases
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people die every year as the result of
high-speed police chases. A Supreme Court decision has now reduced
nearly to the vanishing point the chance that any of their families
will be able to collect damages, even for police behavior that is
reckless to the point of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously ruled that only a chase undertaken with
``a purpose to cause harm'' can be found to violate the
constitutional guarantee of due process. The justices overturned a
ruling by the federal appeals court in California _ home of the
televised high-speed chase _ that had set the more
plaintiff-friendly standard of ``deliberate indifference'' as the
measure of police liability. Deliberation was not a sensible test
for a situation that calls for split-second judgment, Justice David
Souter said.

   Starr Wants Quick Decision
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, asked the
Supreme Court to rule quickly on whether two of President Clinton's
aides must appear before the grand jury investigating the Monica
Lewinsky matter. A federal judge in Washington had ordered the
aides to appear, but the White House is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, Sidney Blumenthal and Bruce Lindsey, have refused to
answer some questions _ citing executive privilege and
attorney-client privilege _ about conversations they had with the
president, the first lady and other officials and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky stopped by the local FBI office to give handwriting
samples and fingerprints to investigators who have spent the last
few months attempting to corroborate some of the things she said
about the president in conversations recorded by her former friend,
Linda Tripp.

   Lyme Disease Vaccine Gets Cautious Push
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United
States, and its sometimes debilitating symptoms _ arthritis and
damage to the nervous system and heart _ underscore the need for a
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration
recommended approval of the first such vaccine, but with
ambivalence about its safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It takes three injections and a year to gain maximum protection,
about 80 percent. But no one knows how often booster doses will be
required or whether repeated shots will be safe. Also uncertain is
whether the vaccine is safe for those with arthritis or undetected
Lyme disease. The committee called on the manufacturer, SmithKline
Beecham, to continue testing the vaccine, particularly in children.
For now, it is recommended only for people from 15 to 70.

   Making Money at Home
</P>
<P>
   Even as the tides of free trade, globalized investments and
regional currencies are washing over every continent, there are
islands of resistance.. In 66 towns and villages in Canada and the
United States, people are printing their own money _ from Sand
Dollars in Bolinas, Calif., to Mountain Money in Hot Springs, N.C.,
to Thread City Bread in Willimantic, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   All of these currencies, printed in kaleidoscopic colors, tend
to be denominated in hours, with one hour worth $10. But they are
not simply displays of design and engraving.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a system designed to promote the use of a
scrip that can only be used locally, so that trade will stay a bit
more securely within the communities.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Ithaca, N.Y., where the system has been running
for seven years, the equivalent of millions of dollars in business
has been done in the local currency, Ithaca Hours, and it is
accepted by a local hospital, a federal credit union, grocery and
book stores, hair salons and chiropractors.

   A Growing Case Against Swiss Banks
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited report sponsored by the Swiss government
confirmed the central bank's complicity in accepting gold looted
from Holocaust victims, bolstering allegations by Jewish groups
that Switzerland traded in wartime misery. Not only did Swiss
bankers ignore the gold's origin, they also considered melting it
down to disguise it, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report, produced by a panel of nine Swiss and
international historians, discounted profit as a motive, it noted
the Swiss National Bank was Germany's biggest client, buying gold
that would be worth $2.5 billion today. The study, meant to show
Switzerland's willingness to come clean on its wartime record, only
upped the ante for Jewish leaders, who intensified demands for
reparations.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Talk about political culture shock. A day after
votes were counted in the Northern Ireland peace referendum, I flew
from Belfast to San Francisco to catch the final week of the
California primary campaign. After a month immersed in the low-tech
modesty of Irish politics (and writing about it for The New York
Times), I was greeted at the airport by an electronic stand-in for
the mayor and chief municipal showboat, Willie Brown Jr. In a
message that boomed from above, and over and over, in the
international arrivals terminal, Brown introduced himself and
welcomed each and every visitor (and prospective voter) to what he
grandly called ``My city.''
</P>
<P>
   Had I not been in Ireland 14 hours earlier, I would not have
thought twice about this bold piece of self-promotion by a
politician who is not even up for re-election. But I arrived in
California with a fresh perspective: Only days earlier, strategists
for the Yes campaign in Northern Ireland bickered for 20 minutes
(with reporters in the room, no less) over whether it would appear
too cynical to print T-shirts with a big, bold, ``YES'' emblazoned
across the front. (They went ahead with the idea and it did not
seem to put off voters; the referendum passed easily.)
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unfair to compare two election campaigns that not
only are half a world apart but could not be more different. In
Ireland, voters were trying to resolve one of the bloodiest, most
enduring conflicts of this century. The voting in California on
Tuesday is, to put it gently, not nearly as historic. Voters here
are being asked to elect nominees for governor, the Senate and the
House, and choose an array of initiatives and local candidates.
Important? Sure. War and peace? No.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for a reporter who has witnessed dozens of American
elections over the last two decades, watching the campaign unfold
in Ireland was a refreshing civics lesson, if also an ultimately
depressing one. While the Irish appeared hopelessly, even
laughably, naieve about how to campaign, their approach seemed
closer to genuine democracy. By contrast, the American system looks
worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of politicians to break through to American voters
has been an undercurrent of campaigns for years, particularly in
California, where the beaches are a more powerful draw than
politics. But the depth of indifference here is even more striking
when contrasted to Ireland. While people there were not
particularly optimistic that the referendum would change anything,
they had enough hope in their politicians and the process that they
were not about to pass on voting altogether. By contrast,
Californians simply don't think it's important to vote. After a
reasonably deep conversation here last week with a friend who is
well educated and well-versed in current events (he once lived in
Washington), he asked, ``When's the election, anyway?'' It was a
question I never encountered _ not once _ in hundreds of
conversations in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Some politicians
groused that the turnout in the Irish Republic was only about 60
percent of the voting-age population. In California, experts
predict turnout could sink below 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While it is to be expected that voting for the more
consequential Ulster peace accord would draw more attention, the
Irish turnout was no anomaly. Irish voting has remained relatively
constant over the years, while turnout in California keeps
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast I mocked the primitive way in which the campaign was
conducted. Rather than buying television commercials, both sides
fought with rudimentary placards hung on lampposts. The Yes
campaign's poster was a particularly easy object of ridicule. It
was intended to look like a road sign, but instead resembled an eye
examination chart.
</P>
<P>
   Here, by contrast, candidates for governor and Senate have
pumped tens of millions of dollars into pelting one another with
30-second commercials that, with their screaming red headlines and
threatening attacks, are intended to sway the tiny minority that
will actually vote. After nearly a week of exposure to those
pitches, I still do not feel I have a grasp of just what these
politicians would do if elected.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland there was no political television advertising, but
the referendum dominated news and public affairs programs. In
California it is possible to watch hours of local news here without
knowing there is an election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   American voters and political reporters, wise to the techniques
of modern politics, are often numb to the consequences of campaign
by focus group. So it was cheering to visit a place where even a
whiff of manipulation rankled voters. The biggest controversy
involving strategy in the Irish campaign came when the press got
hold of a memorandum written by the communications director of the
Northern Ireland Office of the British government that outlined how
to win passage of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, the memorandum was pretty tame, with
suggestions of a ``daily handling meeting'' to plot strategy for
``exerting some influence on the content and quality of media
coverage.'' There was such outrage over what people viewed as
unprecedented manipulation that the Northern Ireland Office backed
off some of its plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unremarkable,'' Kathleen Stevens, the United
States Consul General in Northern Ireland, said of the document.
``But it did a lot of damage. It made everybody shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to campaigns here, where every uttered word, every
slogan is tested and vetted and tested again. Al Checchi, a
multimillionaire businessmen seeking the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, started his advertising by not mentioning his party and
making broad bipartisan appeals. Then he abruptly shifted,
presenting himself as a proud Democrat. No one thinks Checchi's
turnabout reflected a genuine change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Ireland were refreshing to interview because, while
they were suspicious about the peace treaty itself, there was
little grousing about politicians or the political process.
Virtually every person I confronted on the street for any interview
was cheerful and happy to talk. One elderly couple invited me to
their house for tea on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The friendliness no doubt reflects the culture, even in a place
where people have been at war for years. But it also may reflect
the fact that people in Ireland do not live in a world of 30-second
attack commercials. Irish voters may hate each other, but this
time, at least, their politics wasn't hateful.
</P>
<P>
   My journey to Ireland left me longing for a simpler American
politics, one where heartfelt speeches mean more than television
spots, where it is possible to interview a candidate without having
to calibrate the gap between spin and truth. Like the Irish, I hope
things will change. Like them, I doubt they will.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'll dwell on the benefits of this country's
high-tech wizardry. In Ireland, we had to wait an excruciating day
for officials to tally yes-or-no ballots. There is no such dallying
in this land of short attention spans. As I write this sentence,
the experts have already projected most of the victors on Tuesday.
Come Wednesday, I'll be long gone, on to the next campaign.

<P>
   Godzilla was going about his business in a Times Square theater
one afternoon last week when he discovered a murdered infant
godzilla and shrieked in anguish (118 decibels). Then he was
strafed by fighter jets (105 to 115 decibels for five minutes).
Finally, he died (67 decibels).
</P>
<P>
   As a wave of ear-splitting summer movies arrives at theaters,
ears ache or hiss or buzz the way they do after a rock concert. The
moviegoers to whom they are attached wonder whether it's just their
imagination or whether the volume of the soundtrack was at
jet-engine levels. Almost: Jets take off at an eardrum-rupturing
150 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course movies are louder than they used to be,'' said
Leonard Maltin, the critic for the television program Entertainment
Tonight. ``It's a question of whether it's an entertainment or an
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is the result of the digital-sound age, which has
brought hiss-free soundtracks and multi-channel systems with more
knobs and meters than an airplane cockpit. And there are giant
subwoofers under seats and speakers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not just with the equipment in theaters. When
big-budget films are mixed in a way that makes gunfire
crystal-clear but muffles the speech, some frustrated moviegoers
see a metaphor for everything that is wrong with Hollywood. They
long for perfectionist projectionists like the Philippe Noiret
character in ``Cinema Paradiso.''
</P>
<P>
   Uneasiness about ear-splitting volume in movie theaters prompted
a panel discussion at the Cannes Film Festival this month titled,
``Are Movies Too Loud?'' The consensus seemed to be yes, according
to Variety, the show business newspaper that was a sponsor of the
session. It said that creative types and executives shared a common
concern about too-loud soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the movies for a bigger experience than other
entertainment,'' Variety quoted Mario Van Peebles, the director of
the 1991 drug-world drama ``New Jack City,'' as saying, ``but they
have to be able to hear the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   How loud the sound should be is already an issue for the Newport
International Film Festival in Rhode Island, and it doesn't even
open until Tuesday. The festival's organizers have been holding
test screenings in their rented theater, a gilt-trimmed relic from
the days of pipe organs and uniformed ushers. They listen for a
minute or two, then ask each other, Is that too loud?
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect a movie now to be like a roller coaster ride,''
said Christine Schomer, the festival's executive director. ``With
these summer movies especially, every one has to out-top each
other, and the only way to do that is to make them as loud as
possible. And the thing is, the movie costs so much, they're
tricking us into thinking it's more entertaining the louder it
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   How loud? At a showing of ``Quest for Camelot'' in Stamford,
Conn., the decibel level was in the 70 to 75 range, with 85- to
90-decibel bursts. But the previews were even louder: one for
``Rugrats'' registered 80 decibels, except when it surged to 87.
The moment it started, a 4-year-old clamped her hands over her ears
and kept them there. ``Put it softer, Mommy,'' she implored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth,'' in a New York City theater, was in the 68- to
70-decibel range. But during the louder sequences when Warren
Beatty was delivering line after line of rapping rhyme, the meter
climbed to 106, even 109 at one point. That is significantly louder
than a garbage truck (85 decibels), jackhammer (88 decibels) or a
car alarm (80 decibels).
</P>
<P>
   But going strictly by numbers misses a more fundamental point.
Several times at a another showing of ``Bulworth,'' one back-row
moviegoer repeatedly asked her husband what Beatty had just said.
Patricia King Hanson, the editor of the American Film Institute
Catalog, sees irony in the notion that Beatty has become hard to
hear. He was, she said, ``one of the great pioneers in having this
ultraloud sound in `Bonnie and Clyde.'''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Godzilla'' is what ``Bonnie and Clyde'' has wrought. But
too-loud soundtracks are about more than monsters that are longer
than the lines outside the theater. Noise causes stress, even
hearing loss. Various studies have linked prolonged exposure to
noise of between 85 and 115 decibels with an assortment of
physical, mental and social problems ranging from hypertension to
helplessness, from learning disabilities to birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday noise can send a sound-level meter into the overload
zone, and there is no question that entertainment is noisier than
it was before the invention of electric guitars. But Tom Horral,
the technical director of Acentech, an acoustical-engineering
company in Boston, blames the complaints about overly loud movies
on 1990's technology that eliminated so-called residual noise,
making the soundtrack purer. In the bass range, for instance,
sounds that once were distorted into noise by increasing the volume
can now be played loudly without significant distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplexing has created another problem: Sound spills into the
theater next door. ``In the building and planning of multiplexes,''
Maltin said, ``they think they take this into account. What they
haven't taken into account is the vibrations caused by the ever
more sophisticated sound systems. When Godzilla stomps its mighty
foot, they want the theater to shake from not just the sound but
the tremor.''  &QL;

domestic habits that they hate. What if the bride is a neatnik and
the groom is a slob? What if he can't bear to talk to anyone when

 By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Cakes topple. Drunken relatives fight. Brides turn out to be
allergic to their flowers. Gowns and tuxes don't arrive in time.
 &HT;    These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding, no
matter how carefully it is planned. Even wedding coordinators admit
that some things are beyond their control.
 &HT;    For example, Phyllis Block, head of the wedding team at The
World Trade Center in Boston, once handled a wedding at which the
couple's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself.
 &HT;    Toni deLisi, a consultant in Waldwick, N.J., once planned a
wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York, only to have thieves steal
the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    Then there are times when things go really awry: Guests have
fistfights and get arrested. An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on
fire.
 &HT;    If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch
possible _ it's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson, a justice of the
peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton, Mass.
 &HT;    Robinson, who performed 327 weddings in 1997, once married a
couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O. It involved 72
packets of gelatin, 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle
stirrer.
 &HT;    At one wedding over which Robinson presided, the bride's
divorced parents were on bad terms. After the groom's father gave
an emotional toast to the newlyweds, the bride's embittered father
grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good
 !!% !%!,'' he ranted. Everyone gasped, as he continued, ``I also
wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding.''
 &HT;    He was interrupted by his ex-wife, who shot back, ``No, you
didn't, you  !!%!'' The ex-wife then jumped up, grabbed her
ex-husband's throat and punched him in the stomach.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the ex-husband's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife
with her fingernails, while both reached for the microphone to use
as a weapon.
 &HT;    The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot. When all
was said and done, 11 people were arrested.
 &HT;    Another time, Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio
overlooking a golf course. During the nuptials, he realized there
was a ruckus behind him, but he didn't dare turn around. When it
came time for the bride to say her vows, a breathy voice in back of
him yelled, ``I do.''
 &HT;    It was the groom's ex-girlfriend, decked out in a wedding gown,
determined to get revenge. Pandemonium broke out faster than you
can say ``Fatal Attraction.'' The groom then warned everyone to be
careful, as his former flame had recently broken into his house,
trashed it and slit his car tires.
 &HT;    When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment, the angry ex
took lighter fluid, wrote ``I Love You'' on the hood of the car and
set it on fire.
 &HT;    ``I left before I heard what happened next,'' Robinson says.
 &HT;    Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the
budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead
of hiring professional musicians. Unfortunately, Uncle Joe got
inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate, to say the
least. The parents danced to ``Send in the Clowns,'' the newlyweds
waltzed to ``The Stripper'' and the groom and his mother danced to
``Do It to Me One More Time.''
 &HT;    Doug Giordano, director of food and beverage at New Jersey's
Woodcliff Lake Hilton, once had a bride who was assaulted by
strangers in the restroom.
 &HT;    This happened at another hotel, where the ballroom and the bar
shared a restroom. Apparently, three jealous _ and intoxicated _
female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom, held
her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their
cigarettes.
 &HT;    At another wedding that Giordano handled, three rap stars, who
had just performed at The Meadowlands, returned to their hotel and,
out of boredom, crashed the wedding in the ballroom. They ran out
onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance, Giordano
recalls. When one of the bridesmaids confronted them, it evolved
into a fistfight ``with split lips, black eyes and five police
cars,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least there were no threats of bullets. Teddy Lenderman, a
wedding coordinator in Terre Haute, Ind., wore a bulletproof vest
for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest, groom
and several members of the wedding party.
 &HT;    Apparently, the groom's irrational mother didn't like the bride,
and told him, ``If you marry her, I'm going to come in and blow you
all away.''
 &HT;    No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative's
funeral, where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut.
When the funeral director approached her, she kicked him and broke
his leg in three places.
 &HT;    On the day before the wedding, she called the rectory five times
and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm.
 &HT;    On the wedding day, the nervous groom called his mom and forbade
her to come.
 &HT;    ``She didn't show,'' Lenderman says. ``But in my 14 years of
business, at that point, I had never experienced anything so
nerve-wracking.''
 &HT;    The bride was the tremulous one t a wedding attended by Barbara
Sheehan, an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii.
 &HT;    Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle, then
turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question:
 &HT;    ``You can learn to love someone, can't you?''

 &UR; By MARTHA A. WOODHAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``The Bride Did What?!''
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother is sure she knows what's correct. Your beloved's
mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't
wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's
attended. You begin to feel queasy at the thought of ``Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   1. The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids
and groomsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish
_ best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky brides wail, ``But I don't feel close to his sisters. I
want my friends instead.'' A wedding is a great place to get
acquainted. After the ``I do's,'' those strangers will be your
sisters, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many women going to college, supporting themselves and
marrying later, being ``given away'' seems terribly out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom _ and her
new husband _ should sit in the first pew. Dad _ and his new wife _
should sit in the next pew.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   4. The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women _ even all
children if you like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be politically correct at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   5. A bride cannot ask her mother to be the matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
</P>
<P>
   6. A bride cannot ask her mother to escort her down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lovely gesture, and most moms are thrilled to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   7. A flower girl must be under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The littler they are, the cuter they are _ and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl: At a
crucial moment in the ceremony, I stage-whispered, ``Mommy, I have
to tee-tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old _ or young _ the child is.
</P>
<P>
   8. Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their
own age.
</P>
<P>
   No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pregnant woman cannot be a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   10. There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
</P>
<P>
   If the bride's best friend is a guy, she should ask him. But she
shouldn't call him, as one Atlanta bride did, her ``mister of
honor.''

 c.1998 Elegant Wedding, published by Philadelphia magazine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>

must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

   &UR; By EVE GLICKSMAN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 Elegant Wedding, published by Philadelphia magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to be patient, cordial and mannerly,''
according to Bilofsky. ``You have a loved one in common. Do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, she adds, ``Remind yourself that your in-laws
must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

   Carol Hersh-Weiss collects, and then some. To enter her
sprawling New York City apartment is to venture into the nooks and
crannies of her decidedly idiosyncratic mind. Along one wall are 19
pairs of shoes, a small part of a collection of black shoes.
Elsewhere soda bottles bearing forgotten brand names like ``Cheer
Up,'' ``Dream'' and ``Just Whistle.'' Hidden in a drawer are
thousands of erasers, including one shaped like Ronald Reagan's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Antique quilts are everywhere, well over 100 the last time
anybody counted. They have multiplied in value 10 times over in the
last 15 years, with many worth more than $1,000. Mrs. Hersh-Weiss,
a professional potter, has told her husband, Norman, a
mathematician at Queens College, that quilts beat the stock market
hands down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make more money on my quilts than he can on Microsoft
and Intel,'' she said. ``He's not going to double his money and I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersh-Weiss's optimism is shared by millions of other
Americans who are taking advantage of the strong economy to collect
stamps and coins as well as used beer cans in the hope that they
will increase in value. One in three Americans collect something.
Most of them don't care that collectibles, which is a term for
items made solely for the enjoyment of the collector, have
historically decreased in value than increased. They are more
concerned about the proliferation of fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Trade magazines estimate the collectibles market to be
approaching $10 billion in annual sales, and stories of resale are
legend. The Jetsons lunch box bought for $1 at a garage sale in
1980 fetching $200 today. The 1955 Murray fire truck that sold for
$50 in 1993 worth $250. The unused Hawaiian missionary stamp
selling for $575,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the collectibles action is on the Internet, where
millions participate in auctions held at hundreds of sites. It
helps to be in the news. Frank Sinatra memorabilia is suddenly hot.
All things connected with the millennium items will be collected.
</P>
<P>
   But white-hot publicity can be as fleeting as a sound bite: When
Princess Diana died, autographed pictures that had been worth
$1,500 immediately jumped to $50,000. The price has since drifted
back to about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the amount of material related to the events surrounding
Princess Diana's death and burial, it is safe to assume that supply
will exceed demand for centuries, not decades, to come,'' wrote
Harry L. Rinker in Antiques &AMP; Collecting Magazine. ``Even if 90
percent ends up in the landfill, supply will exceed demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the supply-and-demand equation more in evidence than
in the area of instant heirlooms. The Franklin Mint sells them by
the hundreds of thousands, including its non-firing replica of
Wyatt Earp's six-shooter and a 24-inch porcelain doll of Marilyn
Monroe in a feathered headdress. The company is in the business of
selling the glorious illusions that most resonate with the average
person. It bought Jacqueline Onassis's faux pearls for $211,500 at
auction and made replicas that became runaway best sellers at $195
each.
</P>
<P>
   But true value hinges on scarcity _ a bitter truth learned by
the 17th-century Dutch when speculators drove the price of tulips
to astronomic levels, only to see it crash with an abundant tulip
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Today collectors seem motivated more by love, often tinged with
nostalgia, than by thoughts of making a killing. ``People end up
buying themselves a present in a way that means something,'' said
Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center who has personally collected 25,000 comic books; baseballs
autographed by Babe Ruth, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle and Yogi
Berra, and Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers ray guns. Still, Manevitz
worries that people, including some of his patients, become  &UR; too &LR; 
obsessed. ``You shouldn't define yourself through your things,'' he
said, sounding almost convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lose myself in it,'' said Hank Seiden, an avid
collector who runs an advertising agency in his spare time. From
the time he bought bought an F.D.R. autograph for $5 as a
teen-ager, he has always set a goal in his collecting. He now owns
the signatures of all United States presidents, and all members of
Yankees teams in 1927, 1941, 1951 and 1961. ``I'm not a nut,'' he
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Luck matters in collecting. On May 24, Yankee Stadium offered a
free Beanie Baby to every child. Produced in limited quantities,
other versions of the plush toys have gotten prices of nearly
$3,000, but the financial windfall, finally, seems to be ebbing.
Except perhaps for the free teddy bears given out by the Yanks:
Each of these carries a certificate with the date of the game when
David Wells pitched a perfect game. A cuddly, properly dated
specimen already resides in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

   &UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times
Syndicate looks at the changing institution of fatherhood from many
perspectives. We examine the conflicts men face balancing work and
family, and the trend toward becoming fathers in middle age. We
offer two essays by dads anticipating Father's Day: one nostalgic
and one humorous. And for those dads who love to hit the links, Jim

   Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing
work and family. But what about the working dad? In the 1990s, more

and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and
vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better

   As many women have children later in life and divorced men
remarry and have second families, many men in theIR late 40s, 50s
and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns. They may
get mistaken for grandfathers, but this new breed of fathers brings
a fresh new perspective to fatherhood, the authors say, often
valuing their children as much or even more than work. But older
fathers also face doubts about whether it's fair to raise a young
child at an advanced age. (slugged:

   This Father's Day, Herrera's children have asked him to take

``The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special.
Too often it's taken for granted by both parent and child,''
Herrera says. (slugged:

 By EVERETT DeMORIER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage''  
 &HT;    Whether you've been living together since junior high school or
spent your first night together on your honeymoon, the agenda for
the first year of marriage is pretty much the same. Just when you
thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself
or herself, you're really meeting each other for the first time.
 &HT;    Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of
single life, with an additional person. But as soon as two people
step across the marriage threshold, with sweater-drying rack and
dartboard in hand, two sets of histories and expectations must
join.
 &HT;    Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy
first year of marriage and living together prior to being married,
but living together does get a few of those
put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the-
old-one-first type of rules out of the way. Some of them, but not
all.
 &HT;    Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of
marriage, and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them.
 &HT;    + Feeling at home.
 &HT;    Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a
new home your own, whether you have moved in with your spouse or
the two of you have moved into a new home together. Having friends
and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a
sense of pride in your home, and a feeling of ease and comfort.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the little things that help establish roots, such
as being the voice on the answering machine, planting a garden or
making friends with the neighbors.
 &HT;    + The slob factor.
 &HT;    If your spouse's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired,
if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the
refrigerator, the pile method is a great alternative to bashing
your spouse with a tire iron.
 &HT;    The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a
desk, a dresser, a closet, somewhere you can live with a mess _ and
placing all the wallets, car keys, dirty socks, magazines, dishes
and so forth in that place.
 &HT;    This works for the ``neatnik,'' because everything can be picked
up and deposited quickly, and it works for the slob because
everything is in one place. Note: This is a treatment, not a cure.
 &HT;    + The clash of expectations.
 &HT;    Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a
couple to be. Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic. You won't
know until it's out in the open. Be specific.
 &HT;    Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like
your father did for your mother? Do you expect your mate to be home
exactly at 5 o'clock? Do you expect to be able to have friends over
every night?
 &HT;    The majority of newlyweds' fights occur when one spouse is not
acting the way the other spouse expects. But no one, not even
Robert Duvall, can act without a script.
 &HT;    + The age-old toothpaste dilemma.
 &HT;    This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to
resolve when you get right down to it. If your mate insists on
leaving the cap off the toothpaste, or worse, squeezing the tube in
the middle (gasp!), just buy two tubes of toothpaste.
 &HT;    To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or
under _ believe it or not, this actually accounted for an entire
segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers.
 &HT;    Of course, having separate bathrooms would solve not only both
these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the
sexes: Should the toilet seat be left up or down?
 &HT;    The best advice is just to get over it. Sure, you think the
world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ... But
would it really?
 &HT;    Personal habits take some getting used to. Any two people need
time to adjust to each other, a new lifestyle and new surroundings.
Relax. A routine will develop soon enough, and you will quickly
forget that you were ever uncomfortable.
 &HT;    + ``Don't talk to me before I have my coffee.''
 &HT;    There are morning people and there are night people. And then
there are peppy morning people. If you've married one of those
people who pop out of bed, draw open the shades and sing in the
shower ... first of all, my condolences. On the other hand, your
mate is probably a happy person, which may be why you fell in love
with him or her in the first place.
 &HT;    + ``Isn't the game over yet?''
 &HT;    Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent
complaints heard from newlywed women. While women often complain
about their husband's sports-viewing habits, however, many women
actually like watching sports on television, particularly with
their mates. Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports
occupies the entire weekend.
 &HT;    One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to
watch, rather than just watching anything that's on.
 &HT;    Here are some other solutions:
 &HT;    Have a sports party. Invite friends or other couples over to
watch the game.
 &HT;    Participate in a sport together. Join a volleyball team or a
bowling league. Take up tennis or golf. Being involved in a sport
makes it more interesting to watch it on television.
 &HT;    Go to the sporting event together. Rather than lounge in the
easy chair all day Saturday, buy tickets to the local college
football game and make a day of it.
 &HT;    Go do something else on your weekend time together, and listen
to the game on the way.
 &HT;    + Sharing the covers.
 &HT;    There's not much people can do to change their behaviors when
they're fast asleep. Thus, newlyweds often complain about the
spouse's snoring, hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle
of the night.
 &HT;    There are some things both partners can do before falling
asleep, however, that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing.
For instance, if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more
warmly for bed, he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during
the night. Likewise, if the partner who ends up without covers
during the night dresses more warmly, he or she will not mind as
much when the covers disappear.
 &HT;    Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to
the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers
during the night can use a substitute blanket.
 &HT;    For a more romantic option, try sleeping closer together. Body
heat is better than a blanket any day.

 &UR; (From ``Fathers of a Certain Age'') &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' a tiny voice says next to his ear, ``it's time to get
up. It's light out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam groans, his eyes still closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep, honey,'' he manages to say. ``It's
nighttime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, still without moving, not addressing anyone in particular:
``Can't you do something about this? I'm 54 years old and there's a
child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam says that on mornings like these, he feels as if he's
living in a lost episode of ``The Twilight Zone.'' He is a member
of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s,
50s and even 60s. At a time when they should be basking in the
midafternoon sun of lives well lived, these men are raising young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mornings when I'll wake up _ I most likely, get
awakened,'' says Adam, ``and I'll say to myself, where the hell am
I? And who's this insane person in my body who's doing this? And
then I realize, it's me. I'm the insane person.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son
to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those
guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in
their early 30s playing with their children nearby. ``Sure, at some
level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch
strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are
_ just another father in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam is typical of these fathers ``of a certain age.'' They have
always been around, but now there seem to be a lot more of them.
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the
folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and,
many would say, inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women _
and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good.
 &UR; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is an everyday miracle,'' a friend in his 50s
tells us, smiling. Steve has three grown children, all boys, from
his first marriage, and a girl, age 2, from his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when
you are in late middle age,'' Steve goes on. ``The unfolding of
life has to be savored _ observed carefully, contemplated and
understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the
unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror. My attachment to
my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems
more like what mothers are supposed to feel. I have discovered real
parenting skills, the ones I was too busy to work on when I was
climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
</P>
<P>
   One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Alan (her son) today, at 27,'' she said, quite
agitated, ``if he had been born to a father in his 50s. Suppose his
father had even lived that long, he would be 80. Could a man 80
years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like
Alan still needs in his 20s? Could that same father at 70 have had
any meaningful connection with a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``More likely, Alan would now have to
be taking care of an old man with serious health problems. I don't
think kids in their 20s are ready to do that. They should not have
to do it. They should be free to think about themselves. God knows,
the ego trip ends soon enough, why make them take on the worry of
aging parents when they should be exploring life?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it is to lose a parent when you are
young,'' she continued, getting angrier. ``I lost my mother when I
was 21, and I never got over it. It is devastating and unfair.
Sure, it happens even when you are born to young parents like I
was. But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of
dying before their kids are 20. You may not like that idea, but it
is true. It leaves a tremendous void.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry says the conversation shook him to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life?'' he
worries. ``Do children who have older parents and lose them
prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure
self-gratification? I realized that in the decision around this
child, neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I
would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then
teenager confronted puberty and high school. Our main concerns had
been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he thought about it further, Larry realized that having a
father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent
phenomenon. His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a
``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father
died in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his
young child. Older parents know that they risk making their
children face a father's ``early'' death. Yet they also know that
they can give their child a higher material standard of living,
more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and
probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the
father is present.
</P>
<P>
   When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

 By JAMES A. LEVINE AND TODD L. PITTINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old
son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general
manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine. ``Then when I
come home, I can tap right into Will's world. I'll say, `I hear you
were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.' It
lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough
``quality time'' with their children. And when they're unable to do
this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey
of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work?
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other.
 &UR; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace,''
says Stewart Friedman, director of the Wharton Life Interests
Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
``Fathers' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on
children's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some surprising ways that a father's work has impact,
positive or negative, on his kids.
</P>
<P>
   + When fathers are satisfied with their jobs, their children
have fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about
his work with a positive attitude, confidence and pride, that seems
to rub off on his kids,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   + Too many or too few work hours affect children's learning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State
University in Columbus, sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth
Menaghan, the authors of ``Parents' Jobs and Children's Lives''
(Aldine De Gruyter, 1994), found that a father's unemployment may
be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining, hitting
and acting out. Conversely, working sustained overtime _ not just
putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, vocabulary will not be as developed,'' Parcel observes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad is around, on the other hand, there are big benefits
for kids, numerous studies show. For example, at 6 months of age,
babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an
intellectual ability test, according to a study by F.A. Pederson,
author of the ``The Father-Infant Relationship'' (Praeger, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   + How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be able to stay with the company,'' Lovell says,
``if they didn't trust that I'll always get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work,
they feel more confident as parents,'' she says. ``And they are
clearer about what they expect from their children, too.''
 &UR; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in
their policies?
</P>
<P>
   Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
</P>
<P>
   But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy, listening skills, knowing how to teach others and how
learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are
directly applicable to the workplace,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look more closely for nonverbal signals now,'' he says,
``and I can use this skill when I'm talking with colleagues and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sensitive to a father's family
responsibilities, dads want to keep working there. Mike Dedek, a
software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in
Miamisburg, Ohio, says, ``My dedication to this company is
primarily due to their family friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's policies and programs take family needs into
account, employees are 45 percent more likely to ``go the extra
mile'' for their employer, say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington,
Del.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication,
but, as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New
York observes, ``When people are less stressed out, they tend to
produce better on the job.''
 &UR; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
</P>
<P>
   + Ask, don't assume.
</P>
<P>
   Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.

   One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay
home with his son, who wasn't feeling well, so his wife took time
off from her own job. The next day his boss _ a working parent
herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home. When he
mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child, the boss
said, ``Why don't you do your work at home if you need to?''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   + Frame your request in terms of work.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
</P>
<P>
   + Use your human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   HR professionals today often receive special training in helping
employees negotiate sticky work/family issues. So, again, ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   + Turn down extra work with business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing
your work: ``I'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up
some other stuff on my plate. Can we review my assignments and see
what I might delay doing, or perhaps delegate to someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   + Find strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not yet be the law of the land, but a member of the
nation's highest court is recognizing dads' family needs. In 1994,
shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule
for law clerk David Post, who was attending Georgetown University
at night. His wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so Post
needed to care for their children during part of each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream of the way the world should be,'' Ginsburg
said. ``I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are
doing a parent's work, who do not regard that as strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men
who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they
spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be
thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its brassy boardwalk, bar and shopping-mall culture, New
Jersey is the ancestral home of the attitudinal T-shirt _ the ones
that say things like ``I'm Not as Think as You Drunk I Am'' in
blurry letters.
</P>
<P>
   Little surprise, then, that Gov. Christie Whitman chose to
proclaim her state's border victory over New York last week by
gleefully displaying a T-shirt that said, ``Ellis Island, N.J.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was celebrating a triumph in a once-obscure dispute
between New Jersey and New York over boundaries in the middle of
the Hudson River. In a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that
24.2 acres of Ellis Island landfill were actually in New Jersey,
and not in New York as everyone had assumed since the island was
expanded starting in the late 19th century to process the arrival
of 12 million immigrants. The original 3.3 acres _ on which the
main hall and immigration museum stand _ remain in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which state map it is on, Ellis Island is a national
park, owned by the federal government. Each year 1.6 million
tourists visit it. Last week, reporters dispatched to the island to
get reaction to the border victory found a wall of people who might
as well have been wearing those T-shirts that say, ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the public seemed to care little about state
sovereignty over the revered pile of land (and landfill) with the
breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan
skyline _ the place where the ancestors of an estimated 40 percent
of today's Americans first set foot in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, politicians and their amen choruses among the
news media seemed to care quite a lot. Mrs. Whitman, for example,
proclaimed herself ``delighted that the Supreme Court has
officially recognized New Jersey's place in history,'' and
triumphantly set off for a Republican Party fund-raiser in Ohio,
where she asserted that the Ellis Island victory was proof that she
still had relevance as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to remain on the sidelines, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York City scoffed at the idea that New Jersey had any valid
claim on the island's mythology. Giuliani said he was certain his
immigrant grandfather hadn't told himself, ``I'm coming to New
Jersey'' when he boarded a ship in Genoa. ``He knew he was coming
to the streets of New York,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Finnegan, a professor of politics at Stone Hill College
in Easton, Mass., said, ``It seems to me there was a lot of `My
state can lick your state' in all this.'' Finnegan said he was
astonished at ``the exaggerated attention to a matter that most
people think is pretty minor at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we aren't exactly talking the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act
here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case took five years and generated 2,000
documents and 4,000 pages of testimony, prompting Justice David
Souter to remark ruefully in his majority opinion on the
``succession of legal fees and expenses arising from interstate
boundary disputes.'' The litigation undoubtedly cost New Jersey
taxpayers far more than can ever be recouped from the state's newly
staked claim to a portion of the sales tax revenue generated by
island's gift and snack shops.
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan said he was intrigued by the Ellis Island news bubble
because of its similarity to another recent scene in modern
political theater. He was referring to a ploy by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., who earlier this year slipped the following words
into a routine bill authorizing federal money for research on the
Great Lakes: ``The term Great Lakes includes Lake Champlain.''
Thus, Lake Champlain, a comparative sliver of water between Vermont
and New York, suddenly became the sixth Great Lake _ to the delight
of regional politicians, area Chambers of Commerce and the local
news media, but to the horror of national geographers and
historians.
</P>
<P>
   The law was quickly rewritten to withdraw the distinction, but
the brouhaha lifted Leahy's stock. In the end, Finnegan said, both
the Lake Champlain and Ellis Island furors were prime examples of
what he called ``policy as entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ellis Island commotion really represents the
infantilization of politics,'' he added, ``driving it down to the
seventh-grade level: `My state whipped your state.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some reaction in New Jersey seemed to support that notion.
``It's about pride,'' crowed an editorial celebrating the Ellis
Island victory in The Star Ledger of Newark, New Jersey's largest
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really about respect, not money,'' said Bret
Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, who nevertheless noted that
Ellis Island, N.J., now falls within his city's boundaries and is
potentially part of Jersey City's urban empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of commercial development is barely submerged under
any discussion of change in landlords on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has not indicated whether it might pressure the
National Park Service to allow more development on Ellis Island,
N.J. But preservationists have been fretting for years about the
fate of that part of the island, which contains the medical
buildings where the sick and contagious were once treated. In 1992,
preservationists blocked a Park Service plan that would have
allowed a developer to demolish the old buildings and build a hotel
or conference center. Now they fear similar proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Ellis Island as a national park that needs money for
historical preservation has been swamped by the hoopla in the past
week, said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk has been bragging rights and sales tax and who
gets what _ but we're missing the history part,'' she said. ``Ellis
Island is the only national park in the country that some people
look on as a development site waiting for a hotel and conference
center.''

 &HT;    
 By JOE APPLEGATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is 5 a.m. on Father's Day, and you have decisions to make. Do
you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with
their annual offerings of gratitude and affection, their homemade
cards, fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne?
 &HT;    Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone's the
wiser?
 &HT;    You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face
of your wife. You ask yourself where in the world you would be
without her.
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach?
 &HT;    Naah! This is where you belong, you tell yourself angrily. You
dope! A wife and children, good health, a steady job _ be honest
with yourself, you sorry hacker, would you trade them for anything
on this planet? Would you?
 &HT;    You choke back a tear.
 &HT;    Yes! Tiger Woods' swing.
 &HT;    Again, wearily, you try to imagine playing golf for a living,
having a job where you don't have to answer a phone, phone in an
answer, estimate budget figures, figure budget estimates or budget
estimated figures while answering the phone.
 &HT;    You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don't
hate their jobs sometimes. And yet, try as you might, you cannot
imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back
nine by 5 o'clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff
meeting before dinner.
 &HT;    OK, dude, you tell yourself, that's enough for one morning, get
a grip. Back to reality _ and a good, sane reality it is. You've
got some blessings to count:
 &HT;    + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her
exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls. You both
carry your own bags.
 &HT;    + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even
if it is for a price. You control the bets, however, and every
penny you have to pay out is worth it. The expression on a kid's
little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless.
 &HT;    + Your own good sense, when all is said and done, in knowing
when to go for the greens and when to lay back, as now, in bed.
 &HT;    There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural,
healthy choice. Is there any better alternative to the stupor of
the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course,
even a snowy one?
 &HT;    And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to
play golf is maybe just a little bit sick. Father's Day is one,
Mother's Day definitely another.
 &HT;    So today, of all days, it's best to be still and enjoy your
status as father. Maybe one day your kid, interviewed after winning
a tournament and a big check on Father's Day, will smile at the
camera, wave and shout, ``I love you, Dad!'' _ just the way Woods
did on Mother's Day, except, of course, that he said, ``I love you,
Mom!''
 &HT;    And just think how popping proud you'll be that Father's Day,
watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your
late-afternoon round.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Thanks to past Father's Days, I can go a month without washing
underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at
any department store. As the father of four children, I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. However, my
hopes may be too high for 1998.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate
in my closet, I could always use another necktie. Coffee-shop
coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup.
 &HT;    But this year, I want something radical: I want peace on
Father's Day.
 &HT;    I'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice,
too. I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story
house.
 &HT;    I answered, ``What if you guys quit fighting on Father's Day?''
 &HT;    You see, a day rarely goes by in our house without ``He hit
me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes the witty
``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I'm asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty doesn't have to be in
writing _ I'll accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    But I want an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'' ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    My request puzzled them. Either they didn't understand or they
knew the mission was impossible. I could tell they were hunting for
an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening and scaly
creatures engaging in noisy rampages. No, we weren't watching ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The
Lost World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater, strolling along
the steep hills, past the Veterans Memorial and my school, St.
Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he liked the Batman movie
as much as I did. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago, and every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.
 &HT;    When we're coming out of the theater this year, maybe I'll catch
them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat
socks they've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge
of the driveway.
 &HT;    While we're at it, let's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _
especially at the dinner table and at church.
 &HT;    But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them. The
time a child spends alone with his or her father is special. Too
often it's taken for granted by both parent and child.
 &HT;    Maybe peace at home on Father's Day is a bit much to ask. Maybe
all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to
create some moments worth reliving.

   During that time, golf has exploded, both as a spectator and a

</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was not, however, without his crushing defeats or his
personal insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open. At
the age of 42, he had finished his final round of the championship
and was standing beside the scorer's tent waiting to be interviewed
as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens, if Tom Watson
bogied either of the last two holes. And Watson was in trouble, his
ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th.
</P>
<P>
   From our tower at 18, I looked down on Nicklaus. He was staring
at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot. From the difficult
lie, it might well run far across the green, leaving him a likely
bogie and setting up victory for Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson made ``the shot heard round the world,'' knocking the
ball into the hole for a birdie. In that instant, as he stood just
below me, Jack's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of
defeat, but a look of total shock and deep disappointment, the face
of a stricken youngster, not of the most famous golfer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arnold Palmer
</P>
<P>
   To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman,
it helps to sit with him as I did at the home (in Latrobe, Pa.) he
and his wife, Winnie, have lived in for more than 35 years and
understand that he IS Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   He still loves to sit by the pool, looking down toward the
course he grew up on, just at the bottom of the hill. That day some
four or five years ago, he smiled and told me how he used to lie
outside his family's house on the edge of the course and wait for
the woman to come by the sixth hole--the woman who always gave him
a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself now when I was really small,'' he said.
``Making sure my dad couldn't see me because I wasn't allowed on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his
fans. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he said, ``maybe it's because they understand who I am.
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person. Maybe
they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their
encouragement means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee Trevino
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972
British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on one tee, he turned to the crowd and said, ``They
took me to an old castle for dinner last night. We had food like
they ate back in the old days, and we ate like they did--with our
fingers. Heck, back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat
with a fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Watson
</P>
<P>
   Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gary Player
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the
fanatical, and some of his beliefs approach the mystical. In the
earlier days, he would usually dress totally in black. ``Why?'' he
was asked. ``It must be terribly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``but it makes me feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Greg Norman
</P>
<P>
   I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   7. Seve Ballesteros
</P>
<P>
   His emergence was sudden, his impact enormous, his downfall
unforeseen and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nick Faldo
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, I have found myself thinking, Can you imagine Ben
Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach?
</P>
<P>
   9. Ray Floyd
</P>
<P>
   How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els?
</P>
<P>
   All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back and ask me that in 20 years,'' he said, ``and I'll
tell you.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the brouhaha last week over the dropping of remedial classes
at the City University of New York, one of the nation's largest
systems, would make many people think that remediation was a
multicultural course invented by CUNY professors.
</P>
<P>
   They would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 78 percent of America's colleges offered such classes,
up from 73 percent in 1988. Although they were most prevalent at
public community colleges (96 percent of them offered these courses
in 1995), they were common at four-year colleges, too, with 72
percent offering the courses.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of
Education, found that almost half of all college students took at
least one class to prepare them for college-level work. At CUNY
last year, 46 percent of students entering four-year colleges
failed one or more of the placement examinations in reading,
writing and math. At the California State University System, about
half the freshmen need such classes to acclimate them to the rigors
of academia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ivy League, the official line is that there are no
remedial courses or underprepared students, but these institutions
typically provide help in different guises. Harvard and Yale, for
instance, offer peer tutors and a writing center. At the University
of Chicago, a handful of students are directed each year to a
course called essential mathematics that begins with arithmetic,
algebra and geometry _ comparable to the remedial math courses at
CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   So why are so many high-school graduates unprepared for college?
</P>
<P>
   One explanation, educators say, is that there is a gap between
what many secondary schools expect their students to know and what
college professors require, and that there has not been enough
coordination between them. Another is that many high schools offer
preparatory courses but students fail to take them, either because
they are not planning to go to college or because they think they
can get by without them. In some cases, they get weak instruction;
sometimes they do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have been allowed to coast,'' said Joseph Creech,
director for educational policies at the Southern Regional
Education Board in Atlanta. ``If students are going to have to be
able to do certain things when they get to college, then we have to
make these expectations clear in high school, and even in middle
school.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time many of these ill-prepared students simply did not
go to college. But in a technology-driven, information-based
economy, where a college diploma is a passport to a higher standard
of living, more students are continuing their education.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of university administrators and college
officials do not see this trend as good news. To them, each
remedial student represents a failure, and wasted resources _ a job
that has to be done at least twice thus diverting colleges from
their real mission of providing higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Remediation is such a dirty word that some colleges will not
even admit to offering it, although their catalogs list courses in
algebra, grammar and other subjects many students routinely take in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that it is despoiling the environment,'' said
H. Patrick Swygert, president of Howard University in Washington.
``Remediation _ the word _ is verboten on this campus because it
carries with it all the stigma that its opponents have trotted out
that students who need it are less than fully qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do not qualify intellectually or have the
inclination to do the hard intellectual work required in college,''
Swygert added. ``The great tragedy is that by removing remedial
classes, that is not who is being screened out. The numbers suggest
that once students navigate the remedial classes, many go on to
successful college careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Few colleges have approached moving remediation off campus with
the fervor of the trustees at the CUNY, who despite widespread
protests from faculty and students, voted last week to phase out
remedial classes at their four-year colleges by 2001. Students
failing placement exams will be directed to intensive summer or
weekend classes, or to the two-year community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of these students would be able to
complete these courses quickly, how many will opt for community
colleges or how many will choose other four-year colleges or simply
drop out in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But CUNY is not alone in trying to reduce its remediation.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities, like the University of Maryland, are trying
to foster closer coordination between secondary schools and
colleges about what ground will be covered in certain courses.
</P>
<P>
   The California State University, the largest public university
in the country with 360,000 students, has set a goal of reducing
the percentage of freshmen needing remediation to 10 percent by
2007 from more than 50 percent now. The trustees, who had hoped to
move faster, scaled back in the face of criticisms that they would
penalize immigrants and minority students who had attended poor
high schools and fared poorly in placement exams.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reed, who became chancellor of California State
University system in March, said he would like to follow a program
similar to the one he introduced at the University of Florida in
1985, where it offers no remedial courses; students needing them
must go to community colleges or other institutions. The students,
however, can still register for university classes at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be some students who need
remediation,'' Reed said. ``But universities are not as well
prepared to do remediation as the community colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critical part of the plan, he said, is to give the
college placement tests to high school students _ preferably by the
10th grade _ ``as a wake-up call.'' That way students can see where
they are weak and still have time to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work in Florida? Partly.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Florida say that only 10 percent
of the students need remedial work _ well below the figure at CUNY
and Cal State. The figure is lower in part because the university
takes in many of its students after they have already completed
some credits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But even under the Florida system, students do not always whiz
through their remedial courses. Chuck Lindsey, director of general
education at Florida Gulf Coast University, said that some students
simply skip the hours they should spend learning basics and
computer skills. ``They just keep taking the class until they pass
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Florida has taken one more step. The state recently passed a
law requiring that students taking remedial courses repeatedly will
be charged the full price of the course, not the subsidized price
available to local students.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Reed said, the number of students needing
remediation at Florida's community colleges continues to grow.

   CALIF-GOV (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The 1998 primary campaign for
California governor has shown that two things are inevitable in
America: excess and television. The race also has had the poor

SALLADAY.

lawyers for representing the state. By CLAY ROBISON.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Most of New York City's 44,000
taxicab drivers _ some estimate 90 per cent _ are immigrants,
mostly from South Asia, but also from the Caribbean and Latin
America. They came here seeking a chance for a better life than it
was possible for them to have in their native countries, as had so
many immigrants before them. By HARRY ROSENFELD.

   CLACK-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Robert F. Kennedy was the one
politician who told us to dream. The one politician who spoke with
passion to the problems of society and the world and challenged us
to do something about it. If this nation and this world are to ever
be made better, we must get back the passion and soul Kennedy
offered. By CARY CLACK.

   CHICAGO _ Merger mania may be running amok in the world of
commerce, but in the world of civics the opposite seems to be
happening. Cities and counties dotting the country are in the grip
of secession fever.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the San Fernando Valley has been brazenly
unfaithful to the city of Los Angeles, doing all it can to get a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in New York, the rural East End of Long Island filed
suit, trying to force the State Legislature to allow it to secede
from Suffolk County and form Peconic County.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, a legislator submitted a bill last year seeking to
study the feasibility of making northern Maine the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland lawmaker recently asked his Legislature to let
Eastern Shore residents decide if they want to form their own
state.
</P>
<P>
   And in March, seeking attention over a nettlesome fishing
dispute, people in a sliver of Minnesota called the Northwest Angle
got their congressman to propose a constitutional amendment
allowing them to secede from the United States and join Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue, perhaps, from places like Scotland and Quebec,
break-up talk is bleeding into legislatures and city halls. Some of
it is intended to draw attention to neglected issues. But most of
it stems from a serious desire for more local autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, as Staten Island learned in its failed secession battle
five years ago, these movements have dim prospects because they
usually must be approved by governing bodies of the very places
they want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The only movement currently given a fighting chance is in the
San Fernando Valley, the suburban sprawl of 1.4 million people that
spawned the nasally hip Valley Girl. An organized campaign by
constituents who believe they receive too few city services for
their high taxes is seeking to create what would be the nation's
sixth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The effort gained ground in October with a law that bars city
councils from vetoing secession initiatives, though there are still
hurdles: petition signatures of 25 percent of registered voters, a
viability study and a majority vote for secession in both the
Valley and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that they're not getting a fair shake in the
existing arrangements,'' said Richard Briffault, a professor at
Columbia University Law School who has written about legal issues
in secession but is neutral on its desirability. ``Usually, it's a
group that's a population minority in the larger entity. They are
also different in some significant way, whether it's based on
ethnicity or based on politics or based on economics.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the conservative Eastern Shore has chafed under
state laws on gun control and wetlands preservation, but ``the
straw that broke the camel's back,'' said State senator Richard L.
Colburn, a Republican, was the response when a toxic microbe killed
thousands of fish in Chesapeake Bay last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the problem to manure runoff at chicken farms, the major
Eastern Shore industry, the governor proposed stricter
environmental regulations costly to the poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we should control our own destiny,'' said Colburn, who
introduced a bill this session that was buried in committee but may
resurface. Colburn wants to call the new state Delmarva (after the
peninsula shared by Delaware and Virginia), and said it would have
no sales tax, loose environmental regulation and a blue flag with
one star like the Bonnie Blue flown by some southern states in the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists and politicians see secession as a movement whose
time has come, a welcome backlash to the consolidation that began
earlier in the century, when most cities grew by annexing
territory. A few cities, like Indianapolis and Nashville, have
merged with their suburbs in recent years, but some experts say the
pendulum is swinging the other way. In Los Angeles, which has
always been a diffuse collection of neighborhoods, Venice, San
Pedro and other communities are also talking secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fracturing cities might be the best way to form more efficient
governments,'' said Howard Husock, director of case studies and
public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
government. He also favors a ``quasi-secession'' movement in Dade
County, Fla., where four unincorporated areas near Miami have voted
to turn themselves into municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small municipalities can control things like schools, zoning
and other functions, and form compacts with other communities for
other services, like fire departments,'' Husock said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McClintock, a Republican Assemblyman who co-wrote the
California law opening the door to secession movements, puts the
argument in grander terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large, centralized command-and-control structures were very
much a 20th-century phenomenon, actually a throwback to medieval
governing modalities,'' he said. ``We have been re-learning the
lessons of the Enlightenment, that human institutions produce far
more satisfactory results when powers are decentralized and
disbursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Starr, a California historian who is the state librarian,
fears that breaking up Los Angeles would leave behind a shell of a
city. He said he saw some secession movements as ``a kind of shock
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a married couple when one person doesn't really want
a divorce but moves out,'' he added. ``Everybody starts rethinking
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents claim they reap benefits even if they don't gain
independence because the media attention forces elected officials
to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without Peconic County being formed, we have seen a lot
of attention,'' said Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican
from Sag Harbor, N.Y., who twice introduced legislation asking for
a binding referendum on forming a new county, to no avail. Thiele
believes the threat of secession has prompted politicians to favor
his constituents on issues like farmland preservation and
real-estate transfer taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, State Representative Henry Joy, a Republican who
introduced the secession study bill, said forest and land
regulations were restricting economic growth in northern Maine. He
said the bill generated ``hearings around the state to discuss the
feasibility of economic development in rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It also convinced Joy to run for governor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Collin Peterson, the Democrat who introduced the
constitutional amendment in Minnesota, said the 100 residents of
the Northwest Angle didn't really want to leave the country _ only
to solve their problems with Ontario over regulation of the Lake of
the Woods, which dips into Minnesota. He acknowledged that
secession publicity got him a meeting with Canadian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the Northwest Angle decided the only way to get
something resolved was to create an international incident,''
Peterson said. ``Initially, their idea was to blockade a train.''

MORALES BLOWS SMOKE ON CHILD HEALTH FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales, champion of sound
bites and hyperbole, has polished his art on several occasions
during the prolonged dispute over legal fees in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   But he outdid even himself last week when he asked a federal
judge to slap $25 million in ``bad faith'' penalties on Gov. George
W. Bush and seven legislators who have been fighting to lower the
$2.3 billion awarded outside lawyers for representing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, on one side, and the governor and lawmakers on the
other, have different opinions of how _ or whether _ the dispute
over lawyers' fees will affect Texas' deal to collect $15.3 billion
from cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who is right, and I don't think any of the
principals in the debate can be sure either until the dispute is
ended, either by the courts or a negotiated agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Morales has persisted in misrepresenting one important
point, and that is that if the controversy were resolved today,
tobacco dollars would start flowing immediately to health-care
programs for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are thousands of children across this state
who could have received much-needed medical care had this frivolous
action not been pursued by the challengers,'' he said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has made similar statements several times in recent
months, but they are not true, thanks to an agreement Morales
himself negotiated with key legislators a few weeks after the
tobacco settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, not the attorney general or anyone else, will
decide how the tobacco funds are spent.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the first tobacco payments were to be transferred
from the escrow account, where they have been held during the legal
fees dispute, into the state treasury tomorrow, they would remain
unspent until lawmakers appropriate them _ sometime after they
convene in January.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is now trying to negotiate an additional $2 billion from
tobacco companies to allow Texas to match, proportionately, a
tobacco agreement more recently hammered out by Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco settlement Morales struck early this year calls
for cigarette makers to pay Texas $15.3 billion over the next 25
years. At the outset, Morales agreed that the Legislature would
decide how to spend the payments received after the first year, but
initially the attorney general tried to specify how the $1.2
billion due the state the first year would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Morales picked a good cause _ health care, which has been
traditionally underfunded in Texas. He announced the cigarette
makers' first-year payments would be spent on a health insurance
program for children, an anti-smoking campaign at the Texas
Department of Health, programs at several medical schools and a new
private foundation specializing in children's health care.
</P>
<P>
   But after state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, and state
Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, the Legislature's chief budget
writers, went to court complaining that the attorney general was
trying to usurp the Legislature's budget-setting authority, Morales
gave in and cut a deal with the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Morales signed a written agreement to let the Legislature,
during its 1999 session, determine how the first-year tobacco
payments are spent.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff and Junell promised, in return, to do their best to
convince lawmakers to fund most of Morales' priorities. They nixed
the private foundation but agreed to sponsor an effort to spend all
the money on health care.
</P>
<P>
   The two key lawmakers _ who weren't in the group targeted by
Morales for sanctions last week _ agreed to give special attention
to a new Children's Health Insurance Program, a top Morales
priority. This new federal program was created after the last
session of the Legislature ended last spring and wasn't funded by
lawmakers in the current state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Several million dollars have been found elsewhere in the budget
to begin funding the program, although nowhere near the level
envisioned by Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' agreement with Ratliff and Junell provides that tobacco
funds eventually will be used to pay back any money transferred
into the health insurance program from the existing state budget.
The agreement doesn't allow tobacco dollars to be spent on the
program before the full Legislature approves the expenditure,
Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no way that (tobacco) money could be used prior to being
appropriated by the Legislature,'' the senator added.
</P>
<P>
   There also are policy considerations involved in establishing
the new children's insurance program that should be resolved by the
full Legislature anyway, Ratliff believes, reflecting, perhaps, a
philosophical difference with Morales that goes beyond tobacco
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers won't convene for another seven months. Let us hope
the dispute over the lawyers' fees and a controversy over sharing
tobacco payments with counties _ which also is holding up the
settlement _ are resolved well before then.

LES BUBBAS KNOW ABOUT GOOD CAJUN TASTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dining parlors beckon by the dozens along Interstate 10. Beside
other roadways, too, in southwest Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun Kitchen. Cajun Haven. Cajun Grill. Cajun Tales. Cajun
Connection. Cajun Way. Cajun King. Some satisfy the taste buds;
others are merely passable. A few don't even bother to pretend
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none prepares fall-apart-tender beef in a ``Cajun
microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   And none smokes succulent pork in a ``Cajun spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Les Bubbas claim those distinctions, as I gleefully
discovered at a ``duck camp feast'' in Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   Les Bubbas, an ever-expanding assemblage of Acadian-heritage
part-time chefs, are self-appointed informal ambassadors of a proud
culture. Especially its hospitality. And its food.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearances are seldom scheduled. But throw a party, and
they are quick to volunteer. In Lafayette. Or Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ever ask in return is all the beer we can drink, or
maybe a little red wine _ you know, to get the imagination
flowing,'' says Ray Guidry, described by his associates as ``the
head bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started about 20 years ago with one pot and a lot of
different ideas about ingredients,'' Guidry says. ``We cooked
around the campfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun intensified during hunting trips _ thus the ``duck
camp'' label _ with each man trying to outdo the others by
implementing new techniques and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had a few of us at the start; now there must be 100 or
more,'' Guidry says. ``There are so many that we can't remember
names. That's why we just call each other Bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   All have full-time jobs. But, says Guidry, ``We love people; the
closer we are to people and the more enjoyment we can bring them,
the happier we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Bubbas decry the misinterpretation they see applied to
authentic Cajun cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go into some of these restaurants that call themselves
Cajun, and the first thing we see is a big bottle of Tabasco on the
table,'' Guidry says. ``Nothing against Tabasco _ it's a fine
product _ but that's not what real Cajun food is all about. It's
not about cayenne pepper, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Castille, a Lafayette city councilman who joined Les
Bubbas several years back, elaborates: ``If the first thing you
taste is pepper, it's not Cajun. If you're eating potatoes, you
should taste potatoes. Same with pork or duck. We use seasoning to
enhance the flavoring, not to spoil it.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Bubbas discover fascinating ways to maximize those flavors,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Guidry helped pioneer the ``Cajun microwave,'' so named because
it's a not-so-instant and not-so-new outdoor cooking mechanism that
at first impression could be mistaken for an enormous steel box.
</P>
<P>
   The meat goes on a rack near the bottom; charcoal is placed on
another rack toward the top. ``Or we use wood if we don't have any
charcoal,'' says Robert Domingue, Guidry's colleague. ``We build
the heat from the top. The walls (side and bottom) have up to 3
inches of insulation. It has a cover. We can smoke a 25-pound roast
in our `microwave.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has his special technique, too. You might take a
knife and put a slit in the roast, then stuff it with a little
onion or garlic or salt and pepper. Or you might prefer a little
sage. Anything you like.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``spaceship'' is an L-shaped smoker that all but defies
description. ``I can guarantee that there's nothing else in the
world quite like it, because I spent a lot of years experimenting
to get it right,'' says Paul Benton, the inventor.
</P>
<P>
   The heat source is in the lower (horizontal) part of the L, and
the meat is hung in the vertical part so that smoke circulates and
surrounds it. Benton hangs up to three kinds of meat at one time,
with the fattiest at the top so the flavoring drips onto the
others. His secret ingredient? ``I brush the meat over and over
with 7-Up and honey,'' Benton confides.
</P>
<P>
   Les Bubbas have traveled all over the South preparing delectable
meats, smothered potatoes, crawfish touffe, maque choux and
whatever else the imagination dictates. Last year, they were
invited to a Duck Festival near Montreal. ``We cooked duck gumbo
and duck jambalaya _ hundreds and hundreds of pounds of duck,''
says Carrol Credeur.
</P>
<P>
   Always at their side are Les Bubbettes, otherwise known as the
wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bubbettes have an important role,'' Guidry insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we get to cut the onions,'' says Peggy Benoit.
</P>
<P>
   She jests. These volunteer men and women work closely together,
both in food preparation and in spreading fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first question, when I became part of the group, was, `Who
gives the orders?''' Castille says. ``And they said, `No one does.
If you see something that needs doing, do it.' Everybody washes.
Everybody cleans. Everybody cuts. Everybody hauls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the kind of lifestyle we've always known. We grew
up poor people. We had to hustle for everything. We grew our own
corn, our own potatoes. We didn't have money to spend in those
specialty stores. We learned to appreciate fresh ingredients and
quality. And we learned to cook. We learned that to feed a lot of
people, you could stretch a gumbo for hours and hours with rice and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we enjoy meeting people now and doing something for
them.''
</P>

IN MIDDLE-AGED CIRCLES, VIAGRA INSPIRES HOPE, JOKES _ AND A BLACK
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For weeks, my friends and I have been
talking about it, usually in hushed tones around back tables in
restaurants. We don't want others to overhear us pondering the
possibilities of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we need it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly
accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore
youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination
and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age,''
says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington. ``But now I hear about
Viagra, and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four-year-old John ``Zonk'' Lanzillo of Richardson also
ponders whether Viagra might be in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it now, but I'm wondering if I might not need it
next year,'' he says. ``What the heck does it really do, and
where'd it come from in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's genesis at Pfizer Labs is humorous, really.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally tested as a medication for high blood
pressure, with little success. But it had a pleasant side effect,
which left the men in the initial test run begging to keep their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that 52 percent of men between 40 and 70
have some problem with ED, which is short for erectile
dysfunction,'' explains a Pfizer sales representative who asked not
to be identified. ``Viagra stimulates blood flow, which allows a
stronger erection. Obviously there is great public interest in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth internist Dr. Kelly Goss first heard about Viagra
three months ago, when a urologist friend called him with a tip.
``(He) said to buy Pfizer stock, because Viagra was going to be a
home run,'' Goss says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hears about little else. Goss and many other Tarrant
County practitioners are inundated with visits from middle-aged
male patients they haven't heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about everything else, and then they finally say,
`Oh, by the way ...''' Goss says. ``They think that if they get
Viagra, they're going to feel like they're 16 again.'' But rumors
about Viagra's capabilities, Goss says, are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give you erections automatically,'' he says. ```If
you get aroused, it helps you keep an erection. But if you have
other problems, psychological problems, it's not going to help with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra mythology is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that if you don't have any problem, if you don't need
Viagra but take it anyway, that you stay ready to go for hours and
hours,'' muses 51-year-old Bill Clarkson of Fort Worth. ``Man,
think about it. Wouldn't that be great?''
</P>
<P>
   And if that ``ready to go'' state extended into the next day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Clarkson says, ``Can you think of a better reason to
call the boss and say you can't come in to work?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Goss notes, priapism is not one of Viagra's potential
side effects. For some users, headaches are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cause a real turnaround,'' Goss says. ``Things will
change from the wife saying, `Not tonight, honey, I've got a
headache,' to the man saying, `Honey, I've got my headache, so
let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billings is more concerned with the fact that the pill doesn't
work instant magic. ``They say you're supposed to take it an hour
ahead of time. I mean, if it's late at night, I'm not sure I can
stay awake a whole hour. Don't they have one that works after five
minutes? And that hour between taking it and using it? Doesn't that
assume your wife is going to stay in the mood that long? What if
you have an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Various newswires have reported Viagra black markets springing
up worldwide. In Tokyo, the football-shaped tablets are said to
bring $40 a pop. Americans seem willing to pay $20 for pills that
cost $8-$10 apiece if prescribed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'd pay $20,'' Clarkson concedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer sales representative reports that he and his
colleagues are regularly approached when they make sales calls on
Tarrant County doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer ``gave us these satchels with `VIAGRA' printed on the
side,'' he says. ``We've had to start carrying them with the other
side of the satchel facing out. Men see that word, `Viagra,' and
they just want to have some.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fort Worth urologist heard that Viagra salesmen have even
faced impromptu muggings. Goss reports that Pfizer reps insist on
dropping Viagra samples directly on the doctor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rumored Tarrant County black market. There are
whispers that in certain men's rooms in the hospital district, 50-
and 100-milligram pills can be had by asking the right gentlemen
loitering near the urinals. But a quick check found no one
``holding'' in a hospital toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inspiration struck. If dealers exist, what could be more
prime territory than the Colonial golf tournament for large groups
of middle-aged men with readily disposable income?
</P>
<P>
   Stationing myself by the Porta Potties behind various greens, I
sidled up to selected gentlemen in the 40-to-70 age group and
hissed, ``Hey, anybody around here got any Viagra?''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they all said they had no idea. To a man, they all
asked me to tell them if I did find somebody with a tablet or two
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Goss says he hasn't yet heard from irate wives. But he expects
he will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be married women who've gotten very
comfortable with limited sex lives,'' he says. ``So if I give
Viagra to their husbands, all of a sudden their routines could be
radically changed, and they might not be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer salesman believes most wives would be pleased that
his company's product made its way into their husbands'
bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, think about it for people who've been married a long
time, like for 25 years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzillo feels inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did take one, I wouldn't tell my wife,'' he says,
chuckling. ``I'd want it to be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get Viagra in Tarrant County through the
obvious legal means. Doctors are free to prescribe it. But that
doesn't mean they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from patients,'' says Dr. Bill Vance, a Fort
Worth cardiologist. ``In many cases they're on medication, and they
want to know if they can take Viagra, too. Well, you can't take
Viagra if you're on nitro(glycerin). Frequently, heart patients on
nitroglycerin need to take their nitro after vigorous physical
exercise _ one of those classic events is intercourse. But if
they've taken Viagra beforehand, then afterward if they have chest
pain, they can't take their nitroglycerin.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vance says, there already are medical jokes about
other poor chemical mixes with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one,'' he offers. ``The joke is, you can't take Viagra
if you take iron supplements because of the tremendous danger that,
when aroused, you'll immediately turn to the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss says that a lot more patients ask for Viagra than really
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, for men a certain age, just having it around offers
some security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Viagra has come along at just the right moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Clarkson says. ``Frank Sinatra just died.
Mickey Mantle is dead. When our heroes die, middle-age men are
reminded they're going to die, too. Viagra's a way of holding back
the clock a little.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I score Viagra. One doctor gives me a five-pill
sample box and a prescription for five tablets. Another doctor
gives me two boxes of samples, and a casual acquaintance who works
near the hospital district passed along a much-handled, grubby blue
tablet. He says it was one of three a male nurse sold him a few
days earlier for the negotiated price of $12 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this my birthday and Christmas present to you for the
next 10 years,'' he says, and I stash my Viagra in a dresser
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a friend of mine said when I asked him why he decided
to buy a handgun and keep it in his bedroom closet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to ever need it, but it gives me such a warm
feeling to know it's right there if I do.''

UNDATED: talk about himself.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that
people now don't expect any details, juicy or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Strait is a total mystery. We know he grew up
in Pearsall; his parents separated when George was young; and he
and his older brother, Buddy, were raised by his father, John, a
math teacher and part-time rancher.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in
San Marcos, enlisted in the Army in 1971, and was in for three
years, stationed in Hawaii. That is where he began singing in a
band; when he returned to San Marcos (he graduated with a degree in
agriculture), he began playing bars, gradually becoming more and
more popular.
</P>
<P>
   And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981; his
first single for the label, ``Unwound,'' charted in early May, just
before he turned 29. His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released
that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs
such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look
So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 25, 1986, his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was
killed in a car accident near San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Strait's career has continued to prosper despite changing times;
he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the
Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four
times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and
hosts the George Strait Team Roping Classic each June in
Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was The Dog Incident: In 1996 his
Australian heeler, Buster, disappeared from his South Texas ranch.
Strait offered a reward, and half the state, it seems, went looking
for the dog. Buster was never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you about George's status in Texas,'' says West.
``You can't imagine the phone calls, the number of people thinking
they had found him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wheat, sound archivist for the Center for American History
at the University of Texas at Austin, says Strait ``appeals to
people who want at least a modicum of authenticity. People still
revere western culture, and authenticity is hard to find in country
music. He isn't trying to fit his music into pop music trends.
Country has folk music roots _ it's concerned with people's daily
lives _ and George is still in that camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sell himself as competing with rock bands. He knows
about ranching, and he doesn't get away from it and go live in Los
Angeles or Nashville. He's a quiet, strong, self-effacing
character. He holds himself back, and people appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda O'Brian, music director and assistant program director at
Dallas-Fort Worth radio station KSCS/96.3 FM, says Strait appeals
because he ``just seems so normal. Everything he does is done with
this quiet strength _ you don't think of him as having issues, so
people don't ask about him. They just want to meet him. Everybody
wants to meet him. He just has this really incredible sense of
self; the songs aren't by him, because he's not a songwriter, but
they sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   And thats, says old pal Clay Blaker, is the way Strait has
always been. The two met in 1976, when they were both playing bars
on the Austin/San Antonio/Houston circuit. Blaker's band did
``around 100'' shows with Strait's, and then Strait invited him
along as an opener in the '80s. Also, Strait has cut eight Blaker
songs, including ``She Lays It All on the Line'' on the ``Pure
Country'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm around him, he's the same old George to me,''
says Blaker. ``He's very nice and polite and shy. He's always
pretty much kept to himself, but he's very friendly to his friends.
And he has a lot of the same friends he had before he got a record
deal; that'll tell you something right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason he's still at the top of his game can be
attributed to you don't see him in magazines all the time or on TV
all the time; there's still a mystique about him that's a result of
the way he is. In today's market, there's so many people that are
so overexposed; you're a star for 15 minutes, and then you're gone.
He's a competitor, he takes his career real seriously, and he wants
to go out there and prove he can still cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, he still can. The question now is, how long
will Strait's career continue? Given what he's chosen to do and
chosen not to do, one can easily see him making one final, grand
gesture, one final release and series of concerts, and then
gracefully riding off into the sunset. It might be a lame metaphor
for many other singers, but not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an acknowledgement that this won't go on forever,''
says West. ``Eventually George will decide. It won't be decided for
him. He's the master of his universe; he controls his own fate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's very possible that, even at the very end, Strait will
be what he's always been: the lone figure on the plain, silent but
for the songs he sings, not feeling the need to talk to anyone
about his private life or career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine,'' says West
with a chuckle. ``He loves cigars, and he wants to do an interview.
I don't know if they'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people
on the cover _ but we're testing the waters. They haven't asked.''

SPIDER MITES CAN BE A HUGE PROBLEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I bought four roses in February _ two antique roses and two
miniatures _ all of which I grow in containers. All are blooming
off and on, but powdery mildew and spider mites are decimating the
leaves and flowers. I've put fungicides and insecticides on these
plants, and nothing fazes these pests. Leaves that escaped these
pests are turning yellow. I fertilize regularly with rose food. I
water at 6 p.m. as I don't have time to water before work, but take
care not to wet the foliage.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks to the mild winter and this long stretch of hot, dry
weather, spider mites are a huge problem. These pests are not
insects but members of the spider family. Since you only have four
containerized plants, wage war with the water hose. This tactic
will require diligence, but I think you can put a dent in the life
cycles of these pests with persistence. Fight the mites with a
high-pressure spray from the water hose. Hit the undersides of the
leaves at least every other day.
</P>
<P>
   You also could dust the leaves with sulfur to help control the
mites. Damaged leaves will not green up. You'll have to wait until
new ones grow for a healthier look.
</P>
<P>
   Insecticides are not always an effective means of control of
spider mites. Do the products you've used target them? Look for a
miticide. Avid, a product used by many rosarians, is expensive, but
only a small amount is used per gallon of water. You could possibly
share the expense with another rose gardener. Others report success
fighting mites with products that contain neem.
</P>
<P>
   Although leaves that have diseases such as black spot will
eventually yellow and drop, yellow leaves are not always caused by
disease or insects. Foliage that has served its purpose will yellow
and drop. Too much or too little water will cause leaves to yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that does not thrive with
moisture, and a good washing weekly can help control the disease.
You could even cut off the affected tips. This disease blemishes
plants, but does not kill them. Powdery mildew, too, usually
becomes less of a problem as summer wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Antique roses will get the same disease as modern roses but are
usually so vigorous they drop diseased foliage and continue to
grow. Although `Martha Gonzales' is said to be one of the more
disease-tolerant varieties, no rose is totally resistant. And, of
course, gardeners' experiences differ.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine, good air circulation and healthy soil are the
first steps toward good resistance. Container-grown roses need a
nutrient-holding soil mixture. Organic matter is beneficial, and
fish emulsion is helpful in boosting soil health. Keep your
containers (or gardens) free of fallen diseased leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners discourage blackspot and mildews by spraying a
fungicide every seven to 10 days. While I tend to shy away from
printing product names, the following have gotten good reviews from
various gardeners. Funginex is popular. Safer's manufactures a
sulfur-based fungicide that helps control powdery mildew and
blackspot. Rose Defense, which contains neem oil, fights mites as
well as powdery mildew.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish to go organic, spray plants with a baking soda/water
mixture at a rate of 1 to 2 tablespoons per gallon of water. Apply
with a hose-end sprayer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My ripening tomatoes have white spots. What causes these?
Some have had blossom end rot, too. What can I do to prevent this?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your tomatoes have white or yellow spots or patches just
beneath the skin, they may have a condition called cloudy spot. If
you peel the fruit and find white corky tissue beneath the
chlorotic surface blemishes, you have cloudy spot, which is
actually stink bug damage.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the tomato garden weed-free, as stink bugs hide in weeds.
Pesticides that target stink bugs include pyrethrin and sabadilla.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscald causes white, papery spots on the side of the tomato
that faces the sun. The fruit often has yellow-orange blotches near
the stem end. These areas do not ripen. To avoid this problem, keep
plants as healthy as possible to avoid diseases that trigger leaf
loss. You want plenty of foliage to shade the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Blossom end rot is a physiological disorder caused by a calcium
deficiency and aggravated by water stress. The blossom end of the
tomato develops a sunken, dark brown or black lesion. To avoid,
water carefully and mulch. You can apply a liquid fertilizer that
contains calcium nitrate. Add lime or calcium to your soil mix
before planting your tomatoes next season.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Keep the soil evenly moist to discourage blossom drop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a television cable box in my garden that serves myself
as well as many of my neighbors. It is about 3.5 feet tall by 18
inches. I would like to camouflage it but must ensure the cable
company technicians can access it when necessary. I think a potted
fern in front of the box would be nice. I already have some
decorative rocks in my garden, and I would like to plant the fern
in a container that looks like a natural rock. Do you know if
anyone makes a pot that is shaped like and has the color of natural
rock and also is several inches deep?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are accent boulder planters on the market. These are
lightweight volcanic boulders in irregular shapes. If you can't
find such a product locally, Gardener's Supply, 128 Intervale Road,
Burlington, Vt., 05401 carries them.
</P>
<P>
   A simulated stone trough may also serve the purpose. These are
occasionally available at local garden shops. They are also
available through the catalog of the Kinsman Co., River Road, P.O.
Box 357, Point Pleasant, Pa., 18950-0357. I think this type of
container would blend nicely with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider growing a short climber in a large,
attractive, terra-cotta container with a rose pillar (black steel
trellis) or bamboo trellis. These are available at some local
garden centers and also through Kinsman.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could group attractive terra-cotta containers in front of
the box. A short screen of pickets or bamboo would dress up the
area. You could use potted plants in front of the screen or not.
</P>
<P>

Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, Garden Editor, Houston
Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents individual replies to all unpublished letters.

UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN'T GONE HOLLYWOOD, BUT STILL THE KING OF
COUNTRY MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of
Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for
George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a
thin folder with a small batch of articles.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, she said. What year is this?
</P>
<P>
   No, she was told, that's it: total. All the press on the man who
then, as now, was one of the most popular singers in country music.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most
popular boxed sets of all time. Strait is selling out football
stadiums nationwide, averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing
any press or TV _ The New York Times, David Letterman, Jay Leno and
even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been
firmly, but politely, told no.
</P>
<P>
   And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West,
Strait's longtime publicist. ``Garth generates 2 inches of press in
15 seconds. George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as
the media goes. He doesn't do anything. And he doesn't make
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the dichotomy of Strait's career. At 46, the Pearsall,
Texas, native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone
cowboy. His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help
him fill the largest venues in America, but he can still slip out
of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas
rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts stay firmly starched. The little half-smile stays
put. The gaze stays steady. The hat stays on. The music stays pure
honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing. The
deep, water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up
as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This
year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy
Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including
Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Strait, West says, stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and
Sundays only so he can fly home (he has a home in San Antonio and a
ranch somewhere in South Texas) on his private plane for several
days each week.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on
Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and
spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than
25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even
as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top
Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth
Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year
_ but Strait, amazingly, has sold as well in the '90s as in the
'80s, when he burst into prominence. The soundtrack to the 1992
movie ``Pure Country'' sold 5 million copies. Since that year,
Strait has been the 10th-most-popular musical act of any genre.
</P>
<P>
   This appears more phenomenal considering Strait's low media
profile. After years as a bar musician (he was discovered in 1981
while based in San Marcos) and spending the '80s playing hundreds
of dates per year as his national popularity grew, Strait long ago
found his own balance between personal and professional.
</P>
<P>
   He will not tour till he drops, and several years ago ended his
annual New Year's Eve show at Dallas' Reunion Arena to spend the
night at home with his family. He will not curry favor with
Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock
stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just
a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD. He will
sell as well as he does playing by his rules, and that will be
that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country''
(in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!),
he was deluged with movie offers: a sequel, other roles, big money.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned them all down, she says, because he simply didn't
want to make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did `Pure Country' because he got a script he liked, he
could do it in Texas, and he had some time off,'' she says. ``It
was relatively painless. But it wasn't because he wanted to give
his career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked about this casually. His life's been consistent
and steady, and he really values that. How much longer is Bubba
going to be at home? He doesn't want to be on the road when his
son's growing up, and when he's ready to stay home, his son is out
of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait
for more than a decade; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait
you see in his simple videos is the genuine article. When not
onstage, she says, he's so unwilling to call attention to himself
that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in
one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first
saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in
1982. ``It's sincere. He's almost embarrassed when people ask for
his autograph. Obviously, he still loves the response _ but he
doesn't like to talk about himself.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that
people now don't expect any details, juicy or otherwise.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine,'' says West
with a chuckle. ``He loves cigars, and he wants to do an interview.
I don't know if they'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people
on the cover _ but we're testing the waters. They haven't asked.''

UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN'T GONE HOLLYWOOD, BUT STILL THE KING OF
COUNTRY MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of
Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for
George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a
thin folder with a small batch of articles.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, she said. What year is this?
</P>
<P>
   No, she was told, that's it: total. All the press on the man who
then, as now, was one of the most popular singers in country music.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most
popular boxed sets of all time. Strait is selling out football
stadiums nationwide, averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing
any press or TV _ The New York Times, David Letterman, Jay Leno and
even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been
firmly, but politely, told no.
</P>
<P>
   And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West,
Strait's longtime publicist. ``Garth generates 2 inches of press in
15 seconds. George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as
the media goes. He doesn't do anything. And he doesn't make
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the dichotomy of Strait's career. At 46, the Pearsall,
Texas, native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone
cowboy. His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help
him fill the largest venues in America, but he can still slip out
of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas
rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts stay firmly starched. The little half-smile stays
put. The gaze stays steady. The hat stays on. The music stays pure
honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing. The
deep, water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up
as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This
year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy
Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including
Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Strait, West says, stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and
Sundays only so he can fly home (he has a home in San Antonio and a
ranch somewhere in South Texas) on his private plane for several
days each week.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on
Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and
spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than
25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even
as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top
Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth
Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year
_ but Strait, amazingly, has sold as well in the '90s as in the
'80s, when he burst into prominence. The soundtrack to the 1992
movie ``Pure Country'' sold 5 million copies. Since that year,
Strait has been the 10th-most-popular musical act of any genre.
</P>
<P>
   This appears more phenomenal considering Strait's low media
profile. After years as a bar musician (he was discovered in 1981
while based in San Marcos) and spending the '80s playing hundreds
of dates per year as his national popularity grew, Strait long ago
found his own balance between personal and professional.
</P>
<P>
   He will not tour till he drops, and several years ago ended his
annual New Year's Eve show at Dallas' Reunion Arena to spend the
night at home with his family. He will not curry favor with
Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock
stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just
a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD. He will
sell as well as he does playing by his rules, and that will be
that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country''
(in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!),
he was deluged with movie offers: a sequel, other roles, big money.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned them all down, she says, because he simply didn't
want to make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did `Pure Country' because he got a script he liked, he
could do it in Texas, and he had some time off,'' she says. ``It
was relatively painless. But it wasn't because he wanted to give
his career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked about this casually. His life's been consistent
and steady, and he really values that. How much longer is Bubba
going to be at home? He doesn't want to be on the road when his
son's growing up, and when he's ready to stay home, his son is out
of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait
for more than a decade; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait
you see in his simple videos is the genuine article. When not
onstage, she says, he's so unwilling to call attention to himself
that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in
one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first
saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in
1982. ``It's sincere. He's almost embarrassed when people ask for
his autograph. Obviously, he still loves the response _ but he
doesn't like to talk about himself.''

IN MIDDLE-AGED CIRCLES, VIAGRA INSPIRES HOPE, JOKES _ AND A BLACK
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For weeks, my friends and I have been
talking about it, usually in hushed tones around back tables in
restaurants. We don't want others to overhear us pondering the
possibilities of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we need it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly
accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore
youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination
and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age,''
says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington. ``But now I hear about
Viagra, and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four-year-old John ``Zonk'' Lanzillo of Richardson also
ponders whether Viagra might be in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it now, but I'm wondering if I might not need it
next year,'' he says. ``What the heck does it really do, and
where'd it come from in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's genesis at Pfizer Labs is humorous, really.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally tested as a medication for high blood
pressure, with little success. But it had a pleasant side effect,
which left the men in the initial test run begging to keep their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that 52 percent of men between 40 and 70
have some problem with ED, which is short for erectile
dysfunction,'' explains a Pfizer sales representative who asked not
to be identified. ``Viagra stimulates blood flow, which allows a
stronger erection. Obviously there is great public interest in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth internist Dr. Kelly Goss first heard about Viagra
three months ago, when a urologist friend called him with a tip.
``(He) said to buy Pfizer stock, because Viagra was going to be a
home run,'' Goss says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hears about little else. Goss and many other Tarrant
County practitioners are inundated with visits from middle-aged
male patients they haven't heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about everything else, and then they finally say,
`Oh, by the way ...''' Goss says. ``They think that if they get
Viagra, they're going to feel like they're 16 again.'' But rumors
about Viagra's capabilities, Goss says, are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give you erections automatically,'' he says. ```If
you get aroused, it helps you keep an erection. But if you have
other problems, psychological problems, it's not going to help with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra mythology is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that if you don't have any problem, if you don't need
Viagra but take it anyway, that you stay ready to go for hours and
hours,'' muses 51-year-old Bill Clarkson of Fort Worth. ``Man,
think about it. Wouldn't that be great?''
</P>
<P>
   And if that ``ready to go'' state extended into the next day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Clarkson says, ``Can you think of a better reason to
call the boss and say you can't come in to work?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Goss notes, priapism is not one of Viagra's potential
side effects. For some users, headaches are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cause a real turnaround,'' Goss says. ``Things will
change from the wife saying, `Not tonight, honey, I've got a
headache,' to the man saying, `Honey, I've got my headache, so
let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billings is more concerned with the fact that the pill doesn't
work instant magic. ``They say you're supposed to take it an hour
ahead of time. I mean, if it's late at night, I'm not sure I can
stay awake a whole hour. Don't they have one that works after five
minutes? And that hour between taking it and using it? Doesn't that
assume your wife is going to stay in the mood that long? What if
you have an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Various newswires have reported Viagra black markets springing
up worldwide. In Tokyo, the football-shaped tablets are said to
bring $40 a pop. Americans seem willing to pay $20 for pills that
cost $8-$10 apiece if prescribed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'd pay $20,'' Clarkson concedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer sales representative reports that he and his
colleagues are regularly approached when they make sales calls on
Tarrant County doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer ``gave us these satchels with `VIAGRA' printed on the
side,'' he says. ``We've had to start carrying them with the other
side of the satchel facing out. Men see that word, `Viagra,' and
they just want to have some.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fort Worth urologist heard that Viagra salesmen have even
faced impromptu muggings. Goss reports that Pfizer reps insist on
dropping Viagra samples directly on the doctor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rumored Tarrant County black market. There are
whispers that in certain men's rooms in the hospital district, 50-
and 100-milligram pills can be had by asking the right gentlemen
loitering near the urinals. But a quick check found no one
``holding'' in a hospital toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inspiration struck. If dealers exist, what could be more
prime territory than the Colonial golf tournament for large groups
of middle-aged men with readily disposable income?
</P>
<P>
   Stationing myself by the Porta Potties behind various greens, I
sidled up to selected gentlemen in the 40-to-70 age group and
hissed, ``Hey, anybody around here got any Viagra?''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they all said they had no idea. To a man, they all
asked me to tell them if I did find somebody with a tablet or two
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Goss says he hasn't yet heard from irate wives. But he expects
he will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be married women who've gotten very
comfortable with limited sex lives,'' he says. ``So if I give
Viagra to their husbands, all of a sudden their routines could be
radically changed, and they might not be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer salesman believes most wives would be pleased that
his company's product made its way into their husbands'
bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, think about it for people who've been married a long
time, like for 25 years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzillo feels inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did take one, I wouldn't tell my wife,'' he says,
chuckling. ``I'd want it to be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get Viagra in Tarrant County through the
obvious legal means. Doctors are free to prescribe it. But that
doesn't mean they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from patients,'' says Dr. Bill Vance, a Fort
Worth cardiologist. ``In many cases they're on medication, and they
want to know if they can take Viagra, too. Well, you can't take
Viagra if you're on nitro(glycerin). Frequently, heart patients on
nitroglycerin need to take their nitro after vigorous physical
exercise _ one of those classic events is intercourse. But if
they've taken Viagra beforehand, then afterward if they have chest
pain, they can't take their nitroglycerin.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vance says, there already are medical jokes about
other poor chemical mixes with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one,'' he offers. ``The joke is, you can't take Viagra
if you take iron supplements because of the tremendous danger that,
when aroused, you'll immediately turn to the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss says that a lot more patients ask for Viagra than really
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, for men a certain age, just having it around offers
some security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Viagra has come along at just the right moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Clarkson says. ``Frank Sinatra just died.
Mickey Mantle is dead. When our heroes die, middle-age men are
reminded they're going to die, too. Viagra's a way of holding back
the clock a little.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I score Viagra. One doctor gives me a five-pill
sample box and a prescription for five tablets. Another doctor
gives me two boxes of samples, and a casual acquaintance who works
near the hospital district passed along a much-handled, grubby blue
tablet. He says it was one of three a male nurse sold him a few
days earlier for the negotiated price of $12 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this my birthday and Christmas present to you for the
next 10 years,'' he says, and I stash my Viagra in a dresser
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a friend of mine said when I asked him why he decided
to buy a handgun and keep it in his bedroom closet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to ever need it, but it gives me such a warm
feeling to know it's right there if I do.''

REEVE TELLS OF ORDEAL WITH CANDOR, HUMOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the months after Christopher Reeve suffered a riding accident
that paralyzed him from the neck down, he sought escape in sleep.
In his dreams he would be whole again and able to resume his active
life.
</P>
<P>
   Then he would wake up in his hospital room, stare at a screen
that monitored his vital signs and wonder why he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   With the love of his wife, friends and family, his attitude
gradually changed. He stopped wondering, ``What life do I have?''
and began to consider, ``What life can I build?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Me'' (Random House, $25), Reeve writes movingly about
his accident, which occurred three years ago, and its aftermath. It
is an optimistic yet realistic account that avoids the cloying,
everyone-lives-happily-ever-after quality of such stories.
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Reeve writes, he was someone who enjoyed
being in control. However, his self-contained world was shattered
after his parents divorced when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   He sought solace in acting and began a career that reached its
pinnacle when he was cast as Superman in the 1978 hit movie. He
also appeared as the Man of Steel in three sequels.
</P>
<P>
   Although he continued to work regularly in movies and stage
plays, his career had stalled by the mid-1990s. But his personal
life was fulfilling _ he was happily married to Dana Morosini and
the father of three children _ and active.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished equestrian, he entered a riding competition in
Virginia on Memorial Day 1995. It was to be his last competition of
the season, as he planned to leave for Ireland five days later to
film a movie.
</P>
<P>
   While on the course, his horse stopped suddenly at a fence and
flipped Reeve to the ground. He landed on his head. While his
helmet prevented brain damage, the impact of the landing broke his
first and second vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve later learned that if he had landed with his head slightly
more to the left, he would have been killed instantly. If he had
landed slightly more to the right, he probably would have sustained
only minor bruises.
</P>
<P>
   His injuries were so serious that, upon being told by doctors he
had a slim chance for survival, his mother begged them to ``pull
the plug'' and withdraw life support.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Reeve was stabilized, he considered ending his life
when doctors first told him his prognosis. He was likely never to
regain any feeling below his shoulder blades and would probably
spend the rest of his life breathing with a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said she would support whatever decision he made. But,
she added, she would be with him for the long haul, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she added the words that saved my life: `You're still
you. And I love you,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the book Reeve details the high points of his life since the
accident, including his electrifying surprise appearance at the
Academy Awards ceremony in 1996 and his stint as director of the
critically acclaimed HBO film ``In the Gloaming.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes movingly about his setbacks. He has been
hospitalized 11 times, has come close to death twice and almost had
to have his left ankle amputated when infection set in.
</P>
<P>
   Putting him to bed takes two hours every night and includes a
humiliating process of eliminating bodily wastes with the help of
an aide. It takes attendants two hours to get him up in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two people have to roll you back and forth in order to
put on your underpants at age 45, it's a difficult lesson in
patience and acceptance,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   He also writes movingly of the pain of not being able to hug his
son and how he becomes angry at times with the turn his life has
taken.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much humor in the book. Reeve writes how, while he
was waiting for surgery a few days after the accident, actor Robin
Williams arrived in the room dressed as a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He announced that he was a proctologist and had to examine me
immediately,'' Reeve writes. ``And for the first time since the
accident I laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is also filled with forgiveness. Reeve writes how he
has become closer to his estranged father since the accident and
even refuses to blame the horse that threw him.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Reeve learned to forgive himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a year I wondered if the injury was purely an
accident or if I was responsible for what happened,'' he writes.
``I learned that endless speculation serves no purpose other than
torment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is such honest and realistic writing that makes Reeve's book
a powerful read. He doesn't shy away from the realities of his life
as a quadriplegic. He doesn't apologize for his ambivalent
feelings. And he doesn't tone down his opinions to make the reader
feel more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve has become an outspoken advocate for people with
spinal-cord injuries. He is chairman of the board of the American
Paralysis Foundation and founded the Christopher Reeve Foundation
to fund promising research into spinal-cord regeneration using
antibodies and nerve growth factors.
</P>
<P>
   He has regained some sensation below the neck, across his
shoulders and down his left arm and leg. He can now turn his head
70 degrees on each side and breathe on his own for up to half an
hour. He recognizes he has a long way to go to regain movement and
feeling in the rest of his body, but he hasn't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve has also become a vigorous critic of insurance companies
that limit treatment to people with spinal-cord injuries. He
acknowledges how fortunate he is to have the resources for
round-the-clock care that are not available to others with similar
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   When doing publicity for the first Superman movie, Reeve defined
a hero as ``someone who commits a courageous action without
considering the consequences.'' Since the accident, his definition
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that he now thinks of a hero as ``an ordinary
individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite
of overwhelming obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Me'' proves that Reeve is a hero under any definition.
By facing his situation with honor, humor and candor, he is more of
a Superman in real life than he ever was in the movies.

TOYOTA'S 1998 LAND CRUISER IS BEST OF THE SUVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best has just gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities getting any
better than it was, but that's what happened when Toyota redesigned
the Land Cruiser for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is the vehicle that has set the standard for
sport-utilities since the previous generation debuted in 1991, even
against such tough and capable competition as the Range Rover and
Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   But for 1998, Toyota has raised the bar to a level that will be
hard for any manufacturer to match, let alone top.
</P>
<P>
   The new Land Cruiser _ which also comes in a Lexus version
called the LX 470 _ now has a 4.7-liter, 32-valve,
double-overhead-cam V-8 engine replacing the previous generation's
inline six.
</P>
<P>
   That engine cranks out 230 horsepower, an increase of 18, and
develops 320 foot-pounds of torque, up 45 from last year. This
all-new engine is based on the V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 sedan,
but it's significantly modified to produce better low-speed torque
for trailer-towing and off-road hill-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds, an
improvement of two seconds over last year's model. That's quite
impressive for a vehicle that weighs 5,225 pounds empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is slightly better than last year, even with the
power increase. EPA ratings are 14 miles per gallon in the city and
16 on the highway, above average for a large sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser is first and foremost a great luxury wagon,
suitable for the most formal of occasions at the country club. But
what makes it so unusual in the sport-utility field is that it's
also a great performer off the beaten path. In fact, it's the
best-performing off-road vehicle on the market, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, with a base price of $46,397 and a tricked-out sticker
of $52,025, it's not likely many owners will put the Land Cruiser
to the test on serious off-road routes such as California's
legendary Rubicon Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these vehicles will answer the call of the wild. A
lot of people buy the Land Cruiser for hunting and other sporting
purposes, and these people appreciate having a vehicle that won't
get stuck in the mud or sand.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't extensively tested the new Land Cruiser off-road yet,
but I have driven the previous generation on some of the wildest
trails in the nation, including those in the Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park in California and the Scott's Gulf Pocket Wilderness
along the Caney Fork River in Tennessee's Cumberland Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And on those excursions, I've used the Land Cruiser to pull a
few Jeeps out of some sticky spots that posed no challenge to the
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   On or off the road, the new Land Cruiser's ride is pure luxury,
much smoother and quieter than before. That's due in part to the
new independent front suspension and the vehicle's structural
rigidity, which has been increased 50 percent over the previous
version.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel drive is a full-time system with high and low
ranges, as before. And with the optional locking rear differential
($410), a must for serious off-roading, this is the most capable
drivetrain available for either on- or off-road driving.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features abound, including automatic climate control,
four-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel antilock brakes that
work even with the transmission in low range, premium
AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo, rear heater, power windows/door
locks/mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, heated outside
mirrors, dual front air bags, keyless entry, power adjustable front
seats and automatic headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space has been increased from last year, giving
passengers more head, leg and shoulder room. Additionally, the
doors and rear hatch are larger for easier entry and loading. And
as before, the Land Cruiser seats up to eight people with the
optional third seat ($1,100).
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our test vehicle included luxurious leather seats
($1,820), power moon roof ($1,155), a roof luggage rack ($449), and
running boards ($595), which I would decline if I were planning to
do much off-roading. Running boards are the first thing to go when
the going gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   Crashworthiness has been increased dramatically over the
previous Land Cruiser, Toyota officials say. The ladder frame now
has nine cross members, instead of six, and the chassis side rails
have collapsible, energy-absorbing ends.
</P>
<P>
   Land Cruisers can pull trailers of up to 6,500 pounds with a
tongue weight of up to 650 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As an aid for extended cruising, the fuel tank holds 25.4
gallons.

ONE CRITIC'S DOGGED PURSUIT OF GEORGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GEORGE STRAIT-ESSAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Strait is elusive. Really elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, George Strait is so elusive, his press agent, Kay West
in Nashville, is essentially an answering machine. Since 1982, I've
left approximately 55 messages for Kay/George in pursuit of
interviews or information and received approximately five return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, nearly two decades of my life have been spent in
journalistic pursuit of this Sinatra of South Texas. To date, the
sum total of my efforts has been one (1) phone interview, in 1984,
and one (1) in-person interview, in 1992. And that's actually a
pretty good record for a Strait newshound; other longtime country
music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done
from George's ranch in South Texas, as he and the Ace in the Hole
Band were literally loading up to go on tour. He told me that, no
offense intended, he didn't much like doing interviews, and he
refused to use his free time to do them. He was tallying that
interview into his road time, he said, as though he'd punched a
time clock.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, I attended the Country Music Association
awards, when George won Male Vocalist honors for the first time. It
was his first major award. How'd he feel? asked the press. Pretty
good, said George.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, when he filmed his movie ``Pure Country'' in and around
Fort Worth, George was legendary. I watched the filming of the
concert sequence at Tarrant County Convention Center Arena, and was
invited by the movie company publicist to do a ``one-on-one'' with
George the following week.
</P>
<P>
   I went to an abandoned dance hall in Midlothian on the appointed
day and watched George walk up a dusty road in the early morning.
Then I watched George film a sequence inside the dance hall and was
surprised at how natural he seemed. The other actors goofed lines
and faced the wrong way, but George didn't. He occasionally made
suggestions and was minded when he did.
</P>
<P>
   I finally got my chance in late afternoon, after waiting around
all day. George went on his tour bus with wife Norma, and I was
invited to join them for 15 minutes, although we talked for more
than 45 minutes undisturbed. The press agent cautioned me not to
bring up personal matters. I promised I wouldn't, and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I found Norma to be outgoing and likeable, and George seemed to
appreciate how I made genuine friends with their dog, a Boston
terrier.
</P>
<P>
   George lounged in his seat, spoke in a languid, low drawl, and
cross-examined me with a flash of his green eyes on several
occasions. He was mildly confrontational if he thought I was
drawing the wrong conclusion. He stuck pretty much to business _
his music, the movie _ though he did touch on rodeoing and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign that there was tension to the interview was
George's constant toying with a piece of rope, tying slipknots.
He'd study the knot intensely for a few moments before answering
sometimes. Then, suddenly, he'd flash that silvery smile, and I'd
feel relief wash over me like the Frio River.
</P>
<P>
   I covered the world premiere of ``Pure Country'' in the fall of
'92, in San Antonio, and was invited to a sumptuous party
afterward. George made the rounds, without an entourage, and
blended in with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't bring myself to be pushy to this quiet, pleasant man
during such a lovely party. His manager eventually introduced us. I
said something really clever, like ``Nice to see you again; I liked
your movie,'' and he said something memorable like ``Well, thanks.
It's good to see you again, too.'' (He did, however, add that
little sideways half-smile, and I noticed that his eyes looked blue
in candlelight.)
</P>
<P>
   So, why don't I, and other spurned journalists, just write
George off and curse him as a prima donna jerk?
</P>
<P>
   Because I honestly believe that he isn't. He's uncomfortable
telling strangers personal details, and I believe he considers it
unseemly. George Strait does nothing for its press value, and in an
age when Naomi Judd jabbers publicly about whether daughter Ashley
wore underwear to a certain awards show, George remains a personal
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, maybe, just maybe, he's saving all his secrets to
divulge to me and me alone someday. Kay might give me a call back
to set it up, any day now.

MOTHER, SPRINTER, WINNER: NAIA STANDOUT A STUDY IN EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most single mothers, Kathy Nelson's life is a race. Rushing
to take the children to school and soccer practice. Zipping off to
do the shopping. You know, the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing 400 meters at the National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics national track championships last weekend
in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she's accomplished has been incredible,'' said Randy
Heath, Nelson's track coach at Oklahoma Christian University. ``I
was skeptical about her at first because I didn't know anything
about her. But once I saw her, I knew. You could tell right away
she was going to be special.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has proved that in three years at Oklahoma Christian, an
NAIA school in Oklahoma City. The Grand Prairie native and former
Nolan High School star qualified for the NAIA championship meet at
100, 200 and 400 meters and has school records in all three events.
She has earned NAIA All-America recognition three times in indoor
competition, including her national runner-up finish in the 400
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nelson, a biology major with a 3.91 grade-point
average, was an NAIA scholar-athlete and won the prestigious A.O.
Duer Award, presented to an NAIA junior student-athlete in who
excels in academics and athletics. She was OCU's outstanding
science student in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing. Nelson, who will turn 30 on June 8, is 10
years older than many of her teammates and track rivals. She's the
single mother of three children _ 11-year-old David, 10-year-old
Daniel and 8-year-old Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets real tough at times,'' Nelson said. ``The hardest part
is finding time to study. I squeeze in study time whenever I can.
I'll study in the car during soccer practice and at halftime of
their games. There are a lot of late nights after they've gone to
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a lot of long days, including classes, workouts
and track meets. Nelson gets help with the children from her
ex-husband, Roy Nelson, who moved to the Oklahoma City area and is
a large part of his sons' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see their dad a lot, and him being here really helps
me,'' Kathy Nelson said. ``That lets me do what I have to do. ... I
just look at it like it's a job. I need this to get where I want to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Where she wants to go is a career as a physical therapist,
something she has dreamed of since she was a newly divorced mother
teaching physical education at Preschool Enrichment in North
Richland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's dream came closer to reality this month when she was
accepted into the University of Oklahoma's highly regarded physical
therapy program for her senior year. But that means that she must
leave OCU and give up track _ according to NCAA rules, she will be
too old to run for the Sooners _ but such an opportunity is why she
decided to go to college in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it, but I do have mixed feelings,'' she
said. ``I'll miss running, and I'll miss Oklahoma Christian. But I
can't turn this offer down.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, such a chance seemed impossible. Nelson knew
she wanted to attend college, but between work and her children,
all she could manage was a few scattered classes at Tarrant County
Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   That changed thanks to her boss, Preschool Enrichment owner Gary
Hill, an OCU graduate and a strength coach for Fort Worth
Christian's athletic program. In that capacity, he had seen young
Kathy Patton star for Nolan in volleyball, basketball and track. He
watched her soar to the 1985 state private school long jump
championship with a leap of 18 feet, one-half inch, still the Texas
Association of Private and Parochial Schools all-class record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was a very good athlete,'' Hill said. ``She had
always wondered if she could compete at that level. I knew she had
the talent to do it when she was younger, and I knew she had the
drive at the time. And she had made it through some very difficult
times with a smile on her face. I didn't know she was going to
compete on such a high national level, but I was sure she'd be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill worked with Nelson on a weight-training program and track
workouts to get her into running shape. When he felt she was ready,
he called his friend Heath and told him to take a look at the
prospect he had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Heath was dubious, but gave her a small athletic scholarship in
addition to her academic scholarship. Hill promised to pick up the
rest of her expenses as long as she stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was an instant success on the track. By her sophomore
year, she was an indoor All-America at 200 and 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Her regret is that she never made All-America outdoors. This
year, Nelson ranked in the top five nationally in the 100 and 200
and eighth in the 400, but a strained Achilles' tendon sustained in
the invitational 200 at the Drake Relays sidelined her much of the
season. Still at less than full speed at the NAIA meet last week in
Tulsa, Nelson wound up seventh in the 400, one place short of
All-America status.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a minor detail. After all, what's important to Nelson
has always been the education, mostly because it will mean a better
life for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met my goals and then some,'' she said. ``Things just
keep falling into place. Sometimes I feel like I'm being carried to
the right place. It's been a blessing.''

FOYT SAYS BOAT'S CAR WAS `SABOTAGED' BEFORE INDY 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Racing legend A.J. Foyt says the engine in
Billy Boat's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning car was ``sabotaged''
the night before the big race while locked inside his garage at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   And Foyt has not ruled out the possibility the tampering might
have been an inside job, involving a team member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody did some sabotage on Billy Boat's car,'' Foyt said
during a teleconference previewing the Pep Boys Indy Racing
League's True Value 500K night race at Texas Motor Speedway on June
6. ``Somebody dropped red Loctite on the last two (fuel injector)
butterflies on the left engine bank. It run down the throttle shaft
and locked the two butterflies solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Loctite is a liquid glue-type substance typically used to secure
gaskets and bolts to metal surfaces. Foyt said the problem was
discovered when his crew attempted to warm up the Oldsmobile Indy
Aurora V-8 in Boat's No. 11 Conseco Dallara before the start of
Sunday's 82nd Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who won the pole at 223.503 mph, said there are eight
injectors at the top of the engine, one for each cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The butterfly controls how much air gets into the engine,''
Boat said from his business, B&AMP;B Fabrication in Phoenix. ``Somebody
put Loctite on the throttle shaft. It just locked it up solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for it to happen by accident. I can't
accuse anybody, but the circumstances of how it happened are just
very suspicious. It can be done in a minute. You only have to do it
in one little spot to lock up the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said the engine had been run at 2 p.m. Saturday, after
which the garage was locked and ``sealed'' at approximately 2:30.
Foyt said Tommy LaMance, team manager of A.J. Foyt Racing and his
nephew, and Craig Baranouski, Boat's chief mechanic, were the first
crewmen to arrive at the garage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew somebody had went through,'' said Foyt, first
four-time winner of the Indy 500. ``I don't know if it was (done)
from the outside or if it was somebody on our crew. I guess there's
a lot of jealous people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he did not officially report the incident to the
sanctioning IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnhart, the IRL's director of racing operations, said
the garages were locked at 5 p.m. Saturday. Barnhart said the
Speedway also provided roving security 24 hours a day during race
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's suspicion among the team,'' said Boat,
who led the race's first 12 laps but finished 23rd because of a
faulty gearbox. ``I'm 100 percent confident that nobody in our
organization would do that. We got a good bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Boat originally was declared the winner of last
year's True Value 500K at TMS. But the victory was overturned and
awarded to Arie Luyendyk the next day after a scoring review by the
U.S. Auto Club.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt will take no chances with the cars of Boat and teammate
Kenny Brack at TMS, where practice and qualifying are scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lock 'em back in the transporters, is what we'll do,''
Foyt said.

COWBOYS' SANDERS UNDERGOES ANKLE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOSIE KARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deion Sanders underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle
yesterday in Miami, the Cowboys announced. Dr. John Uribe removed a
bone spur from the cornerback's ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred over time, Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said.
Sanders underwent a similar operation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery and rehabilitation time will take from four to six
weeks, Maurer said. That means Sanders could miss the beginning
portion of training camp when the team convenes in Wichita Falls in
mid-July. In three seasons with the Cowboys, Sanders has attended
training camp only once, in 1996. When he was originally signed
before the 1995 season the Cowboys were already through with
training camp and last season he played baseball while his
teammates practiced in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The operation could hamper the plans of first-year Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey to include Sanders in the offense. Sanders has not
participated in offensive practices during off-season workouts.

`ALMOST' DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the very first scene of ``Almost Heroes,'' Chris Farley is on
the gallows, telling the crowd what it can do with his fat rump.
Not only is the scene a creepy reminder of his recent death, it's a
reminder of how he lived his life: not caring much what anyone
thought of him, and willing to do anything for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Farley did the most extreme things for a laugh. His
philosophy seemed to be that no matter how lame the line, bellowing
it would make it funny; no matter how weak the sight gag, if Farley
screamed and abused himself enough, maybe you'd at least crack a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Farley does a lot of bellowing and screaming in ``Almost
Heroes,'' but nobody could have saved this script, written by a
trio whose names don't merit looking up. Although a few laughs come
through, this story of a cut-rate Lewis and Clark ultimately
defeats normally dependable talents, including Matthew Perry and
Eugene Levy, with its disjointed gags and aimless story.
</P>
<P>
   But it's director Christopher Guest who suffers the biggest
defeat. Less than a year after his ``Waiting for Guffman'' made
some of 1997's 10-best lists, he's delivered a movie that's a good
bet for 1998's 10-worst lists. Maybe Guest needs to write his own
material when he directs; whatever the case, he winds up with a
movie about cross-country exploration in which everyone in the cast
seems to be going in a separate direction, and nothing seems to
click.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Farley's bluster, he changes pace somewhat with his role
as Bartholomew Hunt, the slovenly 19th-century explorer who teams
up with the effete Leslie Edwards (Perry) to lead a ragtag band
toward the Pacific Northwest. Most of Farley's earlier movie
characters were innocent doofuses, but Hunt knows his way through
the wilderness; he just suffers a lot of indignities in finding it.
But the change of character doesn't make for much of a change in
the performance, and the gallows opening isn't the only reminder of
Farley's demise.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really play well off Perry, but then Perry seems
uncomfortable throughout, throwing out his usual engaging
cleverness in favor of a pomposity that never really finds the
right note. Call it the ``Friends'' curse _ like his cast mates
David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston, who also made bad movies this
year, he seems forever doomed to play his TV persona. But hey, he's
well-paid for it; we should all be so doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, as a maniacal French interpreter, and Kevin Dunn, as a
ruthless conquistador, do what they can to breathe life into
things, but all their performances amount to is huffing and
puffing; Bokeem Woodbine, Lisa Barbuscia and Fort Worth's Patrick
Cranshaw are wasted in supporting roles that are all set-up and no
payoff. But then, the whole movie is a bit of waste _ a fitful
struggle for laughs with a terrible ending. Kind of like Farley's
life.

ORIOLES DOWN RANGERS, SELE, 6-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Left-handed hitters often served as a source of
torment for right-hander Aaron Sele during 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those demons appeared exorcised during his first nine starts
this season with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The past two appearances suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who last night failed in his bid to become the major
leagues' first nine-game winner, surrendered home runs to two
left-handed hitters during the first three innings of Baltimore's
6-3 victory at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buried this team early,'' Sele said after the Rangers' fifth
consecutive loss and his shortest appearance this season. ``I put
us down five runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder B.J. Surhoff and designated hitter Harold Baines,
two of five players in the Orioles' lineup who hit left-handed
against Sele, sent two curveballs on 400-foot journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff's three-run blast consummated the Orioles' four-run
first inning, and Baines connected for a one-out, solo home run
during the third inning that gave the Orioles a 5-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (8-3) silenced left-handed hitters routinely during his
first nine starts. Left-handed batters hit only .229 (32-for-140)
against him during that span. However, left-handed batters produced
a .478 batting average (11-for-23) against Sele during his past two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not making quality pitches,'' Sele said. ``It doesn't
matter if you're left-handed or right-handed. You throw too many
pitches in poor locations and not too many good things are going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Roberto Alomar, a switch hitter, drove the
Orioles' first run home with a two-out double to right field, and
Baines advanced to third on the extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Surhoff to the plate with first base unoccupied.
Rangers manager Johnny Oates considered pitching around Surhoff
with Cal Ripken, a right-handed hitter, on deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't, and Surhoff capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect to give up three-run homers and expect to win
very often,'' said Sele, who allowed five runs on seven hits during
32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oates removed Sele with a two-out, bases-loaded situation with
Baines again at-bat during the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele pitched well in his previous start May 23 at The Ballpark
in Arlington. Sele earned the victory against the Kansas City
Royals with a complete-game effort, but signs of trouble appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The first three batters in the Royals' lineup featured two
left-handed hitters (center fielder Johnny Damon and designated
hitter Hal Morris) and a switch hitter (second baseman Jose
Offerman). That collection combined to go 6-for-11 with two
extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sele blamed command of his best pitch _ the curveball _ for his
difficulty last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just inconsistent,'' he said. ``I'd throw a couple of
good ones and then leave then next one letter- or belt-high. You
can't afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' struggles at the plate also continued.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the order _ left fielder Rusty Greer, right fielder
Juan Gonzalez and catcher Ivan Rodriguez _ produced only an infield
single during its 10 at-bats. Greer drove in one of the Rangers'
runs with a fifth-inning sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have that sustained offense right now that we've
become accustomed to this year,'' Oates said. ``Guys at the top are
getting on. Guys at the bottom are swinging at pitches, but we're
not getting much from the middle. That's what we've come to depend
on.''

CARREY RISKS SECURITY FOR CHALLENGE OF SATIRICAL `TRUMAN SHOW' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Carrey has had this strange fantasy going on in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I was the only real person and everyone else was an
actor?,'' Carrey says, completely serious. ``And I was some kind of
experiment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the grocery store, and the guy who, like, accidentally
bumps into my shoulder and doesn't say a word. ... Well, that guy,
you know, that's a special little part, and he goes around a corner
and high-fives a bunch of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey notices he's getting a chuckle, likes it, and begins to
laugh himself. After four years of stardom, he still seems to enjoy
entertaining his interviewer, even when he's being serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then this guy gets on the phone to his agent, and he
switches wardrobe because he's got another scene where he just has
to drive by me in a car.''
</P>
<P>
   We could dismiss such thoughts as the weird musing of a comic
madman. Except that, of course, most of us have shared the same
fantasy. Just the tiniest nagging suspicion (or is it a hope?) that
we really are the center of the entire universe, and everything and
everybody revolves around us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of us,'' Carrey says, ``has at one point in our
lives felt that feeling. I was going to write a script about it at
one point. I was so relieved when Andrew Niccol suddenly came up
with this brilliant script. I didn't have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``brilliant script'' is now ``The Truman Show,'' which opens
Friday. It's a sharp satire that _ under the guidance of director
Peter Weir (``Gallipoli,'' ``Witness,'' ``Dead Poets Society'') and
with an energetic but smartly tempered comic-dramatic performance
by Carrey _ is easily one of the most thought-provoking movies of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good satire, ``The Truman Show'' entertains while
illuminating a serious aspect of contemporary society. In this
case, it's the way those in media, particularly television, blur
the lines between reality and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's character, Truman Burbank, was the first child legally
adopted by a corporation. That corporation immediately turned baby
Truman into the star of a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week
television show. As Truman grew up, the world watched.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's friends and family are actors. His hometown is a vast
set. Now that he's grown, his job and wife are part of the phoney
story.
</P>
<P>
   Truman has no idea that every moment of his day is watched by
millions of people, or that his life is not real.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous? Sure. Diabolical? Horrifying? Of course. No wonder
it's a huge ratings hit.
</P>
<P>
   Would the public really buy into such a concept? Weir is
convinced the answer is a firm yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of public torture of Lady Diana and her husband
(Prince Charles) was really a version of `The Truman Show,''' says
the Australian director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between the real and unreal was blurred there. The
cameras were (sometimes) concealed that picked up their private
moments. The shock of her death was in some ways that they were
watching a soap opera on which people don't really die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was enthralled by every move she made,'' Weir says.
``She acted like a soap opera star at times, even courted trouble.
There were villains and lovers and revelations. Dodi Fayed was like
a new character introduced into the series. He was exotic and
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when she died the very people who bought all this stuff
were the most outraged, could have lynched the paparazzi who were
out getting photos for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those watching Truman on TV clearly find his life somehow more
real than their own lives. It may be sad and morbid, but perhaps
it's simply human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the very base of it, there's a human goodness,''
Carrey says. ``They're all just people who sometimes don't
understand themselves, who kind of feed off negativity in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic need which _ if we don't suppress it _ is to
feel superior to people. Everybody has that urge within them to see
somebody who is in a worse spot than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were a real ``Truman Show'' on TV, would Carrey watch
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, probably,'' he admits, as though confessing a sin. ``I
stumble across `Jerry Springer' and sit there sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the title of this movie is so great, The True-Man
Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we go out of our way to see real life. It's not
enough to see actors do their thing, or re-enactments. We want to
see the real pain and the real deal. It's a car-crash mentality,
the rubber-necking kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show says something bad about our society. It's a
warning,'' Carrey says.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays Truman at the point at which he is just beginning
to suspect there is something strange about his life, but he still
has no idea what. That gives the movie a touch of suspense and a
hopeful prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything that happens to this guy (Truman), you can't
kill the human spirit,'' Carrey says. ``You can't put it in a fish
bowl. You can't capture it.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Bring on the dead octopuses. They can't be near as
rancid as what the Stars threw out on the ice for the first two
periods last night at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Smelly. Slimy. Putrid.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't find a week-old, dead eight-legger more rotten than
a Stars team that not only forgot what got it here, but got caught
up trying to out-Wing the Red Wings, connoisseurs of the
fly-and-sigh offense, and failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   And then, for 15 minutes of the third period, the Stars nearly
scared the scarlet britches off the defending Stanley Cup champs
and their fans, who sat stunned by a furious Stars rally that might
have turned into the biggest comeback in franchise history if not
for one final ignominious moment by goalie Eddie Belfour on easily
his worst night of the playoffs, if not his life.
</P>
<P>
   If Game 2 was a must-win contest for the Stars, then the Red
Wings' humiliating, 5-3 thumping of the intruders from Texas
guarantees even more desperation hockey in Game 4 tomorrow
afternoon with Detroit leading the best-of-seven series 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   This game was over five minutes into the second period when, in
an 80-second span, the Wings pumped two goals past the nearly
comatose Belfour for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Over. Kaput. Finished.
</P>
<P>
   The no-offense Stars down by four goals and the Wings on a
rampage with half the game to play? No way, Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was verging on getting very embarrassing,'' Mike Modano
admitted. ``That much time to play and the way those guys can fill
up the net ...''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a soul in Joe Louis Arena not dressed in Dallas
black who didn't figure it was all done but for the traditional
octopus cookout. Don't tell me you didn't think so, too.
</P>
<P>
   But, determined to give the Wings something to think about, here
came the Stars, 1-2-3, as in goals flying past the Wings' own
papier-mache netminder Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   With the fans silenced, the Wings on their heels, the Stars
riding the momentum of their three-goal explosion off the sticks of
Jere Lehtinen (twice) and Modano, there was nothing farfetched
about thinking that this game was headed to overtime, if not an
outright Dallas victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Belfour, who has spent 99 percent of the playoffs
standing on his head, taking a swan dive _ literally _ that made
the Stars rally ultimately meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's penchant for straying too far from the crease took him
all the way into the left corner to chase down a dying puck. As he
swiped it around behind his goal, he was brushed by Wings forward
Martin Lapointe. Obviously hoping to draw a penalty, Belfour
sprawled to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   No whistle.
</P>
<P>
   As Belfour scrambled to his skates and rushed tardily back to
his position, Vyacheslav Kozlov passed to Lapointe, who had
stationed himself 15 feet in front of the Dallas goal. He drilled
it into the net on the late-arriving Belfour's glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Did the ``Eagle'' embellish the fall? No question about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think (Lapointe) made too much contact with Eddie,''
center Brian Skrudland said candidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't one of Eddie's best nights,'' coach Ken Hitchcock
understated. ``But he's carried us since the Olympic break. I'm not
going to sit here and criticize anything Eddie does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us aren't quite so loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the scariest part of the whole ugly evening came in
the postgame news conference when Hitchcock raved about his team's
play in front a nearly speechless room of reporters ready to write
its obit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best five-on-five we've played all year,'' Hitchcock
insisted. ``If we can continue to keep up our energy and play
five-on-five like that, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello. Earth to Hitch. Maybe he was still feeling the effects of
his foray into nearby Greektown for a Friday night dinner he said
afterward he didn't recognize either time he saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he was just doing the obligatory, losing coach
spin-doctoring. If so, give him credit for putting on a much better
performance than Belfour, who will win no Oscars for his dive at a
crucial part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that stage, you just want to keep playing the game,''
Hitchcock said. ``We had a good bead on things until they put in
that final goal.''
</P>
<P>
   At least his players weren't trying to float anything the
Detroit River hasn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible first 40 minutes,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely didn't play well, that's for sure,'' chimed in
Jamie Langenbrunner. ``We gave them too many opportunities and
didn't take advantage of our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of got reeled into playing their game as we fell
behind. But when you're down 4-0, what have you got to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the down-to-earth Skrudland to sum it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can congratulate each other, saying we played hard and came
back, and slap each other on the back,'' he said, ``but we're not
fooling anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   I doubt they're even fooling Hitch, as much as he tried to
convince us.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the Stars learned a painful if obvious lesson last
night. All those first-period shots might have looked pretty, they
might have even gotten the coach excited, but that's not this
team's game and it's not what got them here.
</P>
<P>
   Write it down: They can't fly with the Wings anymore than a dead
octopus can.

   ``At that stage, you just want to keep playing the game,''
Hitchcock said. ``We had a good bead on things until they put in
that final goal.''
</P>
<P>
   At least his players weren't trying to float anything the
Detroit River hasn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible first 40 minutes,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely didn't play well, that's for sure,'' chimed in
Jamie Langenbrunner. ``We gave them too many opportunities and
didn't take advantage of our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of got reeled into playing their game as we fell
behind. But when you're down 4-0, what have you got to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the down-to-earth Skrudland to sum it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can congratulate each other, saying we played hard and came
back, and slap each other on the back,'' he said, ``but we're not
fooling anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   I doubt they're even fooling Hitch, as much as he tried to
convince us.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the Stars learned a painful if obvious lesson last
night. All those first-period shots might have looked pretty, they
might have even gotten the coach excited, but that's not this
team's game and it's not what got them here.
</P>
<P>
   Write it down: They can't fly with the Wings anymore than a dead
octopus can.

<P>
   Paramount Pictures began early press and sneak screenings of
``The Truman Show'' months ago, hoping to get out the word that
this was not another slapstick Carrey movie along the lines of
``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' or ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio was successful at building considerable audience
awareness and positive word-of-mouth. Esquire ran an advance story
calling The Truman Show ``the movie of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount was also testing the waters to find out how to market
its unusual film, mindful of the relative disaster that occurred
when Carrey first tried a satire, the dark ``The Cable Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1996 movie finally managed to make $100 million worldwide,
far less than anticipated. Carrey's fans _ those who loved him in
slapstick films _ were not pleased with his portrayal of a
character in whom the comedy was scary and strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shooting gallery sometimes,'' Carrey says. ``It's
just your time to go in front of the guys with the guns. It was
politics, a lot of things. And then there was the money that had
never been heard of before.'' (Carrey got an unprecedented $20
million to star in ``The Cable Guy.'')
</P>
<P>
   He knew early in his career that he had to branch out from the
narrow comedy rut he was digging for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very same people who go, `I just want to see him do this
one thing,' if you did that one thing five times in a row, they're
over you,'' Carrey says. ``I'm not comparing myself to The Beatles,
but it happened to them. (Some fans) rejected every change. `Why
did you cut your hair? Why are you with this person (Yoko Ono)?'''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``The Cable Guy,'' Carrey has apparently expanded his fan
base with ``Liar Liar,'' which appealed to a more mature audience
than ``Ace Ventura.'' But that's no guarantee ``The Truman Show''
will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern of the studio is not so much his fans,'' Weir
says. ``We're more concerned with people who don't like Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Paramount) have done enough testing to know there's a
drop-off of those who are maybe too young (to appreciate ``The
Truman Show'') or just want to see him slip on a banana skin,''
Weir says. It's rare for a director to admit before a movie opens
that there may be some people who won't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey does see a cautious side to himself when it comes to
choosing his movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to to read carefully,'' he says. ``I don't want to do
everything. I'm not the type of person who has to work all the
time. I don't really define myself by being the most busy person.
If I could have a beeper-free world, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not easily deterred from a project in which he's
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show was one of the best scripts I'd ever read,''
he says. ``And Peter Weir's involvement was a huge deal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is eager for the day when he'll be doing straight
dramatic roles, rather than just comedy, Carrey gives a verbal
shrug: ``Sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'm heading. I do them as they come. This
one was offered to me, and the situation was great. How could I
turn it down?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the opportunities to show other sides of myself,
that's fantastic, and I appreciate it. But I think my comedy is
just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   He's content with the way things are going in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I be anything but happy?'' he asks. ``I'm ecstatic.
It's a dream come true that way. To have people like Peter Weir
believe in you is, like, ridiculous. And I didn't even have to lop
my ear off.''

RED WINGS SHOOT DOWN STARS, 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Stars decided to take an aggressive game to the
Joe Louis Arena ice last night and make the Detroit Red Wings
react.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings did, to the tune of four goals on the first 11 shots
while riding to a 5-3 victory in Game 3 of what was supposed to be
a defensive-minded Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Red Wings a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven
series heading into tomorrow's 1 p.m. rematch at Joe Louis Arena _
a place in which the Stars are 1-15-2 in their past 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   It also could have the Stars in a sort of identity crisis. While
the team has pitched strong defensive play throughout the playoffs,
they decided to gamble yesterday and force the issue. While that
resulted in numerous offensive chances and a 34-20 edge in shots,
it also allowed the Red Wings to sneak through the little cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can play aggressively, we just can't make the
mistakes we made,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We made a few
mistakes and they took advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars closed to within 4-3 in the third period, a
Detroit goal with 4:05 remaining ended comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played firehouse hockey from the opening drop, pushing
the play at Detroit and trying to prove they weren't intimidated by
either the crowd or the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a harried first 10 minutes for Red Wings goalie
Chris Osgood, but the Stars paid the price at the other end. The
Red Wings came up with three outmanned rushes in which the Stars
defensemen were excellent in keeping the pressure off goalie Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth Wings' rush, however, Belfour wasn't so lucky.
Steve Yzerman took advantage of a neutral zone turnover and made a
perfect move to center ice to open up about five feet of space for
linemate Brent Gilchrist. With Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig
closing in front and Stars center Benoit Hogue trailing behind,
Gilchrist was able to slip a wrist shot over Belfour for a 1-0 lead
at the 5:50 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play aggressive, we just can't make those mistakes,''
center Guy Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars seemed to have control of the game, despite the 1-0
deficit and had a golden opportunity to tie the score when Wings
defenseman Larry Murphy took his first penalty of the playoffs to
give the Stars a five-on-three power play for 1 minute, 34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Stars peppered Osgood with five shots, they
couldn't score on a power play that is 0-for-22 in three games
against the Red Wings and has just two goals in its past 11 playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure could have used a goal then,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Our power play took some energy away from our
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at The Joe was never any louder in the game than it
was after the Wings killed the five-on-three, and it was just three
minutes later that the Red Wings scored on their own power play to
take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That play truly was a bad break; a Nicklas Lidstrom shot from
the point deflected off the skate of Stars defenseman Derian
Hatcher and slithered past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had controlled much of the play to that point, and
still found themselves behind. And it would only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lidstrom sneaked another point shot past Belfour in the second
period, followed by a long shot from the stick of defenseman Jamie
Macoun to give the Wings a 4-0 lead just 25:33 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had faced 11 shots and was not looking like the man who
had not allowed more than two goals in the previous 10 games _ an
NHL record.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Stars pulled out all of the stops. Hitchcock
made several moves, most notably reuniting the top scoring line of
Mike Modano, Jere Lehtinen and Jamie Langenbrunner. Lehtinen
responded with two goals and an assist, while Modano had a goal and
an assist and Langenbrunner an assist.
</P>
<P>
   With 12:26 remaining in the game, the Stars closed to within 4-3
and had a real chance of tying.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, there were mistakes. The Stars failed once again
on the power play, sucking more air out of their game. And then
Belfour strayed from his net while trying to play the puck and was
knocked down by the Red Wings' Martin Lapointe. That allowed
Lapointe to find an open spot and put in the insurance goal with
4:05 remaining to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said afterward the comeback was indicative of the way
the team played, adding that ``from a five-on-five standpoint,
that's the best we've played all playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Stars were happy with the comeback, they didn't
share Hitchcock's glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can slap each other on the back (for coming back), but
we're not fooling anyone,'' center Brian Skrudland said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Craig Ludwig said changes are in order for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play a lot smarter than that,'' he said. ``Our
style is not to give up the outmanned rushes. There has to be a
right time to jump into the play and when not to. We've got guys
who want to win bad, but we have to do it with control.''

WINGS SAY STARS `DESERVED TO WIN' (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
C.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The broad smile that ran across the face of Red Wings
defenseman Jamie Macoun was about the only one visible in the
Detroit dressing room after Friday night's game with the Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Macoun's good feeling was understandable: in the second period
he scored what proved to be the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   But most Red Wings players were far more subdued, calling
themselves fortunate to escape with a 5-3 victory after blowing a
seemingly untouchable 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky tonight,'' said forward Martin Lapointe, who
shattered the Stars' comeback hopes with the fifth Detroit goal.
``We let them back in \Rthe game\S. It's a lesson: When you go up
four-nothing in the playoffs, you can't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe said Detroit ``Sat back a little'' after scoring early
and often. ``A lot of the adrenaline goes down,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ``We never panicked,'' Lapointe said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Larry Murphy also was hardly jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outshot us badly the whole game,'' Murphy said. The Stars
had 34 shots on goalie Chris Osgood, to the Red Wings' 20 on Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's reaction to Lapointe's goal with about four minutes to
play? ``That was a huge sigh of relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Macoun's thrilling moment was somewhat blunted. Of his
goal, he said, ``I didn't realize it was going to be as important
as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half of the game we got some lucky bounces and
ended up being up four to nothing,'' Macoun said. ``We probably
didn't deserve to be up four to nothing, and the second half of the
game ended up indicating where the game was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Macoun was impressed with the Stars' effort after falling so far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been the best team in the league all year long and
tonight they showed why,'' he said. ``Tonight was a very important
game and they smelled blood. They realized, for whatever reason,
that we weren't clicking tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings players were at a loss to explain why they weren't on
their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort was there but the passes were off a little bit and
we were doing plays that just didn't work out,'' Macoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said that his team was off form,
but that he didn't feel they had let up on the Stars after getting
the big lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I didn't think we were as sharp as we have been,''
Bowman said. ``I don't think we tried to be careful, we just lost
our focus a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Macoun: ``The players and the fans all want to have a nice
easy game. We were up four to nothing, but maybe we shouldn't have
been. Dallas probably deserved to win tonight, to be honest with
you. I'm sure they're thinking they should have won.''

BELFOUR CURSED BY `BAD LUCK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Martin Lapointe glided into a vacated Dallas Stars
zone, behind a vacated Stars net where he passed Stars goalie Ed
Belfour, who had ventured from his crease to play the puck.
</P>
<P>
   This much we know. This much they agree on.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Lapointe either slashed Belfour's leg (Belfour's
version) or Belfour took a dive (Lapointe's version). ``Well I
played the puck, and Lapointe two-handed me and got me between the
pads,'' Belfour said. ``Obviously, it hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars goalie went down either writhing in pain (Belfour's
version) or trying to draw a penalty (Lapointe's version). ``He was
trying to draw a penalty, obviously,'' Red Wings coach Scotty
Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   The next point on which everybody agrees is that Belfour
scrambled back to the crease. Lapointe scrambled in front of the
crease. Lapointe got there faster, sliding a puck past Belfour's
pads.
</P>
<P>
   It was Detroit's fifth and final goal, and it was the one that
sealed a 5-3 Red Wings victory in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Terry Gregson ``didn't say anything,'' Belfour said.
``He didn't want to come near me. He knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor: ``Maybe it was \Ra dive\S,
but \RLapointe\S touched a goalie. He has to call that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ``it'' was, ``it'' only capped a night that had been
what Belfour himself described as a horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who had stood on his head for 13 playoff games before
last night, finally teetered in Game 3. He allowed Detroit four
unanswered goals to begin Game 3. He allowed the biggest after the
Stars had battled back to pull within 4-3 in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it wasn't my night,'' Belfour said. ``I had some bad
luck goals, unfortunately, far too many in one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first goal began with an odd-man rush, and ended when Red
Wings winger Brent Gilchrist whistled a shot high and over his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal by defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom looked to be
heading wide, only to hit Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher's skate
and deflect in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three of them that went off sticks or skates,'' Belfour
said. ``Hopefully, we got rid of all of them in one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The third goal slid between his pads, another slap shot by
Lidstrom that hit something or someone before flying by Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth goal sailed over Belfour's shoulder, this time by Red
Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth goal slid past him on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't one of Eddie's best nights,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock admitted. ``He's carried us since the Olympic break, and
I'm not going to sit here and criticize anything Eddie Belfour
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner: ``We can't expect Eddie
to stand on his head every night. He played solid for us, and we
didn't for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour entered Game 3 with a 1.41 goals-against average, the
best among playoff goalies. He had repeatedly kept the Stars in
games that they had little reason to be in.
</P>
<P>
   He had been Stars' best player. He, by his own admission, wasn't
even close last night.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit had entered Game 3 preaching a steady diet of shots,
traffic and head games for Belfour. They tested him early as the
Stars, pressing on the offensive end gave up one odd-man rush, then
another and another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up a few odd-man rushes, and obviously at that point,
we needed to make a few saves,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The saves just weren't there, the goals from Lidstrom and
Gilchrist coming in the first period. The second-period goals by
Lidstrom and Macoun came 1:20 apart.
</P>
<P>
   The final goal against Belfour was the biggest and hurt the
most. On that, both Lapointe and Belfour can agree.

FOYT SAYS BOAT'S CAR WAS `SABOTAGED' BEFORE INDY 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Racing legend A.J. Foyt says the engine in
Billy Boat's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning car was ``sabotaged''
the night before the big race while locked inside his garage at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   And Foyt has not ruled out the possibility the tampering might
have been an inside job, involving a team member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody did some sabotage on Billy Boat's car,'' Foyt said
during a teleconference previewing the Pep Boys Indy Racing
League's True Value 500K night race at Texas Motor Speedway on June
6. ``Somebody dropped red Loctite on the last two (fuel injector)
butterflies on the left engine bank. It run down the throttle shaft
and locked the two butterflies solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Loctite is a liquid glue-type substance typically used to secure
gaskets and bolts to metal surfaces. Foyt said the problem was
discovered when his crew attempted to warm up the Oldsmobile Indy
Aurora V-8 in Boat's No. 11 Conseco Dallara before the start of
Sunday's 82nd Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who won the pole at 223.503 mph, said there are eight
injectors at the top of the engine, one for each cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The butterfly controls how much air gets into the engine,''
Boat said from his business, B&AMP;B Fabrication in Phoenix. ``Somebody
put Loctite on the throttle shaft. It just locked it up solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for it to happen by accident. I can't
accuse anybody, but the circumstances of how it happened are just
very suspicious. It can be done in a minute. You only have to do it
in one little spot to lock up the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said the engine had been run at 2 p.m. Saturday, after
which the garage was locked and ``sealed'' at approximately 2:30.
Foyt said Tommy LaMance, team manager of A.J. Foyt Racing and his
nephew, and Craig Baranouski, Boat's chief mechanic, were the first
crewmen to arrive at the garage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew somebody had went through,'' said Foyt, first
four-time winner of the Indy 500. ``I don't know if it was (done)
from the outside or if it was somebody on our crew. I guess there's
a lot of jealous people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he did not officially report the incident to the
sanctioning IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnhart, the IRL's director of racing operations, said
the garages were locked at 5 p.m. Saturday. Barnhart said the
Speedway also provided roving security 24 hours a day during race
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's suspicion among the team,'' said Boat,
who led the race's first 12 laps but finished 23rd because of a
faulty gearbox. ``I'm 100 percent confident that nobody in our
organization would do that. We got a good bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Boat originally was declared the winner of last
year's True Value 500K at TMS. But the victory was overturned and
awarded to Arie Luyendyk the next day after a scoring review by the
U.S. Auto Club.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt will take no chances with the cars of Boat and teammate
Kenny Brack at TMS, where practice and qualifying are scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lock 'em back in the transporters, is what we'll do,''
Foyt said.

   In the very first scene of ``Almost Heroes,'' Chris Farley is on
the gallows, telling the crowd what it can do with his fat rump.
Not only is the scene a creepy reminder of his recent death, it's a
reminder of how he lived his life: not caring much what anyone
thought of him, and willing to do anything for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Farley did the most extreme things for a laugh. His
philosophy seemed to be that no matter how lame the line, bellowing
it would make it funny; no matter how weak the sight gag, if Farley
screamed and abused himself enough, maybe you'd at least crack a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Farley does a lot of bellowing and screaming in ``Almost
Heroes,'' but nobody could have saved this script, written by a
trio whose names don't merit looking up. Although a few laughs come
through, this story of a cut-rate Lewis and Clark ultimately
defeats normally dependable talents, including Matthew Perry and
Eugene Levy, with its disjointed gags and aimless story.
</P>
<P>
   But it's director Christopher Guest who suffers the biggest
defeat. Less than a year after his ``Waiting for Guffman'' made
some of 1997's 10-best lists, he's delivered a movie that's a good
bet for 1998's 10-worst lists. Maybe Guest needs to write his own
material when he directs; whatever the case, he winds up with a
movie about cross-country exploration in which everyone in the cast
seems to be going in a separate direction, and nothing seems to
click.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Farley's bluster, he changes pace somewhat with his role
as Bartholomew Hunt, the slovenly 19th-century explorer who teams
up with the effete Leslie Edwards (Perry) to lead a ragtag band
toward the Pacific Northwest. Most of Farley's earlier movie
characters were innocent doofuses, but Hunt knows his way through
the wilderness; he just suffers a lot of indignities in finding it.
But the change of character doesn't make for much of a change in
the performance, and the gallows opening isn't the only reminder of
Farley's demise.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really play well off Perry, but then Perry seems
uncomfortable throughout, throwing out his usual engaging
cleverness in favor of a pomposity that never really finds the
right note. Call it the ``Friends'' curse _ like his cast mates
David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston, who also made bad movies this
year, he seems forever doomed to play his TV persona. But hey, he's
well-paid for it; we should all be so doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, as a maniacal French interpreter, and Kevin Dunn, as a
ruthless conquistador, do what they can to breathe life into
things, but all their performances amount to is huffing and
puffing; Bokeem Woodbine, Lisa Barbuscia and Fort Worth's Patrick
Cranshaw are wasted in supporting roles that are all set-up and no
payoff. But then, the whole movie is a bit of waste _ a fitful
struggle for laughs with a terrible ending. Kind of like Farley's
life.

CHEEVER MAKING HIS MARK IN IRL AS DRIVER, CAR OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As proud as he was of his victorious drive
in the 82nd Indianapolis 500 last Sunday, Eddie Cheever was even
more pleased for his car owner.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is Eddie McKay Cheever Jr., one of only three
owners/drivers competing in the fledgling Pep Boys Indy Racing
League. Born in the United States but reared in Italy, Cheever
qualifies as the IRL's resident international playboy. Handsome,
introspective and opinionated, Cheever is fully capable of
articulating the attributes of his two-car team in English, Italian
and French.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parlez-vous'' crankcase?
</P>
<P>
   You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in this to win,'' said Cheever, who scored his second
career Indy-car victory _ both as owner/driver _ in the world's
most prestigious auto race May 24. ``I am in this for Team Cheever
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that ego? No. I have not met a decent racing driver that
(A) likes to lose and (B) does not want to make sure that all the
attention in the team is on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   As owner/driver, Cheever is doubling up on the attention and the
aggravation inherent in professional motorsports. His off-season
was largely occupied by the search for a replacement primary
sponsor after the defection of FirstPlus Financial to the NASCAR
Winston Cup ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Rachel's Potato Chips, a Minneapolis-based company looking
to forge a national identity. Rachel's jumped onto the sidepods of
Cheever's black and blue Dallara chassis a week before the Indy
500. Improbably, Rachel's rode with Cheever into victory lane at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Cheever opted to change chassis
manufacturers, from G Force to Dallara, because the latter offered
more technical expertise. And in the IRL's version of Tire Wars, he
pledged allegiance to Goodyear at a time when Firestone rubber was
hot, hot, hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all difficult decisions to make,'' Cheever said
during a promotional visit to Texas Motor Speedway, which is
scheduled to play host to the second annual True Value
500-kilometer race Saturday night. ``As the team owner, it was
gratifying to see that most of the decisions were right. It's very
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting his European upbringing, Cheever spent 11 years
competing in Formula One _ road racing's most technologically
advanced series _ for a variety of teams. But he didn't win an F1
race in 133 starts, finishing a career-best second on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he took to oval-track racing in the States almost
immediately in 1990, when he joined Chip Ganassi Racing in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams Series. Cheever qualified 14th for
his first Indy 500 that year and completed 193 of 200 laps en route
to an eighth-place finish. The performance earned him rookie of the
year honors. Cheever proved that was no fluke by also capturing
CART's rookie of the year award at the end of the full season.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, however, Cheever labored as a journeyman
for team owners John Menard and A.J. Foyt. They were tours of duty
that convinced him it was time to change gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting really tired of racing for teams and seeing
things I thought were wrong,'' said Cheever, 40, of Tampa, Fla.
``And it wasn't correct for me to be insisting on those changes
because it wasn't my responsibility. My responsibility was to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I learned a lot from A.J. Foyt, on how to work around
people and how to work on an oval. John Menard and his team ... I
worked for Ferrari and Renault in Formula One and there were so
many different things that I have seen and done that I wanted to
implement.''
</P>
<P>
   FirstPlus Team Cheever made its debut in 1997. That was the
second year of the IRL, founder and Indianapolis Motor Speedway
president Tony George's vehicle designed to make open-wheel racing
more affordable and competitive while returning the sport to its
traditional all-oval roots.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever said he, rookie teammate Robby Unser, native Texan Greg
Ray and the sometimes curious mix of IRL near-names and no-names
nevertheless are proof that the series' concept is viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Indy 500 winners, and we broke every business rule
in the world with our racing team,'' said Cheever, who scored his
first IRL victory in the rain-shortened Indy 200 in Orlando, Fla.,
in January 1997. ``We dove into the swimming pool because I
promised everybody that water would be in the pool, and that we
wouldn't hit bottom. We were underfinanced. We went and bought cars
and engines and did everything we could to be as competitive as we
could because we believed the structure would allow us to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of faith in what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of true believers in Team Cheever includes business
partner/publisher Clyde Perlee, team manager Dick Caron and crew
chief Owen Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the race weekend I am probably third on the hierarchy,''
Cheever said. ``Dick Caron runs the company. He has 15 years
experience. The technical running of the car is done by Owen.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was crew chief for Al Unser Jr. in 1992, when ``Little
Al'' posted the first of two Indy 500 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win is more satisfying because it's a much smaller
group,'' said Snyder, then employed by Galles Racing International
and a member of CART's upper crust. ``Eddie and myself were working
on this car. We did not over-engineer the car _ because we did not
have an engineer. It was up to Eddie and I to make the best of what
we had, and use our experience. That's how we're competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk, who has won Indy 500s before and after the
CART-IRL divorce, said Cheever is perseverance personified.
Complete with Gucci loafers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie has taken a lot of criticism over the years,'' said
Luyendyk, defending champion of the True Value 500K. ``He's
thick-skinned. He's been with bad teams and always saw it through.
He drove a great Indy 500 and he's a very deserving winner. I'm
really happy for Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Cheever is working within the parameters of what the owner
said is a $5 million budget _ middle-of-the-pack by IRL standards
but merely chump change for CART's juggernauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business point of view, there is not a better value in
sports right now than the IRL,'' said Cheever, who has an estimated
$3 million in equity in his team. ``In the IRL they've set levels
where it's not possible to have that big of an advantage over
everybody else. So strategy will come into play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our race in Indy was won on strategy. We decided what strategy
to use two months before we went to Indy. I know it's not going to
pay off every time we go there, but we guessed the tires, we
guessed the temperatures right, we guessed the car right, we
guessed how many revs we had to run the Aurora engine at _ and
everything worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get everything right, it is possible for any driver to win
races. I did win at Indy, and it was a time where I probably had
the best car and the best team of my whole career on that one
weekend. I'm very proud that, as a team, we've been able to
compete. Damn right I am.''

REAL QUIET BOUND FOR GLORY IF TRIPLE CROWN BID SUCCEEDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He isn't as fast or good-looking as Secretariat was, and his
nickname of ``The Fish'' doesn't stack up well with ``Big Red,''
either.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Affirmed, he hasn't had a rival like Alydar to push him
to breathtaking performances.
</P>
<P>
   And he has lost more races than he has won, whereas Seattle Slew
lost only three times in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But if Real Quiet wins the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, opposing
trainers say he will deserve to be ranked alongside those famed
1970s horses as a deserving Triple Crown champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He possibly might not have the charisma or mystique that some
of the other Triple Crown winners have had,'' said Elliott Walden,
who trains Kentucky Derby and Preakness runner-up Victory Gallop.
``But he did go through a tremendous grind with this thing. If he
were to do it, I would definitely think he's deserving of being in
the elite category.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's half-length Kentucky Derby victory was considered
an upset by most. Even his trainer, Bob Baffert, thought that
stablemate Indian Charlie, who finished third, had more natural
ability.
</P>
<P>
   In the Preakness Stakes, Real Quiet came into his own with a
convincing victory despite running wide around the difficult turns
at Pimlico Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   Now the crooked-legged $17,000 purchase stands on the brink of
racing history, not to mention a guaranteed $5 million payday. No
3-year-old has swept the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978, and
only three horses have accomplished the feat since Citation in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Quiet's competition has been described as merely
average. He never had to meet quality horses such as Lil's Lad,
Event of the Year and Coronado's Quest, who were knocked out of the
races with various ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop is scheduled to try again in the mile-and-a-half
Belmont Stakes, but ``50-50'' Grand Slam would be the race's only
Grade 1 winner other than Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But that shouldn't diminish the difficulty of sweeping the
classics, said D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lukas has never trained a Triple Crown winner, his
horses have won three Derbies, four Preaknesses and three Belmonts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triple Crown winners occur in two ways,'' Lukas said. ``You
get a very, very superior horse that just dominates his class, or
you get a very good racehorse with good durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet isn't getting much respect right now. He appears to
be a horse in the right place at the right time. But you have to be
careful on deciding whether they're worthy or not until some time
goes by, until later in their career. He may be a horse that's
better than we think.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who will run Yarrow Brae and possibly Grand Slam in the
upcoming Belmont, used last year's Triple Crown races as an
illustration of the pitfalls of judging the quality of developing
young horses.
</P>
<P>
   When Silver Charm won the Derby and the Preakness, he was being
widely hailed as a deserving Triple Crown winner until he lost the
Belmont to Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lukas points out, Silver Charm won the Derby by a head over
Captain Bodgit, who ducked in sharply in the stretch run. Silver
Charm had another close call in the Preakness, when Touch Gold had
a nightmarish trip and was arguably the best horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people thought (Silver Charm) was a hell of a horse and
still do,'' Lukas said. ``They heralded him as a top horse, yet,
with a couple of nods here and there, he could have gone 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now you've got Real Quiet, who dominated the Derby and
dominated the Preakness and looks like (an) odds-on (favorite) in
the Belmont. And he gets very little respect. I guess you could say
he's in a no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert believes the answer is simple.
</P>
<P>
   He said Real Quiet is deserving of accolades if he proves
talented and durable enough to win all three races. But if he
doesn't win the Belmont, he is simply another good horse who
couldn't quite stand up to the rigors of an intense five-week
schedule that thwarted recent would-be sweepers such as Alysheba,
Sunday Silence and Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better horses (than Real Quiet) might have gotten beat in the
Triple Crown,'' Walden acknowledged, ``but it takes a special horse
to be able to win all three. If he can pull it off, he should be
deemed special, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And Baffert is confident that Real Quiet will respond to that
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take anybody on,'' he said. ``This horse is getting
better and better. He's just a big long-striding horse who inhales
these horses. I'm the only guy who possibly can screw this up.''

TMS PAVES WAY TOWARD REDEMPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There's a new word before the Texas in Texas
Motor Speedway. Reconfigured. Or Revamped. Or, it's hoped,
Improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different racetrack,'' said Eddie Gossage,
executive vice president and general manager of the track.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5-mile trioval has undergone an estimated $2 million to $3
million overhaul just in time for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series' Pronto Auto Parts 400-kilometer race Friday night and the
Pep Boys Indy Racing League's True Value 500K event Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new drainage system, pipes and sump pumps in place,
designed to let rainwater flow under the track and prevent the
seepage problems that plagued the 24-degree banking in turns 1 and
4 during the NASCAR Winston Cup Texas 500 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The transitions into Turn 1 and out of Turn 4 have been altered
by raising the outside walls in those areas and adding as much as
45 inches of pavement against the concrete. The infamous
eight-degree ``dual-banking'' has been removed and the entire track
repaved with a tighter asphalt mix. The changes were made in
response to complaints by Winston Cup drivers, and to allow the
side-by-side racing that stock-car fans love.
</P>
<P>
   The first driver to turn laps on the reconfigured track _ albeit
in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo pace car _ approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better racetrack,'' IRL driver Greg Ray of Plano said.
``Oh yeah. It's a better racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing, the ideal thing, the perfect-world thing would
have been to get it right the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing would have been for the best drivers in the world
to come in and proclaim it the best racetrack in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an old saying about the best laid plans.
</P>
<P>
   TMS could not lay claim to the title as the world's greatest
racetrack when it opened for business in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities and the amenities were excellent. But there was
one not-so-slight problem. The racing surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is first-class. Nothing like this has been built
anywhere else in the world,'' Gossage said. ``Those kinds of things
got lost by the fact that the mile-and-a-half ribbon of asphalt
wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston Cup drivers hated it when they came to town
for the inaugural race last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transitions into and out of the corners were difficult, they
said. The banking fell off too quickly in the exit to Turn 4, and
didn't begin soon enough entering Turn 1. They couldn't race side
by side.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse this year. The track leaked.
</P>
<P>
   There's another old saying. Something about what to do when you
don't succeed the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage and track owner Bruton Smith swallowed a little pride,
ate a little crow, burned the remainder of those ``Shut Up And
Race'' T-shirts and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody _ drivers, sanctioning body, fans _ wants this to be
perfect more than we do,'' Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   How well TMS officials succeeded in their quest for perfection
won't fully be determined until next year, when the Cup drivers
return.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's open-wheel cars are lighter and generate more
downforce than Winston Cup cars, and they didn't have any problems
with the track. The IRL put on the best show of the four races run
at TMS in '97.
</P>
<P>
   So the IRL race won't be the true test.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the truck race. The trucks are basically Cup
chassis with pickup bodywork, but they get into the corners about
15 mph slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has seemed to have had the trouble that the Winston Cup
cars have,'' Gossage said. ``What we want to hear and see is what
Winston Cup drivers have to say. Let's face it: That's our marquee
series and event. I want to hear what Rusty Wallace and Dale
Earnhardt and Mark Martin and those guys have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup drivers won't be back until next year. But when
they do return, Ray suggested that they will say all the right
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banking stays until they're done turning, so it will give
them more control,'' he said. ``All that banking will push them
down and give them grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``For NASCAR, hopefully it's enough of a change that they can
just worry about racing and set up their cars and not complain
about the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary feedback indicates that the complaints should at
least lessen, if not disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The drainage system seemed to pass its first test when the track
received more than an inch of rain Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had practice starting at 8 o'clock (Wednesday), we could
have had it dry with the jet dryers and pulling tires behind
wreckers, the normal stuff you do,'' Gossage said. ``We would have
had a perfectly wonderful day of racing. We feel like we've
resolved that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the racing surface, that issue appears to be resolved
also.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just smoother and has more banking into and out of the
corners,'' Ray said. ``Ultimately, it's just going to be easier to
race and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   It might even allow for side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's obviously the goal,'' Gossage said. ``That's what we
were shooting for. Hopefully, the width and transitions will give
them the ability to race two-wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to a variety of things to expand the grooves here.
For instance, put up pylons when we have the racing schools run
here and make them run the higher groove. The Winston Cup guys are
naturally going to the top groove. If we've already got some rubber
worked into the top groove, it's going to give them reason to
search around and find a place that works better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only change that absolutely had to be made was to the
drainage system. NASCAR president Bill France Jr. threatened to
take away the truck race if the seepage problem wasn't fixed.
France also hinted broadly that TMS had no chance for a second Cup
date, and that even the first date could be in jeopardy, if changes
weren't made.
</P>
<P>
   Although a drainage system would have corrected the water
problem, it would have done nothing to repair the track's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the proper thing to do was not only fix the water but
fix everything,'' Gossage said, ``and try to do the best we could
and really send a statement to NASCAR, to the competitors and the
fans that we really want to have the very best speedway we can have
for all of them. We wanted to go that extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings to mind another old saying for the new and improved
racetrack: Better late than never.

FORGET THE JOE JINX; STARS SEE HOW `WE CAN BEAT THESE GUYS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With just a shade of curiosity in his mind after
Friday's 5-3 Stars' loss to the Detroit Red Wings, coach Ken
Hitchcock skated up to defenseman Craig Ludwig at practice
yesterday and asked to check the team's pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that after the team meal, 10 or 12 of us were
sitting around and the feeling is that, yes, we can beat these
guys,'' Ludwig said. ``And I think a lot of it came from that game
(Friday) night. Even though we lost, we gained a lot of confidence
from what we were able to do against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will need that confidence heading into Game 4 today on
the same Joe Louis Arena ice where they are carrying a 1-15-2
record in their past 18 appearances. And with the Wings holding a
2-1 edge in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals, the Stars
realize that they are in a dire situation once again _ in jeopardy
of falling behind 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like Game 2,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're not in an
elimination situation, but a loss would make it very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars' coach said he believes that the team is
halfway toward a victory, overcoming the key mental hurdle he
perceived was blocking the players in their battle with the
defending Stanley Cup champions. He said he no longer feels the
Stars ``have stopped believing they can win in this building,'' as
he said before Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has gained a lot of confidence,'' Hitchcock said.
``We've played two strong hockey games (against the Red Wings),
we've won one and we've lost one. But we've shown we can play at
the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Game 3 loss, the Stars outshot the Red Wings 34-20 and
complained that three of the Red Wings' goals never should have
happened. Wings winger Brent Gilchrist used a high stick to play a
puck en route to his goal _ a move that should have stopped play,
Hitchcock said. The coach added that referee Terry Gregson blew a
call when he failed to blow the whistle on a delayed penalty,
leading to Jamie Macoun's goal. And Stars goalie Ed Belfour said
Martin Lapointe slashed him outside of the crease to set up the
final goal _ one that broke the back of the hard-charging Stars,
who had climbed back from a 4-0 deficit to make the score 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   And while they could have come off as whiners, while they could
have said the ``Jinx of The Joe'' was haunting them, the players
yesterday said a series of bad hops and missed opportunities only
strengthened their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of bad bounces that ended up in our net,''
defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``Otherwise, we proved that we
can play with this team, that we can play better than this team and
that we can beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches underscored they can do that while playing
the aggressive, offensive-minded style that they used in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play that style, we've done it all year,'' said captain
Derian Hatcher, in references to the Stars' two previous playoff
series. ``We played our best against San Jose when we pushed hard,
and we played our best against Edmonton when we pushed hard. In
that last game, we didn't give up goals because we were
forechecking hard, we gave up goals because we were cheating
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said that problem is easily remedied by increasing focus
and intensity. Both will be needed. The Stars will likely be
without defenseman Shawn Chambers, who has a sprained knee, and
winger Greg Adams, who is expected to be out with a sore neck.
Hitchcock said to expect defenseman Craig Muni and winger Jamie
Wright stepping into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With those changes and some shuffled lines that include the
reuniting of Jamie Langenbrunner, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen,
Hitchcock said the Stars' leaders need to step up. And while he
didn't name names, it's not difficult to pick out names like
Modano, Pat Verbeek, Sergei Zubov and Benoit Hogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us winning is we still don't have everyone drawn
in'' to believing, Hitchcock said. ``We have some key performers
who have to muster up and play with a higher level of
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   But if history is any indication, the Stars should respond with
a spirited performance today. Ludwig said. The Stars won a huge
game in Texas after the Sharks had pushed the series to 2-2. They
went to Edmonton and swept the Oilers there after splitting games
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but we always seem to play better when we
have our backs to the wall,'' Ludwig said. ``Maybe that shows the
character of this team. We have guys here who care, we have guys
here who believe in ourselves and who believe in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, the Red Wings are starting to buy in, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' the Wings' Macoun said after Game 3,
``they probably deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   See, this believing thing is really catching on.

LaPOINTE'S PAIN IS RED WINGS' GAIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Do not ask for whom Martin LaPointe's bells toll,
Dallas Stars. Unfortunately, they still ring for thee.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he is smiling through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Two sounds pealed through ``The Joe,'' Sunday afternoon, each in
its own way chiming a death knell for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ding!''
</P>
<P>
   The first came in the opening moments of the game, when the
Stars' Mike Modano broke free to the right of the Wings' net,
silencing the early bedlam of a jam-packed Joe Louis Arena for a
frozen moment as he sent a laser shot streaking toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The angle wasn't perfect, but it was good enough, and Modano had
Wings' goalie Chris Osgood dead to rights.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood never saw the screamer, but he heard it. Everyone from
Motor City to west Texas heard it as it whistled past Osgood's
right elbow and clanged off the inside of the far left post.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ the ``Joe Jinx'' again? _ it didn't go into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way my luck's been going,'' Modano sighed, ``why should I
be surprised?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dong!''
</P>
<P>
   The second, and most ringing moment of all, came less than 10
minutes later when Stars goalie Eddie Belfour snapped during a
Wings power play.
</P>
<P>
   Snapped. Lost it. Blew it.
</P>
<P>
   In full view of an official, Belfour flagrantly rammed his
stick, tip up, between the legs of Wings' forward LaPointe, yanked
him to the ice from behind and drew a backbreaking penalty that
gave the Wings a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As LaPointe slowly skated off, his Wings teammates attacked
Belfour like a ravenous wolf on a bloody steak, quickly turning a
1-0 lead into a two-goal edge.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid is as stupid does, and when the shouting had stopped, the
Stars' rally to fight back and tie the score had been wasted, and
all the explanations had been rolled out and examined, the bottom
line was as ugly as the 3-1 hole into which the Stars have tumbled
in this Western Conference series:
</P>
<P>
   They arguably outplayed the defending Stanley Cup champs in five
of six periods here and lost both games because one of the hottest
goaltenders in the playoffs has turned softer than the ice at both
steamy rinks.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood, the worst goalie left in the playoffs, outplaying
``Eddie the Eagle?'' Who could have imagined it?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've seen Osgood play since I've been in the
league,'' Stars' coach Ken Hitchcock conceded.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough that Belfour didn't play his normally
impenetrable defense in front of the Stars' net _ and yes, he has
probably spoiled us _ but to try to turn LaPointe into a falsetto
in front of almost 20,000 fans and a very interested referee, was
simply indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young guy,'' Wings coach Scotty Bowman said of
LaPointe, ``and he's married, too. That just shouldn't be allowed
in hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication was clear. Delicate matters were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional time in a very emotional game,''
Hitchcock contended. ``You look at it and you say you can't take
that penalty but I think when you're killing a penalty, the reins
have to be loosened a bit. That's a call you make 5-on-5, not
5-on-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie wants to see the play, it's in our zone and it's a
critical time. He just tried to get him out of his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the last time I checked, Belfour doesn't have a
license to perform vasectomies on unwilling patients, even if it is
the obnoxious and omnipresent LaPointe. At least not right in front
of the ref.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad penalty,'' Belfour admitted when he finally emerged
to face the media. ``I shouldn't take that penalty, especially when
we're already down a man.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he said, there was no particular provocation,''but they're
always hacking at your legs, backing into you.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPointe said he was happy, to a point, to take one for the
team, even if it mean a brutal invasion of his ``private area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel good,'' LaPointe said. ``But it was worth it
to get the team on the power play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Eddie,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said.
``He just likes to get involved in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Jack the Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars valiantly rallied to tie it, but the Wings' talent _
not a poor Dallas defensive play, like Richard Matvichuk's on the
Detroit's short-handed first goal, or Belfour's incredibly stupid
lapse of judgment on the second _ provided the winning goal when
Slava Kozlov redirected a Larry Murphy sizzler over Belfour's right
shoulder with 8:30 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at a point of the game where the next goal was probably
going to win it,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   And the way the bounces always seem to go here, the odds favored
the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Stars find themselves in a place they haven't been
before in this postseason, facing an elimination game and the
prospect of having to beat the good and serendipitous Wings three
consecutive times to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, including
at least once in this building in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   But first they must win at home Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think in terms of being down 3-1 in the series,''
Hitchcock said. ``We just have to try to win a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that, or ring out the season.

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the yen was one of the world's strongest currencies.
No longer. This week it hit a seven-year low of YEN 138 against the
dollar _ 40 percent down on three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this is yet more evidence of Japan's deepening economic
mess, and a bad harbinger for the outside world, too. Worries that
a falling yen could prolong Asia's financial crisis have helped
push Wall Street sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such sentiments are misplaced. The weaker yen will not be a
cure-all, but it is likely to do more good than harm. Which is more
than can be said for the measures that would be needed if
policymakers were to set out to make it stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The recent fall in the yen largely reflects the relative stance
of monetary policy in Japan and the United States. American
interest rates are likely to rise over the next year to keep
inflation in check, while the Bank of Japan is expected to ease
policy.
</P>
<P>
   There is little scope for it to reduce interest rates much
further from their historic low of 0.5 percent, but the bank could
still spur the economy by, in effect, printing massive amounts of
money. This, in turn, implies a weaker exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a stronger yen would require higher interest rates
and monetary contraction: the opposite of what Japan needs.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap yen will bring three benefits to Japan. First, it will
boost exports and so help to offset feeble domestic demand. Second,
by helping to push up import prices a weaker yen will make
deflation less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is currently in danger of entering a deflationary spiral
in which falling prices swell the real debt burden of companies,
which adds to the problems of the banking sector, which further
depress demand and so prices fall lower still.
</P>
<P>
   And, lastly, a cheaper yen will lure new capital into Japanese
equities and property, helping to ease one of the financial
sector's biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view a fall in the yen should be cheered not
feared. However, many policymakers and commentators in both America
and Japan are less than enthusiastic. They warn of two adverse
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   First, that a lower yen could trigger another round of
financial-market turmoil in the rest of East Asia. There are some
grounds for this, but only if the yen were in free-fall rather than
in a fairly steady slide.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse would indeed unsettle other Asian markets, and
avoiding that is a legitimate policy objective. But a slide is
another matter entirely. For Japan's very economic weakness is one
of East Asia's main problems: fresh growth in Japan, and prevention
of deflation, are powerfully in other Asian countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
   The second common objection to a weak yen is that it will widen
Japan's trade surplus and so reignite demands in America for
protectionist measures.

<P>
   It is true that by most measures, such as purchasing-power
parity, the yen has already fallen below its ``equilibrium value.''
Partly as a result, Tokyo, once the most expensive city in the
world, now seems fairly reasonable to a visitor compared with New
York, say.
</P>
<P>
   It is striking that a Big Mac hamburger now costs about 30
percent less in Tokyo than in midtown Manhattan. This might suggest
that the yen-dollar rate has already overshot. However, it is quite
natural for weak economies to experience depreciating currencies
and for booming economies to see rising ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the tumbling yen being more evidence of economic
incompetence, the exchange rate is the mechanism that redistributes
demand away from economies that are operating at full capacity
towards those in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a strong dollar is also in the interest of America's
overheating economy right now as it is helping to keep down
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that devaluation will wipe away Japan's woes.
Far from it. There is still much that the government must do:
implementing its latest fiscal stimulus, cleaning up the financial
sector and deregulating many services businesses are vital for
Japan's longer-term economic health.
</P>
<P>
   But if a cheaper yen contributes to economic recovery it will at
least provide a healthier environment in which to carry out some
painful structural reforms. &QL;

A WEAKER YEN COULD ACTUALLY HELP, NOT HURT, JAPAN'S ECONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the yen was one of the world's strongest currencies.
No longer. This week it hit a seven-year low of YEN 138 against the
dollar _ 40 percent down on three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this is yet more evidence of Japan's deepening economic
mess, and a bad harbinger for the outside world, too. Worries that
a falling yen could prolong Asia's financial crisis have helped
push Wall Street sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such sentiments are misplaced. The weaker yen will not be a
cure-all, but it is likely to do more good than harm. Which is more
than can be said for the measures that would be needed if
policymakers were to set out to make it stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The recent fall in the yen largely reflects the relative stance
of monetary policy in Japan and the United States. American
interest rates are likely to rise over the next year to keep
inflation in check, while the Bank of Japan is expected to ease
policy.
</P>
<P>
   There is little scope for it to reduce interest rates much
further from their historic low of 0.5 percent, but the bank could
still spur the economy by, in effect, printing massive amounts of
money. This, in turn, implies a weaker exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a stronger yen would require higher interest rates
and monetary contraction: the opposite of what Japan needs.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap yen will bring three benefits to Japan. First, it will
boost exports and so help to offset feeble domestic demand. Second,
by helping to push up import prices a weaker yen will make
deflation less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is currently in danger of entering a deflationary spiral
in which falling prices swell the real debt burden of companies,
which adds to the problems of the banking sector, which further
depress demand and so prices fall lower still.
</P>
<P>
   And, lastly, a cheaper yen will lure new capital into Japanese
equities and property, helping to ease one of the financial
sector's biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view a fall in the yen should be cheered not
feared. However, many policymakers and commentators in both America
and Japan are less than enthusiastic. They warn of two adverse
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   First, that a lower yen could trigger another round of
financial-market turmoil in the rest of East Asia. There are some
grounds for this, but only if the yen were in free-fall rather than
in a fairly steady slide.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse would indeed unsettle other Asian markets, and
avoiding that is a legitimate policy objective. But a slide is
another matter entirely. For Japan's very economic weakness is one
of East Asia's main problems: fresh growth in Japan, and prevention
of deflation, are powerfully in other Asian countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
   The second common objection to a weak yen is that it will widen
Japan's trade surplus and so reignite demands in America for
protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that by most measures, such as purchasing-power
parity, the yen has already fallen below its ``equilibrium value.''
Partly as a result, Tokyo, once the most expensive city in the
world, now seems fairly reasonable to a visitor compared with New
York, say.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Rather than the tumbling yen being more evidence of economic

demand away from economies that are operating at full capacity
towards those in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a strong dollar is also in the interest of America's

</P>

<P>
   At the turn of the century, with the economy booming and
inequality on the rise, the Salvation Army threw a dinner party at
Madison Square Garden. The stadium's lights beamed down on
thousands of poor people tucking into free food. The rich hired
boxes and galleries to savor their philanthropy. Everybody sang
``Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hailed by the Salvation Army Commander as ``the dawning
of a new era, the bridging of a gulf between the rich and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next quarter-century the masses at the trestle tables
turned on the elite in the galleries. The icons of American
capitalism _ the Rockefellers, Morgans and Vanderbilts _ were
denounced as ``robber barons'' and ``malefactors of great wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust policy was used to cut them down to size, higher taxes
to narrow the inequalities they had created, and tariffs to stop
them exporting American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market crash of 1929 (also their fault) led the
government to interfere even more in business. Then came the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   A simplistic account, no doubt, but one that America's new rich
might review. For if 1900 marked the high point of one era of
wealth creation, with enormous riches for those who seized new
national markets just then opening up, 2000 may mark another, with
the opportunities flowing this time from globalization, new
technology and corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   America, at the last count, had 170 billionaires, compared with
13 in 1982. In many cases, the rich have got richer by doing rather
little. An American who had $500,000 in shares and a $500,000 New
York apartment 15 years ago, and has merely held on to them, is now
$5 million better off.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche that America's poor are too busy striving to have
time for envy still rings true. Just now the economy is doing so
well that everybody is getting ahead. But inequality has increased
sharply over the past 30 years, and this has not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper cartoons, Bill Gates has evolved from geek-hero to
bullying monopolist _ very Rockefelleresque. ``Titanic,'' the
blockbuster movie, offered a bracingly Marxist view of events, and
the delight of American audiences when one or two rich passengers
went under was, er, chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week passes without news of some executive hauling home
a planet-sized pay packet, often for merely keeping his own
company's performance in line with the stock market's. And the
fattest pay packets often occur at companies where ``downsizing''
is most vicious.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be long before populists such as Pat Buchanan begin to
tap directly into these resentments, before politicians say that
``something must be done'' to rein back American capitalism?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, public policy can do sensible things, as well as
crass destructive ones, to address fears that America's less
fortunate are being left behind. But on this occasion we will not
dwell on the rights and wrongs of welfare reform, education reform,
tax reform and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   We simply pose the question, what might America's rich
themselves do to assuage the anxieties and resentments of the
unrich?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, philanthropy was the answer. Americans still
give generously, especially compared with mean Europeans. But there
are signs that the tradition is flagging, particularly near the
top.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, eight in ten Americans earning more than $1
million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the new billionaires of Silicon Valley and Wall
Street pale alongside the robber barons. John D. Rockefeller
started giving away his money when he was a clerk in Cleveland; by
the end of his life he had handed over $550 million, around $6
billion at today's prices.
</P>
<P>
   The barons also had a sense of purpose. Nowadays, when cash is
given, it is often thrown away on things like renaming business
schools. Philanthropy needs the bright ideas of the new corporate
leaders as much as it needs their cash.
</P>
<P>
   In such a market-driven place as America, there is always a
chance that a problem can heal itself. The pattern of future growth
may, relatively speaking, favor today's low-income groups more than
the better-off.
</P>
<P>
   The conspicuous excesses of capitalism may likewise be curbed:
shareholders may clamp down on silly executive pay. Downsizing is
going out of fashion. Also, many of the new rich are young; they
will become more philanthropic in their dotage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side stand the lesson of history (even the robber
barons' generosity did not avert a backlash) and the fact that few
of the new rich seem to be aware that they are doing anything
questionable at all.
</P>
<P>
   This conviction sometimes reflects the products they make. A
software designer is a creative type, an artist almost _ hardly an
exploiter, like somebody who builds a railway. But it also reflects
two tenets of modern American business.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the perception that a businessman's value to
society lies solely (as opposed to chiefly) in being a good
businessman, in starting companies and making better products.
Medical and law schools teach the value of pro bono work, business
schools rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   The more dangerous second idea is the notion that America's rich
owe their wealth entirely to their own brilliance, when in fact
they also owe much of it to the system that allows and encourages
great wealth to be created.
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy is part of the unspoken contract that underpins the
American dream. If that contract is broken, a backlash is likely.
Every American, rich and poor, would lose. &QL;

   MANAGUA _ The sky is thickly overcast; the smoke makes eyes
water and lungs gasp for breath; the muggy heat is unbearable. This
is the Nicaraguan capital, Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Life was much the same this week in Mexico City, which was on
full smog alert. Honduras reported a continuing sharp rise in
respiratory disorders, and until Monday the country's four main
airports had all been closed for some days for lack of visibility.
</P>
<P>
   At Tikal, in Guatemala, 700 firefighters were struggling to
protect historic Mayan temples.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, fires have raged in scrub and forests from Panama
to southern Mexico. Their effects are devastating, and will long
outlast the human discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua alone, a British-aided monitoring program using
satellite images has counted many thousands of fires, especially on
the Caribbean side, whose forests, stretching across into Honduras,
are the last really large area of pristine forest in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   In some places the fire front is 20, 30, even 50 kilometers
wide. Nicaragua has about 40,000 square kilometers (15,450 square
miles) of forest. But that is only half what it had in 1960 _ and
about 500 square kilometers a week have recently being going up in
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   At last, Central Americans are noticing their own threatened
environment, and listening to the experts who have been warning
them for years that far more must be done to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy, this year, to blame El Nino. But many of the fires
were started deliberately to clear land, only to run out of control
in the drought and heat.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble, now as for 30-40 years past, in Nicaragua and
Honduras alike, is not weather but people: big ranchers clearing
land for cattle, slash-and-burn peasant farmers, timber companies
logging indiscriminately and often illegally: ``They get permission
for 50 trees and take 500,'' says one angry conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   And behind these are the politicians and officials who allow it
all and often profit from it.

   MANAGUA _ The sky is thickly overcast; the smoke makes eyes
water and lungs gasp for breath; the muggy heat is unbearable. This
is the Nicaraguan capital, Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Life was much the same this week in Mexico City, which was on
full smog alert. Honduras reported a continuing sharp rise in
respiratory disorders, and until Monday the country's four main
airports had all been closed for some days for lack of visibility.
</P>
<P>
   At Tikal, in Guatemala, 700 firefighters were struggling to
protect historic Mayan temples.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, fires have raged in scrub and forests from Panama
to southern Mexico. Their effects are devastating, and will long
outlast the human discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua alone, a British-aided monitoring program using
satellite images has counted many thousands of fires, especially on
the Caribbean side, whose forests, stretching across into Honduras,
are the last really large area of pristine forest in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   In some places the fire front is 20, 30, even 50 kilometers
wide. Nicaragua has about 40,000 square kilometers (15,450 square
miles) of forest. But that is only half what it had in 1960 _ and
about 500 square kilometers a week have recently being going up in
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   At last, Central Americans are noticing their own threatened
environment, and listening to the experts who have been warning
them for years that far more must be done to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy, this year, to blame El Nino. But many of the fires
were started deliberately to clear land, only to run out of control
in the drought and heat.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble, now as for 30-40 years past, in Nicaragua and
Honduras alike, is not weather but people: big ranchers clearing
land for cattle, slash-and-burn peasant farmers, timber companies
logging indiscriminately and often illegally: ``They get permission
for 50 trees and take 500,'' says one angry conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   And behind these are the politicians and officials who allow it
all and often profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua things have grown worse as thousands of destitute
former Contra guerrillas, many with little skill in farming, have
moved into uninhabited (and theoretically protected) forests in the
north, and burned them to get land.
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies have played their part; a Korean one has been
accused not only of cutting into precious hardwood forests around
and in the Bosawas reserve on the Caribbean coast, but of opening
trails into the forest for settlers like the ex-Contras.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants who might wish to protest _ there are such _ dare not:
they would pay for it if they did, they say, and they don't mean in
money.

   In Honduras, there is no effective control of logging, say

(supposedly protected) areas in Mosquitia and elsewhere in the
east, and even killing those who resist them. No one has much

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is surprising to find a serene man like Howard Behar in a
double-espresso job. As president of Starbucks Coffee
International, the overseas arm of the Seattle-based chain, he has
sustained a frenetic pace over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   In April his firm acquired the confusingly named Seattle Coffee
Company _ a London-based chain with 60 stores in Britain _ gaining
its first foothold in Europe. In the past month he has signed deals
that will take Starbucks into Malaysia and New Zealand, and has
overseen new branch openings in Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he has shuttled back and forth to his home in Seattle,
a speech at Stanford business school and his son's wedding in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Behar does not seem at all frazzled as he talks about his
work, combining a decaffeinated demeanor with generous spoonfuls of
sweet sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   His primary goal is to improve people's lives, he declares, and
Starbucks _ the world's biggest chain of coffee shops, with some
1,600 branches _ is helping him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the customers, who can walk into any Starbucks
outlet and buy a great cup of coffee, delivered with a smile. Then
there are the employees, who not only earn some money, but also
have a chance to feel as good about serving customers as he does.
</P>
<P>
   To the man who is leading Starbucks abroad, therefore, Asia is a
place where many different kinds of people share the same goal:
``to be treated with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is one to make of all this? Despite its name, this column
is inclined to take wholesome claims at a heavy discount. And in
this case skepticism is no doubt warranted.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, there is the question of whether anyone's dignity
is enhanced by the exchange of $2 for a cup of coffee. Nor, for
that matter, is it easy to overlook Behar's stock options and new
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   And an opponent seeking to take a cheap shot would in all
likelihood point out that, before he joined Starbucks, Behar used
to sell time-share property.
</P>
<P>
   To harp on about such things, however, would be unfair. For one
thing, there is no particular reason to doubt Behar's integrity. He
really seems to mean it when he says that his family has taught him
his most important lessons about management.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, executives such as Behar are nothing rare. Few talk as
plainly, but many share his belief that some of the things
employees and customers care about are missed by the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Behar is undoubtedly right about two crucial points. Customers
like being treated well; and employees, if they have to work
anyway, would rather work in a pleasant environment doing something
with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this has two advantages. First, if workers treat
customers well, there is a better chance that they will come back,
thereby boosting revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if employees have the ``tools'' with which to serve
those customers, they will receive more smiles and fewer insults,
and firms will again benefit _ through better applicants, lower
labor turnover, or even lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   For Starbucks, which has a prominent brand and a flexible work
force, such things matter. The firm goes out of its way to buy
high-quality coffee beans, and has invested in ways to make better
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to charge a premium for coffee if customers can
pay less for the same amount of caffeine and comfort just down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, to compete on costs Starbucks needs a flexible work
force. With low wages and every danger of staff being poorly
motivated, it is hard for such firms to cultivate
customer-friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Starbucks' core North American business, which
Behar used to run, has long emphasized human-resource policies. It
offers all of its front-line employees the same package of
health-care and other benefits that its most senior executives
enjoy, and tosses in a few stock options as well.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is the extensive training it gives to its
coffee-store employees (known as baristas, in a nod to Italian
supremacy), so they can better handle crotchety customers.
</P>
<P>
   Behar thinks this approach is just as crucial in Asia. It is not
enough, he says, simply to attune the firm's beverages to local
tastes: if Starbucks is to win over Asian consumers, it will have
to provide topnotch service.
</P>
<P>
   In a city such as Tokyo, where customers may encounter several
different branches, the knock-on effects of good or bad service are
all the more important.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Behar has maintained the emphasis on training, and
_ despite his demanding travel schedule _ tries to meet all of
Starbucks' growing cadre of Asian employees.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that all this goes too far, paying too much
attention to employees and not enough to prices, margins or
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Paying employees too much, or overinflating their hopes, does
not help either. And shareholders value smiling customers only to
the extent that they can be converted into cash.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has not been tested yet: its share price has
outperformed even a frothy stock market. Many firms discover how
nice they really are only when things start to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That said, too many service companies make the opposite mistake.
When a manager is asked to defend his performance, it is easy to
document savings in cost or increasing same-store sales. The
fuzzier benefits of happy employees and impressed customers are
harder to put in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a true believer occupies a position of power, such things
are easily neglected. Sometimes, a double-espresso job does demand
a decaffeinated personality. &QL;

<P>
   It is surprising to find a serene man like Howard Behar in a
double-espresso job. As president of Starbucks Coffee
International, the overseas arm of the Seattle-based chain, he has
sustained a frenetic pace over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   In April his firm acquired the confusingly named Seattle Coffee
Company _ a London-based chain with 60 stores in Britain _ gaining
its first foothold in Europe. In the past month he has signed deals
that will take Starbucks into Malaysia and New Zealand, and has
overseen new branch openings in Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he has shuttled back and forth to his home in Seattle,
a speech at Stanford business school and his son's wedding in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Behar does not seem at all frazzled as he talks about his
work, combining a decaffeinated demeanor with generous spoonfuls of
sweet sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   His primary goal is to improve people's lives, he declares, and
Starbucks _ the world's biggest chain of coffee shops, with some
1,600 branches _ is helping him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the customers, who can walk into any Starbucks
outlet and buy a great cup of coffee, delivered with a smile. Then
there are the employees, who not only earn some money, but also
have a chance to feel as good about serving customers as he does.
</P>
<P>
   To the man who is leading Starbucks abroad, therefore, Asia is a
place where many different kinds of people share the same goal:
``to be treated with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is one to make of all this? Despite its name, this column
is inclined to take wholesome claims at a heavy discount. And in
this case skepticism is no doubt warranted.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, there is the question of whether anyone's dignity
is enhanced by the exchange of $2 for a cup of coffee. Nor, for
that matter, is it easy to overlook Behar's stock options and new
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   And an opponent seeking to take a cheap shot would in all
likelihood point out that, before he joined Starbucks, Behar used
to sell time-share property.
</P>
<P>
   To harp on about such things, however, would be unfair. For one
thing, there is no particular reason to doubt Behar's integrity. He
really seems to mean it when he says that his family has taught him
his most important lessons about management.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, executives such as Behar are nothing rare. Few talk as
plainly, but many share his belief that some of the things
employees and customers care about are missed by the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Behar is undoubtedly right about two crucial points. Customers
like being treated well; and employees, if they have to work
anyway, would rather work in a pleasant environment doing something
with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this has two advantages. First, if workers treat
customers well, there is a better chance that they will come back,
thereby boosting revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if employees have the ``tools'' with which to serve
those customers, they will receive more smiles and fewer insults,
and firms will again benefit _ through better applicants, lower
labor turnover, or even lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   For Starbucks, which has a prominent brand and a flexible work
force, such things matter. The firm goes out of its way to buy
high-quality coffee beans, and has invested in ways to make better
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to charge a premium for coffee if customers can
pay less for the same amount of caffeine and comfort just down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, to compete on costs Starbucks needs a flexible work
force. With low wages and every danger of staff being poorly
motivated, it is hard for such firms to cultivate
customer-friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Starbucks' core North American business, which
Behar used to run, has long emphasized human-resource policies. It
offers all of its front-line employees the same package of
health-care and other benefits that its most senior executives
enjoy, and tosses in a few stock options as well.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is the extensive training it gives to its
coffee-store employees (known as baristas, in a nod to Italian
supremacy), so they can better handle crotchety customers.
</P>
<P>
   Behar thinks this approach is just as crucial in Asia. It is not
enough, he says, simply to attune the firm's beverages to local
tastes: if Starbucks is to win over Asian consumers, it will have
to provide topnotch service.
</P>
<P>
   In a city such as Tokyo, where customers may encounter several
different branches, the knock-on effects of good or bad service are
all the more important.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Behar has maintained the emphasis on training, and
_ despite his demanding travel schedule _ tries to meet all of
Starbucks' growing cadre of Asian employees.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that all this goes too far, paying too much
attention to employees and not enough to prices, margins or
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Paying employees too much, or overinflating their hopes, does
not help either. And shareholders value smiling customers only to
the extent that they can be converted into cash.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has not been tested yet: its share price has
outperformed even a frothy stock market. Many firms discover how
nice they really are only when things start to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That said, too many service companies make the opposite mistake.
When a manager is asked to defend his performance, it is easy to
document savings in cost or increasing same-store sales. The
fuzzier benefits of happy employees and impressed customers are
harder to put in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a true believer occupies a position of power, such things
are easily neglected. Sometimes, a double-espresso job does demand
a decaffeinated personality. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the hype, you might think that Viagra is the first drug
designed to help men achieve and sustain an erection. In fact there
are many rival products.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Chinese medicine, especially, claims numerous
treatments for invigorating the organ in question. Yu Han, a
Chinese-medicine specialist based in London, notes that most such
medicines are parts of plants _ lotus stems, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Since plants have also yielded many drugs recognized as
effective by western medicine, it is likely that some of these
herbal cures would withstand scientific scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction between medicine and magic is often a fine
one, and when ``cures'' are based not on the chemical diversity of
plants but on the alleged attributes of wild animals, the success
of any treatment is surely all in the mind. Which is not much
comfort to the animals involved.
</P>
<P>
   Take tiger-penis soup, for instance _ and some apparently do. It
is supposed to endow men who consume it with the prowess of that
mighty beast. Tigers are not amused: only 5,500-7,500 are left in
the wild, and dozens are poached and chopped up each year for use
in traditional medicines.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, according to Steve Trent of the Environmental
Investigation Agency in London, which studies ``crimes against
nature,'' trade in tiger parts is killing more of the beasts than
the destruction of their forest habitat.
</P>
<P>
   And tigers are not alone. Powdered rhinoceros horn is also a
favored treatment for impotence (fewer than 12,000 rhinos remain in
the world), as are potions made with the remains of the masked
palm-civet, an endangered mongoose-like animal.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are endangered species, the trade in tigers, rhinos
and civets involves poaching, smuggling and related treacheries.
All of this drives up costs, making such potions luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   For the patient of ordinary means, therefore, something cheaper
is required. And stags have just the right sort of image. Dried
into a black and leathery state, stag penises are diced like
carrots and then boiled to make soup.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't taste just like chicken. It tastes ``just like
MSG,'' reports Hugh Baker, a professor of Chinese at the University
of London.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoholic infusions are also popular. Three-penis wine (made of
the said parts of a dog, a stag and a seal) is a popular standby.
Nine-penis wine (don't ask) is slightly more expensive. So is wine
made with a special kind of gecko, a cheerful little lizard that is
found throughout Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Even snake penises are considered good. In Hong Kong, they are
soaked in herbs and liquor, aged for a couple of years, and then
sold for up to $200 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, then, Asia should be a fertile market for
Viagra, and tigers, rhinos and civets might thus have some of the
pressure lifted from them. But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Asians do not doubt the virtues of western medicine. Many,
however, assume that traditional varieties are better for certain
kinds of problems, ``vigor'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Viagra _ unlike the folk remedies _ has clinical trials
to prove that it works. At a dose of 100mg, Pfizer reports that 82
percent of men had improved erectile performance. (It also notes,
deadpan, that the drug is ``not indicated for use in newborns,
children or women.'')
</P>
<P>
   Stag-penis soup, on the other hand ``didn't do a thing for any
of us who had it for dinner,'' says Dr. Baker. &QL;

<P>
   He was a young, bookish, bespectacled version of Che Guevara, a
young revolutionary whose only romantic touch was the red-and-black
silk Sandinista bandanna around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixties' style high-heel boots were not a fashion statement,
but simply to lift him up to something like average height.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Ortega captured the hearts of the post-Guevara
generation when he led the ragtag men and women of the Sandinista
National Liberation Front (FSLN) into Managua in July 1979 after
overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in a guerrilla war that had
soaked Nicaraguan streets in blood.
</P>
<P>
   As ``coordinator'' of the revolution, a man who had spent seven
years in Somoza's jails, often tortured, no one batted an eyelid
when the Sandinistas appointed him President of Nicaragua, a post
he held until world pressure forced him to hold free elections in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   As Sandinista leader, Ortega became the new symbol of revolution
20 years after Guevara and Fidel Castro had overthrown Cuba's
dictator, Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   With Guevara long dead _ killed in Bolivia in 1967 _ and Castro
deeply frozen inside the Cold War, Ortega became the biggest thorn
in the side of the United States, and the focal point of Ronald
Reagan's anti-communist paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   His confiscation of property and land, including that of
American owners, did not add to his popularity in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan called him a ``tin-pot dictator.'' His successor George
Bush called him ``a skunk at a garden party.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuinely fearing that the Sandinistas would spread their
revolution north, up through Central America and Mexico, Reagan
ordered Border Patrol guards in such cities as Brownsville, Texas,
to be on extra alert. An awful lot of Americans saw nothing funny
about their president's stand.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, using the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
President Reagan encouraged and financed the remnants of dictator
Somoza's feared National Guardsmen to form the ``Contras'' _ short
for ``Counter-Revolutionaries'' _ a right-wing guerrilla group
aimed at overthrowing the Sandinistas and restoring a government
more amenable to the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Based across the Nicaraguan border in Honduras and Costa Rica,
the Contras launched hit-and-run attacks, carried out massacres and
engaged in combat with the Sandinistas which left tens of thousands
of Nicaraguans dead throughout the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Like Castro, Ortega thrived on the Americans' hangups. He
flirted openly with the Cuban leader and became chummy with Iraq's
Saddam Hussein and Libya's Col. Muammar Qaddafi. And like Castro,
his image of pariah to yuppie America made him even more of a hero
to sociallistly-minded youth and intellectuals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As they had done in the sugar-cane fields of Cuba, young people
flocked to Nicaragua to help pick coffee beans ``for the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually sandal-wearing backpackers with little money to spend on
hotels with hot water, they became known as ``the Sandalistas,''
revolutionary hippies of the Eighties. Even their Nicaraguan hosts
mocked their body odors.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline of the Soviet Union, and an increasingly
isolated economy, faith in the Sandinistas faded throughout the
Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   What had started as a ``National Liberation Front'' in the
jungles of Costa Rica and underground in the slums of cities such
as Managua and Leon, had become a disunited party, proven inept at
managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguans were increasingly critical of the ongoing
war-footing _ though largely promoted by the CIA-backed Contras _
and the conscription and budget needed to maintain an army seen
only as a symbol of defiance against the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ortega, under worldwide pressure, finally held free
elections in 1990, few doubted his charisma would pull him through
for a further six years.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because Nicaraguans had learned to keep their opinions
to themselves through years of dictatorship, as well as under the
reign of the Sandinistas' no-nonsense internal security agents, the
polls turned out to be all wrong. Conservative grandmother Violetta
Chamorro won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega, now 52, has been opposition leader ever since, often
disrupting public life by organizing strikes and regularly
threatening to take up arms again _ a threat few, if any
Nicaraguans ever take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 elections, he lost again, this time to conservative
Arnoldo Aleman, the current president, who had been jailed by the
Sandinistas in the Eighties and seen his coffee farm confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   That defeat came despite an American-style campaign by Ortega
and a complete change of image.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the fiery anti-American rhetoric, replaced by calls for
friendly relations. Gone were the horn-rimmed eyeglasses, replaced
by contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the cowboy shirts with rolled-up sleeves, replaced by
choirboy-like white collarless smocks. Gone was the old
revolutionary Sandinista anthem with its exhortation to ``fight the
Yanqui, enemy of humanity,'' replaced by Beethoven's ``Ode to
Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortega even brought in former ``Contra'' guerrillas to his
campaign, including the notorious Commander Mack, once photographed
ordering one of his men to cut a peasant's throat, in an effort to
win conservative votes.
</P>
<P>
   But all to no avail. Ortega lost again and, despite being
reelected Sandinista leader at the party's Congress last weekend _
four days before his stepdaughter lodged criminal sexual abuse
charges against him _ few Nicaraguans believe Ortega will be a
presidential candidate next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rape and sexual abuse charges do not stick, his
stepdaughter's detailed allegations have undoubtedly hurt Ortega's
image at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When she announced the charges, his stepdaughter, Zoilamerica
Narvaez, now 30, was heckled by a few hard-line Sandinista women,
shouting ``Crazy Woman, Degenerate!'' but backed by other women
chanting ``Keep up the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Nicaraguan women, including Sandinistas, say the party
always had a macho bent, shown by the relatively few women given
senior government positions despite having served as foot soldiers
in the guerrilla war and revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were always manipulated under Sandinismo,'' Nicaraguan
political analyst Moises Hassan, a former Sandinista, was recently
quoted as saying. ``It's a farce.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He opposed restrictions on abortion, supported gays
in the military and thought Pat Robertson's religious right was a
bunch of ``kooks.'' To hear the television news and read the
obituaries, you might have thought that Barry Goldwater was a
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the right-wing senator from Arizona who died on Friday
was a liberal, in many of the ways that the word is used in
Britain. He was in the Manchester tradition, a foe of government
intervention and an individualist.
</P>
<P>
   In America being a liberal means being something else _ a friend
of the state _ and so Goldwater's lifelong crusade was against
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   But in his later years he found himself often at odds with the
Republican Party, over abortion, school prayers and gay rights, as
they became more authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ease with which the mainstream media in America
slid into eulogy was slightly disturbing. ``Barry Goldwater was a
politician who stood by his own salty views,'' the New York Times
said in an editorial, failing to point out that it had long
regarded most of these salty views as a grave threat to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He had, after all, saltily suggested using low-yield nuclear
weapons in Vietnam. Saltily, he had voted against the 1964 Civil
Rights Act which started to dismantle apartheid in America's South.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth of the reaction from President Bill Clinton to
Goldwater's death was also slightly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   When Goldwater ran in 1964, as the Washington Post pointed out,
he was regarded as ``a demagogue and a leader of right-wing
extremists and fascists who was likely to lead the United States
into nuclear war, eliminate civil rights progress and destroy such
social welfare programs as Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, as Clinton put it, he was ``a great patriot and a
truly fine human being.''
</P>
<P>

   ``A lot of so-called conservatives today don't know what the
word means,'' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. ``They think

slightly outside politics, yet created a permanent change in it.

   Yet Goldwater has had his effect on British politics as surely
as if he had been born and raised in the East End. He began the
wave of reaction that crashed on to our shores in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to make politics what it is now in Britain and
America, which is why so many found such kind things to say about a
man once regarded as a lunatic. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ He opposed restrictions on abortion, supported gays
in the military and thought Pat Robertson's religious right was a
bunch of ``kooks.'' To hear the television news and read the
obituaries, you might have thought that Barry Goldwater was a
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the right-wing senator from Arizona who died on Friday
was a liberal, in many of the ways that the word is used in
Britain. He was in the Manchester tradition, a foe of government
intervention and an individualist.
</P>
<P>
   In America being a liberal means being something else _ a friend
of the state _ and so Goldwater's lifelong crusade was against
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   But in his later years he found himself often at odds with the
Republican Party, over abortion, school prayers and gay rights, as
they became more authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ease with which the mainstream media in America
slid into eulogy was slightly disturbing. ``Barry Goldwater was a
politician who stood by his own salty views,'' the New York Times
said in an editorial, failing to point out that it had long
regarded most of these salty views as a grave threat to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He had, after all, saltily suggested using low-yield nuclear
weapons in Vietnam. Saltily, he had voted against the 1964 Civil
Rights Act which started to dismantle apartheid in America's South.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth of the reaction from President Bill Clinton to
Goldwater's death was also slightly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   When Goldwater ran in 1964, as the Washington Post pointed out,
he was regarded as ``a demagogue and a leader of right-wing
extremists and fascists who was likely to lead the United States
into nuclear war, eliminate civil rights progress and destroy such
social welfare programs as Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, as Clinton put it, he was ``a great patriot and a
truly fine human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the mellowing of opinion towards
Goldwater is that he remained in favor of personal choice, while
the fanatics of the religious right were colonizing conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of so-called conservatives today don't know what the
word means,'' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. ``They think
I've turned liberal because I believe a woman has a right to an
abortion. That's a decision that's up to a pregnant woman, not up
to the Pope or some do-gooders or the religious right.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Sometimes in science, things do not happen singly, but
come along in threes, like buses. Earlier this week the giant
agribusiness company Monsanto announced that it has worked out how
to generate cotton that is naturally blue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clinical trials with people in Baltimore have shown
that a genetically-engineered potato can confer resistance to
``traveller's diarrhea'' caused by varieties of the E.coli
bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in this week's science journal ``Nature,'' a team from
the University of Exeter announce that it has finally worked out
how plants produce vitamin C _ opening the way, it says, to
genetically-engineered versions of the fruit which produce far
greater amounts of such useful vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are increasingly able to map out the locations of
every gene in a plant or bacterium, and they are increasingly sure
what each of those genes does, and how they interact.
</P>
<P>
   At the more complex level of the functioning bacterium, plant or
_ ultimately _ human being, our knowledge is also advancing in
leaps and bounds. So new applications, such as the three listed
above, are becoming almost routine. Scarcely a day goes by without
some announcement from a company involved with genes.
</P>
<P>
   But while gene-jeans may excite casual interest, the real focus
is on altering plants so that they will become truly useful
``factories'' for chemicals such as vaccines; or simply making them
more fertile, so that the same land area can feed the
ever-expanding number of mouths in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, the first of those applications could cut through
many of the problem of immunization in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having to organize widespread campaigns involving
injections _ with all the attendant problems of sterilization and
distribution of syringes and refrigerated vaccines _ health workers
would simply provide genetically-engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   By eating the produce, people would immunize themselves against
diseases such as hepatitis, malaria and rabies, and childhood
diseases such as diphtheria, rubella, and measles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Exeter team's unravelling of the ``chemical
pathway'' by which plants make vitamin C is a key advance which
ends a 40-year search.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run it means, if people so wish, that we can
genetically engineer plants to have altered vitamin C content. That
has potential benefits in both nutrition and for the ability of
plants to withstand various kinds of environmental stresses that
would normally reduce crop yield,'' said Nicholas Smirnoff, a
lecturer in plant biochemistry who led the research at Exeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we made our discovery it was essentially impossible to
do that, but now we know the pathway, we can identify the genes
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year they should be able to begin experiments to
genetically boost the vitamin C content of fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``edible vaccines'' is not limited to academia,
though. It is big business. Among them is Cambridge-based Axis
Genetics, which is working on a number of schemes to coax vaccines
out of transgenic plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two main approaches,'' said Iain Cubitt, chief
executive of Axis Genetics. ``First, engineer viruses that normally
attack plants so they put proteins from disease-causing organisms
on their surface, so that the plants produce a vaccine to them.
Secondly, engineer the plants to make the vaccine directly. Most of
that work has been done in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment with genetically-engineered potatoes, by the
Boise Thompson Institute of Cornell University, New York, is one
outgrowth of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken five or six years to reach this stage,'' said Dr.
Cubitt. ``Now, our main business is producing vaccines from
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing that requires a three-way understanding of genes and
organisms. Immunization essentially teaches the body to watch out
for particular proteins found on the ``coats'' of unwanted bacteria
or viruses. This means that rather than injecting the whole
organism, a particular protein can be identified which will serve
to alert the body of an infection.
</P>
<P>
   If you can work out which gene makes the required protein, then
you are just one step away from your target; all you need to do is
find a way for your required plant to make it, by adding the gene
to the plant in such a way that it is ``expressed'' in the fruit,
skin or other useful part.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, this is one area where the small start-ups _ often
outgrowths of academic research _ have an advantage over the big
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big companies aren't involved yet, because I think they
have been cynical about doing things with plants,'' said Dr.
Cubitt.
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are being made with standard crops: already,
just 15 crop plants provide 90 percent of the world's food energy. &QL;

 By REGINALD DALE  
 c.1998 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How long can the U.S. economy keep up its
world-beating dynamism of the past six years? Ask an economist, and
you will probably hear a lot about inflation, interest rates and
exuberant financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ask someone who runs a business today, and the reply will be
very different. The chances are you will be told that the Achilles'
heel of America's economic performance is a growing shortage of
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   More and more companies, particularly those using the most
advanced technologies, say they are cutting back expansion plans _
or transferring some operations abroad _ because they simply cannot
find enough workers with the requisite skills in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in business believe the shortage threatens not just
the current economic expansion but America's continuing domination
of the computer and software technologies that will be crucial to
prosperity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from this angle, a better way of putting the question might
be: How long can a country whose high school students score so
poorly in mathematics and science hope to retain world
technological leadership?
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects virtually every kind of business. According
to a report just published by the Council on Competitiveness, a
private, nonpartisan policy forum in Washington, there is ``an
acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens
the foundation of American competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Labor Department official likes to point out that
nearly half of America's high school graduates do not have the math
skills necessary to get a job in a modern auto plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage is most acute in the information-technology
industry, where estimates of unfilled vacancies run into the
hundreds of thousands. According to one industry leader, the
unemployment rate in electrical engineering is a rock-bottom 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are two obvious ways of meeting the demand: Train more
Americans or hire skilled workers from abroad. But neither is very
easy.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton is threatening to veto a bill passed by
the Senate that would increase the number of visas granted to
high-technology workers from places such as India, Russia and
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions complain, unreasonably, that the legislation risks
discriminating against American workers and holding wages down.
With somewhat greater justification, they accuse employers of
wanting only to hire young workers trained in the latest
techniques, often straight from colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the unions ought to be able to see that it makes more sense
to bring the foreigners to America than to move the jobs to the
foreigners. U.S. companies should both be allowed to recruit the
best of the foreigners, before they are snatched up by rival
companies, and be encouraged to help train more Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, according to the Council on Competitiveness, the
United States has an aging work force and a youth population that
is ``largely unprepared'' for highly skilled work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coming years,'' the council says, ``new entrants to the
work force will present an even tougher challenge: They are
projected to be the least prepared and the most ethnically,
racially, and gender diverse in history.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also widespread agreement among experts that the
American school system is not good enough at teaching the skills
needed by industry, nor at inculcating the ambition to excel in
science and math. Many young people are more interested in what
they see as get-rich-quick careers in entertainment or sports.
</P>
<P>
   Business is not doing enough either _ training expenditure per
worker appears to have fallen in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Council on Competitiveness says it is still not too late
to confront the skills challenge. The important thing is to tackle
it now, while the economy is still booming. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ How long can the U.S. economy keep up its
world-beating dynamism of the past six years? Ask an economist, and
you will probably hear a lot about inflation, interest rates and
exuberant financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ask someone who runs a business today, and the reply will be
very different. The chances are you will be told that the Achilles'
heel of America's economic performance is a growing shortage of
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   More and more companies, particularly those using the most
advanced technologies, say they are cutting back expansion plans _
or transferring some operations abroad _ because they simply cannot
find enough workers with the requisite skills in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in business believe the shortage threatens not just
the current economic expansion but America's continuing domination
of the computer and software technologies that will be crucial to
prosperity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from this angle, a better way of putting the question might
be: How long can a country whose high school students score so
poorly in mathematics and science hope to retain world
technological leadership?
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects virtually every kind of business. According
to a report just published by the Council on Competitiveness, a
private, nonpartisan policy forum in Washington, there is ``an
acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens
the foundation of American competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Labor Department official likes to point out that
nearly half of America's high school graduates do not have the math
skills necessary to get a job in a modern auto plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage is most acute in the information-technology
industry, where estimates of unfilled vacancies run into the
hundreds of thousands. According to one industry leader, the
unemployment rate in electrical engineering is a rock-bottom 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are two obvious ways of meeting the demand: Train more
Americans or hire skilled workers from abroad. But neither is very
easy.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton is threatening to veto a bill passed by
the Senate that would increase the number of visas granted to
high-technology workers from places such as India, Russia and
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions complain, unreasonably, that the legislation risks
discriminating against American workers and holding wages down.
With somewhat greater justification, they accuse employers of
wanting only to hire young workers trained in the latest
techniques, often straight from colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the unions ought to be able to see that it makes more sense
to bring the foreigners to America than to move the jobs to the
foreigners. U.S. companies should both be allowed to recruit the
best of the foreigners, before they are snatched up by rival
companies, and be encouraged to help train more Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, according to the Council on Competitiveness, the
United States has an aging work force and a youth population that
is ``largely unprepared'' for highly skilled work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coming years,'' the council says, ``new entrants to the
work force will present an even tougher challenge: They are
projected to be the least prepared and the most ethnically,
racially, and gender diverse in history.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also widespread agreement among experts that the
American school system is not good enough at teaching the skills
needed by industry, nor at inculcating the ambition to excel in
science and math. Many young people are more interested in what
they see as get-rich-quick careers in entertainment or sports.
</P>
<P>
   Business is not doing enough either _ training expenditure per
worker appears to have fallen in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Council on Competitiveness says it is still not too late
to confront the skills challenge. The important thing is to tackle
it now, while the economy is still booming. &QL;

 McNALLY EPISODE RAISES TOUGH ISSUES  
 By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Threats to burn down a theater, kill the staff and
``exterminate'' a playwright will get people's attention every
time. Last week's firestorm over the cancellation and subsequent
reinstatement of Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi'' at New
York's Manhattan Theater Club was felt strongly across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a heated exercise in spontaneous public
discourse. Ignorance played as big a role as passion in the
``Corpus Christi'' affair, which left the MTC scraping egg from its
blushing face, turned the playwright into a unwitting hero of
artistic freedom, and raised all sorts of fears that intimidation
could be a successful strategy to influence what gets seen and what
doesn't on stage.
</P>
<P>
   With the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights squared
off against a squadron of outraged playwrights and the National
Coalition Against Censorship, ``Corpus Christi'' was once and
forever politicized. Will anyone be able to see McNally's play,
once it gets on, without thinking of it as a theatrical equivalent
to Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what the play actually portrays or whether it
succeeds artistically. The play-that-got-banned label, inaccurate
as it is, will both enhance and obscure its reception.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished play, according to those who have read a draft,
deals with a modern-day Jesus figure named Joshua who is gay and
has sex with his disciples. ``I'm not Jesus,'' the character points
out. ``I'm Joshua.'' Producer Jonathan Reinis of San Francisco's
Theatre on the Square, who's read the play, terms it a comedy that
``could be very, very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Theater Club, a vital off-Broadway house, pulled
the show from its fall season May 21, then reversed its decision a
week later. ``Corpus Christi'' will proceed, with security
measures, although the opening date has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic group disavowed the threats of violence but strongly
protested the play. Tony Kushner, Wendy Wasserstein and a host of
other big-gun playwrights decried MTC's original decision to cancel
the play. Athol Fugard threatened to pull a forthcoming play from
the MTC's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Before the reinstatement, offers by Reinis, the Berkeley
Repertory Theatre and the Eureka Theatre to produce the play in the
Bay Area symbolized the theater community's vigilance when it comes
to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let these people win,'' Berkeley Rep Artistic
Director Tony Taccone said of those who issued the anonymous
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Taccone acknowledged that McNally's play was not likely to
premiere in Berkeley and even said the playwright wasn't his ``cup
of tea entirely,'' but he said the show of solidarity was
important.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the to-do over the play wouldn't have hurt at the box
office. The enduring irony about artistic protests in the modern
world is that they're often great publicity.
</P>
<P>
   One striking aspect of the controversy was how little anyone on
either side actually knew as events unfolded. Few if any of the
work's opponents had read the play they vowed to shut down. And
until MTC artistic director Lynne Meadow held a press conference
Thursday, no one charging the theater with ``censorship'' knew the
details of the threats that led her to cancel the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for both sides to judge,'' said Carey Perloff,
artistic director of the American Conservatory Theater in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Perloff spoke from experience. In 1992, a group called Catholics
for Truth and Justice lobbied hard against ACT's production of
Dario Fo's ``The Pope and the Witch,'' which presented an
irreverent portrait of the head of the Catholic church. There were
no death threats then, but the protesters struck hard at the
lifeline of the company by trying to influence funders.
</P>
<P>
   Perloff sympathized with both Meadow's anguish and the reaction
of those angered by the theater's initial capitulation. ``It's an
awful, awful situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson learned from ``The Pope and the Witch'' mess, she
said, was clear. ``The most important thing is to demysitfy the
play. The more we put the media beam on it and did symposia and
answered phone calls, the less virulent the attacks became.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen with ``Corpus Christi.'' The protests and
threats, the cancellation, outrage and reversal, came in a blur.
Suspicion, second-guessing, rebukes and heavy rhetoric took over.
</P>
<P>
   Taccone, speaking just after the decision to reinstate ``Corpus
Christi'' was made, did find a bit of fatalist humor in the
situation. ``The play will probably open and get creamed by the
critics,'' he said, ``and be a huge hit with the public.''

   ROME _ The resignation of President Suharto under intense
pressure from popular demonstrations and finally from the military,
which holds the keys of power, is a great step forward for
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was against his will, Suharto's peaceful departure
from power nonetheless crowned decades of great accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although gravely marred by the last 15 years or so of rampant
corruption, forcible suppression of opposition and brutal,
imperialistic expansion in East Timor, the overall record of
Suharto's administration is, nonetheless, admirable.
</P>
<P>
   He and his American-educated technocrats transformed a nation
that was literally bankrupt, with people on the verge of mass
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto stepped down, the people of Indonesia's 13,000-odd
islands were generally well off and better educated; they spoke the
national language, as well as their own, widely divergent tongues;
they no longer groaned under the oppression of the Javanese, the
domineering natives of the largest island, and they truly felt
themselves citizens of a nation whose motto is ``unity out of
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the voice of the people has been decisive. No
transfer of power in the former East Indies' thousands of years of
history as an empire or as a congeries of principalities had ever
before been determined by the public's wishes. Certainly no
transfer of power in Indonesia's 50 years as a nominal republic had
occurred peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Wits used to say that Indonesia was the most stable nation in
Asia, perhaps the entire world _ after all, it had had only two
presidents in half a century, Sukarno and Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   That jape was inspired by the constant upheavals, the unceasing
strife and the suffering that tormented Indonesia under the
grandiose Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
   To truly appreciate Suharto it is necessary to have seen the
catastrophic effects of Sukarno's government and the extraordinary
circumstances under which Suharto came to power in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno was the most glamorous, if not necessarily the most
effective, leader of the revolution that overthrew Dutch rule. He
was also the most flamboyant, parading his sexual exploits.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian people were at first delighted by the great man
as irresistible demagogue and, alternately, as lovable scamp. They
greatly enjoyed his antics, although the two or three complaisant
young women provided by local governments every night of his state
visits usually left the next morning unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1960s Sukarno's disregard for almost everything
except his own glory had produced acute material distress in
Indonesia, which had endured several abortive revolts against him,
one sponsored by the CIA. He was not only a stalking horse for the
Communists, but a wastrel who scattered the national wealth like
confetti.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1965, Sukarno joined the Communist Party and the air
force in what looked like a coup against himself. He was actually
seeking to regain the power the anti-Communist army had taken away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   The coup opened with an assassination plot against the ranking
army generals. Aside from the chief of staff, who did not want
supreme power, Suharto was the only important general to survive.
He had clambered over his garden wall, just escaping the assassins.
The most junior general the night of the murders, he assumed power
as the most senior still living.
</P>
<P>
   Although Suharto was party to the army's vengeful and merciless
extermination of several hundred thousand presumed leftists, his
normal style was wholly different from Sukarno's. His unpretentious
jeep even stopped at red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno built a tall white pillar topped by a golden flame,
formally the National Monument but universally known as Sukarno's
last erection. Suharto's monuments are broad boulevards lined by
office buildings and hotels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by overseas Chinese strategists and financiers,
Suharto's technocrats, the Berkeley mafia, built a largely
laissez-faire economy that spread benefits throughout the islands.
Jakarta, the capital, benefited most.
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw the city in the mid-1950s there were no hotels,
no taxis, no dialing telephones, no supermarkets and few
automobiles, restaurants or stores. All those appurtenances of
modernity, as well as air conditioning, now exist in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Alienated by power and sycophants from reality and
responsibility, Suharto subsequently fostered corruption and
looting of wealth all but unparalleled in Asia or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has left Indonesia with the physical and the
psychological basis for much greater modern growth. &QL;

<P>
   For the first time the voice of the people has been decisive. No
transfer of power in the former East Indies' thousands of years of
history as an empire or as a congeries of principalities had ever
before been determined by the public's wishes. Certainly no

occurred peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Wits used to say that Indonesia was the most stable nation in
Asia, perhaps the entire world _ after all, it had had only two
presidents in half a century, Sukarno and Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   That jape was inspired by the constant upheavals, the unceasing
strife and the suffering that tormented Indonesia under the
grandiose Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
   To truly appreciate Suharto it is necessary to have seen the
catastrophic effects of Sukarno's government and the extraordinary
circumstances under which Suharto came to power in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno was the most glamorous, if not necessarily the most
effective, leader of the revolution that overthrew Dutch rule. He
was also the most flamboyant, parading his sexual exploits.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian people were at first delighted by the great man
as irresistible demagogue and, alternately, as lovable scamp. They
greatly enjoyed his antics, although the two or three complaisant
young women provided by local governments every night of his state
visits usually left the next morning unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1960s Sukarno's disregard for almost everything
except his own glory had produced acute material distress in
Indonesia, which had endured several abortive revolts against him,
one sponsored by the CIA. He was not only a stalking horse for the
Communists, but a wastrel who scattered the national wealth like
confetti.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1965, Sukarno joined the Communist Party and the air
force in what looked like a coup against himself. He was actually
seeking to regain the power the anti-Communist army had taken away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   The coup opened with an assassination plot against the ranking
army generals. Aside from the chief of staff, who did not want
supreme power, Suharto was the only important general to survive.
He had clambered over his garden wall, just escaping the assassins.
The most junior general the night of the murders, he assumed power
as the most senior still living.
</P>
<P>
   Although Suharto was party to the army's vengeful and merciless
extermination of several hundred thousand presumed leftists, his
normal style was wholly different from Sukarno's. His unpretentious
jeep even stopped at red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno built a tall white pillar topped by a golden flame,
formally the National Monument but universally known as Sukarno's
last erection. Suharto's monuments are broad boulevards lined by
office buildings and hotels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by overseas Chinese strategists and financiers,
Suharto's technocrats, the Berkeley mafia, built a largely
laissez-faire economy that spread benefits throughout the islands.
Jakarta, the capital, benefited most.
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw the city in the mid-1950s there were no hotels,
no taxis, no dialing telephones, no supermarkets and few
automobiles, restaurants or stores. All those appurtenances of
modernity, as well as air conditioning, now exist in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Alienated by power and sycophants from reality and
responsibility, Suharto subsequently fostered corruption and
looting of wealth all but unparalleled in Asia or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has left Indonesia with the physical and the
psychological basis for much greater modern growth. &QL;

   ROME _ The resignation of President Suharto under intense
pressure from popular demonstrations and finally from the military,
which holds the keys of power, is a great step forward for
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was against his will, Suharto's peaceful departure
from power nonetheless crowned decades of great accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although gravely marred by the last 15 years or so of rampant
corruption, forcible suppression of opposition and brutal,
imperialistic expansion in East Timor, the overall record of
Suharto's administration is, nonetheless, admirable.
</P>
<P>
   He and his American-educated technocrats transformed a nation
that was literally bankrupt, with people on the verge of mass
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto stepped down, the people of Indonesia's 13,000-odd
islands were generally well off and better educated; they spoke the
national language, as well as their own, widely divergent tongues;
they no longer groaned under the oppression of the Javanese, the
domineering natives of the largest island, and they truly felt
themselves citizens of a nation whose motto is ``unity out of

TOYOTA'S 1998 LAND CRUISER IS BEST OF THE SUVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best has just gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities getting any
better than it was, but that's what happened when Toyota redesigned
the Land Cruiser for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is the vehicle that has set the standard for
sport-utilities since the previous generation debuted in 1991, even
against such tough and capable competition as the Range Rover and
Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   But for 1998, Toyota has raised the bar to a level that will be
hard for any manufacturer to match, let alone top.
</P>
<P>
   The new Land Cruiser _ which also comes in a Lexus version
called the LX 470 _ now has a 4.7-liter, 32-valve,
double-overhead-cam V-8 engine replacing the previous generation's
inline six.
</P>
<P>
   That engine cranks out 230 horsepower, an increase of 18, and
develops 320 foot-pounds of torque, up 45 from last year. This
all-new engine is based on the V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 sedan,
but it's significantly modified to produce better low-speed torque
for trailer-towing and off-road hill-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds, an
improvement of two seconds over last year's model. That's quite
impressive for a vehicle that weighs 5,225 pounds empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is slightly better than last year, even with the
power increase. EPA ratings are 14 miles per gallon in the city and
16 on the highway, above average for a large sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser is first and foremost a great luxury wagon,
suitable for the most formal of occasions at the country club. But
what makes it so unusual in the sport-utility field is that it's
also a great performer off the beaten path. In fact, it's the
best-performing off-road vehicle on the market, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, with a base price of $46,397 and a tricked-out sticker
of $52,025, it's not likely many owners will put the Land Cruiser
to the test on serious off-road routes such as California's
legendary Rubicon Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these vehicles will answer the call of the wild. A
lot of people buy the Land Cruiser for hunting and other sporting
purposes, and these people appreciate having a vehicle that won't
get stuck in the mud or sand.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't extensively tested the new Land Cruiser off-road yet,
but I have driven the previous generation on some of the wildest
trails in the nation, including those in the Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park in California and the Scott's Gulf Pocket Wilderness
along the Caney Fork River in Tennessee's Cumberland Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And on those excursions, I've used the Land Cruiser to pull a
few Jeeps out of some sticky spots that posed no challenge to the
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   On or off the road, the new Land Cruiser's ride is pure luxury,
much smoother and quieter than before. That's due in part to the
new independent front suspension and the vehicle's structural
rigidity, which has been increased 50 percent over the previous
version.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel drive is a full-time system with high and low
ranges, as before. And with the optional locking rear differential
($410), a must for serious off-roading, this is the most capable
drivetrain available for either on- or off-road driving.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features abound, including automatic climate control,
four-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel antilock brakes that
work even with the transmission in low range, premium
AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo, rear heater, power windows/door
locks/mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, heated outside
mirrors, dual front air bags, keyless entry, power adjustable front
seats and automatic headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space has been increased from last year, giving
passengers more head, leg and shoulder room. Additionally, the
doors and rear hatch are larger for easier entry and loading. And
as before, the Land Cruiser seats up to eight people with the
optional third seat ($1,100).
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our test vehicle included luxurious leather seats
($1,820), power moon roof ($1,155), a roof luggage rack ($449), and
running boards ($595), which I would decline if I were planning to
do much off-roading. Running boards are the first thing to go when
the going gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   Crashworthiness has been increased dramatically over the
previous Land Cruiser, Toyota officials say. The ladder frame now
has nine cross members, instead of six, and the chassis side rails
have collapsible, energy-absorbing ends.
</P>
<P>
   Land Cruisers can pull trailers of up to 6,500 pounds with a
tongue weight of up to 650 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As an aid for extended cruising, the fuel tank holds 25.4
gallons.

IN MIDDLE-AGED CIRCLES, VIAGRA INSPIRES HOPE, JOKES _ AND A BLACK
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For weeks, my friends and I have been
talking about it, usually in hushed tones around back tables in
restaurants. We don't want others to overhear us pondering the
possibilities of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we need it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly
accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore
youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination
and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age,''
says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington. ``But now I hear about
Viagra, and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four-year-old John ``Zonk'' Lanzillo of Richardson also
ponders whether Viagra might be in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it now, but I'm wondering if I might not need it
next year,'' he says. ``What the heck does it really do, and
where'd it come from in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's genesis at Pfizer Labs is humorous, really.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally tested as a medication for high blood
pressure, with little success. But it had a pleasant side effect,
which left the men in the initial test run begging to keep their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that 52 percent of men between 40 and 70
have some problem with ED, which is short for erectile
dysfunction,'' explains a Pfizer sales representative who asked not
to be identified. ``Viagra stimulates blood flow, which allows a
stronger erection. Obviously there is great public interest in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth internist Dr. Kelly Goss first heard about Viagra
three months ago, when a urologist friend called him with a tip.
``(He) said to buy Pfizer stock, because Viagra was going to be a
home run,'' Goss says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hears about little else. Goss and many other Tarrant
County practitioners are inundated with visits from middle-aged
male patients they haven't heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about everything else, and then they finally say,
`Oh, by the way ...''' Goss says. ``They think that if they get
Viagra, they're going to feel like they're 16 again.'' But rumors
about Viagra's capabilities, Goss says, are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give you erections automatically,'' he says. ```If
you get aroused, it helps you keep an erection. But if you have
other problems, psychological problems, it's not going to help with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra mythology is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that if you don't have any problem, if you don't need
Viagra but take it anyway, that you stay ready to go for hours and
hours,'' muses 51-year-old Bill Clarkson of Fort Worth. ``Man,
think about it. Wouldn't that be great?''
</P>
<P>
   And if that ``ready to go'' state extended into the next day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Clarkson says, ``Can you think of a better reason to
call the boss and say you can't come in to work?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Goss notes, priapism is not one of Viagra's potential
side effects. For some users, headaches are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cause a real turnaround,'' Goss says. ``Things will
change from the wife saying, `Not tonight, honey, I've got a
headache,' to the man saying, `Honey, I've got my headache, so
let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billings is more concerned with the fact that the pill doesn't
work instant magic. ``They say you're supposed to take it an hour
ahead of time. I mean, if it's late at night, I'm not sure I can
stay awake a whole hour. Don't they have one that works after five
minutes? And that hour between taking it and using it? Doesn't that
assume your wife is going to stay in the mood that long? What if
you have an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Various newswires have reported Viagra black markets springing
up worldwide. In Tokyo, the football-shaped tablets are said to
bring $40 a pop. Americans seem willing to pay $20 for pills that
cost $8-$10 apiece if prescribed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'd pay $20,'' Clarkson concedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer sales representative reports that he and his
colleagues are regularly approached when they make sales calls on
Tarrant County doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer ``gave us these satchels with `VIAGRA' printed on the
side,'' he says. ``We've had to start carrying them with the other
side of the satchel facing out. Men see that word, `Viagra,' and
they just want to have some.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fort Worth urologist heard that Viagra salesmen have even
faced impromptu muggings. Goss reports that Pfizer reps insist on
dropping Viagra samples directly on the doctor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rumored Tarrant County black market. There are
whispers that in certain men's rooms in the hospital district, 50-
and 100-milligram pills can be had by asking the right gentlemen
loitering near the urinals. But a quick check found no one
``holding'' in a hospital toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inspiration struck. If dealers exist, what could be more
prime territory than the Colonial golf tournament for large groups
of middle-aged men with readily disposable income?
</P>
<P>
   Stationing myself by the Porta Potties behind various greens, I
sidled up to selected gentlemen in the 40-to-70 age group and
hissed, ``Hey, anybody around here got any Viagra?''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they all said they had no idea. To a man, they all
asked me to tell them if I did find somebody with a tablet or two
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Goss says he hasn't yet heard from irate wives. But he expects
he will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be married women who've gotten very
comfortable with limited sex lives,'' he says. ``So if I give
Viagra to their husbands, all of a sudden their routines could be
radically changed, and they might not be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer salesman believes most wives would be pleased that
his company's product made its way into their husbands'
bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, think about it for people who've been married a long
time, like for 25 years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzillo feels inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did take one, I wouldn't tell my wife,'' he says,
chuckling. ``I'd want it to be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get Viagra in Tarrant County through the
obvious legal means. Doctors are free to prescribe it. But that
doesn't mean they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from patients,'' says Dr. Bill Vance, a Fort
Worth cardiologist. ``In many cases they're on medication, and they
want to know if they can take Viagra, too. Well, you can't take
Viagra if you're on nitro(glycerin). Frequently, heart patients on
nitroglycerin need to take their nitro after vigorous physical
exercise _ one of those classic events is intercourse. But if
they've taken Viagra beforehand, then afterward if they have chest
pain, they can't take their nitroglycerin.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vance says, there already are medical jokes about
other poor chemical mixes with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one,'' he offers. ``The joke is, you can't take Viagra
if you take iron supplements because of the tremendous danger that,
when aroused, you'll immediately turn to the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss says that a lot more patients ask for Viagra than really
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, for men a certain age, just having it around offers
some security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Viagra has come along at just the right moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Clarkson says. ``Frank Sinatra just died.
Mickey Mantle is dead. When our heroes die, middle-age men are
reminded they're going to die, too. Viagra's a way of holding back
the clock a little.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I score Viagra. One doctor gives me a five-pill
sample box and a prescription for five tablets. Another doctor
gives me two boxes of samples, and a casual acquaintance who works
near the hospital district passed along a much-handled, grubby blue
tablet. He says it was one of three a male nurse sold him a few
days earlier for the negotiated price of $12 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this my birthday and Christmas present to you for the
next 10 years,'' he says, and I stash my Viagra in a dresser
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a friend of mine said when I asked him why he decided
to buy a handgun and keep it in his bedroom closet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to ever need it, but it gives me such a warm
feeling to know it's right there if I do.''

UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN'T GONE HOLLYWOOD, BUT STILL THE KING OF
COUNTRY MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of
Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for
George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a
thin folder with a small batch of articles.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, she said. What year is this?
</P>
<P>
   No, she was told, that's it: total. All the press on the man who
then, as now, was one of the most popular singers in country music.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most
popular boxed sets of all time. Strait is selling out football
stadiums nationwide, averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing
any press or TV _ The New York Times, David Letterman, Jay Leno and
even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been
firmly, but politely, told no.
</P>
<P>
   And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West,
Strait's longtime publicist. ``Garth generates 2 inches of press in
15 seconds. George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as
the media goes. He doesn't do anything. And he doesn't make
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the dichotomy of Strait's career. At 46, the Pearsall,
Texas, native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone
cowboy. His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help
him fill the largest venues in America, but he can still slip out
of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas
rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts stay firmly starched. The little half-smile stays
put. The gaze stays steady. The hat stays on. The music stays pure
honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing. The
deep, water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up
as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This
year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy
Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including
Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Strait, West says, stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and
Sundays only so he can fly home (he has a home in San Antonio and a
ranch somewhere in South Texas) on his private plane for several
days each week.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on
Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and
spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than
25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even
as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top
Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth
Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year
_ but Strait, amazingly, has sold as well in the '90s as in the
'80s, when he burst into prominence. The soundtrack to the 1992
movie ``Pure Country'' sold 5 million copies. Since that year,
Strait has been the 10th-most-popular musical act of any genre.
</P>
<P>
   This appears more phenomenal considering Strait's low media
profile. After years as a bar musician (he was discovered in 1981
while based in San Marcos) and spending the '80s playing hundreds
of dates per year as his national popularity grew, Strait long ago
found his own balance between personal and professional.
</P>
<P>
   He will not tour till he drops, and several years ago ended his
annual New Year's Eve show at Dallas' Reunion Arena to spend the
night at home with his family. He will not curry favor with
Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock
stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just
a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD. He will
sell as well as he does playing by his rules, and that will be
that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country''
(in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!),
he was deluged with movie offers: a sequel, other roles, big money.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned them all down, she says, because he simply didn't
want to make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did `Pure Country' because he got a script he liked, he
could do it in Texas, and he had some time off,'' she says. ``It
was relatively painless. But it wasn't because he wanted to give
his career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked about this casually. His life's been consistent
and steady, and he really values that. How much longer is Bubba
going to be at home? He doesn't want to be on the road when his
son's growing up, and when he's ready to stay home, his son is out
of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait
for more than a decade; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait
you see in his simple videos is the genuine article. When not
onstage, she says, he's so unwilling to call attention to himself
that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in
one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first
saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in
1982. ``It's sincere. He's almost embarrassed when people ask for
his autograph. Obviously, he still loves the response _ but he
doesn't like to talk about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that
people now don't expect any details, juicy or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Strait is a total mystery. We know he grew up
in Pearsall; his parents separated when George was young; and he
and his older brother, Buddy, were raised by his father, John, a
math teacher and part-time rancher.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in
San Marcos, enlisted in the Army in 1971, and was in for three
years, stationed in Hawaii. That is where he began singing in a
band; when he returned to San Marcos (he graduated with a degree in
agriculture), he began playing bars, gradually becoming more and
more popular.
</P>
<P>
   And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981; his
first single for the label, ``Unwound,'' charted in early May, just
before he turned 29. His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released
that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs
such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look
So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 25, 1986, his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was
killed in a car accident near San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Strait's career has continued to prosper despite changing times;
he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the
Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four
times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and
hosts the George Strait Team Roping Classic each June in
Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was The Dog Incident: In 1996 his
Australian heeler, Buster, disappeared from his South Texas ranch.
Strait offered a reward, and half the state, it seems, went looking
for the dog. Buster was never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you about George's status in Texas,'' says West.
``You can't imagine the phone calls, the number of people thinking
they had found him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wheat, sound archivist for the Center for American History
at the University of Texas at Austin, says Strait ``appeals to
people who want at least a modicum of authenticity. People still
revere western culture, and authenticity is hard to find in country
music. He isn't trying to fit his music into pop music trends.
Country has folk music roots _ it's concerned with people's daily
lives _ and George is still in that camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sell himself as competing with rock bands. He knows
about ranching, and he doesn't get away from it and go live in Los
Angeles or Nashville. He's a quiet, strong, self-effacing
character. He holds himself back, and people appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda O'Brian, music director and assistant program director at
Dallas-Fort Worth radio station KSCS/96.3 FM, says Strait appeals
because he ``just seems so normal. Everything he does is done with
this quiet strength _ you don't think of him as having issues, so
people don't ask about him. They just want to meet him. Everybody
wants to meet him. He just has this really incredible sense of
self; the songs aren't by him, because he's not a songwriter, but
they sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   And thats, says old pal Clay Blaker, is the way Strait has
always been. The two met in 1976, when they were both playing bars
on the Austin/San Antonio/Houston circuit. Blaker's band did
``around 100'' shows with Strait's, and then Strait invited him
along as an opener in the '80s. Also, Strait has cut eight Blaker
songs, including ``She Lays It All on the Line'' on the ``Pure
Country'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm around him, he's the same old George to me,''
says Blaker. ``He's very nice and polite and shy. He's always
pretty much kept to himself, but he's very friendly to his friends.
And he has a lot of the same friends he had before he got a record
deal; that'll tell you something right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason he's still at the top of his game can be
attributed to you don't see him in magazines all the time or on TV
all the time; there's still a mystique about him that's a result of
the way he is. In today's market, there's so many people that are
so overexposed; you're a star for 15 minutes, and then you're gone.
He's a competitor, he takes his career real seriously, and he wants
to go out there and prove he can still cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, he still can. The question now is, how long
will Strait's career continue? Given what he's chosen to do and
chosen not to do, one can easily see him making one final, grand
gesture, one final release and series of concerts, and then
gracefully riding off into the sunset. It might be a lame metaphor
for many other singers, but not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an acknowledgement that this won't go on forever,''
says West. ``Eventually George will decide. It won't be decided for
him. He's the master of his universe; he controls his own fate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's very possible that, even at the very end, Strait will
be what he's always been: the lone figure on the plain, silent but
for the songs he sings, not feeling the need to talk to anyone
about his private life or career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine,'' says West
with a chuckle. ``He loves cigars, and he wants to do an interview.
I don't know if they'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people
on the cover _ but we're testing the waters. They haven't asked.''

ONE CRITIC'S DOGGED PURSUIT OF GEORGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GEORGE STRAIT-ESSAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Strait is elusive. Really elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, George Strait is so elusive, his press agent, Kay West
in Nashville, is essentially an answering machine. Since 1982, I've
left approximately 55 messages for Kay/George in pursuit of
interviews or information and received approximately five return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, nearly two decades of my life have been spent in
journalistic pursuit of this Sinatra of South Texas. To date, the
sum total of my efforts has been one (1) phone interview, in 1984,
and one (1) in-person interview, in 1992. And that's actually a
pretty good record for a Strait newshound; other longtime country
music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done
from George's ranch in South Texas, as he and the Ace in the Hole
Band were literally loading up to go on tour. He told me that, no
offense intended, he didn't much like doing interviews, and he
refused to use his free time to do them. He was tallying that
interview into his road time, he said, as though he'd punched a
time clock.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, I attended the Country Music Association
awards, when George won Male Vocalist honors for the first time. It
was his first major award. How'd he feel? asked the press. Pretty
good, said George.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, when he filmed his movie ``Pure Country'' in and around
Fort Worth, George was legendary. I watched the filming of the
concert sequence at Tarrant County Convention Center Arena, and was
invited by the movie company publicist to do a ``one-on-one'' with
George the following week.
</P>
<P>
   I went to an abandoned dance hall in Midlothian on the appointed
day and watched George walk up a dusty road in the early morning.
Then I watched George film a sequence inside the dance hall and was
surprised at how natural he seemed. The other actors goofed lines
and faced the wrong way, but George didn't. He occasionally made
suggestions and was minded when he did.
</P>
<P>
   I finally got my chance in late afternoon, after waiting around
all day. George went on his tour bus with wife Norma, and I was
invited to join them for 15 minutes, although we talked for more
than 45 minutes undisturbed. The press agent cautioned me not to
bring up personal matters. I promised I wouldn't, and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I found Norma to be outgoing and likeable, and George seemed to
appreciate how I made genuine friends with their dog, a Boston
terrier.
</P>
<P>
   George lounged in his seat, spoke in a languid, low drawl, and
cross-examined me with a flash of his green eyes on several
occasions. He was mildly confrontational if he thought I was
drawing the wrong conclusion. He stuck pretty much to business _
his music, the movie _ though he did touch on rodeoing and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign that there was tension to the interview was
George's constant toying with a piece of rope, tying slipknots.
He'd study the knot intensely for a few moments before answering
sometimes. Then, suddenly, he'd flash that silvery smile, and I'd
feel relief wash over me like the Frio River.
</P>
<P>
   I covered the world premiere of ``Pure Country'' in the fall of
'92, in San Antonio, and was invited to a sumptuous party
afterward. George made the rounds, without an entourage, and
blended in with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't bring myself to be pushy to this quiet, pleasant man
during such a lovely party. His manager eventually introduced us. I
said something really clever, like ``Nice to see you again; I liked
your movie,'' and he said something memorable like ``Well, thanks.
It's good to see you again, too.'' (He did, however, add that
little sideways half-smile, and I noticed that his eyes looked blue
in candlelight.)
</P>
<P>
   So, why don't I, and other spurned journalists, just write
George off and curse him as a prima donna jerk?
</P>
<P>
   Because I honestly believe that he isn't. He's uncomfortable
telling strangers personal details, and I believe he considers it
unseemly. George Strait does nothing for its press value, and in an
age when Naomi Judd jabbers publicly about whether daughter Ashley
wore underwear to a certain awards show, George remains a personal
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, maybe, just maybe, he's saving all his secrets to
divulge to me and me alone someday. Kay might give me a call back
to set it up, any day now.

ALL POLITICS IS ... FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``You write too much about politics,'' said a
woman who works the checkout stand in my grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it. I do. There are other things I enjoy in life, like
comedy, drama and heaps of money. Politics has it all, plus the
ability to reshape life _ or end human life on this planet.
</P>
<P>
   In what other field but politics would Al Checchi, an unknown
businessman who became a Democratic candidate for governor, spend
$40 million of his own money to become hated all over California?
</P>
<P>
   Some entrepreneur Checchi turned out to be. Bill Gates made $45
billion while becoming hated all over the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater died on Friday, and his death affected me a lot
more than I would have predicted when I was 18.
</P>
<P>
   He's the man who got me interested in politics, in a reverse
sort of way, when he sank himself in the 1964 presidential election
by saying, ``Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.''
Visions of mushroom clouds danced in voters' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we got Lyndon Johnson and a long, sad education in
napalm and street politics.
</P>
<P>
   The best man didn't win. On the other hand, we'll never know if
Goldwater would have found his place in history by ending history
with Gen. Curtis LeMay's nukes. Goldwater did better by losing, and
being remembered as the honorable man and true conservative he was.
</P>
<P>
   What I recall best is having to defend Johnson's brand of
liberalism in discussions with my conservative friends. Except for
civil rights, it wasn't easy. But they were discussions, not
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when conservatives and liberals still
talked, and were friends. Those were the days when people still
called themselves liberals, before liberals in Washington started
liberally killing kids in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days. Now almost everyone is a little
conservative and a little liberal, and hates being labeled. Maybe
these are better days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because these are better days that we can afford to
hate politics and concentrate on the finer things. Still, I don't
know why everyone hates politics. What's to hate besides the
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   It's a great spectator sport. It has to be at the national and
state level, because only those who can pony up big donations or
the family fortune can play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the higher entrance fees, politicians are smaller.
However, they're examined under bigger media magnifying glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress is a much smaller place than when Johnson and
Goldwater were there. When you speak of principles, the names
``Trent'' and ``Newt'' don't spring to mind.
</P>
<P>
   But for shtick political comedy, you can't beat car-alarm mogul
Darrell Issa running for Senate in California amid allegations he
stole cars as a youth, inflated his military record and once took a
gun into an office during a business transaction. His response was:
``Shots were never fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics is about the redistribution of wealth, and I'm not
talking about communism. Rich people distribute some wealth into
campaigns. Consultants distribute that money to themselves and
highly skilled makers of crummy TV ads designed to keep people from
voting.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, the politicians redistribute your income,
generally in the direction of the people who gave to them. It's
what you might call a closed system. It's closed to you.
</P>
<P>
   All politics is local, and probably more so than ever now that
national politics is all spin and dirt, and nothing washes.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative supposedly was invented to bring citizens
back into politics, but it's just added a new and more distasteful
meaning to the word ``proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   I like sitting in the bleachers of politics. I try not to do
endorsements. But when it comes to propositions, I sometimes do
disendorsements.
</P>
<P>
   In California's primary on Tuesday, please consider voting
against Proposition 226 and Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 226 is a trick to lock organized labor out of
politics. It would make unions get members' individual permission
to use their dues for campaign contributions, even though union
leaders are democratically elected. It further reduces the power of
working people, and ultimately will redistribute income to the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   If Proposition 226 were at all fair, it would make shareholders
sign off on corporate campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As for Proposition 227, vote against it not because bilingual
education in California is so wonderful, which it hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   Vote against it because it's an effort by one rich guy, Ron Unz,
to tell parents, teachers and local schools what to do with
children in the classroom. Teachers can be held financially liable
if they don't follow Unz's dictates about language.
</P>
<P>
   Who made him language god? Politics is supposed to be
entertaining. It isn't supposed to mess with kids' minds.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Jerry Brown teeters atop a table in an oakland cafe, his arms
akimbo like a jack-in-the-box. Surprise, it's me! It's early on a
Saturday morning, and droopy-eyed customers drift past him,
bellying up to the counter. But Brown won't be ignored.
 &HT;    ``Oakland has been on the verge of greatness for so long, it's
time to push it past the verge!'' he shouts as the black table
wobbles beneath him.
 &HT;    The cafe, called Brewberry's, is wedged between storefronts in
the city's working-class Laurel District, one of the most
integrated neighborhoods in one of the most diverse cities in the
country. Down the street are Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church,
Sun Sun Alterations and La Ultima Restaurant. Inside the coffee
shop, Brown, dressed in a black collarless shirt and black Gap
pants _ denounces the power of moneyed interests in politics and
``the old boys network.''
 &HT;    It's vintage Brown rhetoric. This time, however, the ``old
boys'' targeted by Brown are the blacks and Latinos who run
Oakland's City Hall.
 &HT;    A woman in stretch pants finally speaks up, asking him, ``Why do
you want the job?'' Brown leans toward her and shoots back,
``Because it will be a major contribution to political life in the
whole country.''
 &HT;    He promises to limit the influence of lobbyists, generate ``full
citizen participation'' in local government, enforce ``zero
tolerance for crime,'' improve the schools, stimulate development,
even spark a ``revitalized cultural life.'' Brown rhapsodizes about
``the power of ideas,'' then asks, ``Anybody want to offer an
idea?''
 &HT;    When no one steps forward, he promptly fills the void. ``Ideas
have to be tested in the crucible of reality,'' he exclaims.
``Oakland is the crucible of reality!''
 &HT;    Why does Brown want to be mayor of a largely nonwhite city of
just 388,000 people in which the post is a relatively weak one?
Since Oakland is known more for the size of its underclass (and its
embrace of Ebonics) than for the stature of its political leaders,
many observers have sneered that the mayor's office here is beneath
Brown.
 &HT;    But the pundits have it wrong. In Oakland, crime is down,
employment is up and there are signs of a long-delayed economic
boom _ creating the possibility of a showcase turnaround. Moreover,
at 60, how many more times can he mount unsuccessful bids for the
presidency? Following years of high-flying talk _ he has even been
a radio chat-show host lately _ Brown seems to want to ground
himself, at last, in Oakland.
 &HT;    If it's clear why Brown wants to be mayor, the motivations of
Oakland voters are murkier. Brown is almost always met with a mix
of familiarity and perplexity, the kind of reaction Mario Cuomo
might encounter if he decided to run for mayor of Poughkeepsie. In
front of Brewberry's picture window, an elderly Mexican-American
woman doubts that Brown will stay long at City Hall if he's
elected.
 &HT;    ``I worry about him winning and taking off,'' she says. A
middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic. ``The black
leadership hasn't accomplished much,'' she says flatly, creasing
her lips. ``Brown can change the whole picture. He's energetic,
dynamic. Besides, he's the Kennedy of California. The native son
can do what he wants, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Brown's celebrity may grab headlines, but that is far easier
than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade. And
even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to
pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor
Moonbeam _ simply isn't suited for the managerial challenges that
face urban mayors today.
 &HT;    Brown is a newcomer, having moved to Oakland in 1994. And this
is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white (43
percent are black, 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian). Not
surprisingly, his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper.
 &HT;    For much of its 146-year history, however, Oakland was run by a
clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors. In the
1970s, around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor
_ following in the footsteps of his father, Edmund G. Brown, who
held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther
Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives.
 &HT;    In 1977, Lionel Wilson, a judge, became the city's first black
mayor; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris, a black state
legislator. (Harris chose not to run for a third term this year.)
Against this backdrop, Brown's regular denunciations of
``mediocrity at City Hall'' during ``the past 20 years'' have hit a
nerve.
 &HT;    Exhibit A in Brown's brief against the status quo is the costly
deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the
Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum. (The
deal, aimed at giving the city's anemic economy a shot in the arm,
relied on inflated revenue estimates.) Brown has called for a
criminal investigation.
 &HT;    ``Brown's just playing to the cheapest seats,'' replies Mary
King, one of his key opponents in the mayoral race. King is a black
woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful
position of Alameda County Supervisor. At a public forum, she
vents, ``It's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a
governor! _ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother
on welfare of being too imbedded in the system.''
 &HT;    King places the blame for Oakland's economic collapse in the
1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry
Brown was governor. After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state
money for cities fell. An economic skid grew into a sustained
statewide recession, hitting Oakland particularly hard.
 &HT;    ``Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done
enough, for not having moved farther,'' King murmurs. ``But it's
been uphill all the way.''
 &HT;    King is clearly frustrated by Brown's popularity. ``People have
gotten caught up in a kind of 'white man's ice is colder'
syndrome,'' she says acidly.
 &HT;    Another of Brown's chief competitors is a member of the City
Council, Ignacio De La Fuente, an immigrant from Mexico who started
out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through
trade-union leadership ranks to become the city's first Latino vice
mayor. In a drive around the city, De La Fuente animatedly points
out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new
shopping center in his district, Fruitvale, in two decades.
 &HT;    ``Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire,'' he demands.
``Saying and doing are two different things. Jerry talks a good
line about development and creating jobs. But damn it, I've been
accomplishing what he only talks about.''
 &HT;    With California's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices
elsewhere, Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a
surfeit of affordable space. A decommissioned 422-acre Army base
will be conveyed to the city soon, another plum opportunity. There
are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport, fueling a
potential job surge. De La Fuente ticks off these facts, and winces
at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass.
 &HT;    ``I like Jerry,'' De La Fuente says. ``But he just doesn't have
the attention span to be mayor.''
 &HT;    If a person's home provides a window into his psyche, the $2
million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995
is a fascinating case study. Stretched over a quarter block of land
near Oakland's waterfront, it looks austere from the outside, a
vast expanse of corrugated steel.
 &HT;    Inside, there's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in, with a
garden outside for organic vegetables. It's where Brown's campaign
was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the
room. On the opposite side are two long wooden tables.
 &HT;    ``Here's the only thing about the whole place that matters to
me,'' Brown says, waving his hand. ``The monastic table _ to sit
there and have conversations.''
 &HT;    Brown's longtime friend, the French-born intellectual Jacques
Barzaghi, painted a large red circle in the center of the floor
downstairs _ ``to signify unity,'' he says, fingering his polished
prayer beads. Barzaghi, who has been part of Brown's inner circle
since his gubernatorial days, is a man with a gleaming shaved head
given to sudden proclamations. (``Life is good!'' he regularly
exclaims.)
 &HT;    Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs.
Brown sleeps in a room down the way, and other political supporters
and friends periodically bed down in the rest. (Brown's regular
date for the past eight years, Anne Gust, is general counsel for
the Gap; she maintains her own home in San Francisco.) It's not
your average Oakland politician's digs.
 &HT;    None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of
Brown's living in a commune, perhaps because his unconventionality
_ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for
president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long, vaguely
oracular phrases _ has become, after all these years, familiar to
Californians.
 &HT;    Reporters continue to poke fun, however. ``They write that I'm
quirky,'' he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. ``But the whole
thing I'm doing here is pure practical, nuts and bolts. You've been
around. Have you seen anything quirky?''
 &HT;    One afternoon in the warehouse, Brown pulls out a worn album
that his father kept under his bed. The tattered clippings
chronicle his father's early career. Jerry recites his father's
campaign slogan, laughing: ``'Crack down on crime, pick Brown this
time.' Boy, some things never change.''
 &HT;    His father was an avuncular, beloved politician of the old
school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the
state's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's. When the
younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960, he bided
his time at law school and a clerkship, waiting to begin his own
political hegira until 1969, three years after his father lost his
bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan.
 &HT;    ``The point I'm trying to make with all this,'' he says now, in
a kind of reverie as he pages through his father's scrapbook, ``is
that Edmund G. Brown, father and son, have been involved in
California politics since 1946. It's an unbroken chain.''
 &HT;    This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry
Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor's office while still in
his mid-30s, he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government
spending on infrastructure and social programs, the hallmark of his
father's career.
 &HT;    He openly decried ``the obvious manipulation and role-playing''
in his father's style of politics. Watching him embrace his
father's legacy so fully now, referring casually to their
similarities, you can see how agile he is, how strong his penchant
for reinvention.
 &HT;    Brown regularly touts his experience as governor, citing ``the
tremendous burst of creativity'' in state government during his
years as chief executive. But there's the other side of history too
_ notably, his reputation for poor administrative skills. ``He's
absolutely the worst administrator I've ever seen,'' says a former
member of his cabinet.
 &HT;    In any case, Brown himself admits that what's required
politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a
mayor. ``Being governor is much more abstract,'' Brown
acknowledges. ``This is upfront, in-your-face detail.''
 &HT;    Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to
slog through such details?
 &HT;    Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October, the media
had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by
Brown and titled ``Oakland Ecopolis: A Plan for a Green Plan.'' The
plan upbraided advocates of ``mere economic growth,'' envisioning
an ``ecologically friendly'' city where ``solar generators quietly
hum'' next to ``farm kiosks and craft bazaars.''
 &HT;    This spring, however, he reined himself in, talking almost
exclusively about crime, schools _ and economic development.
Pressed about this change, Brown bristles. ``I do want to do a
sustainability plan for Oakland,'' he says. ``It'll take a few
years to do it. But we'll work it in there.''
 &HT;    As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland's
reality, I ask, can he really set the city's political direction?
``Look, I could do something else _ like enjoy life,'' he says.
``There's everything here that I've ever cared about _ poverty,
environmental issues, labor, crime, schools, transportation. In a
concrete way, everything I've been concerned about in my entire
life is at issue in Oakland.''
 &HT;    Brown's capacity for reinvention could flourish, or founder, in
the pitted streets of Oakland. A mayor in a city like Oakland is
held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the
streets. With hopes raised high, the citizens of Oakland are
unlikely to cut him any slack once he's in office. Power seduces,
but it also stings.
 &HT;    Come next January, Jerry Brown had better know whom to call
about those potholes.

A TIP FOR NEW YORK CABBIES: GET SOME MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York City's 44,000 taxicab drivers are under
fire as an industry for driving recklessly and behaving crudely to
their passengers and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drivers _ some estimate 90 percent _ are immigrants,
mostly from South Asia, but also from the Caribbean and Latin
America. They came to the United States seeking a chance for a
better life than it was possible for them to have in their native
countries, as had so many immigrants before them. And, as for many
immigrants, the streets and buildings of New York City are where
they begin their ``pursuit of happiness'' on the lowest rungs of
the American economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   When immigrants try to make it in America, they almost always
have a hard time, doing the sort of jobs that those already on the
premises regard as beneath them. Today's immigrants are no
different. The cabbies among them quickly discover that driving in
New York City is a hard way to earn a living. Also dangerous.
Drivers are easy prey for petty criminals trying to pick up easy
money, thieves who often don't limit themselves to stealing, but
can be viciously violent.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as the crackdown on criminals produced
measurable success, the peril to pedestrians and taxi passengers
has increased dramatically as traffic accidents involving taxis
escalated 40 percent between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That's not real news to any one who has taken a cab in Manhattan
recently. With few exceptions, a taxi ride there has become an
unpleasant, breath-holding exercise to see whether you will
actually arrive at your destination undented and unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Cabs hurtle past one another, avoiding collisions, if they do
avoid them, by millimeters. They intimidate other drivers,
especially the poor civilians among them who ought to know just how
perilous it is to try to share street space with rambunctious
truckers and cabbies.
</P>
<P>
   Now cabbies in Manhattan traditionally have never been retiring
types, neither in their driving nor their vocabulary. So today's
drivers have a well-established base upon which to enlarge their
incivilities.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, taking a cab is a cruder experience today than
it used to be. In my last three dozen or so Manhattan cab rides, I
cannot recollect one ``thank you'' for a fine tip. You can't make
the argument that this behavior reflects a language problem,
because expressing thanks is not a matter of linguistic ability but
of cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cab drivers claim they don't know the way to where you
want to go _ one Israeli cabbie in Midtown said he did not know how
to get to the Waldorf _ often, apparently, because they do not deem
the destination would be rewarding enough for them. Others have
fits of annoyance when, luggage in hand, you turn out to be a fare
for the nearby railroad station rather than the distant airport.
They make their passengers fully aware with boorish remarks of
their discontent, although they are obliged by law to take you
where you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Taxis are a licensed public service properly subjected to
regulation and close monitoring. Reckless driving, smoking on the
job, arrogant behavior and rudeness are not civil rights, but are
rightly controlled by supervising authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives of the cabbies and some academic analysts
attribute the unacceptable behavior to how money made from driving
taxis is divided between owners of the cars and the people who
drive them. The drivers are under unrelenting pressure to make the
$120 or so they have to pay to rent the cab for a 12-hour shift
before they see any returns for themselves, usually ranging between
$60 and $80 a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers complain of passengers who demand greater speed,
although personally I have yet to meet such a person. Other cabbies
say they lead a dreadful life, not having the chance for timely
access to restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems should be addressed through the licensing
procedures in the same way that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has gotten
important reforms on liability insurance and raising the amount of
fines cabbies face for improper driving.
</P>
<P>
   There are many rights and wrongs to sort out in the clashing
contentions between drivers and owners, and between the $1.5
billion industry and the regulators. However, those issues remain
to be resolved, the riding public deserves to get safe service,
accompanied by professionally correct manners, for which they pay a
substantial fare.

RECALLING THE PASSION, SOUL OF BOBBY KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)      ``Some
people see things as they are and ask why. But I dream things that
never were and ask, why not?'' _ Robert F. Kennedy, quoting George
Bernard Shaw   
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Robert F. Kennedy was the one politician who told
us to dream. The one politician who spoke with passion to the
problems of society and the world and challenged us to do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the spiritual drift of the United States
is that we lack leaders who can speak to our longing for a better
world; who can inspire our imagination and urge us to work toward
that world.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kennedy did this. He imagined Mississippi and Appalachia
without the grinding poverty and asked, why not?
</P>
<P>
   He imagined farm workers and blue-collar workers being treated
with dignity and paid a living wage and asked, why not?
</P>
<P>
   He imagined a nation healed of the violence and racism that
scarred it and asked, why not?
</P>
<P>
   He imagined the end to the Vietnam War and all wars, and asked,
why not?
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to South Africa in 1966, he said: ``We all struggle to
transcend the cruelties and the follies of mankind. That struggle
will not be won by standing aloof and pointing a finger: it will be
won by action, by men who commit their every resource of mind and
body to the education and improvement of their fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this week, just minutes after winning the
California Democratic presidential primary, with the Democratic
Party nomination and the White House within his grasp, Bobby
Kennedy was assassinated in a hotel pantry while shaking the hands
of kitchen workers. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   It is fruitless to wonder what might have been had Kennedy
lived. What is known is that this nation lost a vigorous and
prophetic voice that was always raised in outrage against injustice
and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   His conscience and heart were magnets drawn to the dispossessed.
Where they were is where he went. He visited the ghettos,
reservations, fields and factories to bear witness to their
suffering so that others would know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the politicians (Do they exist?) who will visit these
places?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any who can unleash the power of our imagination to
dream?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any who can rekindle hope in the dying embers of a
nation's soul?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any who can speak words like this, the extemporaneous
speech that Bobby Kennedy gave in Indianapolis just minutes after
learning of the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He ended it by
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need in the United States is not hatred, what we need
in the United States is not lawlessness, but love and wisdom and
compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward
those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or
they be black. Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote
so many years ago: `To tame the savageness of man and make gentle
the life of this world.' Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say
a prayer for our country and our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Once there was passion. Once there was soul. If this nation and
this world are to ever be made better, we must get them back.

LEARN TO WALK... ALL OVER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Walking. Putting one foot in front of the other.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those basics, like learning not to shove peas up
your nose or put gum in your hair, that we all learned as babies.
There we were, crawling across the carpet and using the edge of the
coffee table to pull ourselves upright. Suddenly one day, we let
go.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ma, I'm walkin'!
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, we were independent, upright human beings able to
toddle, then run, leaving our frantic parents scrambling behind us.
When we fell, we got up again and walked bravely into the rest of
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   As teens, guys perfected that I'm-so-cool slouch, and girls
developed the ingenue sashay, leading with their hips like runway
fashion models and sexy young movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, we learned to ambulate with a baby perched on one
hip, a heavy purse thrown over one shoulder, weighed down by
schoolbooks or an overweight briefcase, lugging bags of groceries
or boxes of tools.
</P>
<P>
   And all those things, Sherry Brourman says, is why we walk
funny. And why our backs, our knees, our shoulders, our ankles
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's in pain,'' said the West Los Angeles physical
therapist, who has written a book, ``Walk Yourself Well,'' on how
to walk properly _ and be pain-free. ``Walking the way you're
supposed to is the answer to that pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When you get right down to it, it's probably an evolutionary
miracle that we're able to hold ourselves upright in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably genetically programmed to crawl,'' Brourman
said. ``You're holding this strange bag of bones up against
gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the problem, human feet are put together wrong, with
our ankles and legs attached just above our heels. For perfect
posture, our ankles would be attached in the middle of our feet,
which would make our shoes look really funny, but would help us
balance better.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to walk unsymmetrically and unbalanced starts
early, said Brourman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come into the world with pretty sound bodies. But when
we're babies, we're sponges. We're watching the person we worship
the most _ mom, dad. By the time they're 6 months old, toddlers
pick up mom's gait, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   A walk ``is literally as distinctive as a face,'' said Brourman,
a Boston University graduate. Think Marilyn Monroe, with her
rolling hips and an undulating rear that one observer once said
looked like ``two puppies wrestling under a blanket.'' Think John
Wayne, with that sidewinder-style meander that told the bad guy he
was in for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we're 30 or 40 or 50, our distinctive gait is
probably taking its toll on our joints.
</P>
<P>
   For example, visualize a perfectly constructed, perfectly
balanced robot walking. Everything works just fine. Then a screw
falls out of an ankle, and the ankle becomes wobbly. Over weeks or
months, the ankle gets so wobbly, it causes strain in the knee,
then the hip, then the back.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you've got a robot looking for a good chiropractor
or orthopedist. Or at least a tube of Ben-Gay and an aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The human body works the same way, affirms Dr. Clifford Kahn, an
Encino orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Encino-Tarzana Regional
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old foot-bone-connected-to-the-leg-bone thing,'' he
said. ``The mechanics of it extends throughout the body.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, is an advocate of proper body alignment and proper
walking techniques, especially with patients who've just undergone
foot, leg or back surgery and who are learning to walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use proper body mechanics _ proper walking techniques
and proper posture _ body problems can certainly improve,'' Kahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   But convincing patients that they need to change their walk
often brings hesitancy and skepticism, said Brourman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look as me and say, `But I've been walking this way for
57 or whatever years.' Then they do it my way _ and they can see
the difference immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   While patients are usually pleased that they're pain-free, they
may not be totally happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys usually tell me I'm taking the `cool' out of their
walk,'' Brourman said with a laugh. ``Women tell me it looks too
masculine. Men tell me it looks swishy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brourman's book includes a detailed test to evaluate
your walk and diagnose problems, often all she needs to do is watch
a person sit, stand and walk to start them on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, for instance, came for help for a bad back. But the
real problem, she determined, was that he was nearly deaf and
leaned forward to hear. At the same time, he had glasses that slid
down his nose, so he always sat or walked with his neck crooked and
his head elevated to keep his glasses in place. When he got his
glasses fixed, a hearing aid and a few lessons on how to keep his
body aligned, his back problems ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get people to try changing their walk, and they feel the
difference and they get this amazed look on their faces,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all that charm-school stuff about walking around
with a book on your head? It doesn't work, she says: ``You can walk
with the book on your head and have your body inappropriately
balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   And forget that head-up, shoulders-back, chest-out, stomach-in,
butt-in military posture rookies and plebes have been taught for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forces you to lean back, and you have to bring your head
and your shoulders forward to balance yourself or you'd be falling
on your butt all the time. It's bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you know if you're walking right? Think of yourself
like a puppet, Brourman suggests. Visualize a string coming out of
the top of your head, pulling it toward the ceiling. Visualize two
more strings attached to your shoulders, pulling them toward the
floor. With head and shoulders in line, the rest will usually
follow.
</P>
<P>
   But what about people with arthritic joints, slipped discs or
other skeletal problems? If the muscles are strong and the body is
in alignment, uncushioned joints won't rub together and hurt,
Brourman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower back pain? Stand up straight and lift your rib cage one
inch. You should feel less pressure on your back _ and less pain.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget, she admonishes, that strong stomach muscles
can take a lot of pressure off aching back muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say to me, `You mean I have to use my
stomach muscles all the time?' Yes, you have to use your stomach
muscles all the time. But look at it as exercise for your belly and
a lot of other muscles. Look at it this way: You can walk to the
bathroom and be getting in 18 steps of exercise while you do it.''

BRUSHING UP YOUR STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; How can you tell if you're walking properly?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look in the mirror. Do you lean to one side? Are your
shoulders straight? Do you lead with your head? Your hips?
</P>
<P>
   Or take a walk barefoot on wet sand. Do your heels sink in
evenly? Or is there a deeper depression on the outside of your
foot, or the inside? Does your foot make a print like Donald
Duck's, or is the arch clearly delineated?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other suggestions, from Sherry Brourman's book
``Walk Yourself Well'' (Hyperion; $22.95):
</P>
<P>
   Lengthen your stride so you can feel muscles in legs and
buttocks working. Short steps keep you off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't walk leaning back. Don't lead with your hips or your head.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your feet straight, not letting your ankles roll inward.
Each heel should strike at the midpoint, not closer to either edge.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to feel the muscles in your feet as you walk.
Use your toes to push off and start the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your stance as wide as your shoulders to keep from
wobbling, which puts stress on your knees.
</P>
<P>
   As you walk, keep your feet turned out only a little; 15 to 20
degrees is way too far and forces you to lean back to maintain your
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your knees flexible, not locked, as you walk and stand to
minimize stress on those joints.
</P>
<P>
   Shift your weight from hip to hip as you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Your knees aren't car headlights and shouldn't point straight
ahead; they should be turned outward a little.
</P>
<P>
   Swing your arms as you walk to help propel yourself; palms
should be toward your body, thumbs pointing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Untuck your buns and hold your belly in. Keep your head up and
back.

<P>
   PARIS _ With less than two weeks to go before the soccer World
Cup kicks off in Paris on June 10, France has got the jitters. The
month-long series of 64 games, featuring 32 teams from around the
world, is expected to be watched, at least once, by a billion or so
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful chance for a publicity seeker. Terrorists,
soccer hooligans and striking transport workers are all threatening
to spoil the fun _ and sully the proud host's image around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, nearly 100 people suspected of links with Algerian
Muslim extremists were arrested in dawn raids in five European
countries (Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and France) at the
request of France's leading anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis
Bruguiere.
</P>
<P>
   No explosives and only one firearm were found, but the interior
ministry said that months of surveillance had led it to believe
that ``terrorist activities were being prepared in the World Cup's
run-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 53 nabbed in France live barely a grenade's throw
from a sparkling new 80,000-seat stadium in Paris's northern
suburbs, where nine matches, including the final, are to be played.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier, an unexploded bomb had been found in front of
France Telecom's offices in Paris's northeast. No one has claimed
responsibility, but the bomb was like the ones used in a wave of
attacks in France inspired by Algerian extremists in 1995, when ten
people were killed and more than 150 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of suspected Algerian terrorist sympathizers are already
in French jails after earlier clampdowns on Muslim extremists. Some
130, arrested three years ago, are to go on trial this September.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential troublemakers include Basque and Corsican
separatists, never averse to a bomb or two. And then, of course,
there are football hooligans, notably from England.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has tried to do its bit to prevent
exporting England's national shame, with the slogan ``No ticket,
don't travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But a junior French minister, on a visit to London to boost
French tourism not long ago, flummoxed everyone by inviting ``as
many Britons as possible'' to come and join in festivities, ticket
or no ticket. Quelle gaffe!
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the way things are going, the hooligans _ as well as
better-behaved fans _ may find it hard to get to France. The main
pilots' union has called a 15-day strike from June 1 to protest
against plans to dock their pay by 15 percent in exchange for a
shareholding in Air France when the state-owned airline is
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   And two French train-drivers' unions have called for a 24-hour
(repeatable) stoppage on June 10, the day of the World Cup
kick-off.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers also threatened protests during the Cup, but have
put off further action until the autumn. The government is drawing
some comfort from a belief that most unions will be reluctant to
risk the unpopularity of any disruption to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Another aggrieved group may, however, make itself felt: French
women. While men are expected to be glued to their television sets,
three-quarters of women say they will switch right off, and a tenth
are positively dreading the entire event. So ``special activities''
are being set up for France's jaundiced, abandoned wives.
</P>
<P>
   The Chippendales, a male striptease quintet, are putting on a
show in Paris from June 15 entitled ``Les filles sans foot,'' which
means ``Girls without football'' but also sounds like ``Les filles
s'en foutent'' _ ``Girls don't give a damn'' (or something rather
ruder).
</P>
<P>
   Another bunch of male strippers, the California Dream Men, will
be undressing at the Folies Bergeres in a ``Widows of the World
Cup'' spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants are offering four meals for the price of three
to all-female groups. And Cup-bashing outfits, with such names as
La Coupe est pleine (My Cup runneth over) is arranging ``hen
outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists are even predicting _ in all earnest _ a steep rise
in divorce. At the same time, some 20 extra tons of World Cup
condoms have, it is said, been imported. &QL;

   PARIS _ With less than two weeks to go before the soccer World
Cup kicks off in Paris on June 10, France has got the jitters. The
month-long series of 64 games, featuring 32 teams from around the
world, is expected to be watched, at least once, by a billion or so
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful chance for a publicity seeker. Terrorists,
soccer hooligans and striking transport workers are all threatening
to spoil the fun _ and sully the proud host's image around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, nearly 100 people suspected of links with Algerian
Muslim extremists were arrested in dawn raids in five European
countries (Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and France) at the
request of France's leading anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis
Bruguiere.
</P>
<P>
   No explosives and only one firearm were found, but the interior
ministry said that months of surveillance had led it to believe
that ``terrorist activities were being prepared in the World Cup's
run-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 53 nabbed in France live barely a grenade's throw
from a sparkling new 80,000-seat stadium in Paris's northern
suburbs, where nine matches, including the final, are to be played.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier, an unexploded bomb had been found in front of
France Telecom's offices in Paris's northeast. No one has claimed
responsibility, but the bomb was like the ones used in a wave of
attacks in France inspired by Algerian extremists in 1995, when ten
people were killed and more than 150 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of suspected Algerian terrorist sympathizers are already
in French jails after earlier clampdowns on Muslim extremists. Some
130, arrested three years ago, are to go on trial this September.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential troublemakers include Basque and Corsican
separatists, never averse to a bomb or two. And then, of course,
there are football hooligans, notably from England.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has tried to do its bit to prevent
exporting England's national shame, with the slogan ``No ticket,
don't travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But a junior French minister, on a visit to London to boost
French tourism not long ago, flummoxed everyone by inviting ``as
many Britons as possible'' to come and join in festivities, ticket
or no ticket. Quelle gaffe!
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the way things are going, the hooligans _ as well as
better-behaved fans _ may find it hard to get to France. The main
pilots' union has called a 15-day strike from June 1 to protest
against plans to dock their pay by 15 percent in exchange for a
shareholding in Air France when the state-owned airline is
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   And two French train-drivers' unions have called for a 24-hour
(repeatable) stoppage on June 10, the day of the World Cup
kick-off.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers also threatened protests during the Cup, but have
put off further action until the autumn. The government is drawing
some comfort from a belief that most unions will be reluctant to
risk the unpopularity of any disruption to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Another aggrieved group may, however, make itself felt: French
women. While men are expected to be glued to their television sets,
three-quarters of women say they will switch right off, and a tenth
are positively dreading the entire event. So ``special activities''
are being set up for France's jaundiced, abandoned wives.
</P>
<P>
   The Chippendales, a male striptease quintet, are putting on a
show in Paris from June 15 entitled ``Les filles sans foot,'' which
means ``Girls without football'' but also sounds like ``Les filles
s'en foutent'' _ ``Girls don't give a damn'' (or something rather
ruder).
</P>
<P>
   Another bunch of male strippers, the California Dream Men, will
be undressing at the Folies Bergeres in a ``Widows of the World
Cup'' spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants are offering four meals for the price of three
to all-female groups. And Cup-bashing outfits, with such names as
La Coupe est pleine (My Cup runneth over) is arranging ``hen
outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists are even predicting _ in all earnest _ a steep rise
in divorce. At the same time, some 20 extra tons of World Cup
condoms have, it is said, been imported. &QL;

WORLD CUP GIVES VITALITY TO INDUSTRIAL CITY

   SAINT-DENIS, France _ The huge metal ring shimmers and gleams in
the middle distance, like a gigantic alien spacecraft looming at
the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The ring is pierced by 18 steel masts, and cables from atop each
mast hold the ring aloft above 80,000 seats. Struts at the edge of
the ring moor it to the Earth. Otherwise, it would sail away.
</P>
<P>
   If the new Stade de France looks like a hybrid of flying saucer
and clipper ship, the image is apt.
</P>
<P>
   The main stadium for the 1998 World Cup of Soccer will bring the
eyes of the world to this hard-working industrial town of 92,000 at
the northern edge of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   When Saint-Denis welcomes the world to the tournament's opening
match on June 10, the world will find itself already there.
</P>
<P>
   The streets teem with immigrants and their children, many from
North Africa and Central Africa, some from Asia and Eastern Europe,
most of them poor or working-class. About a fifth of the people of
Saint-Denis were not born in France.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Denis has a long history, and it has figured prominently
in the making and remaking of the French identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Saint-Denis Basilica, in whose basement archaeologists are
uncovering foundation stones from the early Middle Ages, was the
birthplace of Gothic architecture in the 12th century and, for more
than 1,000 years, the burial place of French kings. Their bodies
were tossed into a ditch during the Revolution and were reburied
with honor during the reign of Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Industrial Revolution that made Saint-Denis what
it is today. The construction of a canal feeding into the Seine in
1834, and the arrival of the railroad in 1843, brought a heavy
concentration of manufacturing to La Plaine, a previously
undeveloped area between Paris and then-rural Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   La Plaine now constitutes the southern half of Saint-Denis and
is home to numerous audio-visual, research and manufacturing
industries, including the plant where France's high-speed rail cars
are built.
</P>
<P>
   With industrialization came immigration and leftist politics. In
1892, Saint-Denis elected its first Socialist mayor. During the
student uprisings of 1968, leftist faculty bolted the Sorbonne and
established a new university in Saint-Denis, now the University of
Paris VIII with about 27,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The city's left-leaning, working-class, multicultural tradition
took physical form when the badly decayed town center was
redeveloped starting in the early 1970s. About 80 percent of the
buildings near the basilica had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saint-Denis wanted the town center not to be for the rich,''
said my guide, Caroline zum Kolk, although there was little chance
of that outcome in any event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided most of the new buildings should be social
housing, and to preserve the old street system from the Middle
Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The architectural results were variable, ranging from grim
brutalist concrete boxes to rather more cheery interpretations of
North African traditions, by a variety of French and international
architects. Oscar Niemeyer, the architect of the basilica, chimed
in with an elegant wave of reflective glass for the offices of the
newspaper L'Humanite.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was an excellent example of urban planning, even if not
all the buildings are memorable or well-maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow passages between buildings, echoes of the medieval town,
lead to a wider but still intimate pedestrian mall bisected by a
street.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of this space is the crisp modernist City Hall annex,
designed by Henri Gaudin, and the entrance to the subway station is
near the other end. All around are street-level shops with public
housing, offices and a hotel above.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single project incorporates a parking garage, a
supermarket and several levels of oddly angled and terraced public
housing in which no two units are identical.
</P>
<P>
   When the French government chose a site in Saint-Denis for a new
stadium to accommodate the 1998 World Cup, city officials saw the
project as an opportunity for further redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at the northern end of La Plaine and just outside what
had been the wall of the historic town, was ideally situated to
spur new development. Saint-Denis applied its brand of
entrepreneurial socialism to make sure the project met its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The town's Communist deputy mayor (now the mayor), Patrick
Braouezec, was appointed co-chair of the regional organizational
committee for the World Cup. He was able to use the city's
acceptance of the stadium project as leverage to obtain
infrastructure improvements, jobs and housing.
</P>
<P>
   The bargain brought Saint-Denis two commuter rail lines, an
expanded subway station, improved highway connections and a linear
park over a portion of an expressway that sliced through La Plaine.
</P>
<P>
   The construction phase included a job training program and
guarantees to use local subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Development of a new neighborhood is promised near the stadium
after the World Cup, and adjacent land already has been
commercially developed with Europe's largest sporting goods store
and a multiscreen cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The town also expects economic gain from the visitors the
stadium brings, both for the World Cup and for other events
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stadium has only 6,000 parking spaces, most visitors
will come by public transit. Both the subway and commuter rail
lines will leave stadium visitors close to the restaurants, bars
and shops of Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Denis also is using the arts and culture as tourism draws.
The annual Saint-Denis Festival coincides with the World Cup this
year.
</P>
<P>
   For traditional sight-seeing, Saint-Denis has a true gem in its
basilica. The carved stone images of centuries of royals form an
eerie supine congregation in the ruggedly beautiful space.
</P>
<P>
   The taller of the original spires has been lost, but the
building remains a fascinating document of a crucial moment in
architectural history. It's far more interesting than Notre Dame in
Paris, and here you don't have to stand in line for an hour to get
inside.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a small but worthy Museum of Art and History,
created from a former convent; the Christofle Museum, at the site
of the famous silversmith factory; and a traditional market, in a
late 19th-century shed just off the town center.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of Saint-Denis is not so much in its buildings as
in its human culture _ the liveliness of its shopping streets, its
mixed population, the sound of a local variant of rap music
pouncing through an open window.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Kolk says, with a tinge of both pride and defiance, that
Saint-Denis seems to presage a new France whose multicultural
vitality is full of promise.

FOR SOME PARISIANS, THE WORLD CUP IS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE GREENBERG  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The opera-goers were quiet and serious in the subway.
They'd just exited a riveting production of Alban Berg's ``Lulu,''
a tragic tale of a hooker with a heart of brass, at the Opera
Bastille, and they weren't exactly humming the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   At Chatelet station, where the commuter line from the new
80,000-seat Stade de France feeds into the subway system, the train
was invaded by a horde of young people dressed in the red, white
and blue of Paris-Saint-Germain, the city's pro soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   The pensive silence of the opera-goers was shattered by a lusty
chant. Echoing from one car to the next, billowing in the tiled
vaults of the subway stations, it sounded a little like the
Tomahawk Chop.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris team had just beaten Lens, 2-1, to win its fifth
French Cup. The team's supporters were ecstatic. The opera crowd
was oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   Some Parisians care passionately for soccer; others, perhaps
most, don't. To judge from the posters for sale in stalls and shops
and subway entrances all over Paris, the city's main passion is
neither soccer nor opera, but American film star Leonardo DiCaprio.
``Chacun a son gout,'' (to each his own) as they say.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Cup of Soccer tournament begins June 10, even
soccer-loving Parisians might find it hard to summon enthusiasm:
Three days after the French Cup victory, when French national team
coach Aime Jacquet named his provisional squad for the World Cup,
not one Paris-Saint-Germain player made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the World Cup has not been altogether smooth.
Complaints that France was hogging too many tickets for its own
people rose to the status of an international incident in early
spring, when the European Commission and Socialist members of the
European Parliament threatened legal action against the
tournament's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   When 40,000 additional tickets were released for international
sale, the phone bank was flooded with millions of calls. Moreover,
no arrangements had been made to put the buyers of those new
tickets in their proper grandstand areas, somewhat rendering moot
the high steel fences that are supposed to segregate the supporters
of rival teams.
</P>
<P>
   Acting partly out of a concern about possible violence, the
British government has been actively discouraging Britons without
World Cup tickets from visiting France during the event. The French
tourism minister last month raised British hackles by sending the
opposite message: Come to France to soak up the World Cup
atmosphere even if you don't have tickets.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be atmosphere and room for everyone, apparently. French
tourism officials are projecting a 5 percent decline in tourism
during the World Cup, despite an expected 350,000 World Cup
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   As of early May, rooms were still fairly plentiful in Paris'
less swank hotels for all but the opening and closing days of the
tournament. The better hotels tend to be fully booked.
</P>
<P>
   Giant video screens are being set up in public places in all the
World Cup cities to provide televised match coverage for the
benefit of those who can't buy tickets. The screens might be
especially appreciated in Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, where
the gleaming metal roof of the new Stade de France jammed local
television reception.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Paris _ which has a reputation for being gruff to
visitors _ has launched several efforts to help World Cup visitors
feel comfortable and welcome. Months prior to the event, an
advertising campaign appeared urging service workers such as
hairdressers, taxi drivers and waiters to be nice to World Cup
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   International soccer matches are always subject to excessive
passion and hooliganism, and authorities throughout France are on
high alert against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup spectators are subject to body searches for weapons
and other prohibited items, including alcohol, laser pen lights and
``documents, tracts, insignia, symbols or canvas banners of a
political, ideological, philosophical or advertising nature ...''
</P>
<P>
   The police also have discretion to order drinking establishments
to close early.
</P>
<P>
   The French are working with other nations' police officials to
identify and track known troublemakers among soccer fans. All 10
World Cup stadiums have been equipped with surveillance cameras.

AMID WORLD CUP NOISE, PARIS OFFERS THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Paris always has plenty of music, theater and dance in
June and July, but the usual menu is being expanded for the World
Cup of Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The big event is a July 12 concert by the Three Tenors, with the
Orchestre de Paris under James Levine, on the Champ de Mars near
the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Some odd pairings of sport and culture are promised. For
example, while soccer fans await the final match in the Stade de
France, they are to be treated to a parade of 300 fashion models in
a 40-year retrospective of the fashions of Yves Saint-Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Fete de la Musique, with free public concerts of all
sorts in many of Paris' major plazas on June 21, will have extended
hours this year, till 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Also occurring during the period of the World Cup are the IRCAM
Festival of contemporary and experimental music (June 12-26); Paris
Opera productions of ``Manon'' and ``La Traviata''; a Moliere
festival (opening June 11); a tango festival (June 12-14); the New
Tendencies in Jazz Festival (June 12-July 13); and Gay Pride (June
17-21).
</P>
<P>
   Music is as near as the corner subway stop: In stations and on
trains, the rider may encounter a violinist and accordionist
playing Vivaldi's ``The Four Seasons,'' a performer alternating on
vocals and alto sax (with the aid of a portable rhythm machine) in
``Besame Mucho''; or a string orchestra playing the ``Carmen''
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   These are officially sanctioned Metro musicians, chosen through
auditions, and some of them are astonishingly good. Riders are
invited to drop a few coins in a cup or change purse, but no
pressure is applied.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in the subway stations leans heavily toward cultural
events _ Marivaux's ``The Game of Love and Luck'' at Nanterres
Amandieres; Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard'' at the Salle de
Richelieu; Berg's ``Wozzeck'' at the Chatelet; Stuck Mojo and
Rocket from the Crypt at the Zenith.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou Center is closed for renovations until the end of
1999, but the big plaza in front still draws throngs of tourists
and street performers.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame cathedral is open, although the lower portion of
the facade is veiled in scaffolding for a major cleaning and repair
project. Also open is the Louvre, the splendid art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Tops among recent architecture is the City of Music, new home of
the Paris Conservatoire and related institutions. Designed by
prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc, the complex is
notable for its fluid, sinuous lines, its sense of processional
movement, and forms that can be described only as musical.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth seeing is ``Paristoric,'' an excellent overview of
Parisian history and architecture in beautifully photographed
slides, multilingual narration and music, opposite the Opera
Garnier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything can be crammed into less than an hour,
so the program doesn't mention a few minor details, such as two
world wars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the new Stade de France in suburban Saint-Denis will get
the lion's share of attention during the World Cup, Paris itself
has an attractive venue in the Parc des Princes.
</P>
<P>
   Five preliminary matches and the July 11 semifinal are to be
played in this 49,000-seat stadium, a former velodrome renovated
for soccer and rugby in 1972. A bowl resting on gracefully curving
concrete fins, it's the home pitch of Paris-Saint-Germain, the
city's pro soccer team. All new seats and technical improvements
were added for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Parc des Princes is located just inside the Paris city
limits, atop the Peripherique expressway near the Bois du Boulogne.
Surrounding the stadium is an uncommonly pleasant, quiet and
prosperous neighborhood of art deco and international style
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps from the stadium, a historical marker directs the
eyes to architect Raymond Fischer's Villa Godfray, a tautly
disciplined modernist box, built in 1927, whose white exterior is
softened only by an aged but richly blossoming wisteria.

A HINT OF LASTING PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MONTAGUE and ELIZABETH WASSELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ We arrived in Belfast a week before
the peace referendum in Northern Ireland, for a ceremony lauding
John as the first Ireland Professor of Poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Always, coming into Belfast, one is struck by how small a
battleground it is. Just a few streets west of the city center,
which resembles any bustling English town, lie the Unionist enclave
Sandy Row, and the Nationalist Falls Road, literally side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Barbed wire and bombed-out or dilapidated houses characterize
both areas. The only apparent difference between them is the murals
adorning the sooty brick walls. Along the Falls, one sees Che
Guevera and other political crusaders, making it clear that the
Catholic extremists regard themselves as freedom fighters, while
the Protestant murals depict the defiant, blood-red hand of Ulster,
and ``King Billy'' on his white horse few Unionists seem to know
that King William of Orange was supported in his campaigns by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Belfast is a microcosm of the tensions racking the end of our
century, the walls between the Shankill and Falls a miniature of
the former Berlin Wall, its sectarian strife as hard to decipher as
Algeria or Yugoslavia, the pastor Ian Paisley, with his gross
historical simplifications, a Protestant version of the Ayatollahs.
</P>
<P>
   But while religion has been a source of conflict in the North of
Ireland, it has also provided a name and central symbol for the
referendum which was passed last week: the Good Friday agreement.
This agreement will try to remedy the division of Ireland, which
began with a famous event bearing another religious name, the
Dublin Easter Rising of 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments abound. If there had been no Easter rising, would
Ireland have achieved home rule after World War I? After all,
Ireland was united before 1921, albeit under English rule, and a
new independent structure might have evolved naturally. However,
the Unionists had already declared their opposition to home rule,
which they feared would be ``Rome Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   To placate them, England gave them their own parliament in 1921,
which they were able to maintain through gerrymandering, or carving
up electoral districts to sustain a false majority in the six
northeastern counties which make up Northern Ireland. But in the
1960s the oppressed Catholic minority finally rebelled, under the
banner of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   We are in an unusual position to appraise the current changes,
John who was recently named Ireland's first poet laureate, and
Elizabeth, his partner, a novelist who is published in Ireland but
who was born in New York. We had been working on a TV film on
John's home area in County Tyrone, ancient seat of the Kings of
Ulster, and the yearning for peace was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   John's portrait was being painted by a staunch Unionist, a
former commander of the Ulster Defence Regiment. So it came as no
surprise that mid-Ulster had one of the highest yes votes, nearly
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Protestant Belfast? While there, we ventured,
somewhat apprehensively, into the Orange Lily Pub in Sandy Row,
decorated with triumphal orange sashes, Union Jacks, and photos of
the royal family. When John produced a handful of change to buy our
drinks, and the barmaid gazed down at Republic of Ireland coins
emblazoned with harps and salmon, we realized we'd been found out
as southerners, and most likely Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   (The different currencies, and the difficulty of making a phone
call to someone on the same island, are two of the more absurd and
annoying aspects of a divided Ireland.)
</P>
<P>
   But the barmaid remained friendly, and Elizabeth began to speak
to her neighbor at the bar, a middle-aged man staring morosely into
his pint of Guinness. He told her that his 5-year-old daughter had
been killed by the Irish Republican Army, caught in cross-fire.
Afterward, his wife left him, because his face was an unbearable
reminder of their dead child.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I bear them no grudge,'' he said simply. ``God has told us
to forgive each other. All this hatred and revenge is eating up our
souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, we went to Feile na Pobail, or the People's
Festival, in the Catholic Clonnard section of Belfast. Our guide, a
cousin of Pete Hamill, was solicitous that we should get a
``right'' (i.e. Catholic) taxi to the site, an enormous greensward
close to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' house. Also nearby was a
cemetery full of tombstones bearing Republican emblems and hymns to
fallen patriots, but with a few Protestants from less divided times
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Irish music blared through the loudspeakers, while families
played and picnicked. The only suggestion that this was different
from any urban park on a sunny Sunday was the presence of vigilant
stewards here and there, keeping a professional eye out for
trouble. Compared to other sections of the city, which were taut
with fear, these festival grounds seemed relaxed and happy, as
though, to quote the IRA slogan, their day had come.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the Catholic minority has been steadily growing,
and Irish literature, legends, music, even films, have caught the
imagination of the world, while Unionist culture seems to remain
static. So, even as long ago as last summer, long before the Good
Friday agreement, something positive was in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But will this cobbled agreement work? Or will it fall apart like
the power-sharing executive of Sunningdale in 1974, a collapse
which led to bombs in Dublin and Birmingham, and the assassinations
of Airey Neave and Lord Mountbatten?
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit like Lanty Hanlon's famous dog, which went a bit of
the way with everyone. The Unionists have been given back their
Stormont parliament, and an assurance that there will be no change
in the status of Northern Ireland without majority consent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should gain entrance to Stormont (the castle
that houses the Northern Irish parliament), and will have the sop
of cross-border councils, much-disputed by Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   This is ironic when one considers that the new euro-train can
barrel down to Dublin from Belfast in an hour and a half, and that
when one crosses the border by car there are few noticeable
differences: same green mountainous landscape, same language, same
faces.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bird flying over Ireland would see only one small green
island, and be unaware of the divisive lunacies of history.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, despite the resistance of Unionists, the border seems to
be naturally dissolving, especially as all Europe moves toward
unity. But we must still hold our breaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange marching season has begun, and there are still the
Assembly Elections to the new Stormont, where the extreme Unionists
will find themselves in a minority, for the first time. And there
is decommissioning: Sinn Fein maintains that what is important is
that the guns are silent, but Unionists want to see them handed
over, to which Gerry Adams ironically echoes the Unionist battle
cry, ``No surrender!''
</P>
<P>
   And there are the stubborn, splinter paramilitary groups on both
sides, like the particularly vicious Loyal Volunteer Force, which
killed several young Catholics during the cease-fire, as well as
the Continuity IRA, the Republican IRA, and the ``Real'' IRA, all
of which claim legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Orange drums will throb through Ulster. Will the
Orangemen, belligerent in their bowlers and sashes, try to force
their way through the small Catholic enclave of Portadown, the
Garvaghey Road, as before, declaring it their democratic right to
march where they please, in their own province?
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists love to use the term democracy, but Ian Paisley
has already declared that he does not recognize that the agreement
was passed by a majority. Couched in this assertion, but unspoken,
is Paisley's belief that a majority formed in part by Catholics is
not a genuine majority at all, since Catholics shouldn't be
participating in politics in the first place, but should remain
sub-citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, on Irish radio, a comedian was pretending to give
Paisley an arithmetic lesson. ``If you have one apple, and I have
three apples, who has more apples?'' asked the comedian
painstakingly. The Paisley character thundered, ``I do, because
your apples are Catholic apples!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this year, finally, things will ease. The Protestant
boycott of a Catholic church in Antrim, called Harryville, has been
lifted, as opposed to last year, when Catholic churches were being
burned.
</P>
<P>
   John has expressed the tensions and fears which flare up every
marching season in a poem _ ``Weeds'' _ that has become well-known
in Ireland. Although maybe this year the fields will be cleared,
for a better harvest:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   March and counter-March
</P>
<P>
   As jagged orange of whin,
</P>
<P>
   Thick rushy green begin
</P>
<P>
   Again to overcome the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Each year we try to scythe,
</P>
<P>
   Hack, or burn them down,
</P>
<P>
   Knowing full well that next Spring
</P>
<P>
   Those same dumb stubborn
</P>
<P>
   Roots will stir underground.

NOW EVERY KID CAN HAVE A TWIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CINDY RAMOS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Four-year-old Brandon Duke's best buddy is 23
inches tall, with a soft body and a face with a striking
resemblance to Brandon's.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   One day in January, Brandon's new friend, a My Twinn doll,
arrived in the mail. Since then, he's stuck to his buddy like glue.
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn dolls _ available by catalog from an Englewood, Colo.,
company called My Twinn _ are designed to look exactly like your
child. They are so lifelike, owners say, the dolls are mistaken for
children as they sit on a couch or tag along with their owners in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Duke, a physician in San Antonio, has bought four My Twinn
dolls, including one matching what she looked like as a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   The other dolls in the Duke household are twins to Brandon; her
oldest son, Eddie; and her stepdaughter, Christina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted their kids to see how cute they were when they were
little,'' Duke said. ``This is something they can pass on, like an
heirloom.''
</P>
<P>
   A California emergency room doctor created the dolls after
noticing nervous young patients often carried their toy dolls with
them to ease their fears. They usually took the doll that looked
the most like them. My Twinn dolls hit the market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn, a privately owned company, doesn't release sales
figures, but says it sells thousands of dolls annually. The dolls
cost between $129.95 and $179.95, depending on the style and
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Designers at My Twinn match face shapes, skin tone, hair types
and eye colors according to a child's photograph and an information
sheet mailed in by parents. Birthmarks, moles and freckles also are
copied.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that can't be reproduced are dimples.
</P>
<P>
   For many children who have felt self-conscious about their
unique moles and birthmarks on their face, seeing another ``child''
with the same features boosts their self-esteem, said Dave Liggett,
public affairs director for My Twinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not just making dolls; they are making a special
gift,'' Liggett said.
</P>
<P>
   One doll was ordered with no legs and arms because its future
owner didn't have her limbs. Another doll was made for a little
girl who must carry an oxygen tank in her backpack due to a serious
heart condition. Her doll has an oxygen tank, too.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Duke, 12, has a birthmark on her forehead. Although it
has faded over the years, it was more noticeable when she was
younger. Her doll was created with the same birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' she said of the fact her doll shares the mark
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Christina's doll was an early gift for her 13th birthday on June
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Christina said of the resemblance. ``I was
shocked. I almost started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   For Duke, having My Twinn dolls of her children is a way to keep
them young.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always going to grow up, but you can never have that
feeling again when they were little,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn also sells matching outfits and accessories for doll
and child.
</P>

CHOOSING THE RIGHT BRIQUETTE FOR YOUR GRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ About 75 percent of U.S. households have a
barbecue grill, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.
With convenient cart-type covered grills, more than half of
Americans now cook outside year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast leads the heavy-barbecuer category, which means
barbecuing four or more times a month. Gas grills are widely used
now. Charcoal briquettes, which were invented after World War II by
automotive entrepreneur Henry Ford, are a matter of preference.
(Ford took wood left over from making cars and ground and pressed
it into briquettes, which were often sold at car dealers, so early
motorists could stop and cook lunch along the road.)
</P>
<P>
   Today there are a number of instant-light or light-the-bag
products for those who prefer cooking over charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   Natural lump charcoal costs a bit more than charcoal briquettes,
but it burns hotter, requires fewer lumps and partially burned
natural lump charcoal can be reused.
</P>
<P>
   Briquettes work better for long cooking periods, because they
produce more consistent heat. Rather than totally charcoal,
briquettes are made of powdered charcoal from tree bark, sawdust
and scrap lumber and mixed with petroleum extracts, limestone,
sodium nitrate and borax to aid in shaping and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Instant-light charcoal is impregnated with lighter fluid and
instant-light wood products have nontoxic wax incorporated as a
lighting medium.
</P>
<P>
   Briquettes or wood chunks packed in a single-use waxed bag,
which is set on fire, are convenient for tailgating and picnics,
since they are easy to handle and leave nothing to cart home
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Natural lump hardwood charcoal, which contains no additives or
fillers, is making a comeback as it burns 250 times cleaner and at
100 hotter than briquettes. It is especially desirable for
fast-cooking foods like fish, burgers and boneless chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lump charcoal also is ready for grilling in 10 minutes, as it is
just shy of being pure carbon. Briquettes take about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lump hardwood charcoal, however, is considerably more expensive
than briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between expensive lump hardwood charcoal and
briquettes is the extra fillers and lighting compounds that are
added to the cheaper briquettes. Also, some briquettes burn better
than others depending on their respective additives, and prices
vary.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study this year by the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., said that marinating meat before
grilling can reduce the production of heterocyclic aromatic amines,
or HAAs, which have been linked to cancer in animals. For years
scientists have warned against eating too much barbecued meat for
this reason.
</P>
<P>
   Another caution: Burning charcoal inside your home, vehicle or
tent, can be dangerous. Burning charcoal gives off carbon monoxide,
which has no odor.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent British study found that an increasing
number of elderly people were mixed up, frightened, often
belligerently defensive and sometimes happily oblivious because
television had taken over their minds, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   According to a London Observer story on the study: ``The
evidence is alarming. It includes one 90-year-old woman who
remembered the themes of television programs but forgot the
identities of the main characters. To compensate, she transposed
their identities on to people she knew well, leading to bitter
accusations against her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among these were claims that her grandson was being led astray
by prostitutes; that her son-in-law, a retired doctor, was facing
charges of assault for beating a man in the same room as her and
that her doctor was a transvestite. She also accused a ward sister
of being a stripper.''

Springer's universe.

through Alzheimer's disease, or related ailments, understands it's
one of life's grayest emotional areas. On the one hand, a thinking,
loving person is slipping away, forgetting family members like
fading pictures. On the other, there is an element of grand,
sad-funny humor to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say the humor is the only thing that gets them
through.
</P>
<P>
   What's most disturbing about this study is that it's from
Britain. You know, that island that gave the world Shakespeare and
``Masterpiece Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest here. When it comes to bad television, we have
it. If any country is ripe for extending the ramifications of this
study to its zenith, it is ours. Television dominates our lives,
our culture. Many of us were raised on it. The British may have
created the Teletubbies, but we are the Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Already television is blamed for destroying the moral fabric of
our nation _ from bad children's programming to the MTV generation
to parents who can tell you Ward Cleaver's work phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait. This television-is-poisoning-the-elderly thing is
going to be the topic du jour among The Concerned Thinkers and
People Who Worry.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of us will be caught up in the emotional riot of Luddite
finger-pointers and hand-wringing elder counselors. Some of us will
put a little faith in science, hoping for an Alzheimer's miracle.
If it doesn't come by the time we get ready to go, so be it. We'll
be prepared. In our wills we'll make stipulations _ right next to
that power of attorney clause _ that expressly detail what we want
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. It's like turning this whole V-chip thing on
yourself. Censoring your mind before you can't spell the word
anymore. For those of us with vision, this is an opportunity to
shape our future reality. Imagine a world where you're the fifth
``Seinfeld'' cast member. You could be the seventh friend on
``Friends.'' If you start taping C-SPAN right now in anticipation,
you could be a member of the British Parliament, shouting down your
neighbors at the retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   An optimist will not get sad or paranoid about what television
will do to him in their wilted salad years. Yeah, the mind is going
to go for some people. It's the truly television-savvy who let it
live on ``Green Acres'' or with Bob Newhart or as a rugged thinking
person's detective in ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine yourself imagining _ no, believing _ that you're the
third snobbish brother living a truly examined life along with
``Frasier'' and family.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to plan now. Most of us have been hoarding up
pathetic television images for years, and the possibility of
crossover-dream interference is more than likely. You could buy the
entire collection of ``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' and live in a fantasy
land free of worry. Get the tapes ready for constant viewing. It's
like planning your own elder-sitting. You don't want a lot of
``Dateline'' or ``Geraldo'' memories creeping in.
</P>
<P>
   Television and movies have always played on our fascination with
technology, portraying a world where we can live out our dreams.
Until this British study, who knew that we were carrying around
just the right kind of faulty hardware to do the trick?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us already know what it's like to watch people waste
away. Some of us already fear it's in the genes, that it's a
horrible foregone conclusion. Thinking like that is wearying.
Taking the glass-is-half-full approach gives hope to our fate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are going to start taping the Golf Channel 24 hours a
day. The Travel Channel, too. We're going to walk the most
beautiful fairways, strike the ball perfectly every time, then put
the bags down and travel the world, soaking up its beauty while
forgetting the dingy confines of our little warehouse, where
vaguely familiar smiling faces come and call out our names.
</P>
<P>
   We're going where the reruns are brilliant and there are no
commercials.

   CLINTON-PRIVILEGE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to
limit his legal appeals to his assertion of attorney-client
privilege in the Monica Lewinsky matter could yield two advantages:
reducing th case to make it seem too minor for the Supreme Court
to take on an expedited schedule, and limiting questioning of Bruce
Lindsey, the Clinton confidant and director of damage control. Does
this mean that presidents will begin surrounding themselves with
aides with law degrees? (Malone, Cox News Service).

   MODERNIZE-C5 _ Lockheed-Marietta and the U.S. Air Force are in

   PREACH-IN _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio and the church

decision and another month to review Branham's appeal, even though
its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique.
Branham's tumors, meanwhile, doubled in size. And four months after
her initial request for coverage, she died. Last month, the Ohio
Supreme Court ruled that Branham's husband, Craig, has the right to
sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for
disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding. (Jasper, Dayton

   MEXICO-FIRES _ CHIAPAS STATE, Mexico -- Farmers and their
agricultural methods have been blamed for the fires that have been
raging in Mexico and Central America. Why do farmers use fires to
burn land for growing season with such potential danger? Are
farmers concerned about the fires and are they rethinking their
agricultural methods, or can they afford to? Federal officials
assert that peasants encroaching on the rain forest are partly to
blame. But the peasants say there is no other way. (Harmon,

POSTAL SERVICE RANKS TOP 30 DOG-BITE CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Postal Service marked the start of
National Dog Bite Prevention Week on Monday by identifying the 30
U.S. cities where Postal Service employees were most frequently
bitten by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The list ranks Houston as the No. 1 city, with 65 dog bites in
the 12 months ending September 1997, followed by the Chicago area
with 55 bites and the Miami area with 36.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,700 letter carriers were bitten during that period,
according to the Postal Service. Carriers are equipped with pepper
spray to ward off attacking dogs, a fact that helps account for the
recent reduction in dog bite victims among letter carriers. In the
mid-1980s, more than 7,000 carriers suffered dog bites annually.
</P>
<P>
   During National Dog Bite Prevention Week, post offices around
the nation will coordinate with local humane societies and animal
care and control officials on public education about avoiding dog
bites.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service offers this advice on how to avoid a dog
bite:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't run past a dog. Its natural instinct is to chase and
catch prey.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a dog threatens you, don't scream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid eye contact, try to remain motionless until the dog
leaves, then back away slowly until the dog is out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always let a dog see and sniff you before you pet the animal.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service gives these pointers to ``responsible dog
owners'':
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume your dog won't bite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spay or neuter your dog _ unneutered dogs are three times more
likely to bite.
</P>
<P>
   _ When your letter carrier comes to your home, keep your dog
inside, away from the door in another room or on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't let your child take mail from the letter carrier in the
presence of your dog. Your dog's instinct is to protect the family.
</P>
<P>
   The other top 30 dog-bite cities were:
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area (29 bites), Cleveland, (25); Dallas (23);
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (22); Kansas City, Mo. (17); St. Petersburg,
Fla. (17); Phoenix (17); Brooklyn, N.Y. (17); Charlotte, N.C. (17);
San Antonio (17); Buffalo, N.Y. (16); Boston (16); Denver (16);
Baltimore (15); Oklahoma City (15); Indianapolis (14); Milwaukee
(13); Philadelphia (13); Cincinnati (13); Jamaica, N.Y. (13); San
Diego (12); San Francisco (12); Minneapolis (12); West Palm Beach,
Fla. (12); Flushing, N.Y. (11); Rochester, N.Y. (11) and Virginia
Beach, Va. (11).

TOYOTA'S 1998 LAND CRUISER IS BEST OF THE SUVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best has just gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities getting any
better than it was, but that's what happened when Toyota redesigned
the Land Cruiser for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is the vehicle that has set the standard for
sport-utilities since the previous generation debuted in 1991, even
against such tough and capable competition as the Range Rover and
Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   But for 1998, Toyota has raised the bar to a level that will be
hard for any manufacturer to match, let alone top.
</P>
<P>
   The new Land Cruiser _ which also comes in a Lexus version
called the LX 470 _ now has a 4.7-liter, 32-valve,
double-overhead-cam V-8 engine replacing the previous generation's
inline six.
</P>
<P>
   That engine cranks out 230 horsepower, an increase of 18, and
develops 320 foot-pounds of torque, up 45 from last year. This
all-new engine is based on the V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 sedan,
but it's significantly modified to produce better low-speed torque
for trailer-towing and off-road hill-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds, an
improvement of two seconds over last year's model. That's quite
impressive for a vehicle that weighs 5,225 pounds empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is slightly better than last year, even with the
power increase. EPA ratings are 14 miles per gallon in the city and
16 on the highway, above average for a large sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser is first and foremost a great luxury wagon,
suitable for the most formal of occasions at the country club. But
what makes it so unusual in the sport-utility field is that it's
also a great performer off the beaten path. In fact, it's the
best-performing off-road vehicle on the market, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, with a base price of $46,397 and a tricked-out sticker
of $52,025, it's not likely many owners will put the Land Cruiser
to the test on serious off-road routes such as California's
legendary Rubicon Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these vehicles will answer the call of the wild. A
lot of people buy the Land Cruiser for hunting and other sporting
purposes, and these people appreciate having a vehicle that won't
get stuck in the mud or sand.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't extensively tested the new Land Cruiser off-road yet,
but I have driven the previous generation on some of the wildest
trails in the nation, including those in the Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park in California and the Scott's Gulf Pocket Wilderness
along the Caney Fork River in Tennessee's Cumberland Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And on those excursions, I've used the Land Cruiser to pull a
few Jeeps out of some sticky spots that posed no challenge to the
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   On or off the road, the new Land Cruiser's ride is pure luxury,
much smoother and quieter than before. That's due in part to the
new independent front suspension and the vehicle's structural
rigidity, which has been increased 50 percent over the previous
version.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel drive is a full-time system with high and low
ranges, as before. And with the optional locking rear differential
($410), a must for serious off-roading, this is the most capable
drivetrain available for either on- or off-road driving.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features abound, including automatic climate control,
four-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel antilock brakes that
work even with the transmission in low range, premium
AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo, rear heater, power windows/door
locks/mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, heated outside
mirrors, dual front air bags, keyless entry, power adjustable front
seats and automatic headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space has been increased from last year, giving
passengers more head, leg and shoulder room. Additionally, the
doors and rear hatch are larger for easier entry and loading. And
as before, the Land Cruiser seats up to eight people with the
optional third seat ($1,100).
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our test vehicle included luxurious leather seats
($1,820), power moon roof ($1,155), a roof luggage rack ($449), and
running boards ($595), which I would decline if I were planning to
do much off-roading. Running boards are the first thing to go when
the going gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   Crashworthiness has been increased dramatically over the
previous Land Cruiser, Toyota officials say. The ladder frame now
has nine cross members, instead of six, and the chassis side rails
have collapsible, energy-absorbing ends.
</P>
<P>
   Land Cruisers can pull trailers of up to 6,500 pounds with a
tongue weight of up to 650 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As an aid for extended cruising, the fuel tank holds 25.4
gallons.

IN MIDDLE-AGED CIRCLES, VIAGRA INSPIRES HOPE, JOKES _ AND A BLACK
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For weeks, my friends and I have been
talking about it, usually in hushed tones around back tables in
restaurants. We don't want others to overhear us pondering the
possibilities of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we need it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly
accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore
youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination
and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age,''
says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington. ``But now I hear about
Viagra, and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four-year-old John ``Zonk'' Lanzillo of Richardson also
ponders whether Viagra might be in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it now, but I'm wondering if I might not need it
next year,'' he says. ``What the heck does it really do, and
where'd it come from in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's genesis at Pfizer Labs is humorous, really.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally tested as a medication for high blood
pressure, with little success. But it had a pleasant side effect,
which left the men in the initial test run begging to keep their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that 52 percent of men between 40 and 70
have some problem with ED, which is short for erectile
dysfunction,'' explains a Pfizer sales representative who asked not
to be identified. ``Viagra stimulates blood flow, which allows a
stronger erection. Obviously there is great public interest in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth internist Dr. Kelly Goss first heard about Viagra
three months ago, when a urologist friend called him with a tip.
``(He) said to buy Pfizer stock, because Viagra was going to be a
home run,'' Goss says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hears about little else. Goss and many other Tarrant
County practitioners are inundated with visits from middle-aged
male patients they haven't heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about everything else, and then they finally say,
`Oh, by the way ...''' Goss says. ``They think that if they get
Viagra, they're going to feel like they're 16 again.'' But rumors
about Viagra's capabilities, Goss says, are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give you erections automatically,'' he says. ```If
you get aroused, it helps you keep an erection. But if you have
other problems, psychological problems, it's not going to help with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra mythology is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that if you don't have any problem, if you don't need
Viagra but take it anyway, that you stay ready to go for hours and
hours,'' muses 51-year-old Bill Clarkson of Fort Worth. ``Man,
think about it. Wouldn't that be great?''
</P>
<P>
   And if that ``ready to go'' state extended into the next day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Clarkson says, ``Can you think of a better reason to
call the boss and say you can't come in to work?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Goss notes, priapism is not one of Viagra's potential
side effects. For some users, headaches are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cause a real turnaround,'' Goss says. ``Things will
change from the wife saying, `Not tonight, honey, I've got a
headache,' to the man saying, `Honey, I've got my headache, so
let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billings is more concerned with the fact that the pill doesn't
work instant magic. ``They say you're supposed to take it an hour
ahead of time. I mean, if it's late at night, I'm not sure I can
stay awake a whole hour. Don't they have one that works after five
minutes? And that hour between taking it and using it? Doesn't that
assume your wife is going to stay in the mood that long? What if
you have an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Various newswires have reported Viagra black markets springing
up worldwide. In Tokyo, the football-shaped tablets are said to
bring $40 a pop. Americans seem willing to pay $20 for pills that
cost $8-$10 apiece if prescribed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'd pay $20,'' Clarkson concedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer sales representative reports that he and his
colleagues are regularly approached when they make sales calls on
Tarrant County doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer ``gave us these satchels with `VIAGRA' printed on the
side,'' he says. ``We've had to start carrying them with the other
side of the satchel facing out. Men see that word, `Viagra,' and
they just want to have some.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fort Worth urologist heard that Viagra salesmen have even
faced impromptu muggings. Goss reports that Pfizer reps insist on
dropping Viagra samples directly on the doctor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rumored Tarrant County black market. There are
whispers that in certain men's rooms in the hospital district, 50-
and 100-milligram pills can be had by asking the right gentlemen
loitering near the urinals. But a quick check found no one
``holding'' in a hospital toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inspiration struck. If dealers exist, what could be more
prime territory than the Colonial golf tournament for large groups
of middle-aged men with readily disposable income?
</P>
<P>
   Stationing myself by the Porta Potties behind various greens, I
sidled up to selected gentlemen in the 40-to-70 age group and
hissed, ``Hey, anybody around here got any Viagra?''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they all said they had no idea. To a man, they all
asked me to tell them if I did find somebody with a tablet or two
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Goss says he hasn't yet heard from irate wives. But he expects
he will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be married women who've gotten very
comfortable with limited sex lives,'' he says. ``So if I give
Viagra to their husbands, all of a sudden their routines could be
radically changed, and they might not be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer salesman believes most wives would be pleased that
his company's product made its way into their husbands'
bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, think about it for people who've been married a long
time, like for 25 years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzillo feels inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did take one, I wouldn't tell my wife,'' he says,
chuckling. ``I'd want it to be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get Viagra in Tarrant County through the
obvious legal means. Doctors are free to prescribe it. But that
doesn't mean they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from patients,'' says Dr. Bill Vance, a Fort
Worth cardiologist. ``In many cases they're on medication, and they
want to know if they can take Viagra, too. Well, you can't take
Viagra if you're on nitro(glycerin). Frequently, heart patients on
nitroglycerin need to take their nitro after vigorous physical
exercise _ one of those classic events is intercourse. But if
they've taken Viagra beforehand, then afterward if they have chest
pain, they can't take their nitroglycerin.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vance says, there already are medical jokes about
other poor chemical mixes with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one,'' he offers. ``The joke is, you can't take Viagra
if you take iron supplements because of the tremendous danger that,
when aroused, you'll immediately turn to the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss says that a lot more patients ask for Viagra than really
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, for men a certain age, just having it around offers
some security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Viagra has come along at just the right moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Clarkson says. ``Frank Sinatra just died.
Mickey Mantle is dead. When our heroes die, middle-age men are
reminded they're going to die, too. Viagra's a way of holding back
the clock a little.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I score Viagra. One doctor gives me a five-pill
sample box and a prescription for five tablets. Another doctor
gives me two boxes of samples, and a casual acquaintance who works
near the hospital district passed along a much-handled, grubby blue
tablet. He says it was one of three a male nurse sold him a few
days earlier for the negotiated price of $12 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this my birthday and Christmas present to you for the
next 10 years,'' he says, and I stash my Viagra in a dresser
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a friend of mine said when I asked him why he decided
to buy a handgun and keep it in his bedroom closet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to ever need it, but it gives me such a warm
feeling to know it's right there if I do.''

UNASSUMING TEXAN HASN'T GONE HOLLYWOOD, BUT STILL THE KING OF
COUNTRY MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ELUSIVE GEORGE STRAIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of
Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for
George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a
thin folder with a small batch of articles.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, she said. What year is this?
</P>
<P>
   No, she was told, that's it: total. All the press on the man who
then, as now, was one of the most popular singers in country music.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most
popular boxed sets of all time. Strait is selling out football
stadiums nationwide, averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing
any press or TV _ The New York Times, David Letterman, Jay Leno and
even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been
firmly, but politely, told no.
</P>
<P>
   And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West,
Strait's longtime publicist. ``Garth generates 2 inches of press in
15 seconds. George Strait just does not leave footprints as far as
the media goes. He doesn't do anything. And he doesn't make
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the dichotomy of Strait's career. At 46, the Pearsall,
Texas, native remains the living embodiment of the quiet lone
cowboy. His catalog of hits and the 39 million CDs he has sold help
him fill the largest venues in America, but he can still slip out
of his stardom and go back to life as an authentic South Texas
rancher as easily as most folks take off a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts stay firmly starched. The little half-smile stays
put. The gaze stays steady. The hat stays on. The music stays pure
honky-tonk country with more than a hint of western swing. The
deep, water-over-a-stream-bed voice keeps its lived-in luster.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up
as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This
year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy
Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including
Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Strait, West says, stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and
Sundays only so he can fly home (he has a home in San Antonio and a
ranch somewhere in South Texas) on his private plane for several
days each week.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on
Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and
spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than
25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even
as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top
Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth
Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans and performers alike seem to get younger every year
_ but Strait, amazingly, has sold as well in the '90s as in the
'80s, when he burst into prominence. The soundtrack to the 1992
movie ``Pure Country'' sold 5 million copies. Since that year,
Strait has been the 10th-most-popular musical act of any genre.
</P>
<P>
   This appears more phenomenal considering Strait's low media
profile. After years as a bar musician (he was discovered in 1981
while based in San Marcos) and spending the '80s playing hundreds
of dates per year as his national popularity grew, Strait long ago
found his own balance between personal and professional.
</P>
<P>
   He will not tour till he drops, and several years ago ended his
annual New Year's Eve show at Dallas' Reunion Arena to spend the
night at home with his family. He will not curry favor with
Nashville or hang out with movie stars or record duets with rock
stars or do anything else designed to keep his name out there just
a little longer or get one more fan to buy one more CD. He will
sell as well as he does playing by his rules, and that will be
that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country''
(in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!),
he was deluged with movie offers: a sequel, other roles, big money.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned them all down, she says, because he simply didn't
want to make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did `Pure Country' because he got a script he liked, he
could do it in Texas, and he had some time off,'' she says. ``It
was relatively painless. But it wasn't because he wanted to give
his career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked about this casually. His life's been consistent
and steady, and he really values that. How much longer is Bubba
going to be at home? He doesn't want to be on the road when his
son's growing up, and when he's ready to stay home, his son is out
of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait
for more than a decade; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait
you see in his simple videos is the genuine article. When not
onstage, she says, he's so unwilling to call attention to himself
that he sometimes enters rodeo competitions under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in
one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first
saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in
1982. ``It's sincere. He's almost embarrassed when people ask for
his autograph. Obviously, he still loves the response _ but he
doesn't like to talk about himself.''

UNDATED: talk about himself.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that
people now don't expect any details, juicy or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Strait is a total mystery. We know he grew up
in Pearsall; his parents separated when George was young; and he
and his older brother, Buddy, were raised by his father, John, a
math teacher and part-time rancher.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in
San Marcos, enlisted in the Army in 1971, and was in for three
years, stationed in Hawaii. That is where he began singing in a
band; when he returned to San Marcos (he graduated with a degree in
agriculture), he began playing bars, gradually becoming more and
more popular.
</P>
<P>
   And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981; his
first single for the label, ``Unwound,'' charted in early May, just
before he turned 29. His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released
that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs
such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look
So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 25, 1986, his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was
killed in a car accident near San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Strait's career has continued to prosper despite changing times;
he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the
Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four
times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and
hosts the George Strait Team Roping Classic each June in
Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was The Dog Incident: In 1996 his
Australian heeler, Buster, disappeared from his South Texas ranch.
Strait offered a reward, and half the state, it seems, went looking
for the dog. Buster was never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you about George's status in Texas,'' says West.
``You can't imagine the phone calls, the number of people thinking
they had found him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wheat, sound archivist for the Center for American History
at the University of Texas at Austin, says Strait ``appeals to
people who want at least a modicum of authenticity. People still
revere western culture, and authenticity is hard to find in country
music. He isn't trying to fit his music into pop music trends.
Country has folk music roots _ it's concerned with people's daily
lives _ and George is still in that camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sell himself as competing with rock bands. He knows
about ranching, and he doesn't get away from it and go live in Los
Angeles or Nashville. He's a quiet, strong, self-effacing
character. He holds himself back, and people appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda O'Brian, music director and assistant program director at
Dallas-Fort Worth radio station KSCS/96.3 FM, says Strait appeals
because he ``just seems so normal. Everything he does is done with
this quiet strength _ you don't think of him as having issues, so
people don't ask about him. They just want to meet him. Everybody
wants to meet him. He just has this really incredible sense of
self; the songs aren't by him, because he's not a songwriter, but
they sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   And thats, says old pal Clay Blaker, is the way Strait has
always been. The two met in 1976, when they were both playing bars
on the Austin/San Antonio/Houston circuit. Blaker's band did
``around 100'' shows with Strait's, and then Strait invited him
along as an opener in the '80s. Also, Strait has cut eight Blaker
songs, including ``She Lays It All on the Line'' on the ``Pure
Country'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm around him, he's the same old George to me,''
says Blaker. ``He's very nice and polite and shy. He's always
pretty much kept to himself, but he's very friendly to his friends.
And he has a lot of the same friends he had before he got a record
deal; that'll tell you something right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason he's still at the top of his game can be
attributed to you don't see him in magazines all the time or on TV
all the time; there's still a mystique about him that's a result of
the way he is. In today's market, there's so many people that are
so overexposed; you're a star for 15 minutes, and then you're gone.
He's a competitor, he takes his career real seriously, and he wants
to go out there and prove he can still cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, he still can. The question now is, how long
will Strait's career continue? Given what he's chosen to do and
chosen not to do, one can easily see him making one final, grand
gesture, one final release and series of concerts, and then
gracefully riding off into the sunset. It might be a lame metaphor
for many other singers, but not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an acknowledgement that this won't go on forever,''
says West. ``Eventually George will decide. It won't be decided for
him. He's the master of his universe; he controls his own fate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's very possible that, even at the very end, Strait will
be what he's always been: the lone figure on the plain, silent but
for the songs he sings, not feeling the need to talk to anyone
about his private life or career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to talk to Cigar Aficionado magazine,'' says West
with a chuckle. ``He loves cigars, and he wants to do an interview.
I don't know if they'll do it _ they put a lot of Hollywood people
on the cover _ but we're testing the waters. They haven't asked.''

ONE CRITIC'S DOGGED PURSUIT OF GEORGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies GEORGE STRAIT-ESSAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Strait is elusive. Really elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, George Strait is so elusive, his press agent, Kay West
in Nashville, is essentially an answering machine. Since 1982, I've
left approximately 55 messages for Kay/George in pursuit of
interviews or information and received approximately five return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, nearly two decades of my life have been spent in
journalistic pursuit of this Sinatra of South Texas. To date, the
sum total of my efforts has been one (1) phone interview, in 1984,
and one (1) in-person interview, in 1992. And that's actually a
pretty good record for a Strait newshound; other longtime country
music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done
from George's ranch in South Texas, as he and the Ace in the Hole
Band were literally loading up to go on tour. He told me that, no
offense intended, he didn't much like doing interviews, and he
refused to use his free time to do them. He was tallying that
interview into his road time, he said, as though he'd punched a
time clock.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, I attended the Country Music Association
awards, when George won Male Vocalist honors for the first time. It
was his first major award. How'd he feel? asked the press. Pretty
good, said George.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, when he filmed his movie ``Pure Country'' in and around
Fort Worth, George was legendary. I watched the filming of the
concert sequence at Tarrant County Convention Center Arena, and was
invited by the movie company publicist to do a ``one-on-one'' with
George the following week.
</P>
<P>
   I went to an abandoned dance hall in Midlothian on the appointed
day and watched George walk up a dusty road in the early morning.
Then I watched George film a sequence inside the dance hall and was
surprised at how natural he seemed. The other actors goofed lines
and faced the wrong way, but George didn't. He occasionally made
suggestions and was minded when he did.
</P>
<P>
   I finally got my chance in late afternoon, after waiting around
all day. George went on his tour bus with wife Norma, and I was
invited to join them for 15 minutes, although we talked for more
than 45 minutes undisturbed. The press agent cautioned me not to
bring up personal matters. I promised I wouldn't, and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I found Norma to be outgoing and likeable, and George seemed to
appreciate how I made genuine friends with their dog, a Boston
terrier.
</P>
<P>
   George lounged in his seat, spoke in a languid, low drawl, and
cross-examined me with a flash of his green eyes on several
occasions. He was mildly confrontational if he thought I was
drawing the wrong conclusion. He stuck pretty much to business _
his music, the movie _ though he did touch on rodeoing and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign that there was tension to the interview was
George's constant toying with a piece of rope, tying slipknots.
He'd study the knot intensely for a few moments before answering
sometimes. Then, suddenly, he'd flash that silvery smile, and I'd
feel relief wash over me like the Frio River.
</P>
<P>
   I covered the world premiere of ``Pure Country'' in the fall of
'92, in San Antonio, and was invited to a sumptuous party
afterward. George made the rounds, without an entourage, and
blended in with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't bring myself to be pushy to this quiet, pleasant man
during such a lovely party. His manager eventually introduced us. I
said something really clever, like ``Nice to see you again; I liked
your movie,'' and he said something memorable like ``Well, thanks.
It's good to see you again, too.'' (He did, however, add that
little sideways half-smile, and I noticed that his eyes looked blue
in candlelight.)
</P>
<P>
   So, why don't I, and other spurned journalists, just write
George off and curse him as a prima donna jerk?
</P>
<P>
   Because I honestly believe that he isn't. He's uncomfortable
telling strangers personal details, and I believe he considers it
unseemly. George Strait does nothing for its press value, and in an
age when Naomi Judd jabbers publicly about whether daughter Ashley
wore underwear to a certain awards show, George remains a personal
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, maybe, just maybe, he's saving all his secrets to
divulge to me and me alone someday. Kay might give me a call back
to set it up, any day now.

FALLING IN LOVE WITH BEANIE BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ADRIENNE FREEMAN and SHARON OKADA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Collecting Beanie Babies _ the little stuffed
animals that made their debut in 1994 and now sell in the millions
_ has become a phenomenon notable for its appeal to adults. Two
moms share the hold Beanie Babies have on them, and offer a glimpse
into the local Beanie Baby network that is tuned in to all things
Beanie:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we confess. We are Beanieholics, adults obsessed with
bagging that new, overlooked, coveted bit of plush out there for
under $7. We are not serious collectors, just part of the crowd
bitten by the Beanie bug.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, we're noticing our tales of Beanie pursuits are
being greeted by the rolling of eyes instead of enthusiasm. Our
children are starting to worry about us. Our co-workers wonder what
powerful substance, possibly embedded in the plastic pellets or
``beans'' stuffed inside these creatures, keeps us continuously on
the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Our Beanie information is gleaned on-line, by word of mouth, and
via an informal telephone network of the similarly obsessed. We
also make phone calls to favorite retailers, although this now
frequently means listening to recorded messages on Beanie
availability. Store owners, often the only staff at the small shops
that typically sell Beanie Babies, say they can no longer spend the
time to personally answer what can be hundreds of Beanie calls they
receive each day.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., the manufacturer of Beanie Babies, has printed its
popular Web site address right on the heart-shaped ``hang tag''
that has accompanied all Beanies since their introduction in 1994.
Our on-line forays add to the 1.6 billion hits the ty.com Beanie
Baby Web site has received. This number is constantly updated at
the top of the Web site, like the McDonald's signs of years past.
</P>
<P>
   We've completed the on-line Beanie Baby survey on the
beaniemom.com site and have discovered that even our enthusiasm for
Beanie Babies pales next to others. Two hundred and fifty six
respondents admitted to following UPS trucks and personnel in their
pursuit of Beanies. Six hundred and two checked ``Beanies are my
primary vocation.'' We're glad we haven't lost it that much.
</P>
<P>
   We have bought (literally) into Ty's brilliant marketing
strategy of maintaining interest in the Beanie collection by
periodically, via the Web and their vendors, announcing the
``retirement'' of batches of Beanies. This results in Beanie
``hunters'' snatching up any remaining ``retirees.'' Ty then
announces the introduction of new ``species'' (type of Beanie Baby)
as they go into production. These new ones are then not available
to the public for a few months, resulting in a Beanie frenzy as UPS
shipments of them trickle into stores.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ty does not sell its products to large retailers like Toys
R Us, bypassing them to sell to smaller toy and gift retailers,
Beanie Babies have been a real boon to these businesses. Small
shops that have sold Ty products long before the Beanie craze also
get preference when it comes to shipments of limited release
Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanie craze also has spawned a thriving resale or secondary
market. Entrepreneurs in malls, Beanie shows, and on the Web resell
Beanies for as much as the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices some retired Beanies are fetching is based on
rarity. Collectors are willing to pay as much as $5,200 for a
Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant because only 2,000 were made in
1995, before the fabric was changed to the more available light
blue.
</P>
<P>
   We long ago gave up on putting together a complete collection of
53 currents and 118 retirees (including the 28 retired on May 1).
But, like dreaming of winning the lottery, we still pursue the
total Beanie deal.
</P>
<P>
   A hobby that started as gift-buying for kids, nieces and friends
has changed into something not quite controllable, and even a
little ridiculous, but still fun, in a deliciously guilty sort of
way.

THE GROWNUP WORLD OF JUDY BLUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ She worried she would never finish writing the book.
She worried no one would read it when she did. She worried they
would read it and hate it. She worried no one would show up at the
book signings on her 12-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very insecure about my writing,'' Judy Blume confesses,
spearing a steamed turnip at The Painted Table in downtown Seattle
during a lunchtime interview Thursday to promote her steamy new
adults-only novel ``Summer Sisters'' (Delacorte Press, 400 pages,
$21.95).
</P>
<P>
   Blume, who became a household name after selling an astounding
65 million books for children and young adults, sniffs the turnip
suspiciously. She worries it's an onion.
</P>
<P>
   And she worries onions will upset a delicate stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, law professor-turned-writer George Cooper, smiles
across the table.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman who worries over tragedies that could happen
on the way to the airport, then frets over the possibility of the
plane crashing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman who keeps a running ``Anxiety Diary'' on her
Internet site _ www.judyblume.com _ chronicling her tribulations
with ``Summer Sisters,'' a book that required 20 drafts and some
painful soul-searching over the two-plus years it took to write it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise myself I won't become obsessed by reviews ... I
won't read the bad ones more than once. Maybe twice. I'll focus on
the good ones _ if there are any good ones,'' Blume writes in her
tell-all online diary.
</P>
<P>
   Frankness has always been Blume's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the R-rated sex scenes in ``Summer Sisters'' _ her
first adult novel in more than 10 years _ she doesn't blink. ``I
know it's sexy if I get turned on when I'm writing it,'' says the
writer, who turned 60 in February but says she's still 12 inside.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband leans forward. ``That comment's going to show up in
the newspaper,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Blume smiles, a quick, broad smile that sets off high
cheekbones, a pert nose and silky skin beneath a curly mop parted
at the side and highlighted with strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   She looks miles from 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Blume says, merriment playing in the warm brown
eyes. ``It's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is what has catapulted Blume's 20-plus coming-of-age
books onto the top of best-seller lists and into the collective
preadolescent imagination the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is what has kept America's kids up past midnight, reading
Blume under the covers with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Novels such as ``Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret,''
``Forever,'' ``Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing'' and ``Blubber''
have unflinchingly tackled subjects like wet dreams, the longing to
belong, death, divorce (Blume's been through two herself), the
cruelty of kids, masturbation and, of course, ``menstroo-ation.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about offensive language and blunt subject matter
have regularly landed the novels on banned-book lists at schools
and libraries. ``I've received numerous letters over the years
telling me I'll burn in Hell,'' says Blume, named the most
frequently challenged author of the last 15 years by the
anti-censorship group People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   She has become a spokeswoman for the National Coalition Against
Censorship. ``There's much more censorship today than when I
started writing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Blume, a child who made up stories as she bounced the ball
against a wall, didn't launch her literary career until her late
20s. She was a bored housewife with small kids in New Jersey,
``going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   All the first stories rhymed. And all were rejected. Her
neighbors thought she was weird to want to be a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tried to discourage me,'' says Blume, who
vividly recalls her first book signing at a New Jersey bookstore.
The book was ``The One in the Middle is the Green Kangaroo.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children showed up. A few of their friends. Her mother. But
the rest of the chairs remained yawningly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe visions of that non-event play in the back of her mind as
Blume dabbles with her steamed veggies at The Painted Table _ no
canola oil, she's allergic, she tells the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   She is worried about her reading in a few hours at Elliott Bay
Book Co. It's set for 5 o'clock.``Do you think people will show up
at that hour?'' Blume asks.
</P>
<P>
   But the reading room at Elliott Bay is packed with Blume fans,
male and female, who raise their hands to thank her for her
honesty, her humor, her battles against censorship. They nod
knowingly when she asks if they grew up on her books.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 11 and reading her, I always thought she was the
one writer who knew what everyone was thinking. She always seemed
to be in synch with how I felt,'' said Elizabeth Zambelli, 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``She simplified a lot of complicated stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplifying a lot of complicated stuff hasn't always set well
with critics. While some praise Blume's roll-up-the-sleeves
realism, others dismiss her writing as ``trivial'' or
``second-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Blume-bashing, Sarah Towers _ writing in this
month's Mirabella magazine _ complains that the book about first
sex, ``Forever,'' ruined her sex life forever. ``The crime was not
that she (Blume) was writing about sex for kids,'' Towers writes,
``but that she was writing badly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics don't buy books. The public buys books. And the
public can't seem to get enough of Judy Blume's catchy stories,
easy prose and emotional rawness. ``My success has always come from
readers, not from critics,'' says the writer.
</P>
<P>
   And Blume readers are sure to plunge headlong into the
nostalgically titillating waters of ``Summer Sisters,'' a page
turner that is No. 9 on Publishers Weekly's best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   The book is set on Martha's Vineyard, where Blume and Cooper
spend part of the year, with other homes in Key West and New York
City. It is dedicated to Mary Weaver, Blume's best friend since
seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Blume insists it's her least autobiographical
book. ``After 22 books, you've pretty much mined your own life,''
she says. ``If you haven't, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The story, which germinated in Blume's head for 10 years, begins
with two 12-year-old girls and follows their tangled friendship and
sexual experimentations over the course of two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The main character, Victoria, or ``Vix,'' is a reserved,
thoughtful girl from a working-class family, who is developing a
voluptuous body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I allow my characters to live out my fantasies,'' says Blume,
teasingly opening her sea-grass green wool jacket to reveal a
modest bust line under her Banana Republic T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's friend, Caitlin, a wild, flashy, manipulative golden
girl from a well-to-do family, invites Vix to summer at the
Vineyard. The invitation, and what ensues from it, transforms
Victoria's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly Dostoevski. And while the adolescent voices sing,
the adult voices tend to fall flat. But Blume's ability to map that
tentative territory between what people think and what they say is
intriguing _ and the ongoing chorus of animal moans that emanate
from the book's tousled beds and backs of cars keeps the pages
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a naughty streak,'' admits Blume, with a devilish
smile.
</P>
<P>
   That smile teeters when she begins talking about upcoming
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Her 6-year-old grandson, whose first word was ``book,'' loves
her Fudge books _ ``Superfudge,'' ``Fudge-a-mania.'' He wants her
to write one for him and dedicate it to him.
</P>
<P>
   She also has another adult book taking shape in the notebooks
full of character sketches and observations she calls her security
blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Blume's face grows thoughtful. ``Will I ever write it?'' she
wonders aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The insecurities kick in and her mind begins to spin.
</P>
<P>
   She leans close, for a soft confession. ``Sometimes I think I
don't want to do this anymore,'' she admits in a voice that's
almost a whisper. ``It's too hard, too painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I think, you don't decide whether to write or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's OK. Because it's the truth.

DIANA IS STILL AT CENTER OF ROYAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nine months after her death in a car crash, Princess
Diana remains a figure of controversy as the British royal family
and her brother, Earl Spencer, feud over her spiritual legacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the squabble are her two adolescent sons,
Princes William and Henry, over whom her brother claimed special
protective rights in an emotional and angry oration at Diana's
funeral last September in Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   ``(William and Henry) have unwittingly been drawn into a
destructive battle between the Windsors and the Spencers,''
according to James Whitaker, a veteran reporter on the royals,
writing in Britain's Spectator magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``War has not been officially declared,'' Whitaker said, but it
is ``the footing on which the two families now find themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Queen Elizabeth II and Diana's former husband, Prince
Charles, have skillfully retrieved some of the popularity they lost
when the princess died, their bitter feelings toward the Spencers
are as strong as ever, Whitaker noted. They blame Earl Spencer for
deliberately exacerbating the wave of national hostility toward the
royal family at the time of the funeral, which briefly threatened
to destabilize the 1,000-year-old monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   As seen from Buckingham Palace, Spencer's latest offense has
been to try to woo the two young princes away from their father _
just as he implicitly pledged to do when he declared at the
funeral: ``We, your blood family will do all we can to continue in
the imaginative and loving way in which you (Diana) were steering
these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply
immersed by duty and tradition, but can sing openly as you had
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys were invited to spend their summer vacation with
Diana's elder sister, Sarah McCorquodale, and her family, Charles
and the queen regarded the proposal as an attempt to separate
William and Harry from their father close to the anniversary of
their mother's death, according to Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   But ``William and Harry themselves ... decided to reject the
offer,'' said the royals-watcher. ``In all matters concerning them,
they meet as a family, talk and then make their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys ``have made clear they would rather be with their
paternal family,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker quoted a ``Buckingham Palace elder'' as saying that
Spencer's behavior at the funeral ``will never be forgotten or
forgiven. Why should anyone think he could give the two princes a
fraction of what their father can? The answer is he can't, and if
Spencer has to learn this the hard way, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The earl may also have committed a serious blunder by recently
calling for the Diana Memorial Fund to be wound up, charging that
it has sponsored several unworthy enterprises, thus doing harm to
her memory. Paradoxically, the president of the fund is Spencer's
sister, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rachel Tisdale, the author of several books on the
royal family, ``(Spencer's) criticism of the fund has received a
cold reception from the public and enabled the royals discreetly to
throw their support behind the fund's continuation. This is helping
to do away with the perception that Charles and the queen wish to
phase out Diana's memory. On the contrary, now that she is gone,
they regard her as a royal asset.''

Monsanto for about $34.4 billion in stock, creating one of the

The purchase price represents almost no premium to Monsanto's
market value. Monsanto, which spun off its chemicals business last
year to focus on genetically engineered crops and agricultural
products, agreed three weeks ago to buy DeKalb Genetics and Delta
and Pine Land for $4.1 billion. The acquisition by American Home
adds Monsanto's arthritis drugs, including at least one potential
blockbuster, to American Home's Advil painkiller and Premarin
hormone-replacement therapy. American Home and SmithKline Beecham

SIGHTLESS MAN TAKES A DIVE AT 10,000 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LORENA FIGUEROA  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Robert Dittman knows no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Blind since birth, the Civil Air Patrol communications officer
stationed at Randolph Air Force Base had no problems leaping from a
plane flying at 10,000 feet Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With an Air Force flight suit on, Dittman had a 35-second free
fall at 125 mph before jump master Rick Meyers of Skydive San
Antonio Inc. opened the main parachute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to prove to people there are no limits, whether
they are disabled or not,'' Dittman, 20, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very depressing when people become handicapped and just
sit around not doing anything,'' he said. ``I want to inspire
people to set a goal like I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dittman, a sophomore at the University of Texas at San Antonio
majoring in radio, television and film, decided to skydive just
three days before his jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became bored on Tuesday and I decided to do something
exciting, like skydiving,'' said Dittman, who hopes the Civil Air
Patrol will give him his wings for the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization that assists in
air search and rescue missions and air crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who accompanied Dittman to the airfield say he is
adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is normal for Rob to do crazy things,'' said Victoria
Archur, who read the liability forms to him before his jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motivation is his favorite word,'' Archur said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers guided and shared a square parachute with Dittman
throughout the jump.
</P>
<P>
   Dittman, who didn't tell his parents beforehand, said he wanted
to skydive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great; it was the coolest feeling,'' he said. ``I shut
my eyes for a second, but then again, I can't see.''

LIPS ARE THE RAGE THESE DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My lips are disappearing,'' a friend says, looking in the
mirror. They don't look any different, to me at least. Maybe she
thinks they're disappearing because she's comparing them to
fashion's latest word on lips, i.e., bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   I switched on the TV the other day just in time to hear a makeup
consultant say, ``lips are all over the place this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I tuned in late, I'm not exactly sure what he meant by
this. But lips are everywhere these days, or maybe it just seems
that way because they're so much bigger than they used to be, so
they take up more space. Thumbing through fashion magazines, one
can see page after page of models with huge, puffy, pouting lips.
Sometimes it looks all right, if the lips are in proportion to the
rest of the face. But in some cases the lips dominate every other
feature, so that's all you see _ lips. Many of these models owe
their luscious lip lines to collagen injections. The acting
profession, too, is full of women whose lips, like certain other
portions of their anatomies, appear suspiciously enhanced. Collagen
or not? Calista Flockhart? Maybe. Michelle Pfeiffer? I wouldn't be
surprised. Kirstie Alley? Definitely. Cher? Can there be any doubt?
Even Kathie Lee appears to have stopped talking long enough to let
a cosmetic surgeon plump up her lips. It only takes a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Collagen injections are increasingly popular, according to
statistics compiled by the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery.
But collagen is not forever, which must cause a certain amount of
rejoicing in cosmetic surgery circles. It wears off as it's
absorbed by the body, so the procedure has to be redone
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its plastic-sounding name, collagen is a natural
substance, derived from the skin of cows, so physicians say it's
safe, unless the patient has an allergy to it. The only real danger
would seem to be getting carried away and ending up with the lip
equivalent of a DD-cup.
</P>
<P>
   Looking sexy is, of course, what big lips are all about. ``Thin
lips (or chicken lips) are no longer considered appealing,'' writes
Helen Bransford in ``Welcome to Your Facelift: What to Expect
Before, During and After Cosmetic Surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news _ at least I think it's good news _ is that
there's an even more natural cure than collagen for chicken lips.
Bransford writes: ``Your own fat may be harvested from another
location (like your butt) to protect you from an allergic reaction,
then transplanted into your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the concept of fat harvesting. It sounds so much more
wholesome than liposuction, as if they were going to store it in a
silo or something, in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For those who long for luscious lips yet hesitate to have
cosmetic surgery, help is at hand. The June issue of the SelfCare
catalog, one of my favorite publications, has the Lip Enhancer, a
transparent acrylic vacuum tube. According to the blurb, for only
$40 plus shipping and handling, it ``makes lips attractively fuller
without the expense, pain or risk of collagen injections! Simply
place the mouthpiece around your lips and pull on the cylinder. The
gentle vacuum creates a lovely fullness ... the effect is quite
rejuvenating!''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you go at it too strenuously. ``It is important to be
patient and to follow directions carefully,'' the ad copy warns.
``In the beginning, you may experience slight bruising or reddening
on or around your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure it's worth the risk. But could you get the same effect
by sticking your lips in a vacuum cleaner hose and turning the
thing on full blast? I'm just asking.
</P>

REV. RIVERS HAS SAVVY, THAT'S FOR SURE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA SMITH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does it take to be larger than life?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Rev. Eugene Rivers, it takes an inborn savvy
that is both manipulative and heartfelt. It's picking exactly the
wrong battles with exactly the wrong people, realizing that winning
is secondary to dogged persistence and a display of arrogance that
both infuriates and disables his adversaries. It is, will wonders
ever cease, the gall and guts to actually defend a headline
renaming Harvard's Henry Louis Gates Jr. ``Head Negro in Charge.''
It is almost singlehandedly ripping a community down its
ideological middle; important issues of the day are relegated to
the backdrop while the topic of debate becomes _ what else? _
Eugene Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt the Reverend Rivers to have his painfully
earnest mug plastered on the front of the June 1 issue of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, there he is, staring from the magazine rack at Store 24,
glaring the gospel from the crowded shelves at Out of Town News and
lined up, row upon row of righteousness, on the rack of any
periodicals purveyor worth its salt. It won't be long, of course,
before another tragedy, world leader or pressing issue replaces him
on the coveted cover. But right now, it is Rivers's turn to flow.
He is the undisputed star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The reverend, as expected, gives incredibly good face _ his
immaculately groomed head, which seems bigger than the average head
somehow, floats above a stark-white clerical collar. His eyes are
simultaneously world-weary, hopeful, reverent, angry, and stubborn.
He is playing shamelessly to the camera. You can almost hear him
thinking, ``Boy, the folks in Boston are gonna love this!'' knowing
full well that quite a few of them will not. Already, one Rivers
detractor has put the cover to good use. ``Makes a great
dartboard,'' he snips.
</P>
<P>
   The headline beneath the head clues us in as to what Rivers is
spouting off about this time: ``God Vs. Gangs'' ``What's the
Hottest Idea in Crime Fighting?'' And then, the answer, as if the
clerical collar wasn't already screaming it: ``The Power of
Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a noble topic, to be sure, and maybe one day someone at
Newsweek will venture to write about it. But this puff piece is
unabashedly in love with the Reverend Rivers. Read about his
derring-do in staring down local gangbangers in order to mark his
territory! Thrill to his cutting-edge criticism of the black church
and, not surprisingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr.! Read his life story!
See him work the streets, pray, get his hair cut! Agree
wholeheartedly when a Boston police lieutenant, reflecting on
Rivers's mix of frayed rhetoric, wannabe Havard Yard and last
week's street lingo, admits ``I don't understand him.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the descriptions of the philosophy and goings-on at
Rivers's Ella J. Baker House hint at a revolution in the pockmarked
history of fighting juvenile crime. But there is not one born-again
street child quoted, no chronicle of a life turned around. Whenever
the piece seems headed in that longed-for direction, the words whiz
right back around to Rivers, as if he alone is the nationally
designated dreamer. The inside headline has anointed him: ``Savior
of the Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   That's in tune with the prevailing local criticism of the
reverend, which is that he has overcome a lukewarm stature in the
black community to present himself as its official spokesman on
everything from crime statistics to stupid headlines. He's good for
a quick sound bite, analysis of a trend or the directions to a good
soul food restaurant. When they need to take the temperature of the
inner city, white Boston shoves the thermometer into Gene Rivers's
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Newsweek, he's gone global.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, ``God vs. Gangs'' is nothing new. For years,
black mamas have defied the lure of the streets and dragged their
sons by the ears right to the preacher's door. I remember one
formidable matriarch who shook a fist at her wayward child in front
of the entire Sunday congregation. She had quite obviously reached
the end of her rope. ``Jesus, you better take him and get him to
the promised land,'' she warned, pushing her son toward the pulpit.
``'Cause if you don't, I got my own way of gettin' him there.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as there has been trouble, there have been neighborhood
prayer circles and fervent testimonials of street toughs who once
were blind but now they see. God has been a quiet, unassuming
success. Even in the days when crime stats painted a more dismal
picture, there were souls being saved.
</P>
<P>
   The power of spirit is new now because Newsweek points to Gene
Rivers and Gene Rivers says it is. And the kids in the midst of all
this? They're mere bit players, standing by as a great big
important magazine screams ``Lights! Camera! Action!'' and
handpicks them a hero.

NEW RULES COULD STALL CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For four years, House members backing an overhaul
of the nation's campaign finance system struggled to build a
majority to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they said they had reached their goal, securing the
218 votes needed for a simple majority in the 435-member House.
</P>
<P>
   But now House Republican leaders have changed the rules,
demonstrating that nothing is likely to be simple in the campaign
to get big money out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with newly crafted House procedures for considering the
campaign finance issue _ rules the House parliamentarian described
as ``unheard of'' in recent history _ advocates for overhauling the
system began waging a grass-roots effort last week to persuade
dozens of additional House members to form a super majority they
may need to overcome the obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which have sent confused lawmakers scurrying to House
parliamentarian Charles Johnson for guidance, effectively create a
legislative free-for-all among every coalition trying to improve
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the issue, which began May 21, is set to resume this
week, after House members return from their weeklong Memorial Day
recess, &UR;  &LR; and continue into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leaders have set up a system to divide and
conquer,'' said Lloyd Leonard, spokesman for the League of Women
Voters, which favors major changes in the system. ``We need to
unite all our forces against them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the standard House rules applied, supporters of a bill
sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican, and Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, said they
would have enough votes to pass the overhaul measure and send it to
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan plan is nearly identical to a bill that won
majority support in the Senate last year but died when backers
could not muster the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican
filibuster. Supporters hope that passing the House bill will
provide new momentum in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But under the process devised recently by the House Rules
Committee, 12 campaign finance proposals, will be voted on, and the
bill that receives the most votes will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, for example, 300 House members could vote for
the Shays-Meehan plan, but if 301 members voted for a rival
proposal to create a commission to study the issue for a year, the
Shays-Meehan measure would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nothing more than a new set of procedural tricks to
kill reform,'' said Don Simon, executive vice president of Common
Cause. The group joined the League of Women Voters and several
other organizations in the effort to garner support for the
Shays-Meehan plan.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who pledged in a meeting three
years ago with President Clinton to change the campaign finance
system, helped create the special rules. His leadership team has
defended the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very fair, open rule,'' said Representative John
Linder, a Georgia Republican who serves on the Rules Committee and
is chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
``The opponents of this open debate want us to close down the
process, allow consideration of only one bill, and foreclose all
other opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, Linder, and the rest of the GOP leadership team are
cosponsoring a stark alternative to the Shays-Meehan bill. Their
plan would abolish all campaign contribution limits, but require
candidates to make quicker and fuller disclosure of their
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan described the special rules and the Gingrich-backed bill
as the latest of numerous moves that Republican leaders have made
to stymie efforts by his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker is totally opposed to passing campaign finance
reform legislation, and he's doing everything possible to thwart
the will of the majority,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan measure would ban large, unregulated donations
known as ``soft money'' that have increasingly influenced state and
national elections. The bill also would tighten disclosure
requirements and regulate spending by corporations, unions, and
nonprofit groups on advertising that influences federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   But with a simple majority no longer enough to guarantee their
bill's passing the House, Shays, Meehan, and their supporters are
scurrying to win over additional House members and to persuade all
their backers to vote against every other proposal but theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The rival proposals include:
</P>
<P>
   _A ``Clean Money, Clean Election'' bill sponsored by
Representative John Tierney, a Salem Democrat, that would allow
candidates to choose either private financing or public funding
with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _A bipartisan measure sponsored by House freshmen that would ban
most ``soft money'' and take less-aggressive steps than
Shays-Meehan in overhauling other areas of the campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   _A bill sponsored by Representative Charles Bass, a New
Hampshire Republican, that is identical to Shays-Meehan except that
it includes a ``paycheck protection'' provision dealing with how
unions use members' dues for political spending.
</P>
<P>
   Many House members have already agreed to vote for Shays-Meehan
and against the other plans. Even some members with competing
proposals have indicated that they may withdraw their bills to help
the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney, for example, ``is definitely going to vote for
Shays-Meehan and be a strong supporter,'' said David Williams, his
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Tierney might also withdraw his bill, which would
remove any risk of its displacing the Shays-Meehan plan. ``Part of
the Republican strategy is to drag this out through the summer so
people grow weary and tune out,'' Williams said. ``We may just pull
the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bass, who has been a prime target of the grass-roots
campaign because he led an effort in the New Hampshire Legislature
to overhaul the state's campaign finance system, has yet to decide
how vigorously he will push his alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing for this debate is kind of like playing
three-dimensional chess,'' said David Leland, his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Leland said Bass has told Common Cause officials that they
should take heart from his voting record. ``He has voted for
campaign reform every time it has come up in Congress, even if it
hasn't been the perfect bill,'' Leland said. ``If the legislation
is at least a step in the right direction, he will vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shays and Meehan, who were among many lawmakers seeking
guidance from the House parliamentarian on the rules process, fear
that their bill could be defeated by a rival plan or gutted by
amendments. They are trying to hold a fragile coalition of about
190 Democrats and 30 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concede we're facing our toughest challenge yet,'' Meehan
said. ``But I'm confident support for our bill is stronger than
ever.''

IN PYLA, GREEK CYPRIOT AND TURKISH CYPRIOT MANAGE TO GET ALONG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PYLA, Cyprus _ On an island divided by concertina wire and
hatred, this may be the only village where ethnic Greeks and Turks
live side by side and manage to get along.
</P>
<P>
   The village is tiny, no more than a few hundred people. And on
the only main road is a Turkish mosque, with its Ottoman minaret,
and a Greek church, with its red-tiled steeple. The church's bell
tower is newly rebuilt to be slightly higher than the mosque's
minaret.
</P>
<P>
   Between the church and the mosque are two cafes that sit
opposite each other. One is the Turkish-owned Kahvehanesi Coffee
House and the other is the Greek-owned Trohos Tavern. The patrons
of these rustic-looking, white stucco cafes sit under the shade of
verandas and stare across at one another. The two sides don't talk
much, the locals admit, but they stare at one another a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Mehmet, 70, sat looking out over the stucco arches of the
Turkish coffee house sipping a small cup of black and powerful
Turkish coffee. Asked if he thought the peace talks headed by US
envoy Richard Holbrooke, which broke down on May 4, could be
restarted, he laughed and answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we aren't going to have a solution. But in the meantime
we just sit here and drink coffee and try to avoid each other as
much as possible,'' he said. ``When we do talk, we argue. But we
don't fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the road at the Greek cafe, Yambos Pavlo peered out over
sunglasses and said, ``It's not that Turks and Greeks can't live
together. We lived together for hundreds of years. It's just
politics that has left this island so divided. It has very little
to do with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into rival ethnic Turkish and Greek
Cypriot zones since 1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of
the island in response to a short-lived coup engineered by the
military then ruling Greece. Since then the island, and its central
city of Nicosia, have been divided by a ``green line'' of sandbags
and barbed wire monitored by UN forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions on the island have been running high lately since
Holbrooke, who brokered a peace deal in Bosnia, announced talks
aimed at reunification of the island were not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Heightening tensions further is a spiraling arms race. This
August, the Greek Cypriot government is expected to receive
shipment of advanced Russian surface-to-air missiles. The Turks
have vowed to retaliate by using their US-made and US-funded F-16
fighter planes to destroy the missiles if they are delivered.
Analysts worry this could touch off a confrontation between Greece
and Turkey and destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
   But through nearly a quarter century of conflict and division,
Pyla has managed to stay bicultural. Most of the Greeks fled the
northern part of the island when the Turks occupied it. And most of
the Turks fled the rest of the island, fearing reprisals from
Greeks. But not in Pyla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? It's the question everyone asks,'' says Michael Diffily,
a Dublin police detective who is now on a military tour with the
United Nations post in Pyla. ``And we never have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue observation tower of the UN post stands in the middle
of the town. Most observers say the glue that holds Pyla together
is the British military base, where many of the villagers work.
They are maintenance workers, chefs, engineers, and secretaries to
the British military based there. And Greeks and Turks work
together. The military base has spawned a British-style bar known
as ``The King's Leather Pub.'' The place is famous for serving the
best pints of creamy Guinness stout on the island. Here both Greeks
and Turks duck out of the hot Cypriot sun to join the British
soldiers for drinks after a day of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base has something to do with why people here get along,''
said a British officer who has been stationed here for 10 years.
``But if you ask me, it's the stout that keeps everyone at peace.''

NEW HAMPSHIRE TOWN REMEMBERS HOLE RIPPED IN ITS HEART
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; COLEBROOK, N.H. _ Last Aug. 19, a hole was ripped in this
town's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Drega, his soul full of rage and arms full of
semi-automatic weapons, murdered four people. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Drega killed New Hampshire state troopers Les Lord and Scott
Phillips first, as they sought to question him about the
dilapidated state of his pickup and threats he'd made against
District Judge Vickie Bunnell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then Drega drove to Bunnell's office. He killed her as she
ran. When newspaper editor Dennis Joos tried to wrestle the gun
away, Drega turned it on him.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Colebrook is the tragedy by which people
measure time. There is Before Colebrook, when such things were
inconceivable. And then there is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is New Hampshire's tragedy of the decade,'' says New
Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin, ``maybe tragedy of
the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck West, a New Hampshire state trooper who was involved in
the shootout in which Drega was killed, says the murders ``rocked
us right to the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Colebrook is somehow more Alaska than New England _ its downtown
more Western frontier than Eastern pastoral. To locals, points
south are simply ``down below.'' Colebrook is in the northern
mountains, where everything seems to happen just a little closer to
the sky; far enough north that French accents lilt Acadian.
</P>
<P>
   Keys sit in car ignitions on Main Street. Keys to kitchen doors
are lost and never missed. People wave.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real setting of the jaw here, almost before the
shots had died away, that this monster and this horror were not
going to change this place,'' says John Harrigan, publisher of the
weekly News &AMP; Sentinel, where Joos worked and where Bunnell had her
office. ``That we were too good for that, to let that bastard
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Colebrook's sense of community has only intensified since last
August 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time now, you see people approaching other people and
saying, `You doing OK? How are things going?''' Harrigan says.
``That's not the idle sort of `Howya doin'?' And if you tell them
you're not doing OK, well, they'll haul you off somewhere for
supper or out for a beer or out for a drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are tired of rehashing the event, weary of the
tears that flow with each new memorial. The families of the victims
are not interested in talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the town feels it's time to put this to
rest,'' says Sylvia Collins, who manages the state liquor store
here. ``We're never going to forget it, but it's time to try to
heal it.''
</P>
<P>
   But August 19 is a constant undercurrent.
</P>
<P>
   Angry public outbursts are no longer shrugged off. The manager
of the IGA store where Lord and Phillips were shot notices now ``if
somebody odd-looking comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has considered expanding its death penalty law; a
gun control measure introduced in the state Legislature this
session failed. New Hampshire's stalking law has been strengthened,
and Vermont has enacted a criminal threatening law.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire police are poring over a recently released
2,600-page report of the killings to see if procedural changes are
needed. Communication among law enforcement agencies is being
improved.
</P>
<P>
   When the news hits that a boy with a gun killed four people in
Oregon, the intake of breath in Colebrook is sharper than in most
places. These people know exactly how that feels. Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have good days, and then there's days you just don't
want to get out of bed,'' says Colebrook Police Chief Mike
Sielicki. ``I think that's everybody in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Noyes is 65. Her family has been in Colebrook since
``eighteen-six.''
</P>
<P>
   This town, she says, has lost something forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep comparing that Drega thing to a woman being raped,''
Noyes says, sadly. ``We lost our innocence is all.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Lamontagne still has the dream.
</P>
<P>
   The one where the spirits of the four victims wander through
town, having been ripped away so suddenly that they cannot find
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The one where Drega's specter invades Colebrook again, restless
and menacing.
</P>
<P>
   Lamontagne, a nurse, was across the street from the News &AMP;
Sentinel when Joos and Bunnell were shot. She ran to them, saw
Vickie lying in so much blood that she knew she could only be dead.
She tried hard to save Dennis, felt one of the final flickers of
his pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she still goes to sleep crying. Sometimes she still
wakes up crying.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrigan has come to expect the crashes. His small staff at
the News &AMP; Sentinel still has them sometimes _ days when August 19
rears its head and makes the work of newspapering impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing damn well, considering,'' says Harrigan.
``We're not doing real well compared to what life should be. We're
still living this nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, two staffers could not make it to work.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, they walk across the parking lot where Bunnell's
blood-soaked body lay for hours as police conducted their
investigation and the paper's staff soldiered on and put out the
next edition. Her body was just there, near a spot filled now with
spring pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, they look out the newsroom window at the shiny black
granite memorial. Just there, near the place where Dennis fell.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, they work in a building with a bullethole in it. A
bullethole that could, conceivably, be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Why not push over the monument and fill the puddle in
and ... no,'' says Harrigan. ``In fact, maybe living with it day to
day is a strengthening process.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan and Bunnell had been close for years, dated sometimes.
From the roof of Harrigan's refurbished Cape-style home on South
Hill, you can see Canada. He points down over the hill, past the
sheep's watering trough, to where Bunnell lived.
</P>
<P>
   They both loved thunderstorms. When the sky grew dark and the
lightning started to flash over Monadnock Mountain, they would call
one another and bet supper on whose house the storm would hit.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a storm came in, roiling and beautiful. Harrigan
reached for the phone. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For his work under unimaginable duress on the night of the
massacre, Harrigan nearly won a Pulitzer Prize. He's glad he didn't
win. Not for something like that.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of August 19, Nila Venne stopped at the IGA.
Her 13-year-old son, Ian, stayed in the car to take a nap. Her
9-year-old daughter, Ariel, went into the store with her. Nila
Venne heard that someone was shooting in the parking lot. She ran
to the front of the store. In silhouette, through the white window
posters, she saw Drega standing next to her car, the one with her
child in it, shooting. She was told to get to the back of the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that instinct that all mothers think would send them
running directly into gunfire, Venne knew there was nothing she
could do.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ian heard the gunfire, sat up, saw Drega shoot at Phillips,
heard Phillips screaming for help. The child ducked back down. He
thought he would die, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Drega drove away, and the doors of the IGA slid open, Ian
and his mom ran to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Ian's nightmares have subsided now.
</P>
<P>
   But Colebrook's children, Venne says, learned that day that
people _ even big, important, strong people like police officers _
can die.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Sielicki says the months since the shootings have been
wrought with discipline problems in the schools. Anger management
workshops have been set up for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sielicki says he's not sure how much of that is a direct
correlation to Drega, but that they've never had so many problems
in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Life, of course, goes on. The lilacs are in bloom, the peas are
planted. There are Little League games to be played, fences to
mend.
</P>
<P>
   But Colebrook is the tragedy by which people measure time. There
is Before Colebrook, and then there is now. Healing will come,
eventually, and the searing pain will fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will not fade,'' says Harrigan, his blue eyes like storm
clouds, ``is the image of Shangri-La lost.''

AN OLDER WORLD EXISTS UNDER FAST-GROWING ARIZONA COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ On the surface, the intersection looks like any
other in Maricopa County: service station, shopping plaza, a vacant
lot prime for development.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the pizza parlor and gas pumps is another world
altogether, one that disappeared half a millennium ago but that
still speaks to archeologists in central and southern Arizona. They
happened upon this particular piece of it when the city decided to
widen the road, and backhoes turned up yet another village of the
prehistoric people known as the Hohokam.
</P>
<P>
   But with Maricopa County growing faster than any other in the
country, archeologists fear that Hohokam sites are disappearing
daily, before they even have a chance to record their existence.
Concern about sprawl is so great that a volunteer group formed a
sort of 911 service _ the South West Archeology Team, or SWAT _ to
handle emergency surveys and excavations when a site is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers see us as the kiss of death,'' said Jerry Howard,
curator of archeology at the Mesa Southwest Museum. ``They think
we're going to interfere with construction, maybe stop the project,
cost them a lot of money. ... But we can get in and look at the
site before the construction crews even get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the entire city of Phoenix and much of the
surrounding area built on the ancient civilization's ruins, the
tensions between archeology buffs and developers are apparent. Each
new golf course or luxury condominium sits atop a potential site of
the Hohokam, expert farmers who lived from about 300 BC to AD 1450
and whose disappearance has spawned various theories.
</P>
<P>
   At one proposed housing development in the town of Cave Creek
north of Phoenix, hand-lettered signs read ``Preserve Spur Cross,''
as it is known. The archeological grapevine buzzes about
petroglyphs, pit-houses, and the Hohokam equivalent of apartment
complexes. Planning commission meetings around the county are
packed with amateur archeologists who say too much history has been
lost already.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another decade, it'll be too late,'' said Glen Rice, an
archeologist at Arizona State University. ``We don't need to
excavate every site. We could put them aside for the future, when
our techniques are much better. In the meantime, we're losing our
ability to study them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Added James Britton, chairman of the SWAT team, ``We have to do
what we can while we have the chance, before it all gets bulldozed
over.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, archeologists say, they must rely on the largesse of
developers, who are under no legal obligation to safeguard
archeological sites on private land unless their construction
projects involve federal money or permits. Under state law, only
burial sites must be reported, and the remains handed over.
Otherwise, each municipality has its own rules; the county
encourages preservation but has no corresponding ordinance, said
Joy Rich, acting director of planning and development.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nath, Mesa's engineering and construction director,
conceded that the city does no archeological surveys unless it is
aware that ruins are in the area. If only local money is involved,
such as with the road widening, no survey is required. Locals,
however, did persuade Mesa to buy a major platform mound, believed
to be a religious site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public land is iffy; it's a farce on private land,'' Grace
Schoonover, a Phoenix native and amateur archeologist whose Cave
Creek home office is filled with survey maps and artists'
renderings of the intricate web of canals dug by the Hohokam.
``Anyone who finds burials, they're supposed to stop immediately
and report them. That doesn't mean they always do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Developers who do right by archeological ruins are what
Schoonover calls ``the good guys,'' and there are plenty of them
even in the 9,238 square miles that make up Maricopa County, whose
population grew more than 27 percent to 2.7 million from 1990 to
1997, according to the US Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers, such as Jerry and Florence Nelson, have
sponsored excavations and even donated ruin-rich land to the
Archeological Conservancy, a nonprofit group based in Albuquerque.
Today, the conservancy has 14 sites in Arizona, but just one in the
Phoenix area _ the Hohokam village on 2 acres in the midst of the
posh Scottsdale subdivision that the Nelsons built.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is show developers that there is usually a
way to preserve the archeological resources and still allow
development,'' said James Walker, southwest regional director of
the conservancy, which preserves but does not necessarily excavate
the sites. ``As a result, many of our preserves are in the middle
of subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists say they are not trying to stop development, and
that they too understand the need for more housing and stores to
serve the burgeoning population. ``Whenever we're sitting around
complaining, I always say, `Yeah, they should've stopped building
right after they built my house,''' said Vicky Erhart, an amateur
archeologist and SWAT team member. ``We're all living on top of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not the cities, not the state, not the developers _ has
enough money to excavate the hundreds, maybe even thousands, of
sites in Maricopa County alone. Instead, the aim is to record what
information can be obtained before the next minimall is built. In
the Phoenix area, about 15 companies provide that service, handling
the archeology angle for clients in the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Archeology Research Services, for instance, works on about 120
projects year, most of them surveying, some of them involving data
testing and recovery, said projects manager Serelle Laine. A recent
survey for the city of Tempe uncovered three sensitive acres, which
turned out to be Hohokam hearths and roasting pits, among other
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had instances where the developer started out planning
on meeting the minimum requirements. But if you get a really cool
site, they get into it,'' Laine said. ``Generally, though, they're
not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. It depends on the
hooks, the permits, or land jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, amateur and professional archeologists alike
want stricter regulations regarding Hohokam ruins, many of them
long since plowed underground, but some of them still visible at
surface level. As a model, they cite Pima County, which includes
Tucson and requires developers to find ways to lessen the impact on
archeological sites. Many would also force adherence by even
single-house developers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Frank Casanova began developing his six acres outside
Phoenix almost two decades ago, he and his friends at the state
archeological society have been digging in his back yard. So far,
they have uncovered four blocks of rooms and the remains of three
infants, complete with tiny jars, in the burial grounds. ``How
could someone not be interested in this?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mueller, an artist and electrical supplies salesman,
wasn't initially interested in the possibility of ruins on his new
Cave Creek property. Then a friend who is an amateur archeologist
insisted on walking the property. After stepping two feet, she told
him it was packed with pottery shards, digging tools, and other
Hohokam artifacts. So Mueller called Schoonover, and she recently
presented him with a map detailing dozens of spots that should be
investigated before the groundbreaking in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wouldn't have occurred to me, but now I can see
things all over the place,'' said Mueller, an avid arrowhead
collector who has since joined the archeological society.
``Hopefully, we can salvage as much as possible, and I can still
build on time. But I don't think anymore that you should plow
something under without first seeing what's there.''

   HEART-OBESITY-MED _ NEW YORK _ Obesity has graduated from a
contributing risk factor for heart disease to a major one, experts
from the American Heart Association are scheduled to announce here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But congratulations are not in order, as the promotion now
places obesity in the same class with other preventable
heart-disease risk factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle, according to Dr. Robert H.
Eckel, vice-chairman of the American Heart Association's (AHA)
volunteer nutrition committee and a professor of medicine and
physiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly, obesity was considered a contributing factor to heart
disease, but recent evidence has shown that it is, in fact, a major
risk factor, Eckel said at an AHA-sponsored media briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But modest weight loss of 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight
can reduce blood pressure levels and high cholesterol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckel called for more research into the causes of obesity and
suggested a need ``to develop better treatment and lifestyle
strategies to address the issue of obesity without passing moral
judgment.'' (DEVELOPING) (500 WORDS)

   PROSTATE-CANCER-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ A blood test that helps detect
prostate cancer has been very effective in detecting the disease in
men of all ages. But new research indicates that similar tests
results do not necessarily mean similar outcomes in older and
younger men.
</P>
<P>
   Men ages 61 to 73 were consistently more likely to have less
curable cancer when compared to younger men, even if their prostate
specific antigen (PSA) levels were the same. PSA is a protein made
by the prostate and high levels indicate that the prostate is
enlarged and possibly cancerous. The PSA blood test and digital
rectal exam are the most common methods used to detect prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add to the debate over whether to continue testing
men with raised PSA levels, according to lead researcher Dr. H.
Ballentine Carter, an associate professor of urology at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The findings indicate that age may be an important guide in
determining whether to further test men, Carter reported on Sunday
here at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``PSA is a test commonly used in the detection of prostate
cancer. However, the threshold value that should prompt further
evaluation is unclear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore urologist noted that lowering the threshold may
cause doctors to spot more harmless tumors, but raising the
threshold might leave life-threatening cancers undetected. (500

   HEALTH-ONLINE-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE MONDAY AT 5 P.M.
EASTERN _ Parents should be wary of health advice available on the
Internet, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the medical information is incorrect or out of date,
researchers reported in the June issue of the electronic edition of
the journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Since just about anyone with a computer _ regardless of medical
expertise _ can publish on the World Wide Web, ``it can present bad
medicine on an equal plane with good,'' according to Dr. H. Juhling
McClung of the Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public

   DROWN-PREVENT-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE MONDAY AT 5 P.M.
EASTERN _ Fences can help keep young children away from swimming
pools when adults are not around, but they do not prevent all
drownings, a national survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of more than 5,200 adults showed that 76
percent of home and apartment pools had adequate fencing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all pools had been properly fenced, the number of
children younger than 5 years old who drowned would have only
dropped by 19 percent, researchers at the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta reported in the
June issue of the electronic edition of the journal Pediatrics.

A BULGING X-FILES GAME

   LOS ANGELES _ If you have a tough enough time every Sunday night
unraveling the complex threads of a vast government-alien
conspiracy involving shadowy figures with mysterious powers bent on
subjugating the world, just wait until you try the X-Files
interactive computer adventure game.
</P>
<P>
   All seven CD-ROMs of it.
</P>
<P>
   The massive X-Files game is out there, or at least it will be in
a few days, arriving in stores a week or so ahead of the theatrical
release of ``The X-Files'' movie and about three weeks after the
end of the smash television show's fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the game as a way to get your X fix all summer.
</P>
<P>
   With an 800-page script that has numerous possible endings,
depending on your choices and attitudes, and takes 30 to 40 hours
to play through each time, there's enough to keep a game Xer, or X
gamer, occupied until the new season starts in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a game with seven CDs is just insane,'' said Bill
Paris, a video-game writer and columnist for Next Generation and
PlayStation magazines. ``That's a new one on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the game, which is being billed as another
episode of the show, is staggering compared to other games on the
market, which seldom need more than two or three CD-ROMs to contain
all their elements, said Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And the space has been well-used. After three years of work,
they've come up with a computer game every bit as distinctive and
engaging as the show upon which it is based. May the movie be as
good.
</P>
<P>
   The game's excellence isn't a total surprise, given the
involvement of many of the talents _ on both sides of the camera _
who have made the show a smash hit for five years.
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their roles as Fox
Mulder and Dana Sculley, the pair of FBI agents who investigate
paranormal X-file cases against a paranoiac backdrop of dark
government conspiracy with aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Show creator Chris Carter, writer/co-creator Frank Spotnitz,
photography director Jon Joffin and music director Mark Snow also
had a hand in the production, said associate producer Luke Letizia.
</P>
<P>
   The game also includes such well-known supporting characters as
Assistant Director Skinner and the loopy Lone Gunmen, the three
technophiliac oddballs who help Mulder from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the game is set somewhere between the show's third
and fourth seasons, it even includes some long-dead characters,
including ``X,'' the undercover operative who before his own
untimely assassination sometimes fed information to Mulder, said
Letizia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they really do have the real people in there is
a great boost,'' said Paris. ``The problem someone like LucasArts
has with their (`Star Wars' movie-based game) licenses is that they
just put generic actors in those roles.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different from the TV show or movie, of course, is that
in the game, the player controls the story's outcome through
decisions and interactions with other characters.
</P>
<P>
   The use of software called VirtualCinema 3.0 makes a big
difference in the way the game plays, creating an experience far
better than older games that use full-motion video to tell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   The technology easily handles the demands of displaying
high-quality video and audio while allowing players to click on
clues, keep track of their equipment and work through the game's
complex story line.
</P>
<P>
   The use of high-quality, letterboxed digital video shot
specially for the game makes a big difference, too. It just looks
good, as sleek and dark and atmospheric as the Sunday night shows.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the game's producers shot more than 40 hours of video
over seven weeks in Seattle last fall in between Vancouver shoots
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was eventually edited down to just four hours of
footage, still a huge amount by computer-game standards, Letizia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The game starts as a player's character, young FBI agent Craig
Willmore, is summoned to the bureau director's office and asked to
locate the missing Sculley and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading out on the road in search of the pair, Agent
Willmore gathers a variety of gear, including a Nokia cellular
phone with a menu of built-in ``numbers'' for key sources, and a
Newton 2000 personal digital assistant to navigate locations and
access field notes.
</P>
<P>
   The player also can log into the Intelligence Network Gateway, a
computer system that provides still more information needed to
track down Mulder and Sculley and help solve the case they have
been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes many delightful touches, including in-joke
props that refer to various ``X-Files'' episodes, such as a book of
Mulder's by Jose Chung, the goofy character played by Charles
Nelson Reilly in a particularly hilarious episode.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, among the many preferences you can modify in the
game are the beam and brightness of the player's flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be `The X-Files' without flashlights, so you can
adjust that,'' Letizia said.
</P>
<P>
   At many points in the game, the player is asked how to interact
with other characters, with a choice of attitudes such as
``funny,'' ``indifferent'' or ``paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How you make those decisions affects how they (the other
characters) react,'' Letizia said. ``They may give you extra
assistance, or throw you off (the trail).''
</P>
<P>
   Really inappropriate or stupid behavior brings rebukes from
other characters, or even leaves your character dead. Game over.
Willmore on a slab. Restart.
</P>
<P>
   And because Fox expects the game to attract wide interest, it
has included ``artificial intuition,'' sort of the computer
equivalent of saying ``warmer, warmer'' when looking for clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we put it in is there are a lot of `X-Files' fans
out there who aren't gamers,'' said Letizia. ``Hard-core gamers can
turn it off if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Letizia said the game normally should take 30 to 40 hours to
complete. And because the story branches in significantly different
ways, it is possible to play the game repeatedly and have a
different experience each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several different endings,'' Letizia said. ``So
there's definitely replayability.''
</P>
<P>
   The game shouldn't be confused with the recently released
X-Files Unrestricted Access CD-ROM, however.
</P>
<P>
   That title, though attractively wrought, is designed to be
something of an interactive encyclopedia of all things X. But it is
no game, appealing mostly to hard-core fans who want to decorate
their computers with ``X-Files'' wallpaper, parse through script
synopses or check out a Web site for episode updates.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files game, however, should appeal to a much broader
crowd, something Fox is counting on with a suggested retail price
of $54.95, only slightly higher than most computer games, even
though it contains so many CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the game's heavy use of video and demanding
technology, it requires at least a 603e PowerPC Macintosh or
Pentium 120 MHz PC to run.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials are mum about how much they spent to create the
game but said they are proud of the way it looks and plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think the overall project really sets the bar for
full-motion video games. We wanted to produce a first-class title,
so we put a lot of resources into it,'' Letizia said. ``But it's
not like `Titanic`.''

MEMORIAL DAY STILL MEANS SOMETHING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the intersection of VFW Parkway and LaGrange Street in West
Roxbury there is a sign that stands like a silent sentry reminding
us of a proud past filled with a quiet sadness that lingers still
across all the years even though the American memory seems to have
less and less capacity to recall the cruel and true costs of war.
It is a memorial to brothers _ Thomas and Gerald Keenan _ who died
in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, thousands pass through the busy crossroads. And, each
day, the sign is there, nearly invisible to those idling in autos:
``Keenan Memorial Square,'' the top line reads. ``Thomas W. Jr. _
US Marines, 1920-1944.'' And, right beside the brief reference to
that young man, ``Gerald J. _ US Navy, 1925-1944. Brothers who gave
the supreme sacrifice for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time I wondered about those brave boys. Who were
they? Where did they live? When did they die? Who _ and what _ did
they leave behind?
</P>
<P>
   The other day along LaGrange, nobody seemed to know. It's
understandable; too much time has passed. People come, people go.
Families move, taking local lore or the treasure of stories spawned
on city streets to new ZIP codes and suburban destinations where
the past is homogenized, packed away or even forgotten, like relics
in an attic.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four years ago, the United States was a different country.
The dimension, the scope and the staggering casualties of a great
war fought on two fronts had reached into every household. The
Depression had been defeated. D-Day sent a coast-to-coast current
of electric euphoria that was offset only by the continual drumroll
and the sound of ``Taps'' that echoed in graveyards of small towns
as well as big cities where so many families were touched with the
tears and the toll of burying their heroic dead.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's Cemetery is just a quarter-mile from the sign. And
there, in a lovely grotto surrounded by the shade of a mature elm,
a flat, stone marker was discovered in freshly cut grass. This is
where Thomas and Gerald came after being brought home from their
war.
</P>
<P>
   Shut your eyes and you can see them still _ and you can sense
the society that mourned them after they lost their lives in
battles that helped deliver the gift of liberty we open each
morning. They returned to a place where self-pity was a stranger,
where neighbors knew each other, where people actually volunteered
for duty and willingly went without staples like sugar or gas
because the cause was greater than any individual need, the
collective will stronger than the smug selfishness that often sets
us apart today.
</P>
<P>
   But who were they? And what did they leave behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you need to talk to my uncle,'' said the young man who
answered the door at the house where both boys grew up. ``They know
the story. And it's still sad to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Helen Keenan had 10 children, seven boys and three
girls. The father was a Boston firefighter. The family lived in
West Roxbury. After Pearl Harbor, the oldest, Tom Jr., joined the
Marine Corps. A few months later, his brother Gerald enlisted in
the Navy after Roslindale High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas died in the battle for Tinian Island,'' his brother
Joe, 71, recalled yesterday. ``He died July 14, 1944. A priest came
to the house with the fellow from Western Union. That's how we were
told: a telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks later, Gerald died when the Japs torpedoed his ship,
the Canberra. Funny thing is, I helped build that boat at the
Charlestown Navy Yard. It was a very difficult time. My parents
never got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers came back to Boston together in death. They were
waked at the old Legion Post in West Roxbury, blocks from their
boyhood home, and buried side-by-side on Aug. 28, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, World War II was over. Germany
surrendered the following spring. The Japanese conceded defeat in
late summer, all because so many brave young men swallowed their
fear and delivered their lives to a common cause not often recalled
all these years later.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Keenan was 23. His brother Gerald was 19. And yesterday _
Memorial Day _ was all about them.

of U.S. manned space activity for the past three years, stays on
Mir are about to join Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as
historical artifacts of the nation's space program. The shuttle
Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir later this week and
retrieve astronaut Andrew Thomas, the last of seven American to
work on the station in the last three years. A look at what has
been learned by the experience. By Warren E. Leary.

   SCI-DRUG-MISUSE (Undated) _ Millions of Americans fail to take
their medications as prescribed and are attracting a flood of
attention in the health-care world. Study after study over the last
20 years has shown that misuse of prescription drugs is a worldwide
epidemic every bit as dangerous and costly as an actual medical
illness. It was tagged ``America's other drug problem'' when
researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent
of hospital and nursing home admissions studied.

   &UR; Renting a Scooter in Rome &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Having visited Rome years ago, I remember the traffic, the
outrageous maneuvers of the many drivers and the difficulty in
getting a cab. Is it possible to rent a motor scooter? _ Linda
Imhauser, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Given your reservations about the drivers, you may want to
observe the traffic for a bit to refresh your memory and see if a
motor scooter makes sense for you. Roman drivers can be quite
reckless, and a certain propensity to disregard the rules of the
road is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Helmets are included in the cost of rental, and a scooter with
an engine larger than 125 cc. requires a driver's license. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renting a scooter at Scoot-A-Long, at 302 Via Cavour, telephone
(39-6) 6780206, costs $144 to $201 a week (at 1,738 lire to the
dollar), depending on the model. The charge includes value added
tax as well as insurance for theft up to the full cost of the
scooter and minimal accident coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A passport or a driver's license is required as is a credit card
against which the company charges a refundable deposit of $173.
Hours: 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. daily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scooters for Rent, at 84 Via della Purificazione, (39-6)
4885485, has more models to choose from and is a little more
expensive. Weekly rates range from $230 for the least powerful
models to $525 for 600-cc. motorcycles. The price includes VAT and
insurance, which covers 75 percent of the value of the scooter and
provides minimal accident coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, a passport or other document is necessary as is a
credit card against which a deposit _ ranging from $173 to $2,012,
depending on the model _ is charged. Hours: 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Limit on Use of Phone Cards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why can't I use a phone card at the Port Authority Bus
Terminal in midtown Manhattan? For some reason, the Port Authority
has disabled its phones so that phone cards and such devices as
voice-mail can't be used. _ Joel Margolis, Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, phone cards of the major companies _ AT&AMP;T, MCI and
Sprint, among others _ can be used to make a call. But if you dial
a company's 800 number, you will not be able to gain access to such
voice-mail functions as retrieving messages, according to Ken
Philmus, former manager of the midtown terminal and now deputy
general manager at Kennedy International Airport. As the tiny type
on notices affixed to almost all of the phones at the bus depot
says: ``This phone does not permit access to: paging or V-mail
systems; incoming calls; international calls.'' As is the case at
the city's other major depots, incoming international calls are not
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these policies is the widespread fraudulent use
of phone cards in the early 1990s. Stolen card numbers were
obtained by shoulder surfing _ eavesdropping or watching someone
make a legitimate call and then using that caller's card number. In
addition, hackers were breaking into corporate voice-mail systems.
With almost 200 pay phones, the bus depot has one of the largest
number of such phones in the city. ``In 1990 and 1991, the terminal
was a different place,'' Philmus said. ``We had 6,500 crimes a
year. Now we're down to 2,500 crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone-card fraud and the crime it attracted had also plagued
other city depots, which took action, too. At Penn Station, notices
on pay phones urge caution when using phone credit cards. In
addition, panels on either side of the keypad deter unwelcome
onlookers. A test of several phones at the station found that
voice-mail messages could be retrieved but that punching in too
many voice-mail commands _ what the breaking point is is not clear
_ produced the message ``No additional dialing allowed'' and caused
the keypad to go dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Central Terminal, no international outgoing calls can
be made and access to voice-mail may also be limited, Dan Brucker,
a spokesman for Metro-North, said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that phone fraud has abated, the Port Authority has decided
on a six-month experiment at the bus terminal: Since January about
a dozen phones without distinguishing markings have allowed access
to voice-mail and to outgoing international calls. The test's
results will determine future steps, Philmus said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Layover in Brussels &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will have a layover at the Brussels airport from 7:45 a.m.
until 2:55 p.m. Can you recommend how to use this time to see some
of Brussels? Susan P. Levine, M.D., River Forest, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A. The airport, Zaventem, could hardly be handier to the city:
The train from Zaventem runs every 20 minutes during the day, and
it's just a 18-minute ride to the Gare Centrale. The fare is $2.35
second class and $3.60 first class (at 37 Belgian francs to the
dollar). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the station it's a five-minute walk to the Grand'Place,
which is bounded by a constellation of guild houses _ dating from
the 18th century and later _ for bakers, brewers, boatmen and
coopers, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Since the museums and the City Hall don't open till 10 a.m., you
could stop at a cafe on the Grand'Place or observe the flower
market there; it runs till 11 or 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could explore the Galeries St.-Hubert, a glassed-in
luxury shopping arcade where you'll find places to eat and stores
selling goods including Neuhaus chocolates and Delvaux handbags.
</P>
<P>
   The Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts comprises the Musee d'Art
Ancien, at 3 Rue de la Regence, and the Musee d'Art Moderne, 1
Place Royale. On their walls you will find the works of Pieter
Bruegel the Elder, Rubens, Van Dyck and Memling as well as those of
such 19th- and 20th-century artists as James Ensor and Paul Delvaux
of Belgium and of Seurat, Bonnard, Signac and Vuillard. (The
Magrittes are in a special exhibition ending June 28 that is sold
out.) Single entry fee to both museums: $4.10. Closed Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Centre Belge de la Band Dessinnee (the Belgian Comic Strip
Museum), at 20 Rue des Sables, will be of interest of fans of
Tintin. Original plates by his creator, Herge, are on view there.
The museum will also attract admirers of its designer, the Art
Nouveau architect Victor Horta known for his interiors and
furniture. Admission: $5.50. Closed Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another worthwhile stop is the 15th-century Hotel de Ville, or
City Hall, which dominates the Grand'Place. The treasures include
18th-century tapestries and artworks depicting noted personalities.
A self-guided tour costs $2.20.
</P>
<P>
   This list is hardly comprehensive, of course, but time is short.

AIRLINES PREPARE TO FIGHT HEART ATTACKS ALOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 7)  
 (JT)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among a planeload of passengers there is almost
always a doctor, nurse or medical technician, but when an airliner
is at cruise altitude, the nearest equipment to diagnose or treat a
heart attack is usually seven miles below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Alaska
Airlines are equipping their planes with a machine that is a
combination heart monitor and defibrillator _ that is, a device
that produces an EKG, and one that shocks the heart back into
normal rhythm if necessary. The device is already credited with
saving one passenger's life, on a flight from Dallas to Mexico City
on Feb. 18, and has helped many other times to determine whether a
stricken passenger was, in fact, having a heart attack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In equipping their planes, the airlines are following the lead
set by Qantas, which flies mostly long over-water flights where
there is no place to land in an emergency. But the United States
carriers are planning the equipment for their domestic flights,
too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the big airlines adopt the policy, Congress has directed the
Federal Aviation Administration to study whether all airlines
should be required to carry more medical equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medical emergency may not be the first risk that leaps to a
traveler's mind when boarding an airplane, but in some years heart
attacks in the sky are more frequent than deaths or injuries in
crashes. The FAA does not keep statistics, but the Air Transport
Association, the trade group of the big airlines, asked its members
to keep track during 1996, and it counted 141 heart attacks and 433
cases of passengers complaining of chest pain. Among the 578
million passengers that year, there were 10,500 medical incidents _
one for each 55,000 passengers, or one for each 780 flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say they cannot keep track of fatalities because
once a patient is taken off a plane, they do not follow up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heart equipment the airlines are using is a $3,000
battery-powered device called Forerunner, manufactured by
Heartstream Inc., a Seattle company. The device has been sold to
police and other nonmedical agencies, the company says, because it
can be used with very little training.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After paddles are applied to a patient's chest, the device
senses electrical currents from the heart and decides whether a
heart attack is, in fact, in progress, and whether defibrillation
is needed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At American, John Hotard, a spokesman, said that since his
company began putting the Forerunners on its planes about a year
ago, they had been used 49 times, but in only three cases did the
Forerunner decide that shocks were needed. Two passengers died
anyway but the third, on Feb. 18, survived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The machine provides data that a doctor could use to make
treatment decisions. ``We have found, if the first nine months are
any indication, that the machine has more value to the doctor as a
heart monitor than actually shocking someone,'' Hotard said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the diagnostic tool on board, American has also beefed up
the medical kits on its planes, Hotard said. These kits, separate
from the first-aid kits kept in the cabin, are in the cockpit and
can be released only by the captain; they contain prescription
drugs that can be used to treat cardiac arrest, epileptic seizure,
asthma, bronchitis, psychosis, nausea, vomiting and other
disorders. The drugs could be administered by a physician who
happened to be on board, or on the orders of an airline physician
on the ground, contacted by radio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American began installing the defibrillators in November 1996.
In March of this year it announced that it would equip all its 640
aircraft by this November. Alaska Airlines said in February that it
would equip all its planes, and Delta said in January that by 2000
all its flights, including commuter flights, would carry the
Forerunner and enhanced medical kits.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Separately, legislation now before Congress would offer
good-Samaritan protection against lawsuits to anyone who assisted a
stricken passenger, whether a member of the cabin crew or a fellow
passenger. Many states have such laws for highway accident victims,
but the law covering plane passengers is not clear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the drugs and the heart devices may help sick patients,
they can also help the airlines and all the other passengers,
aviation experts say. An emergency stop, counting landing fees and
extra fuel, can run from $3,000 to $5,000, and make hundreds of
passengers miss their connections.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American has to divert a plane for medical reasons about 150
times a year, Hotard said, or about one flight in 5,400. The Air
Transport Association study found 557 emergency landings for
medical reasons in 1996, of which 183, or about a third, were for
cardiovascular problems. Other reasons included neurological
problems (88), seizures (51), respiratory problems (37),
gastrointestinal problems (33) and ``other'' (93).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other reasons for landing: in-flight trauma (10),
pregnancy (9), allergy to food (4), unruly passenger (1) and death
(7). Of the 529 million passengers carried that year, 42 died in
flight.

PERSONAL HEALTH: ADDING YEARS TO LIFE AND LIFE TO YEARS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People with bad health habits that they will not or cannot
abandon often make excuses: ``What's the point of living longer _
you'll only spend more years in a nursing home?'' or ``A healthy
life really isn't any longer, it just seems that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the saddest excuse of all dates back to 1964 when the
surgeon general issued the first report on smoking and health.
Diehard smokers told me, ``By the time I get lung cancer, they'll
know how to cure it.'' If only that had happened. But 34 years
later we are hardly closer to curing lung cancer than we were then.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is none of these excuses hold up under the scrutiny of
sound medical research, and a recently published study of more than
1,700 men and women followed for 32 years puts the lie to them all.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in April in The New England Journal of
Medicine, clearly showed that people with healthier habits not only
live longer, they live better, experiencing only half as much
chronic disability as their less-prudent age mates.
</P>
<P>
   The findings strongly suggest that vitality into one's later
years is less a matter of genes and more a question of how a person
chooses to live. Those who smoked the least, stayed trim and
exercised regularly not only lived longer but were less likely to
develop disabilities. Even among participants who died, the
low-risk people had shorter periods of disability before dying.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dr. James Fries, professor of medicine at Stanford
University, published a provocative article suggesting that
preventive health practices would keep Americans healthier longer
and change the shape of the nation's disability and death curve
from one that resembles a water slide to one that looks more like a
cliff.
</P>
<P>
   According to his ``compression of morbidity'' hypothesis, most
Americans, instead of experiencing a more-or-less steady rate of
increasing disability and deaths starting at mid-life, could live
reasonably well into their 80s, before they begin to die at an
accelerated rate.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, if people could be persuaded to choose
more prudent health habits, the majority would reach their ninth
decade in good health and then die after, at most, a relatively
brief period of illness.
</P>
<P>
   But some skeptics challenged Fries, suggesting instead that
practicing good health habits, while likely to add years to life,
would also swell the number of years during which people are beset
by chronic illness and disability. If true, critics said, this
would further overwhelm an already overburdened system struggling
to care for millions of elderly Americans with costly,
debilitating, lingering health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two decades after Fries' proposal, he and his
colleagues have data that dispute the naysayers. According to their
new findings, living healthfully would not only add years to life,
it would also add life to years, keeping people well and able to
enjoy life far longer than they otherwise might have.
</P>
<P>
   Although the participants' average age was only 75 at the last
assessment, there is every indication that those with healthy
habits will on average remain in better health however long they
live. Those whose habits put them at lowest risk for health
problems delayed the average age at which they developed even
minimal disability by nearly seven years _ to age 73 as against age
66 for those at highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tracked 1,741 men and women who graduated from
the University of Pennsylvania in 1939 and 1940. These alumni were
surveyed by other researchers at the time of graduation and again
in 1962, 1976 and 1980 before the Stanford team took over and
reassessed their health habits and health status annually for seven
years starting in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were classified as being at high, moderate or low
risk based on three modifiable factors known to contribute to poor
health: cigarette smoking, excess weight and inactivity. At every
assessment _ even when the participants were only about 43 years
old _ those at highest risk were more likely to report disabilities
than those at moderate risk, who in turn had more disabilities than
those at low risk.
</P>
<P>
   The authors emphasize that for the overwhelming majority these
risk factors are matters of personal choice. But it is all too
obvious that a growing number are making the wrong choices.
</P>
<P>
   Although tens of millions of adults have quit smoking in the
last 34 years, we now face the chilling fact that as many as 40
percent of students in some high schools are smoking. The tobacco
industry has been particularly successful in hooking teen-age girls
and young blacks on this noxious weed. And if you think young
Americans smoke too much, in many European countries it is hard to
find any young person without a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity, too, is a growing concern. Americans on the whole are
fatter now than at any time in our history. People tend to blame
the ready availability of high-calorie foods and the constant
temptation to eat too much, especially too much fatty, sugary
foods. Few seem to have the will to resist overindulging.
</P>
<P>
   But the food supply and eating habits are not the only culprits.
Inactivity has a major, deleterious influence on the weight of
Americans. Having created a society replete with labor-saving
devices, we failed to compensate adequately for our relative
inactivity by building more exercise into our daily routines and
leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one American in five gets enough exercise to keep
weight down and health up. And there is virtually no physical
activity in the lives of 60 percent of Americans, whose exercise
consists of little more than pressing a finger to the television
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those who exercise regularly weigh less and are better able
to achieve and maintain weight loss. Thus, in addition to its
direct health benefits, for example, in preventing cardiovascular
diseases and cancer, exercise can help control weight.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors not assessed in the Fries study also influence
health. But the people who stayed trim and exercised, in all
likelihood, regularly ate more healthfully as well. I think you get
the point: at any stage of life, it pays to pay attention to
preventive health practices. Good health and longevity are largely
in your hands.

   New York Times editors are CONSIDERING these stories for
Tuesday's Page 1:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Deadline at 4:30 p.m. today for the
White House to respond to Kenneth Starr's request for taking an
executive privilege dispute directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ What the primaries tell us about
campaigning in an era of prosperity. A political memo By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HMO-LOBBY (Washington) _ A look at the high-stakes lobbying
surrounding the HMO debate as House Republicans prepare a final
draft of a bill and Democrats step up the pressure, looking to
score political points. Insurance groups launch a new set of radio
and print ads and mobilize business leaders. Senate Democrats,
meanwhile, have featured a ``victim'' a day on the floor. They have
even reached out to Helen Hunt, who played an HMO-bashing mother in
``As Good As It Gets,'' to do promos. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-TRANSIT-STRIKE (Washington) _ Philadelphia transit
workers make good on their strike threat and walk off their jobs at
noon, bringing public transportation to a halt in a city that can
ill afford a protracted labor dispute. But no quick solution is in
sight. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   SD-TORNADO (Spencer, S.D.) _ A tiny South Dakota town surveys
the aftermath of a killer tornado that left four dead and most of
the place in a shambles. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   AHP-MONSANTO (Undated) _ American Home Products acquires
Monsanto for about $34.4 billion in stock, creating one of the
world's largest makers of pharmaceuticals, seeds and herbicides.
The purchase price represents almost no premium to Monsanto's
market value. Monsanto, which spun off its chemicals business last
year to focus on genetically engineered crops and agricultural
products, agreed three weeks ago to buy DeKalb Genetics and Delta
and Pine Land for $4.1 billion. The acquisition by American Home
adds Monsanto's arthritis drugs, including at least one potential
blockbuster, to American Home's Advil painkiller and Premarin
hormone-replacement therapy. American Home and SmithKline Beecham
broke off merger talks in January.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-TRADE-ZONE (Colon, Pamama) _ It has been called a ``den
of pirates'' by an American government official and a steamy, seedy
nest of intrigue by the novelist John Le Carre. It is also the
world's largest free-trade zone outside of Hong Kong. Now the zone,
the Colon Free Zone in Panama, is attempting to remake itself. By
Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-NUKE (Islamabad) _ Developments in Pakistan. By John
Kifner.

President P.W. Botha resumes. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MIR (Undated) _ Visits to the Russian space station Mir by
American space shuttle crews are about to end. After being a focus
of U.S. manned space activity for the past three years, stays on
Mir are about to join Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as
historical artifacts of the nation's space program. The shuttle
Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir later this week and
retrieve astronaut Andrew Thomas, the last of seven American to
work on the station in the last three years. A look at what has
been learned by the experience. By Warren E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUG-MISUSE (Undated) _ Millions of Americans fail to take
their medications as prescribed and are attracting a flood of
attention in the health-care world. Study after study over the last
20 years has shown that misuse of prescription drugs is a worldwide
epidemic every bit as dangerous and costly as an actual medical
illness. It was tagged ``America's other drug problem'' when
researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent
of hospital and nursing home admissions studied.

THE HIGH PRICE OF GETTING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By STEPHEN MANES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most appealing aspects of the Web is getting
something for nothing, not counting connection fees. One short-term
no-cost offering is Outlook 98, the latest version of Microsoft's
ambitious calendar, E-mail and address book package.
</P>
<P>
   The software (not to be confused with the very different
E-mail-only Outlook Express program that comes with Internet
Explorer) is available free for the downloading at
www.microsoft.com/outlook/ until June 30; a CD-ROM can be ordered
for $9.95. On July 1, the official price goes up to $109 except for
registered users of Office 97, Outlook 97 or Exchange Server.
</P>
<P>
   Something for nothing often ends up incurring subtle costs.
First surprise: If you already have Microsoft Office 97, you may
first need to install the Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch, also
known as SR-1. This is a collection of repairs for several
unfortunate gaffes, including the one in Word 97 that refused to
save files correctly in the prior Word format despite what the
program claimed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   SR-1 also repairs one of my all-time favorite demonstrations of
Microsoft's emphasis on quality, the Outlook calendar that put
Thanksgiving on various Tuesdays and Wednesdays over the next few
years, but never on Thursday, not even in the year 2000. Since the
SR-1 fixes must be in place before you can use a forthcoming SR-2
patch, which includes another hunk of code that repairs potential
errors in Excel's spreadsheets, installing SR-1 is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent versions of Office already include the SR-1 fixes,
but it can be impossible to tell until you have installed the
program. The clue: When you run a repaired version and click the
``About'' item under the Help menu, the rubric ``SR-1'' will appear
after the program's name. Retail copies sold today should contain
the updated code, but a CD with the defective version came with a
new Micron computer that I tested a month ago, and other computer
makers may still be shipping the unfixed version.
</P>
<P>
   Things get stranger. If for some reason you need to reinstall
Office 97 or one of its programs, you will need to run the patch
again. Worse, if you need to install a smaller component, you will
need to uninstall Office in its entirety, reinstall it, and then
run the patch program. The details in all their stupefying glory
are available at the hard-to-find
-www.microsoft.com/office/office97/servicerelease/sr1readme.htm
page.
</P>
<P>
   So one expense of getting Outlook 98 for nothing is your time.
Microsoft's Web site informed me that the 7-megabyte patch download
would take a minimum of 35 minutes over a 28.8 kilobit-per-second
modem. It actually took a lot longer. Two successive attempts to
grab the file from Microsoft's own site and one in California
stalled halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   A site in New Zealand actually worked. The final round started
with the Internet Explorer 3 announcement that the estimated
download time was 36 minutes, which swelled to 40, then an hour,
then more before ending with a series of countdowns that claimed 11
seconds remaining, then 7,5,4,1 and _ whoops! _ 1 minute, 2
seconds. Including the false starts, the whole process took two
hours. When I finally got to install the thing, a dispiriting
message warned that ``the patch can take up to 45 minutes to finish
depending on your hardware,'' but on a fast new machine it took
only 5.
</P>
<P>
   If you fail to check out the system requirements for Outlook 98,
you might miss an essential point. The program requires Internet
Explorer 4.01 and installs it for you unless it is already on your
machine. That wipes out any previous version, even if you happen to
prefer it, but you do get to enjoy IE 4.01's many bugs and
anomalies and a reduction in disk space, and you can still use
Netscape Navigator if you want to. On my machine, which already had
Outlook 97 and Internet Explorer 3 installed, the ``standard''
installation grabbed 54 megabytes of disk space for itself despite
omitting some potentially useful optional components. The official
download estimate was three to four hours; in the interest of
sanity I cheated and used a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   And once Outlook 98 was finally up and running? Well, it can do
all sorts of things you may have never even considered, like
turning an electronic message into a calendar entry or a to-do item
simply by dragging it from one place to another. It can present a
concise one-page summary of the day's appointments, ongoing tasks
and unread mail. It can keep an automatic record of how you have
been spending your time with Office applications and quickly launch
that file you were working on last Thursday. It can color-code your
messages so the ones from the boss appear in red and the ones from
duck salesmen turn up in teal.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to figure out just how to do these things, or even
simpler ones, can be infuriating. Although the program has been
modestly improved since its first release, new users will cry out
for a tutorial, a book or, better still, a complete redesign. The
program's many capabilities will be overkill for most people,
because its quirky, unfinished, inconsistent interface buries them
under a mound of puzzling options and tricky gizmos that conceal
what you are trying to find. Like its competitors, it fails to
shift grunt work from human to machine by learning from what you
do.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Outlook's features fail to work the way you
expect them to. Yellow on-screen notes are described as ``the
electronic equivalent of paper sticky notes,'' but they disappear
from the screen the moment you open something on top of them. The
monthly calendar cannot display a week with Sunday first, even if
you set up your workweek to begin on that day. And in a throwback
to the past, Outlook 98 cannot always close itself when you tell
Windows to shut down. You have to do the job for it, sometimes
while facing down Windows error messages.
</P>
<P>
   You can get along with Outlook 98 if you are willing to work at
it, but most users are likely to be more comfortable with simpler
E-mail software like Outlook Express and personal information
managers like Sidekick or the software that comes with the Palm
computer. As something for nothing, Outlook 98 turns out to be too
much and not enough.

 By MARVINE HOWE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In honor of that intrepid seafarer Vasco da Gama and his journey
to India 500 years ago, the Portuguese have organized celebrations
the likes of which have never been seen in this onetime imperial
capital.
 &HT;    On May 22, Lisbon opened the gates to Expo '98, with a record
participation of 154 countries and the theme ``The Oceans, a
Heritage for the Future.''
 &HT;    During Expo's four-month run, visitors can discover the beauty,
riches and challenges of the seas through scores of exhibits. There
will also be nautical competitions, daily multimedia shows, live
entertainment and food from around the world.
 &HT;    The industrial wasteland on Lisbon's east side is being replaced
with new residences and businesses and, of course, Expo, a 150-acre
fairgrounds with international exhibits, a riverside esplanade,
exotic gardens and a panoramic cable car along three miles of
riverfront.
 &HT;    To avoid a post-Expo ghost town, the main pavilions will be
turned into cultural sites, like an aquarium, a science museum and
a theater.
 &HT;    Expo has parking for 17,000 vehicles, but the public is urged to
use bus, subway, train or taxi to the new Oriente Station, which
rises like a forest of steel and glass near Expo's eastern gate.
There will also be regular ferries from the Cais do Sodre river
terminal.
 &HT;    Also on the eastern periphery, the new 10-mile-long Vasco da
Gama Bridge over the Tagus River estuary connects with highways to
the Algarve and Spain.
 &HT;    On the northern ring is Colombo, one of Europe's largest
shopping centers, honoring another great explorer. This popular new
destination includes 425 shops, 10 movie theaters and an amusement
park.
 &HT;    All around the city, ancient monuments and neighborhoods have
been refurbished and new green spaces planted. But the new highways
and Metro stations are a maze of works in progress, causing dust
and delays.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Each day of Expo '98, which runs until Sept. 30, its showpiece
event, a multimedia program called ``Ocean Myths and Legends,''
will be presented at the giant UFO-like Utopia Pavilion at noon, 3,
5 and 9 p.m.
 &HT;    People in carnivalesque sea-monster costumes will provide street
shows all day long, and incredible-looking water-themed machines
will parade around at sunset.
 &HT;    Artistic and folk groups will perform at the Dock Amphitheater
and other open areas in the late afternoon.
 &HT;    Small ensembles offer fado (Portuguese soul music), jazz,
classical music, hip-hop and rock at a dozen open-air stages
starting at about 8:30 p.m. Evenings close with Midnight Tea, an
open-air disco from midnight to 2 a.m.
 &HT;    The fairgrounds themselves are open from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    International performers are scheduled every evening. The Greek
Art Theater will perform ``The Birds'' by Aristophanes on June 11
at 9:30 p.m. at the Dock amphitheater. Free tickets are available
at the national pavilions.
 &HT;    On July 25 some 120 tall ships in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships'
Race start to arrive in Lisbon for the Vasco da Gama Memorial
International Regatta July 31 to Aug. 3.
 &HT;    A ticket for Expo '98 good for one day and night is $28; a
one-night ticket good after 8 p.m. is $11. The three-day pass is
$70 and three-month pass $285. Children 5 to 14 and people over 64
pay half price. Telephone (351-1) 868-0426, fax (351-1) 868-1800.
 &HT;    Many cultural events will coincide with Expo. Les Ballets C. de
la B. from Belgium will perform ``They Feed, we/ Eat, Eat, Eat,''
choreographed by Van den Broeck on June 19 and 20 and the premiere
of the dance-drama ``Bach,'' set to music by Bach, on July 1, 2 and
3, both at 10 p.m. at the Belem Cultural Center's Grand Auditorium,
Praca do Imperio at Belem. Tickets are $5.80 to $17; (351-1)
361-2400.
 &HT;    The Royal Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, conducted by Sir Colin
Davis, will perform the Overture to Berlioz's ``Benvenuto
Cellini,'' with the pianist Maria Joao Pires playing Chopin's
Concerto No. 1, on June 25, and Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust'' on
June 26.
 &HT;    Both programs begin at 9:30 p.m. at the Coliseu dos Recreios,
Rua Portas de Santo Antao. Tickets: $28 to $85; (351-1) 796-6306.
 &HT;    Bizet's ``Carmen,'' directed by Giuseppe Raffa and starring
Dulce Pontes in the title role, will be performed July 1 to 15,
nightly except Thursdays at 10 at the Campo Pequeno Bullring, Praca
de Touros. Tickets are $20 to $170; (351-1) 303-3113.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The main attraction at Expo is the Oceanarium, one of Europe's
largest aquariums, designed by the American architect Peter
Chermayeff.
 &HT;    Visitors are surrounded by re-creations of environments of the
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic Oceans, culminating in a
Global Ocean.
 &HT;    The Portuguese pavilion, overlooking Olivais Dock, will recount
the country's long struggle to master the seas. Other pavilions
will provide interactive experiences.
 &HT;    Germany will offer a virtual journey to Oceanis, an underwater
station equipped with the latest marine research technology.
 &HT;    The United States pavilion is a showcase for American technology
in diving, charting the ocean bottom and protecting the deep-sea
environment.
 &HT;    By the river, a huge abstract wave of stainless steel will be
inscribed with the names of Portuguese-American contributors to the
project.
 &HT;    Expo has provided the inspiration for renovation projects in
neighborhoods and landmarks throughout the city.
 &HT;    Sao Jorge Castle, atop Lisbon's highest hill and dating from
Roman times, has been restored, and now includes a giant periscope
(see all of Lisbon for $1.70) and tourism information office.
 &HT;    The castle, opening onto Rua Chao da Feira, is an oasis of shady
terraces, towers and ramparts around the old palace, used for
official receptions, a luxury restaurant in the walls and, soon to
open, an esplanade cafe. Open daily in summer 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    The surrounding medieval neighborhood of Castelo, a jumble of
tiny houses with iron balconies and patios but few modern
conveniences, is being rehabilitated.
 &HT;    And down the hill, the Moorish quarter of Alfama _ with its
orange-tile roofs, cobblestone alleys and flowering balconies _ has
also been spruced up.
 &HT;    Near the 12th-century Se, or cathedral, the old customhouse has
undergone major work and will open in mid-June as the Fado Museum,
dedicated to the singers and their way of life. No telephone yet.
 &HT;    The Baixa, or downtown area, a lovely ensemble of 18th-century
offices, banks and shops, is also getting a face lift.
 &HT;    Praca do Comercio, a handsome square of bright yellow government
buildings facing the river, is no longer spoiled by a parking lot.
 &HT;    Historic buildings like Dona Maria II Theater and the
18th-century Cafe Nicola have been restored.
 &HT;    Reconstruction is almost finished in the Chiado, the city's most
fashionable shopping neighborhood before it was devastated by fire
in 1988.
 &HT;    The new Chiado Museum for Contemporary Art stands on the site of
a 17th-century monastery, 6 Rua Serpa Pinto, (351-1) 343-2148.
 &HT;    Belem, a western suburb, is Lisbon's monument zone. The
16th-century Jeronimos Monastery and Belem Tower have just
undergone repairs.
 &HT;    Nearby, the Monument to the Discoveries, built in 1960, honors
Prince Henry the Navigator.
 &HT;    The vast fortresslike Belem Cultural Center, built in 1993,
offers music and dance programs and art exhibitions.
 &HT;    A new grassy esplanade runs along the riverfront from Belem to
Alcantara, where decrepit warehouses have been converted into
cafes, restaurants and discos.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Azulejos, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, (351-1)
814-7747, has marvelous decorative tiles.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Reservations promise to be difficult during Expo, and prices
higher than normal.
 &HT;    Only one hotel is open on the Expo site: the Oriente, (351-1)
893-0000, fax (351-1) 893-0099, a bright new apartment-hotel with
116 rooms with kitchenettes and simple decor. A double is $160.
 &HT;    Centrally situated, Hotel Eduardo VII, 5 Avenida Fontes Pereira
Melo (351-1) 353-0141, fax (351-1) 353-3879, has been remodeled. It
has 130 rooms with park and river views. A double is $125 with
breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: Away from downtown, near Lisbon University, the
renovated Hotel Lisboa Penta, Avenida Combatentes (351-1) 726-4054,
fax (351-1) 726-4418, has 600 comfortable rooms with views of
central Lisbon and Monsanto Park. A double is $90, with breakfast.
 &HT;    Hotel Amazonia, also outside the center at 12-20 Travessa
Fabrica dos Pentes; (351-1) 387-7006, fax (351-1) 387-9090, in the
quiet Amoreiras section near the 18th-century aqueduct, has 192
comfortable modern rooms. A double is $100 with breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: Overlooking Eduardo VII Park, the Ritz, 88 Rua Rodrigo
da Fonseca; (351-1) 383-2020, fax (351-1) 383-1783, became a Four
Seasons Hotel this year, and has been renovated with new beige
carpets and gray and yellow marble in the hall.
 &HT;    The 280 rooms still feature oversize marble bathrooms and
private balconies. A double is $335.
 &HT;    Formerly a private mansion, Hotel da Lapa, 4 Rua do Pau da
Bandeira; (351-1) 395-0005, fax (351-1) 395-0665, is on a hill in
the elegant diplomatic quarter. It has a richly decorated lobby and
banquet hall, and the 94 spacious rooms are tastefully done.
 &HT;    The large balconies overlook lush gardens with a fountain and
pool. A double is $270.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    About 80 restaurants and kiosks inside Expo will offer a range
of cuisines and prices.
 &HT;    At a Turkish restaurant run by Istanbul's Divan Hotel,
specialties include sea bass in parchment (dinner for two with wine
is about $50), and Portugal's Panoramic Tower has spectacular views
to accompany local favorites like cataplana (steamed pork and
clams) for $68 to $114 for two.
 &HT;    In the Chiado, Cervejaria da Trindade, 20C Rua da Trindade,
(351-1) 342-3506, a popular beer hall in a former monastery,
specializes in beefsteak but also serves tasty grilled sole and
other fish. Dinner for two with beer or wine, about $22.
 &HT;    For Old World gilt, mirrors, crystal chandeliers and attentive
service, the place is Tavares, 37 Rua da Misericordia, (351-1)
342-1112. Closed Sunday afternoon and Saturday. Specialties include
stuffed crab and duck with prunes. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    Popular with the diplomatic community, Ja Sei!, 202 Avenida
Brasilia in Belem, (351-1) 301-5969, serves high-quality Portuguese
fare like roast lamb with thyme sauce, with a terrific view of the
Tagus. Dinner for two with wine, $60. Closed Saturdays and Sunday
evening.

 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The main attraction at Expo is the Oceanarium, one of Europe's
largest aquariums, designed by the American architect Peter
Chermayeff.
 &HT;    Visitors are surrounded by re-creations of environments of the
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic Oceans, culminating in a
Global Ocean.
 &HT;    The Portuguese pavilion, overlooking Olivais Dock, will recount
the country's long struggle to master the seas. Other pavilions
will provide interactive experiences.
 &HT;    Germany will offer a virtual journey to Oceanis, an underwater
station equipped with the latest marine research technology.
 &HT;    The United States pavilion is a showcase for American technology
in diving, charting the ocean bottom and protecting the deep-sea
environment.
 &HT;    By the river, a huge abstract wave of stainless steel will be
inscribed with the names of Portuguese-American contributors to the
project.
 &HT;    Expo has provided the inspiration for renovation projects in
neighborhoods and landmarks throughout the city.
 &HT;    Sao Jorge Castle, atop Lisbon's highest hill and dating from
Roman times, has been restored, and now includes a giant periscope
(see all of Lisbon for $1.70) and tourism information office.
 &HT;    The castle, opening onto Rua Chao da Feira, is an oasis of shady
terraces, towers and ramparts around the old palace, used for
official receptions, a luxury restaurant in the walls and, soon to
open, an esplanade cafe. Open daily in summer 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    The surrounding medieval neighborhood of Castelo, a jumble of
tiny houses with iron balconies and patios but few modern
conveniences, is being rehabilitated.
 &HT;    And down the hill, the Moorish quarter of Alfama _ with its
orange-tile roofs, cobblestone alleys and flowering balconies _ has
also been spruced up.
 &HT;    Near the 12th-century Se, or cathedral, the old customhouse has
undergone major work and will open in mid-June as the Fado Museum,
dedicated to the singers and their way of life. No telephone yet.
 &HT;    The Baixa, or downtown area, a lovely ensemble of 18th-century
offices, banks and shops, is also getting a face lift.
 &HT;    Praca do Comercio, a handsome square of bright yellow government
buildings facing the river, is no longer spoiled by a parking lot.
 &HT;    Historic buildings like Dona Maria II Theater and the
18th-century Cafe Nicola have been restored.
 &HT;    Reconstruction is almost finished in the Chiado, the city's most
fashionable shopping neighborhood before it was devastated by fire
in 1988.
 &HT;    The new Chiado Museum for Contemporary Art stands on the site of
a 17th-century monastery, 6 Rua Serpa Pinto, (351-1) 343-2148.
 &HT;    Belem, a western suburb, is Lisbon's monument zone. The
16th-century Jeronimos Monastery and Belem Tower have just
undergone repairs.
 &HT;    Nearby, the Monument to the Discoveries, built in 1960, honors
Prince Henry the Navigator.
 &HT;    The vast fortresslike Belem Cultural Center, built in 1993,
offers music and dance programs and art exhibitions.
 &HT;    A new grassy esplanade runs along the riverfront from Belem to
Alcantara, where decrepit warehouses have been converted into
cafes, restaurants and discos.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Azulejos, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, (351-1)
814-7747, has marvelous decorative tiles.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Reservations promise to be difficult during Expo, and prices
higher than normal.
 &HT;    Only one hotel is open on the Expo site: the Oriente, (351-1)
893-0000, fax (351-1) 893-0099, a bright new apartment-hotel with
116 rooms with kitchenettes and simple decor. A double is $160.
 &HT;    Centrally situated, Hotel Eduardo VII, 5 Avenida Fontes Pereira
Melo (351-1) 353-0141, fax (351-1) 353-3879, has been remodeled. It
has 130 rooms with park and river views. A double is $125 with
breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: Away from downtown, near Lisbon University, the
renovated Hotel Lisboa Penta, Avenida Combatentes (351-1) 726-4054,
fax (351-1) 726-4418, has 600 comfortable rooms with views of
central Lisbon and Monsanto Park. A double is $90, with breakfast.
 &HT;    Hotel Amazonia, also outside the center at 12-20 Travessa
Fabrica dos Pentes; (351-1) 387-7006, fax (351-1) 387-9090, in the
quiet Amoreiras section near the 18th-century aqueduct, has 192
comfortable modern rooms. A double is $100 with breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: Overlooking Eduardo VII Park, the Ritz, 88 Rua Rodrigo
da Fonseca; (351-1) 383-2020, fax (351-1) 383-1783, became a Four
Seasons Hotel this year, and has been renovated with new beige
carpets and gray and yellow marble in the hall.
 &HT;    The 280 rooms still feature oversize marble bathrooms and
private balconies. A double is $335.
 &HT;    Formerly a private mansion, Hotel da Lapa, 4 Rua do Pau da
Bandeira; (351-1) 395-0005, fax (351-1) 395-0665, is on a hill in
the elegant diplomatic quarter. It has a richly decorated lobby and
banquet hall, and the 94 spacious rooms are tastefully done.
 &HT;    The large balconies overlook lush gardens with a fountain and
pool. A double is $270.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    About 80 restaurants and kiosks inside Expo will offer a range
of cuisines and prices.
 &HT;    At a Turkish restaurant run by Istanbul's Divan Hotel,
specialties include sea bass in parchment (dinner for two with wine
is about $50), and Portugal's Panoramic Tower has spectacular views
to accompany local favorites like cataplana (steamed pork and
clams) for $68 to $114 for two.
 &HT;    In the Chiado, Cervejaria da Trindade, 20C Rua da Trindade,
(351-1) 342-3506, a popular beer hall in a former monastery,
specializes in beefsteak but also serves tasty grilled sole and
other fish. Dinner for two with beer or wine, about $22.
 &HT;    For Old World gilt, mirrors, crystal chandeliers and attentive
service, the place is Tavares, 37 Rua da Misericordia, (351-1)
342-1112. Closed Sunday afternoon and Saturday. Specialties include
stuffed crab and duck with prunes. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    Popular with the diplomatic community, Ja Sei!, 202 Avenida
Brasilia in Belem, (351-1) 301-5969, serves high-quality Portuguese
fare like roast lamb with thyme sauce, with a terrific view of the
Tagus. Dinner for two with wine, $60. Closed Saturdays and Sunday
evening.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From the Mississippi to the Columbia, one of the most unique
ways to see America is on a river cruise. Here are some companies
that make America's rivers come alive. Prices are per person, based
on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Despite the name, Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery
Bldg., Suite 700, Seattle, Wash. 98121; 800-426-7702) offers more
than some of the best cruises in Alaska. They have seven-night,
round-trip, small ship cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers
from Portland, Ore., starting at $925.
 &HT;    These trips, from March to May and again in September and
October, run on the 78-passenger ``Spirit of Alaska'' and the
84-passenger ``Spirit of Discovery.''
 &HT;    The ships follow in the wake of Lewis and Clark on this
1,000-mile journey, negotiating eight locks and dams each way on
the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
 &HT;    The highlight occurs at the port of Clarkston, Wash., where
guests switch to high-speed jet boats for a 140-mile round-trip on
the Snake River into Hells Canyon.
 &HT;    All shore excursions, including visits to wineries, historic
forts, the Whitman Mission and the Maryhill Museum, are included.
 &HT;    The company also offers California wine country cruises from
September to October on the 102-passenger ``Spirit of Endeavour''
and the 96-passenger ``Spirit of 98.''
 &HT;    The three-night trip starts at $645 and sails round-trip from
San Francisco, travels up the Sacramento River to the heart of Old
Town Sacramento, then up the Napa River to the Napa Valley, with
visits to the Schramsberg and Carneros Alambic wineries and lunch
at Clos Pegasse winery.
 &HT;    The four-night cruise starts at $855 and follows a similar
itinerary, with the addition of a day in Sonoma and tastings at
Domaine Carneros and a lunch at Merryvale Winery.
 &HT;    History, culture and nature all the hallmarks of this cruise
line.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232) operates the 163-passenger
sternwheeler, ``Queen of the West.''
 &HT;    A replica of the classic 19th-century paddlewheelers, the ship
follows a nearly 1,000-mile itinerary on the Columbia, Snake and
Willemette Rivers for seven nights.
 &HT;    The main lounge features nightly variety entertainment, similar
to that aboard showboats in the 19th century.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, which are included in the price of the cruise,
include a ride on the Mt. Hood Railroad, the Columbia Gorge
Discovery Center and jet boats on Hells Canyon. Rates start at
$1,045.
 &HT;    The Delta Queen Steamboat Company (Robin Street Wharf, 1380 Port
of New Orleans Place, New Orleans, La. 70130-1890; 800-543-7637) is
probably the best-known river boat cruise company in the country.
 &HT;    They offer three- to 14-night steamboat cruise on the
Mississippi River, the Ohio River, the Tennessee River, the
Cumberland River, the Arkansas River, the Illinois River, the
Kanawha River, the Atchafalaya River, the Red River and the
Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    The three steamboats that the line uses have become American
icons. There's the 174-passenger Delta Queen, built in 1925-1927
and designated a National Historic Landmark; the 414-passenger
Mississippi Queen, built in 1976; and the 436-passenger American
Queen, built in 1995.
 &HT;    Together, they offer a distinctive way to experience the
heartland of America.
 &HT;    While the newer vessels have been built with modern amenities,
the restored Delta Queen has been likened to staying in a Victorian
bed and breakfast, with the old-fashioned elegance associated with
brass, hardwood paneling and Tiffany-style stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    There are dozens of itineraries year-round among the ships, as
well as theme cruises that focus on the ``Civil War,'' ``Big
Band,'' ``Gardens of the River'' and even ``The Elvis Years.''
 &HT;    Take a typical seven-night cruise aboard the Delta Queen this
July, which embarks in Nashville, Tenn., and ends in Little Rock,
Ark.
 &HT;    Navigating the Cumberland, Ohio, Mississippi and Arkansas
Rivers, the fares for this journey, with Memphis as a highlight,
start at $1,050.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursion Lines (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-650-5041;) is a new company and its first vessel, ``R/B
River Explorer,'' sets sail on Aug. 22.
 &HT;    What sets the ``R/B River Explorer'' apart is the fact that it's
a hotel barge, designed to travel along both rivers and the
Intracoastal Waterway on four- to 10-day excursions.
 &HT;    The company claims that it's the first American-built, flagged
and crewed hotel barge offered in North America.
 &HT;    The ``R/B River Explorer'' is actually comprised of two barges,
the La Salle and the De Soto, and is propelled by the towboat,
``Miss Nari.''
 &HT;    All cabins are outside and a minimum of 200 square feet, with
the usual cruise chip amenities, from televisions with VCRs to
telephones with modem ports to full-size bathrooms.
 &HT;    Take ``The Route of Jean Lafitte,'' which goes between New
Orleans and Port Isabel, Texas, along the Gulf Coast. This
eight-day cruise, which starts in New Orleans and ends in
Galveston, Texas, starts at $1,730.
 &HT;    Other trips include ``Delta South,'' a four- or five-day trip
that goes round-trip from New Orleans.
 &HT;    The eight-day trip ends in Memphis, with stops at Natchez and
Vicksburg, Mississippi as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
 &HT;    Prices range from $740 for the four-day trip to $1,730 for the
eight-day voyage.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, as well as tips, taxes and port charges are
included with the price.

Intracoastal Waterway on four- to 10-day excursions.
 &HT;    The company claims that it's the first American-built, flagged
and crewed hotel barge offered in North America.
 &HT;    The ``R/B River Explorer'' is actually comprised of two barges,
the La Salle and the De Soto, and is propelled by the towboat,
``Miss Nari.''
 &HT;    All cabins are outside and a minimum of 200 square feet, with
the usual cruise chip amenities, from televisions with VCRs to
telephones with modem ports to full-size bathrooms.
 &HT;    Take ``The Route of Jean Lafitte,'' which goes between New
Orleans and Port Isabel, Texas, along the Gulf Coast. This
eight-day cruise, which starts in New Orleans and ends in
Galveston, Texas, starts at $1,730.
 &HT;    Other trips include ``Delta South,'' a four- or five-day trip
that goes round-trip from New Orleans.
 &HT;    The eight-day trip ends in Memphis, with stops at Natchez and
Vicksburg, Mississippi as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
 &HT;    Prices range from $740 for the four-day trip to $1,730 for the
eight-day voyage.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, as well as tips, taxes and port charges are
included with the price.

HURRICANE WATCH IS ON FOR THE SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The retreat of El Nino should mean a calmer
overall hurricane season for Hawaii and the tropical Pacific, but
storm watchers warn the early part of the season could see a repeat
of last summer's violent tropical storms.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the beginning of the 1998 hurricane season in the
central Pacific. Hurricane season runs through Nov. 15 in the
eastern Pacific and through October in the central Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists say the 1997-98 El Nino, an oceanwide warming of
the Pacific's surface temperatures, is waning. Nevertheless, this
El Nino, one of the biggest ever recorded, may still cause storm
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Climate Prediction Center forecasts above-normal
water temperatures in the equatorial eastern Pacific through
midsummer before approaching normal conditions by early fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this forecast, there may be a tendency to have an
increase in the number of tropical cyclones during the early part
of the hurricane season,'' said Jim Weyman, director of the Central
Pacific Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits there is no certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation, growth, movement and dissipation of tropical
cyclones are governed by many complex factors, only one of which is
warm ocean water,'' Weyman said.
</P>
<P>
   During last summer's hurricane season, when El Nino was
developing, there were nine major tropical storm systems in the
central Pacific, twice the 36-year average and the fourth highest
number of tropical storms during that period.
</P>
<P>
   While full-blown hurricanes are rare in Hawaii _ there have been
only four this century _ they are devastating when they do hit.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, 1992, Hurricane Iniki caused $1.8 billion in losses
on Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the number of hurricanes and tropical storms
that may occur, every citizen of Hawaii should prepare for a
hurricane or tropical storm because it only takes one to cause
extreme devastation,'' Weyman told a briefing at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are more common in the eastern Pacific, with the
ocean west of Mexico acting as a breeding ground for the big
storms.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, 16 or 17 tropical storms and nine hurricanes
form off the west coast of Mexico, some of them moving ashore with
disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaking storm season for the eastern Pacific was a
non-El Nino year, 1992, when 27 tropical cyclones rampaged around
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hit-and-run Iniki, some hurricanes can hang around
for a long time. A 1994 storm named John formed off Mexico on Aug.
11, traveled more than 4,000 miles over 31 days and reached peak
winds of 170 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Because John crossed the international dateline twice during its
raucous journey, it changed status from hurricane to typhoon and
back to hurricane. In the Atlantic and eastern Pacific east of the
dateline, storms attaining sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are
hurricanes; the same tropical cyclone west of the international
dateline is called a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical depression, which is far more common than its bigger
and nastier cousins, is an organized cluster of thunderstorms with
sustained winds below 38 mph; a tropical storm is more organized,
with winds between 39 and 73 mph.

 UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.: ...``finishing first.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's happening not only in California. Last month, US
Representative Jon Christensen, the favorite in Nebraska's
gubernatorial race, finished a distant third after a barrage of
negative ads. The reaction in Nebraska was ferocious, prompting
several of the state's leading Republicans, including US Senator
Chuck Hagel and US Representative Doug Bereuter, to assail
Christensen for his tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A negative ad destroys the target and the sender,'' said GOP
pollster Frank Luntz, who believes that voters will not accept
``multimillionaires who use their fortunes to destroy an
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Party means almost nothing. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Party has never been as important in California as elsewhere. In
the early part of the centry, the California Progressives undercut
parties by severely limiting their organizational capabilities,
taking partisanship out of local government and even requiring
parties to change their leaderships and their headquarters every
other years.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, parties, which never had the patronage base of
parties that developed in Boston and Chicago, could not nurture
their roots here. By the 1950s, California had cross-filing,
allowing a candidate to register on both sides of a primary.
</P>
<P>
   This year the blanket primary, which forces Republicans and
Democrats to run together on the same ballot in the same contest,
is further undermining party identification. ``The notion of party
is weakened this spring,'' said James Fay, a founder of the
Northern California Committee for Party Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are essentially running two general elections,
back-to-back. It is good for the entrepreneurs who put out mass
mailings but bad for people who care about the parties, which if
nothing else has provided some sort of a `cue' for voters to
recognize where candidates stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the blanket primary, a Republican can vote for a Democratic
gubernatorial nominee or vice-versa, sometimes for tactical reasons
such as selecting a weak opponent for their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are not part of a party can help choose a
nominee,'' said Sherman Lewis, a political scntist at California
State University at Hayward. ``Conservatives and progressives here
should be worried that they have lost control over a choice that
they used to have for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Hispanics mean almost everything. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are a rapidly growing part of the US population,
economy, culture, and political system. The Census Bureau estimates
that His-panics, the fastest-growing voting group, could become the
largest minority group within seven years, surpassing
African-Americans. In the four years between Bill Clinton's two
presidential campaigns, Hispanics added 1.5 million people to the
voting rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Latino vote is twice as important now as it
was at the beginning of the decade, and the Republicans' share is
down. Ronald Reagan won 44 percent of the state's Latino vote in
1984. Dole won less than 10 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have identified the Republican Party as being
unwilling to recognize their presence and the changes they are
bringing to the state,'' said Fernando Guerra, director of the
nonpartisan Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount
University. ``They believe Republicans are willing to mobilize
white voters against them for short-term political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra and other analysts believe that Hispanics could account
for one-fifth of the voters in Tuesday's primary. ``Not only are
older Latinos turning out, but so are the newly naturalized
Latinos,'' said Monica Lozano, associate publisher of the
Spanish-language La Opinion newspaper. ``They have sworn allegiance
to this country, take citizenship seriously, they are highly
motivated. You can't just define `likely voters' as the people who
voted the last four times.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the major candidates advertised on Spanish-language
television. Indeed, one of the important moments of the campaign
was a bilingual debate (``California Hacia El Futuro,'' or
``California into the Future'') carried live on Spanish-language
stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, Fresno, and
Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Politics is increasingly a female game.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Six years ago California elected two female US senators.
Twice, women have won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Now
the novelty of female candidates is gone. ``There have been so many
prominent women that one no longer has the sense that being a
female brings out the female vote _ or antagonizes the male vote,''
said Sandra Powell, a political scientist at San Francisco State
University.
</P>
<P>
   But there still is a decided female factor. Women have a growing
presence in public offices nationwide, and many analysts believe
Clinton won in 1992 and 1994 because of his support from women.
</P>
<P>
   In California, political professionals estimate that the
Democratic primary vote will be about 58 percent female. Governor
Pete Wilson won reelection four years ago against Kathleen Brown
because he won many votes from moderate Republican and Democratic
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win an election with a pro-male gender gap in this
state,'' said Donna Lucas, who runs a political public relations
firm in Sacramento. ``The big question here is how to win over
those moderate Republican and Democratic women.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. All politics is local.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two big national issues _ bilingual education and
campaign-finance reform _ are state issues in California, and the
battles are more advanced on the state level than on the national
level.
</P>
<P>
   Californians address both issues in referendums on Tuesday's
ballot, in a demonstration of the appeal of bringing important
choices straight to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer here may be to let each state, and even localities,
determine what is best,'' said freshman GOP state Assemblyman Bill
Campbell, who represents southeastern Orange County. ``They are a
better forum for these decisions because they are a lot closer to
the people.''

FERRETTI MOVES TO SOHO, BEGUELIN MOVES ON 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ferretti to Open in SoHo
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since acquiring a building at 30 West 56th St.
for her U.S. headquarters a few years ago, Alberta Ferretti has
been extending the reach of her company outside Italy. She formed
Aeffe USA, which produces and distributes the collections of
Moschino, Rifat Ozbek, Jean Paul Gaultier and Narciso Rodriguez, in
addition to her own lines. She recently opened in-store boutiques
for her signature and Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti lines at
Bergdorf Goodman. And she has now secured a location for her first
freestanding store in the United States, in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   That store, at 452 West Broadway, near Prince Street, is for the
Philosophy collection, a lower-priced version of the signature line
aimed at a younger woman. She is still searching for an uptown spot
to open an Alberta Ferretti store.
</P>
<P>
   The West Broadway building, next door to a Rizzoli bookstore, is
a Federal-style town house built in the late 1800s. When renovation
is completed in late summer, it will have a three-story glass front
and skylights, allowing the interior to be bathed in natural light.
There will be a two-story main floor and a mezzanine, with a zigzag
staircase and a sloped frosted glass floor. The floor, bordered in
concrete, will have water flowing beneath it and will be
illuminated from below. The architect is David Ling.
</P>
<P>
   The stark interior, softened by a curving cashier's counter of
ebonized maple and an ornamental niche on the second floor, should
be an appropriate background for the softly feminine clothes with
their delicate details and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Most designers and fashion companies open flagship stores for
their signature lines first to establish a presence, and then
follow with boutiques for their secondary lines. Ms. Ferretti is
doing the reverse, because a space became available that was the
right size for Philosophy and because she felt that SoHo was the
best place to attract the with-it customers to whom the line
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The area is enjoying a rebirth, with an influx of designer
boutiques, making SoHo a fashionable shopping destination again
after years during which it threatened to become more like a mall
with mass merchants taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Beguelin, by Another Name
</P>
<P>
   Henry Beguelin and his business partner, Tullio Murani, have
parted ways. Beguelin has formed a new leather-goods company in
Milan, Italy, called Henry Cuir, using the French word for leather.
Murani retains the rights to the name Henry Beguelin and plans to
continue producing handbags and other leather goods in Italy in the
trademark Beguelin style, utilizing African trade beads and
embroideries.
</P>
<P>
   Beguelin himself has a new design philosophy. He has in a sense
returned to his roots, eschewing the African-inspired decorative
elements he had added to differentiate his leather bags and belts
from those of others.
</P>
<P>
   He is now concentrating on pure design, working with a single
leather skin, folding it to achieve a finished shape rather than
using several pieces of leather sewn together. In the spirit of his
new esthetic, which is more Asian than African, he is using no
hardware and lining his bags in red, a symbol of luck in ancient
Chinese culture. He is also working for the first time with exotic
skins like alligator and skate fish.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York will introduce the Henry Cuir collection in the
fall, said Judith Collinson, the store's general merchandise
manager for women's ready-to-wear and accessories. Ms. Collinson,
who has known Beguelin for many years, said he had become restless
and bored with the sameness of what his company had been producing
and wanted to begin again. She said he felt that there was no
longer anything unexpected in the look of the products, which came
to include dog collars, luggage, leather objects and furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Cuir leather handbags for fall will be priced from
$575 to $875; the exotic skins will range from $1,700 to about
$5,000. &QL;

MEET THE POLITICAL TRENDS ON THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   2 TAKES (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ This is the first political primary of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the biggest, gaudiest, wildest state go to the polls
Tuesday to select their gubernatorial candidates in the most
costly, colorful, and bitter campaign of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the California race is the most important
political campaign in the country this year. The state's annual
budget is about $75 billion, by far the largest in the nation. It
is the only governor's office in the eight biggest states that the
Democrats have a realistic chance of capturing. And the winner will
play a major role in reapportionment in 2002, when California,
which has 52 seats in the House, may have as many as 60 _ or almost
one-seventh of the entire chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But the California race also is significant because, in the
political as well as popular culture, California is the national
pacesetter. What happens here eventually happens everywhere. ``From
music to entertainment to the national dress code, almost all
trends begin in California _ and politics is no exception,'' said
US Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat. ``We watch
it very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the California political trends that are on display
here _ and that could be coming to an election near you soon:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Money may be the mother's milk of politics, but it doesn't
make for the whole meal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One of the gubernatorial candidates, onetime Northwest
Airlines cochairman Al Checchi, may spend $32 million before
Tuesday. He probably will come in third in the Democratic race.
Another, US Representative Jane Harman, probably will spend $15
million. She is in second place. Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis,
the smallest spender at $8 million, is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But the likely triumph of Davis won't mean that money isn't
important in politics. It is. A 30-second ad on the television
program ``ER'' in Los Angeles costs $55,000. Even a candidate who
is badly outspent uses most of his time asking for contributions
and very little speaking to voters; Davis has had to raise about
$35,000 a day just to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of California,'' said US Representative Sherwood L.
Boehlert, who has contemplated a Republican gubernatorial campaign
in New York, ``is that you want to make a contribution but you end
up spending most of your time trying to get contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   That changes the rhythm of politics _ and affects the sort of
people who run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very highly visible race, where there aren't many
candidates, it is possible for an underfinanced candidate to win,
but in a way it validates the criticism of the role of money,''
said Robert Fellmeth, director of the University of San Diego's
Center for Public Interest Law. ``But imagine if someone who was as
little known and little qualified as Al Checchi ran without his
money. He'd have absolutely no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi almost certainly won't win the primary, but he has
shaped the character of the race more than Davis, a notion that has
not gone un-noticed by political professionals elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money people can buy their way into politics,'' said US
Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican. ``Even if
they don't win, they degrade it and pollute it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Politics is, more than ever, an insider's game. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Look at the media consultants of the three Democratic
candidates. Bob Shrum, who works for Checchi, once was a partner of
David Doak, who works for Davis. Bill Carrick, who is running
Harman's media campaign, worked with Shrum on the staff of Senator
Edward M. Kennedy. And all three worked on the 1988 presidential
campaign of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be on different sides, but they have more in common
than in conflict,'' said Kam Kuwata, Harman's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Media consultants are like baseball managers: They rotate with
the seasons as principals in a game that is chilly if not outright
frosty to outsiders. ``They are the equivalent of the party hacks
of 50 years ago, except that they make big bucks,'' said Bruce
Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But consulting isn't the only closed world in California
politics. There are only about a dozen political writers who follow
state politics, so it is possible to talk to all the insiders of a
state of 32 million people within an hour.
</P>

   Checchi was competitive until he started a negative assault,
first on Harman, then on Davis. His negative commercials hurt his

   ``Sometimes you have to be thankful for the mistakes your
opponents make,'' Davis said in a speech here last week.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll shows that California registered votes,
by a margin of more than four to one, believe Checchi has run the
most negative campaign, followed by Harman, and then Davis. The
same poll suggests that the three Democrats will finish in reverse
order, with the least negative candidate, Davis, finishing first.

WITH A EURO IN HER POUCH ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 7.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what the bankers tell you at the Frankfurt
headquarters of the European Monetary Union, the  &UR; euro &LR;  is already
in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal Australians have long been familiar with the
Westralian rock kangaroo, which they call the  &UR; uroo &LR; ,  &UR; waroo &LR; , or
 &UR; yuro &LR; . English-speaking residents of that continent spell it
 &UR; euro &LR; : ``Wallaby,  &UR; euro &LR; , and dingo tracks,'' wrote I.L. Idriess
in a 1933 novel, ``showed how popular this cool rock-hole was.''
</P>
<P>
   Those creatures, with their powerful hindquarters and
front-loaded method of carrying offspring in pouches, will have to
share their name with the European supercurrency in a few years.
Residents of 11 countries will soon be disdaining francs, marks,
guilders, escudos, and pesetas, instead insisting their common
currency is as ``sound as a  &UR; euro &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans wanted to call it the  &UR; euromark &LR; . The mark was the
name of a German, English, and Scottish weight traceable to the
year 886; in 1946, the  &UR; Deutsche mark &LR;  replaced the  &UR; Reichsmark &LR; 
and became the symbol of German financial stability. But the French
preferred the  &UR; ecu &LR; , acronym for the European Currency Unit (and an
old silver French coin, similar to the English  &UR; crown &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Germans thought  &UR; ecu &LR;  sounded too much like  &UR; Kuh &LR; , German for
``cow,'' likely to lead to such wordplay as ``cash cow'' and
``curdling the currency.'' Bonn countered with the  &UR; franken &LR;  _ a
Germanization of the French  &UR; franc &LR;  _ but that struck many as too
close to Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein, not to mention his
monster. The  &UR; monnet &LR;  had its moment, honoring Jean Monnet, the
European unionist, but that suggestion sounded too much like the
English  &UR; money &LR; , and the Brits were not even embracing the new
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans insist on  &UR; euro &LR; ,'' wrote Nathaniel C. Nash of The
New York Times from Brussels in November 1995, a name their finance
minister, Theo Waigel, ``floated in September when the finance
ministers last met.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the coinage was coined.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM BUG
</P>
<P>
   When a batter fans, baseball scorers put down the symbol  &UR; K &LR; ,
probably from the distinctive letter in  &UR; strike &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Creators of GOP bumper stickers in 1952 sought to encapsulate
three issues against the Democrats: Korea (an unended war),
Communism (soft on), and Corruption (the ``mess in Washington'').
They came up with  &UR; K1C2 &LR; . (The notion of a quasi-chemical symbol as
bumper sticker was used again in 1964 to denote the name of
Goldwater:  &UR; AuH2O &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In the years since,  &UR; K &LR;  _ from  &UR; kilo &LR; , Greek for  &UR; chillioi &LR; ,
``thousand,'' or 10 to the third power _ has most often come to
mean  &UR; kilobyte &LR; , strings of binary digits expressed by 2 to the
10th power, or 1,024. My son the E-commercialist says that if my
computer doesn't boast a memory of 48 megabytes _ that's 49,152
 &UR; kilobytes &LR;  _ I should forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OK &LR;  (coined in 1839): here comes  &UR; Y2K &LR;  (coined in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead guilty to journalistic incompetence,'' writes the
unduly self-flagellating financial columnist Robert Samuelson,
``for ignoring what may be one of the decade's big stories: the
Year 2000 problem. Among technical types it is shortened to the
 &UR; Y2K &LR;  problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As we content providers are aware, the world as we know it is
coming to an end at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. At that moment, the
Times Square ball drops; couples embrace; killjoy mathematicians
insisting the new millennium does not begin for another year are
drowned out in the clack of celebrants' noisemakers; the ghost of
Guy Lombardo reappears to play ``Auld Lang Syne'' (which drunken
etymologists explain is Scottish for ``Old Long Since''); computers
that have not been properly rejiggered assume with perfect binary
logic that the Gay Nineties are over and that we're going into the
year 1900 and that Diamond Jim Brady is canceling our credit cards.
What a moment!
</P>
<P>
   This column understands its scope: at the moment of earthly
doom, for example, its subject will be the origin of  &UR; doomsayer &LR; 
and the pronunciation of  &UR; Armageddon &LR; . Therefore, I will leave the
nerdy technical reasons for the breakdown of expiration dates to
chat-room eschatologists. (It has to do with space-hungry
programmers in the 1960s leaving the first two digits off the year,
so that 1965 was written as 65, and now the computer can't find the
19 to turn it to 20.) We deal here only with the linguistic roots
of  &UR; Y2K &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 26, 1995, James Coates wrote in The Chicago Tribune
about what was being called the  &UR; Year 2000 Holocaust &LR;  and the
 &UR; millennium bug &LR; : ``Once the code that was compiled with the
 &UR; millennium bug &LR;  written into it is decompiled, it must be fixed to
allow four digits rather than two in what is called the date
field.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1996, a  &UR; Y2K &LR;  bulletin board appeared on the
Internet. Its existence was noted in the world of Old Establishment
Media by The Wall Street Journal on July 26, 1996. Peter de Jager,
co-author with Richard Burgeon of Managing 00,'' helped popularize
the term among the netties, as did Dan Rather of the broadcast
network netties. They accepted the old-fashioned symbol of  &UR; K &LR;  as
 &UR; kilo &LR; , 1,000, not as 2 to the 10th power, or 1,024.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't cotton to  &UR; Y2K &LR; , and don't have the space for the
year  &UR; 2000 &LR; , there's always the Roman numeral  &UR; MM &LR; . A candy company
that produces M&AMP;M's (named after Forrest Mars and Bruce Murrie) has
seized on this idea to appoint itself ``the official candy of the
New Millennium.'' If you don't want your fingers sticky with
chocolate as the electronic balloon falls, grab a handful of those
millennium bugs.

CALIFORNIA MAY END BILINGUAL EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California, a bellwether for the nation on issues
such as affirmative action and property taxes, is about to make an
assault on bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   California voters are expected to approve a ballot initiative
Tuesday that would effectively dismantle the state's bilingual
program. Polls have consistently shown strong support for the
proposal among both Anglos and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll conducted May 16-20 found that 63
percent of likely voters favor the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   While passage of the referendum would almost certainly draw
legal challenges from the federal government and groups in
California, conservatives in Congress are counting on a big vote
against bilingual education to boost their efforts to end federal
support for bilingual programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political momentum is going our way,'' said Jim Boulet
Jr., executive director of English First. ``Parents have been
demanding English for their children. Now the politicians are
catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although bilingual programs vary widely from school to school,
their general aim is to help students with limited English by
offering instruction in the students' native language. At least 1.3
million students take bilingual classes in the United States,
including more than 440,000 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The California initiative, Proposition 227, would replace
bilingual education with a ``sink or swim'' approach. Students with
limited English would be placed in English immersion classes for a
year, then shifted to regular classes unless they obtained a
special waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has ignited an emotional debate that has little to
do with education theory. The language issue has become a flash
point in a much larger dispute over the nation's cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   While one side talks of the need for a unifying national
language, the other champions the benefits of a multilingual
society. More than 3 million students have limited English skills,
and immigrant children are the fastest-growing segment of the
school population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English-only nuts are people who are offended by hearing
people speaking another language. It's as simple as that,'' said
Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif. ``They want to think that the only
intelligent people in this world speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides in the dispute agree that a repudiation of
bilingual education in California would give bilingual critics new
momentum, no one expects an immediate rollback of bilingual
education in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual education is widespread and growing in Texas, and
educators say they don't expect the California vote to change their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso's Ysleta Independent School District, which is 85
percent Hispanic, bilingual classes are offered in all grades.
</P>
<P>
   Ysleta Superintendent Anthony Trujillo said the district's goal
is for every student to graduate fluent in two languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole discussion is a no-brainer. Is it better to know
one language or two, or three?'' Trujillo asked. ``We are producing
students that are superior to those educated only in English. Who
do you think will get the better job in the global economy?''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the opposition to bilingual education in California
has come from the very people it is supposed to help. The drive for
California's anti-bilingual initiative began in an impoverished
immigrant neighborhood in East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, about 90 children boycotted bilingual classes at
the Ninth Street School for two weeks until school officials agreed
to provide more English instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents are garment workers. It's very simple to them. If
the schools don't teach English, their kids don't have a chance,''
said Alice Callaghan, who runs Las Familias del Pueblo, a
storefront community center that served as boycott headquarters.
``They don't want their kids working in sweatshops or selling
tamales on the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   News accounts of the boycott caught the attention of Ron Unz, a
Silicon Valley multimillionaire who became the driving force behind
Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Parental discontent isn't limited to California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a group of about 150 families in Brooklyn, N.Y., sued
Community School District 32 over the district's policy of
retaining Spanish-speaking students in bilingual education for up
to six years. The suit was dismissed a year later, but some parents
are as skeptical as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give enough English. The kids are not really
getting good in English,'' said Marino De La Cruz, who had his
children removed from bilingual classes. ``It's going to be very
difficult for them in the future because they don't have a strong
base.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Cruz, who came to the United States from the Dominican
Republic in 1981, said he favors some bilingual education, but
``not year after year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many immigrant parents welcome bilingual education.
A classroom full of English speakers can be a terrifying place to a
child who does not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   Educators who favor bilingual instruction say the teaching
method gives immigrant students the solid academic footing they
need to master English, math and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bilingual education is simply a tool for children to learn
English,'' said Mary Helen Berlanga of Corpus Christi, a member of
the State Board of Education. ``The ultimate goal of every
bilingual program is to get the child proficient in English.''
</P>
<P>
   But bilingual supporters also concede that many bilingual
programs have been hampered by bureaucratic snafus and a lack of
trained teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to defeat the California proposal,
Education Secretary Richard Riley recently urged schools to push
students out of bilingual education after three years. He denounced
the much tougher California plan as ``an educational straitjacket''
that ignores individual student needs.
</P>
<P>
   If California voters approve the measure, House Republican Whip
Tom DeLay of Sugar Land said he intends to seek a vote this summer
on his bill to eliminate the federal Office of Bilingual Education.
The $200 million federal program offers grants and other help to
local bilingual programs.

DOGS PUTTING THE BITE ON HOUSTON MAIL CARRIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT photo service) 
 
By MELANIE COFFEE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston is the fourth largest city in the United
States, but it has the dubious honor of being No. 1 in the nation
when counting the number of postal workers bitten by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get a lot of unwanted dogs in the area, you will
see a lot of dog bites, and that is the case here in Houston,''
said Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Health
and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Humane Society there were 65 dog bites to
Houston postal workers in fiscal 1997 _ the most reported in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago and Miami areas were ranked No. 2 and No. 3,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   James Sanchez isn't surprised that Houston was ranked No. 1.
About a month ago, while delivering the mail, he was attacked by a
stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog came out from under a car and I tried to kick him
loose, but the neighborhood kids came and helped to get him off of
my leg,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of dog bites is under estimated, said Leslie Sinclair
of the U.S. Humane Society. To increase awareness, the Humane
Society and the U.S. Postal Service are dubbing this week as
National Dog Bite Prevention Week.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 4.5 million bite victims each year and last
year 2,708 postal workers were bitten, said Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   Houston law requires owners of all dogs with access to a street
or sidewalk be under physical control, generally a leash, at all
times. Animals at large are subject to pick-up by the city's animal
control officers.
</P>
<P>
   The second and each subsequent time a dog bites or attacks a
person in Houston, its owner must be fined a minimum of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who has been with the post office for seven years,
works the same route where he was bitten, but he's cautious around
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not usually afraid of dogs, but after this happened you
might say I am terrified of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Arceneaux, 53, is also terrified of the dogs on her mail
route _ a large, white pit bull and another dog that stands about 6
feet tall when on its hind legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I do not deliver people's mail until the next day
because their dog is going crazy, barking and snapping at me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   If postal workers feel that they're in danger at a location,
they do not have to deliver mail there that day.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep letter carriers safe each one carries pepper spray
to deter attacking dogs. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; According to the Humane Society most dog bites can be avoided
through prevention methods and having responsible owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to prevent dog bites is for owners to have their
dogs spayed and neutered,'' Barton said. ``Many dog bites are from
dogs that are in heat, because they are much more aggressive that
way and if you do this it helps to keep the number of strays
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said dog bites also can be prevented if owners take
responsibility for their dogs by securely tying them up or placing
them behind a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to take care of their dogs so that I don't have
to worry about getting bit and there are also a lot of kids in
these neighborhoods who could be attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The majority of dog bite victims are children, said Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Vanessa Chavez, 6, was playing in the front yard of
her Houston-area home when a large dog attacked and dragged her
along the flower bed. She had to get 37 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to see your daughter who's usually not
afraid of anything now traumatized by the thought of just being
outside,'' said Robert Sanchez, Vanessa's father.
</P>
<P>
   The dog that allegedly bit Vanessa was ordered put to death, but
its owners are still appealing the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the prevention week raises awareness in the community
because this is a very important problem that needs to be solved,''
Chavez said.

UGLY BLOCS OUTSIDE WHITE HOUSE HAVE THEIR ADMIRERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The real scandal in Washington isn't inside 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue _ it's outside the front gates. It's the
aesthetic problem of Pennsylvania Avenue itself, where the two
blocks in front of the White House are closed off and barricaded by
ungainly concrete planters. It's been three years ago this month
that President Clinton ordered the closing after a series of
breaches of security at the White House and terrorist incidents
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Planners in Washington and beyond talked about turning the
stretch of asphalt into the ``people's boulevard,'' lined with
gardens where tourists could linger. Instead, it's become the
barren province of a few fast-moving pedestrians in business &UR;  &LR; suits
and teenage rollerbladers in pants that are three sizes too large.
</P>
<P>
   For years, good people with good intentions have bandied about
ideas for Pennyslvania Avenue and its neighbor, Lafayette Park. And
yet the area looks more scruffy every year, like a neglected corner
of an old warehouse district, not the heart of a city that calls
itself the capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy administration preserved the small brick buildings
in front of the White House and came up with a plan to install
fountains. That never happened. After the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Ronald Reagan, according to the Washington
Post, an architect proposed building a plaza in front of the White
House and sending cars, trucks, and buses through a tunnel,
blessedly out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of the plan managed to tie up the bureacracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton abruptly closed Pennsylvania Avenue in May 1995. No one
can blame him. The year before, a plane crashed on the South Lawn
and a man fired an assault rifle from the sidewalk outside the
White House. And just before Clinton made his decision, the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma was bombed.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the closing, the National Park Service unveiled a
plan for a curving pedestrian promenade in front of the White
House. It wasn't the Champs Elysees, but it wasn't bad. In 1997, a
Treasury Department study, two years in the making, came up with
the finding that the concrete planters have ``adverse visual
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   They're ugly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Plain talk, apparently, isn't part of the plan for Pennsylvania
Avenue. Testifying before a Congressional subcommittee, Secret
Service Director Eljay B. Bowron said allowing traffic back ``would
be inconsistent with the available data'' (translation: dangerous).
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Washington still want the avenue reopened. They
claim that the closing clogs traffic and deprives the city of
$98,000 a year in money from parking meter revenues. And they say
that with straight faces, even though it's hard to find a working
meter anywhere in this dysfunctional city (the meters have been
stolen, leaving headless poles everywhere).
</P>
<P>
   The avenue's closing is called ``temporary.'' But the yellow
median lines are fading and the planters that were plopped down
show no signs of moving. On some chilly mornings, there are more
Secret Service agents strolling around than tourists (unless
tourists have wires curling out of their ears and into their
suits).
</P>
<P>
   What will come of the people's avenue? In this city of experts,
it's hard to find someone knowledgeable to talk about it publicly.
An official of the Commission on Fine Arts referred a caller to the
General Services Administration, which recommended the Treasury
Department, which passed the questions to the parks service.
</P>
<P>
   One federal official who didn't want to be named blamed a
prominent politician from Washington, who has blocked any efforts
to temporarily beautify Pennsylvania Avenue. The theory is that a
beautified street will be that much harder to re-open (and
re-uglify, if that's the word).
</P>
<P>
   Trying to look for something good to say about the oil-stained
stretch of pavement, the official boasted, ``It's become the
country's best arena for rollerblade hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Maybe these desolate blocks of Pennyslvania Avenue
aren't so inappropriate. Maybe they should stay just the way they
are. Anyone who has spent time in the fast-growing Sun Belt cities
such as Phoenix, Albuquerque, Orlando and Atlanta, knows the
enduring image of a six-lane highway devoid of human beings. This
is a country where people cannot manage without their cars, where
healthy young folks engage in this pasttime: driving to the closest
parking spaces, taking elevators to the gym and then using machines
that simulate stairs. Why walk outside when you can pay good money
to do it indoors?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Mr. President. Right in your own front yard without
spending a lot of money, you've created the perfect monument to
America at the end of the 20th century.

   WASHINGTON _ Sometimes, rich guys finish last.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to become the Democratic nominee for California
governor, businessman Al Checchi has spent more than $30 million.
That's more than anyone has ever spent in a nonpresidential race,
political experts say. And all of it is Checchi's own money.
</P>
<P>
   But after a fast start, Checchi may be poised to finish last in
Tuesday's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters could still surprise the pollsters, the latest
surveys show Checchi, who formerly worked in the investment
operation of the Bass brothers of Fort Worth, losing ground in the
three-way contest with Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and U.S. Rep. Jane
Harman, D-Calif..
</P>
<P>
   In a poll released Thursday, Davis led with 27 percent of likely
voters. Harman had 14 percent, and Checchi, once the front-runner,
had fallen to 13 percent. The Field Institute poll of 714 voters
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amateur hour is over in American politics,'' said Mark
Mellman, a Democratic consultant who has monitored the California
race. He and other political analysts blame Checchi's negative TV
advertising, missteps and inexperience for his poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi is a political neophyte whose extensive business
background as an investor has a Fort Worth connection.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1986, Checchi was a principal in the Bass Brothers
Enterprises investment group, working closely with Richard
Rainwater on the purchase of the Bass stake in the Walt Disney Co.
The four Bass brothers no longer invest jointly, and Rainwater also
went his separate way, but it was a fateful link for Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   It was his Bass association that took him to Los Angeles to
oversee the Disney investment. He later struck out on his own as a
deal-maker, and, in 1989, he engineered the buyout of Northwest
Airlines, for which he served as co-chairman until stepping down
last year to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's investments left him with a $700 million fortune _ and
a desire to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the `old politics' that says we have to be content
with things as they are,'' Checchi said in the candidates' first
televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Checci's high-profile entry into gubernatorial politics in
November at first resonated with voters drawn to ads portraying an
attractive, articulate newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   But when the race with Harman and Davis tightened a few months
ago, voters reacted against the harsh ads that Checchi unleashed
against Harman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have turned away from Checchi,'' said Mark
DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. ``Most people say his
advertising was unfair. Forty-nine percent have an unfavorable
opinion of him. That's quite a negative appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University in Claremont, Calif., said that Checchi's money won him
name recognition, but that enthusiasm for him faded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of the block with 17 percent support from
absolutely nowhere,'' Bebitch Jeffe said. ``The perception is that
Al Checchi has used his money to buy the election. I don't think
there's ever been a case when money can buy you an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts see a ``reverse Perot'' effect. Political
inexperience and wealth helped Dallas billionaire Ross Perot become
a presidential candidate, but they have become negatives for
Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably Ross Perot who gave rich outsiders a bad name,''
Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi made public school education one of his top issues, then
stumbled badly when asked whether he would send his three children
to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial
board. ``Why would I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer enraged public school supporters, and he did not help
himself with a lackluster performance in two debates with his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the TV ads defined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't have anything else to go on,'' said Jack Pitney,
an associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.
``He didn't have a record, a public persona or a constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   With Harman suffering from Checchi's attacks on her record,
Davis, a traditional Democrat and a veteran of 23 years in state
politics, jumped into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins the primary, as expected, he will face California
Attorney General Dan Lungren, the only Republican in the race who
is also on the ballot in Tuesday's open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi has, however, made his mark.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, said Checci's record-breaking spending of his own wealth
``is definitely in new territory.''

A RADICAL IDEA: KICKING THE SPENDING HABIT

THE OVERSPENT AMERICAN 
Upscaling, Downshifting, and the New Consumer 
By Juliet B. Schor. Basic Books. 253 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a little girl my grandmother always said the same
thing whenever I'd ask her to buy me something. The words ``I want
...'' would barely pass my lips when she'd answer, ``Want, want,
want. Want will be your master.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma was wise, as usual. Want is more than ever our master,
according to Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor, who in ``The
Overspent American'' argues that we are financially and
psychologically enslaved by ``competitive consumerism.''
</P>
<P>
   We know we spend too much money on stuff we don't really need.
We read about it, we hear about it, we talk about it, we complain
about it. But most of us keep doing it. So while Schor's book is
interesting, with some important things to say about the excesses
of consumerism, you have to ask: Will she succeed in persuading
readers to change their ways, to ``downshift'' their lives in the
direction of less work and less spending?
</P>
<P>
   Schor devotes a chapter to suggestions aimed at reducing the
relentless creep of consumerism, among them: avoid ``occasions of
sin'' (i.e., malls, stores, catalogs, shopaholic friends); don't be
taken in by the desire for status symbols; learn to share; don't
use shopping as ``therapy''; de-commercialize Christmas, weddings,
and other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   A few people may take inspiration from these and other ideas in
``The Overspent American,'' because anybody who picks up this book
is probably already leaning, if only slightly, in Schor's
direction. However, most people will never hear of the book, and
even if they were to read it the author's ideas would not likely
have any effect on their spending. The majority of Americans enjoy
competitive consuming too much _ it's practically our national
pastime. To give it up would be to surrender part of our identity
because, just as Schor explains at length in this book, we are what
we acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Our buying habits are tightly bound to the image we want to
present to the world, she writes. We are what we buy. Or, more
precisely, we aspire to be what we buy. ``This is not to say that
most Americans make consumer purchases solely to fool others about
who we really are,'' she writes, ``that we are a nation of crass
status-seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not? Well, it's not that simple, according to Schor, who
continues, ``Many of us are continually comparing our own lifestyle
and possessions to those of a select group of people we respect and
want to be like, people whose sense of what's important in life
seems close to our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the ``select group'' has changed over the
years. We used to want to keep up with those famous Joneses who
lived next door. The Jones family may have made a little more money
than we did, but basically we were in the same financial ballpark.
Now, though, the neighbors no longer provide the benchmark. We've
upscaled. We want to live like the rich and famous, like the
celebrities and CEOs we read about and see on TV. ``The result is
that millions of us have become participants in a national culture
of upscale spending,'' Schor writes. ``I call it the new
consumerism.''
</P>
<P>
   Schor sees the new consumerism as a source of profound stress,
dissatisfaction, frustration. Why can't we have a country house
like Martha Stewart's? Or an apartment like one we see on
``Frasier''? Why can't we take a vacation in Bora Bora like those
people we read about in last Sunday's travel section?
</P>
<P>
   Common sense provides the answer, or it would if common sense
had anything to do with competitive consuming, which it doesn't.
Like spoiled children we want what we want, even if we know we
can't afford it, even if upscaling means going deeply into debt,
even courting bankruptcy. Competitive consuming is not confined to
those with limited incomes, Schor writes; on the contrary. It
thrives and creates problems at all income levels, and it's most
acute in the middle and upper-middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   Schor's own 1994-'95 survey of 80,000 workers employed by a
telecommunications company revealed that 27 percent of those in
households with incomes of more than $100,000 a year said they
couldn't afford to buy everything they need. The key word here is
``need.'' Our concept of ``need'' has changed in the last few
decades, Schor writes. What we want swiftly becomes what we
``need.'' Many of us walk around with an ever-present wish list of
things we ``need'' to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Were our expectations always so high? No. We weren't quite this
flagrantly acquisitive until fairly recently. Schor writes that
competitive consuming took off like a rocket in what she calls
``the decade of greed,'' between 1979 and 1989, when the rich and
super-rich took conspicuous consumption to extraordinary levels.
Their excesses reverberated through the upper part of the
upper-middle class, who began acquiring luxury status symbols.
These upper-middles, writes Schor, have come to define material
success and provide the visible lifestyle to which most Americans
aspire.
</P>
<P>
   Schor explores the ways in which people become competitive
consumers. The pressures of advertising. The desire to keep up with
the high-status buying of others. The allure of consuming as a kind
of fantasy fulfillment, as the ``enchanted domain'' of consumer
culture, as she calls it. She cites studies indicating that people
spend an enormous amount of time fantasizing about what they'd like
to acquire. She quotes one woman who dreams of her ``perfect''
house: ``The awe and respect and wonder of my guests are basic to
every daydream about my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these consumer dreams are destined to remain dreams, not
just because they were unrealistic to start with, but because for
most people it's becoming more and more difficult to keep up with
rising levels of consumption. Family finances have deteriorated.
Credit-card debt is at an all-time high. Bankruptcies abound. The
national savings rate has plummeted. The average American household
currently saves only 3.5 percent of its disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   The zeal to consume more goods threatens the quality of people's
personal lives, Schor writes. They have to work harder and longer
to afford more things. They skimp on college funds, retirement
savings, and health insurance so they can buy more. She argues that
Americans are increasingly angry and resentful about having to pay
taxes to support schools, parks, public transportation, and
programs for the poor because they see taxes as subtracting from
the money they need to finance their private consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of Schor's book is devoted to the personal stories
of downshifters, people who are voluntarily opting out of the
consumer economy, with its stress, debt, lack of free time, and
competitive consumption. The simplicity movement has been gaining
ground in recent years. Schor notes that there's no ``typical''
downshifter profile, and her interviews bear that out, though many
of the people she talked with had one thing in common: They hated
their jobs and were willing to chance almost anything for a change.
The stories are not particularly inspiring. Some have adjusted.
Others have struggled, trading in old stresses for new, like the
woman who gave up an extremely high-pressure nursing job for
occasional per-diem work and now frets about whether she can afford
to buy a sandwich for lunch, or get her teeth cleaned. Want is
still her master, but the level of her wants has moved downscale.

MUM'S THE WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the question of whether to testify under oath
before a grand jury about his relationship with former White House
aide Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   The president has apparently decided to continue rejecting
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's efforts to grill him about his
contacts with Lewinsky and his knowledge of those mysterious 37
visits she paid to the White House after leaving her job there.
Although Clinton has already rebuffed at least four grand jury
invitations for his voluntary testimony, Starr is currently
stepping up his pressure to get the president on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly said Sunday that subpoenaing the
president or indicting him was an option being considered, an
ominous hint of just how far Starr may be prepared to go.
</P>
<P>
   But either draconian move would be both legally and politically
dubious. Most experts believe a sitting president cannot be
indicted. Instead, the procedure used in cases of alleged
presidential misconduct is impeachment. And should Starr issue a
subpoena to compel testimony, it would be a stunning, historic
presidential first that could not be enforced. (The constitutional
separation of powers bars the judicial branch from imprisoning a
sitting president.)
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would risk not only an acrimonious standoff but ruin
what remains of Starr's tarnished professional reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch predicts that
Starr will not go that route, although Hatch would like to see
Clinton voluntarily testify.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch sees it as more of a political problem than a legal one
and concedes he hopes that things don't reach impeachment. ``I'd
just as soon have this president finish his term,'' Hatch observes
wryly, no doubt preferring that the Republicans run for president
in 2000 with a diminished Clinton in the White House rather than Al
Gore as a freshly anointed president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton is buying time by keeping his mouth shut. For
him, testifying on this subject is a lose-lose situation. He said
at his last press conference: ``I think I'm in some ways the last
person who needs to be having a national conversation about this.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already vowed under oath in his deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit and in public statements that he did
not have an improper sexual affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial and Republican demands that he ``come forward with the
truth'' are based on an assumption that he has not yet been honest,
his denial is untrue, and that he has committed a criminal act of
perjury and obstruction of justice. His failure to contribute
details to explain away the suggestive circumstances fuels such
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott added to the chorus on Monday,
demanding the president ``be more forthcoming ... give us more
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing Clinton can do that is likely to make
things easier for him. His advisers complain that whatever he says
in secret before a grand jury could be leaked in a distorted
version by a biased Starr, making him look guilty. But that's not
the real reason for resisting.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has been telling the truth and did nothing wrong, he
has a public obligation to put all the suspicions to rest by
explaining things. Remaining mum makes it look as though he is
hiding out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody has been charged with anything yet. Nobody knows
what Starr knows or does not know. The more details the president
provides, the more opportunities for misunderstandings, accusations
and political attacks.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is lying and says more, he could be in danger of
being contradicted by the evidence being collected by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton continues to deny all but Lewinsky cuts a deal and
recants her own prior denial under oath, he will be caught up in a
humiliating he-says-she-says argument in which she may be the more
believable of the two. But the prosecutor will have to prove which
one is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky sticks to her denial, she may be indicted for
perjury based on whatever evidence to the contrary Starr can
produce. That would give Starr the opportunity to call Clinton as a
witness in a criminal trial, forcing him to repeat his own denial
or invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of a president invoking the Fifth, normally the
recourse of defendants who are guilty of something bad, would be
legally feasible but politically disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   If the president changes his tune and admits to an affair, he
will have incriminated himself. The core of Starr's case will be
made, although not necessarily the related allegation of
subornation to perjury. This is an unlikely scenario, however,
given its unpleasant implications for impeachment.

MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIAL LIKELY TO PLAY ROLE ON IRISH REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Kathleen M. O'Toole, the Massachusetts secretary of
public safety, is one of five people expected to be named this week
to a commission that will recommend reform of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member commission, which was established under the
accord that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic May 22, will be chaired by Chris
Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring of the force of almost 13,000 is considered
essential to cementing the settlement and helping to end 30 years
of sustained sectarian and political violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday night, O'Toole said she had been
nominated to the commission but had not received confirmation from
British officials.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the selection process in Belfast said that
the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Mo Mowlam, will announce
the appointment of O'Toole and four other commission members,
possibly as early as Monday. Patten had been named chairman of the
commission last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am appointed, I'd be delighted and honored to serve,''
said O'Toole, who announced last week she would leave her state
Cabinet position this year to become director of the alumni
association at her alma mater, Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nowhere else in the world where the role of the police
is more important right now,'' she said. ``There is a huge
opportunity in Northern Ireland, and I'd be thrilled to be in a
position to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole, 44, who would be the only American and one of two
international figures on the panel, impressed law enforcement and
government officials in Northern Ireland during three visits there
as Massachusetts' top law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the highest-ranking female police administrators in
the United States, O'Toole caught the attention of Mowlam, who met
O'Toole two years ago in Boston when she was the British Labor
Party's shadow secretary for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole is the first woman to serve as the state's
highest-ranking law enforcement official. Mowlam is the first woman
to serve as Britain's top official in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole most recently visited Northern Ireland last fall, when
she led a Massachusetts delegation that advised officials in
Belfast how to establish a program to combat domestic violence.
They used the program at Quincy District Court as a model.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, or RUC, is 93 percent Protestant,
and the biggest challenge facing administrators is how to downsize
a force that was just 3,000 when violence erupted in 1968 while
also increasing Catholic representation on, and confidence in, the
force.
</P>
<P>
   In no other area is the yawning gap of perception and life
experience between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists
in Northern Ireland more evident than in attitudes toward the RUC.
Protestants strongly support the RUC and are deeply suspicious of
attempts to reform it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics have had negative experiences with the RUC. Some
want it disbanded. Those who think disbanding the force is
unrealistic want it reformed and its ranks to more closely reflect
the 43 percent of the population that is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The pact of April 10, known as the Good Friday accord,
acknowledges the need to change the RUC and establishes an
independent commission to recommend how to ``ensure that policing
arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training,
culture, ethos and symbols, are such that in a new approach,
Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread
support from, and is seen as an integral part of, the community as
a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   In her Cabinet position, O'Toole oversaw several state agencies,
including the State Police, the Department of Correction, and the
Registry of Motor Vehicles. O'Toole has a reputation for promoting
technological innovation and new management approaches in law
enforcement. She pushed police departments throughout Massachusetts
to adopt community policing methods, and the state's crime rate
dropped during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I was considered for this commission because
of the work I've done on community policing,'' said O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe last month, Ronnie Flanagan, the
RUC chief, said he appreciated O'Toole's efforts, especially last
year's presentation on domestic violence. Flanagan is friendly with
O'Toole's mentor, William Bratton, who served as police
commissioner in Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Toole's background as a Catholic Irish-American from
South Boston will cause some skepticism among Protestants who are
wary of changes to the RUC.
</P>
<P>
   As an American and as a Catholic, O'Toole's presence on the
commission will please Irish nationalists. But her credentials as a
police officer and administrator and her previous willingness to
work with the RUC may comfort Protestants who oppose attempts to
reform it.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, O'Toole said her nomination was based on ``my
experience as a professional police officer and administrator. I
intend to talk about policing issues, not politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the selection process said the other proposed
panelists include Maurice Hayes, the former Northern Ireland
ombudsman; Lucy Woods, the chief of British Telecom in Northern
Ireland; Clifford Sheering, a South African criminologist at the
University of Toronto; and John Smith, former deputy commissioner
of the Metropolitan Police in London.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is known in Boston by his association with the
Boston-based American Ireland Fund, the largest Irish-American
charity in the United States. Last year, Hayes wrote a report
recommending changes in the way complaints against police in
Northern Ireland are handled.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has been secretary of public safety for the last
four years, O'Toole still holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in
the Massachusetts State Police. A police officer for 19 years, she
has also served with the Metropolitan Police before it merged with
the State Police.

JFK, TOWER AND A TALE OF SEXUAL INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the strange items in the recently released
FBI files on former President John F. Kennedy, one of the strangest
is a cloak-and-dagger tale involving former Sen. John Tower of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1963, Tower telephoned FBI headquarters to report
what he called ``a very unusual set of circumstances.'' The rest of
the story is spelled out in an FBI memo on file in the National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks before Tower went to the FBI, his office
received a series of phone calls from a New York man who identified
himself as Robert Garden. Garden said he had information regarding
the ``national welfare'' that he wanted to pass on to the
Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   Tower's aides initially rebuffed Garden's overture but finally
relented after about a week of repeated phone calls. The brief
conversation persuaded Tower to send administrative assistant H.
Edward Munden to meet the mysterious tipster at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Garden, who identified himself as a private detective, reached
into a tan briefcase and pulled out legal documents that he said
``dealt with personal matters'' involving Kennedy and Attorney
General Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gist of the matter appeared to concern an affair between
the president and a woman and as a result of which the woman became
pregnant,'' the FBI summary states. ``Garden claimed to have
compromising pictures and additional documents in safe deposit
boxes in the midwest and west coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The private detective identified the woman as the widow of a top
executive at the Singer Sewing Machine Co. He also told Munden that
Robert Kennedy used his influence to block a lawsuit that
threatened to expose the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended when Munden told the tipster that he ``wanted
nothing to do with such material.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was unable to verify Garden's identity, but Hoover and
his inner circle were already well aware of the allegations against
the president and his brother. About a month before Tower's call,
the FBI investigated reports that another New York private
detective had tried to sell similar documents to union leader James
Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's alleged lover was Alicia Darr, who had worked as a
prostitute in Boston and New York. She first came to the FBI's
attention in 1961, shortly after Kennedy's inauguration, when she
told an Italian magazine that she had been engaged to marry Kennedy
in the early 1950s. She said the engagement fizzled because
Kennedy's father objected to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Darr later married British actor Edmund Purdom, but the couple
divorced in 1961. Darr rebounded by marrying Alfred Corning Clark,
an heir to the Singer fortune, a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Clark died of a heart attack less than two weeks after the
wedding, leaving his new bride the bulk of his $10 million estate.
The resulting legal tangle was ordered sealed by a New York judge,
a move that helped fuel speculation of a Kennedy cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI files offer no evidence to support either the love
affair or any cover-up. Muckraking journalist Seymour Hersh also
dismisses the allegations in his new book, ``The Dark Side of
Camelot,'' an otherwise scathing account of Kennedy's personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Tower later had his own experience with unproven
allegations in FBI files. In 1989, an FBI file filled with
unsubstantiated reports of womanizing and heavy drinking helped
scuttle Tower's nomination as defense secretary. He died in a
commuter plane crash two years later.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that India has shown the world that it could
quietly purify enough plutonium for the five nuclear devices it
detonated recently _ and probably enough for many more _ attention
is turning to how to divorce nuclear weapons from nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   A small company based here says it has the answer, by
substituting thorium for some of the uranium in fuel for power
reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Radkowsky Thorium Power Corp., headed by a
physicist who was formerly the chief scientist of the U.S. Naval
Propulsion Program, says its fuel could be used in existing
reactors in place of the ordinary uranium fuel, and would produce
very little plutonium, a normal byproduct of the reaction when
uranium is used.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to test its fuel in 2002 in a Russian reactor
that resembles the dominant U.S. design.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say it could also be offered to countries like North
Korea and Cuba, which say they want reactors to generate electric
power.
</P>
<P>
   But some fear they want reactors mostly to generate plutonium
for weapons. The thorium reactor could also be useful for burning
up surplus weapons plutonium _ the United States has at least 50
tons of it _ without producing nearly as much new plutonium as
existing reactors do. And the plutonium it does produce would be a
mix of types that makes the weapon prone to ``fizzle,'' or sustain
a chain reaction for only a brief period, cutting its explosive
yield by 95 to 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty intriguing,'' said Christopher Payne, a senior
researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that is active in nuclear proliferation issues.
``It's worth looking into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better than what we've got,'' said Robert H.
Williams, a physicist at the Princeton University Center for Energy
and Environmental Studies. He pointed out, though, that even if
production is cut by 80 percent, a large nuclear reactor would
still produce enough plutonium each year for several bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has contributed $1.1 million to help with
the development and Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors, which hopes
to win engineering work if the system is used, paid $500,000. Alvin
Radkowsky, who was the chief scientist of the Naval Propulsion
Program from 1948 to 1972, designed the fuel. But some people
question whether Radkowsky's fuel can compete with existing ones,
because the operating characteristics of the existing fuels are so
well known.
</P>
<P>
   Developers refer to Radkowsky's system as a reactor, but it is
essentially a new core, replacing the fuel in an existing reactor.
Its benefit is to change a characteristic of nuclear reactors that
was long considered a virtue but is now a problem: that as they
consume the kind of uranium that can be readily split, they make a
new kind of atom that can also be split easily, plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel for nearly all reactors today is uranium-235, which is
called ``fissile,'' because it can be fissioned, or split. It is
mixed with uranium-238, which is very hard to split.
</P>
<P>
   When the uranium-235 is split, it gives off neutrons that go on
to fission other atoms, sustaining a chain reaction. But often a
neutron hits an atom of uranium-238, a material that is called
``fertile,'' because instead of being split by the neutron, it
absorbs the neutron and changes into a new material, in this case,
plutonium-239.
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium is a different element, and thus is fairly easy to
chemically separate from the rest of the fuel when the fuel bundle
is removed from the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The Radkowsky fuel avoids plutonium production by minimizing the
use of fertile uranium. Instead it uses thorium, a material that
was tried with uranium in the first civilian reactors in the 1950s
and '60s but later dropped in favor of straight uranium fuel.
Thorium, cheap and plentiful, cannot be fissioned to produce
energy, but it is also fertile, and as it absorbs stray neutrons it
is converted to something fissile, in this case, uranium-233.
</P>
<P>
   But uranium-233 is hard to separate from other uranium in the
core, and thus is hard to purify for bombs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Graham, a former negotiator for the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency who is now president of the Lawyers' Alliance
for World Security and a member of the Radkowsky company's board of
directors, said that what India had done in the last few years
would have been nearly impossible if that country's reactors had
used Radkowsky fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan could still have developed its bombs, however, because
its weapons used enriched uranium, not plutonium. That route to a
bomb is much more expensive and difficult, though, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A reactor that does not produce much plutonium would be useful
in the United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   To dispose of excess plutonium, the Energy Department wants to
use it to fuel conventional civilian reactors, but for each 3
pounds of pure plutonium that is converted into fuel, another 2
pounds of plutonium will be created in those reactors, and that
theoretically could be refined and turned into new weapons fuel.
</P>
<P>
   (Some designs are called breeder reactors, because each atom
split produces more than one additional fissile atom.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Radkowksy fuel, far less plutonium is created. And of the
uranium-233 that is created, most is consumed in the fuel as it is
made, producing heat that can be turned into electricity.
</P>
<P>
   If the reactor is shut down before the fuel is fully consumed,
the uranium mix inside would be extremely difficult to purify and
refine into bomb fuel, physicists say.
</P>
<P>
   This is because some of it has absorbed yet another neutron and
turned into uranium-234, and the thorium also has some uranium-238
added. Separating those forms of uranium from each other would be
difficult, because they are chemically identical.
</P>
<P>
   The design is similar to existing nuclear fuel: ceramic pellets
about the size of pencil erasers loaded into long, thin metal
tubes, sometimes as long as 14 feet, assembled into bundles.
Radkowsky's design is that each bundle would have an inner ``seed''
using uranium, and outer tubes forming a ``blanket,'' filled mostly
with thorium. The seed could also be made of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The thorium system has drawbacks, though. One is that the
uranium in the seed would have to be enriched to about 20 percent
of the fissile type of uranium, uranium-235, compared with about
3-5 percent in conventional reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 percent is still considered low enrichment, far too low
for a bomb, but far above the natural level of 0.7 percent. And a
nation or group that wanted an atom bomb would have a major head
start in building a uranium model if it began with fuel enriched to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that while total plutonium production is low,
it is concentrated in the fuel rods in the seed, not those in the
blanket. In fact, there would be more plutonium in a ton of used
seed from the Radkowsky design than from a ton of used uranium fuel
from a conventional uranium reactor.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Galperin, a professor at Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev and an associate of Radkowsky, said in a telephone interview
that the mix of types of plutonium in the reactor would still deter
someone who wanted to build a bomb. For one thing, it would have a
large quantity of plutonium-238, which gives off heat for years, so
much heat, he said, that it would interfere with the high
explosives that are used to help set off a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It would also contain a large amount of plutonium-240 and
plutonium-242, which tend to emit neutrons spontaneously. These
neutrons can start a chain reaction too soon, leading to a fizzle.
The company says such plutonium would never produce more than a
fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Harold A. Fieveson, of the Center for Energy and Environmental
Studies at Princeton University and the editor of Science and
Global Security, said this was ``really lousy plutonium from a
weapons point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be possible with a lot of care and tremendous
difficulty to fabricate a weapon that could have a yield of
hundreds of tons, but it would be a bigger weapon than you would
need with normal plutonium,'' he said, making it harder to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   But Arjun Makhijani, the president of the Institute for Energy
and Environmental Research, said that a device that produced only a
fizzle could still be a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Makhijani, a physicist, said ``a 50 percent probability that it
will fizzle is not good enough, if you're trying to protect
yourself against it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, a fizzle was a mere 3 to 5 percent of the
potential explosive value, but that is still 3 to 5 percent of a
very large number. If a Nagasaki-sized weapon fizzled, he said,
that would still be 100 times larger than the bomb that destroyed
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, or the
Marine barracks in Beiruit. But it would still be 20 or 30 times
smaller than a typical nuclear weapon.

NOW IT'S IRISH-AMERICANS' TURN TO MOVE FORWARD FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The page that has been turned in Ireland now needs
to be turned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   May's astonishing ``Yes'' votes in the North and South,
ratifying April's miraculous peace agreement and empowering a new
majority that can relegate sectarian concepts of the republic and
its still-British North to the past, needs to spark a complimentary
transformation in this country. It can't happen as dramatically,
but America's 44 million citizens of Irish extraction need to
organize a critical mass capable of sustaining a future-centered
relationship between their country and the new Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans have done it well _ Italians, Greeks, Jews and,
increasingly, Asians, come to mind. Now it's the Irish-Americans'
turn to transcend traditional charity, culture, religion, and
knee-jerk republicanism, and mobilize a new generation ready to
support a grown-up relationship with a rapidly changing country.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, the short-term danger is that the parties
to the peace agreement will reconvene in a new Northern Ireland
assembly in late summer and gridlock over issues like prisoner
release and the turning over of arms and explosives. The analogy
would be with post-Dayton Agreement Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Over here, the danger is a loss of momentum. America's Irish
voice, to pick an absurdly extreme example, must not be that of the
ostriches in the organizations that flaunted their surly, quixotic
republicanism in full-page newspaper ads urging rejection of the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   My metaphor for the future can be found in donated space at a
law firm here, where the US-Ireland Alliance is taking shape under
the organizing leadership of an amazing bundle of energy and vision
_ Trina Vargo, until this month Senator Edward M. Kennedy's foreign
policy staff person and one of the heroes in the back-breaking
labors that went on in recent years to make a negotiated settlement
possible.
</P>
<P>
   What she is building is an American organization with support
from both sides of the ocean that will promote the US side of a new
relationship with the republic and the North.
</P>
<P>
   This means vigorous public education, deep involvement in policy
issues, and relentless promotion of new coalitions and joint
ventures here and there. It will be tax exempt for individual and
corporate donors, but not afraid to use the 20 percent of its
resources for lobbying that US law allows tax-exempts.
</P>
<P>
   A model that quickly comes to mind is the frequently powerful
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, with two important
differences. The alliance will not support political candidates,
and it is vital that it avoid the kind of identification with the
Likud movement in Israel that on occasion diminishes AIPACs impact.
Vargo's special interest in Ireland is peace, justice, and a new
economic future at both ends of the island with much more US
participation.
</P>
<P>
   She plans a public television program, dreams of a Rhodes
Scholar-like program for American students, and she can't wait to
take on immigration, trade, investment, and other issues. And,
above all, Vargo labors to release the untapped energies of those
unorganized 44 million people here, nearly half Protestant, and
nearly all inactive in Irish matters.
</P>
<P>
   In part to satisfy Senate ethics rules, her initial fund-raising
and organizing has been In Ireland, and it is revealing. Some of
the new powerhouses of the Irish Miracle are on board with
six-figure contributions, including the Doyle Hotel Group, the Elan
Corp., the Jefferson Smurfit Group, and Citywest, a major Dublin
business park. And her letterhead will have the names of big shots
North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vargo is starting in on the US side. Of course, her now
ex-boss is proudly aboard as is former Coca Cola CEO Don Keough and
Mutual of America. She'll take a hundred bucks or six figures
gratefully.
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, the alliance represents an essential shift of the
American Irish voice out of Congress. During the Troubles, a call
to the late Tip O'Neill or to Kennedy might suffice at a critical
moment. No longer, and Kennedy himself has been one of the first to
recognize this.
</P>
<P>
   Also as a metaphor, Trina Vargo herself is ideal. Her
grandfather came out of the chaos of Eastern Europe. She is Irish
on her mom's side (a Daugherty), but the roots go back to 18th
century Pennsylvania, and she doesn't know if they're North or
South, Catholic or Protestant. She was not into being Irish until
she started working for Kennedy. Now she makes Top 100
Irish-American lists because of her widely recognized role as a
player in the peace process. Most important, while she has a deep
respect for the past and the most intimate knowledge of it, Vargo
is not obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Her obsession is the future for Irish-Americans and for Ireland.
This concentration on new ideas, new links, new activism is the
next page to which a new generation of the 44 million needs to
turn. It promises to be a very exciting time.

IT'S BEEN A COSMIC HALF CENTURY FOR PALOMAR'S 200-INCH TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Richard Preston is the author of ``First Light,'' about astronomers
and the Hale Telescope  
 By RICHARD PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago Wednesday some 800 astronomers and VIPs gathered
under the new Hale Telescope on the summit of Palomar Mountain,
near San Diego, to celebrate the telescope's ``first light,'' as
astronomers call the moment when a new telescope is opened to the
night sky for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hale Telescope, named for George Ellery Hale, who proposed
it in 1928, was the largest and greatest working telescope on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a generation, the world's leading astronomers used
the Hale to make fundamental discoveries that changed our views of
the universe. Allan Sandage spent 20 years using the Hale to
explore the size and age of the universe, a project that seems to
have a grandeur beyond almost any other quest in science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Maarten Schmidt was using the Hale to examine quasars
when he discovered that quasars are not the nearby stars
astronomers had assumed them to be, but powerful, brilliant objects
in the distant reaches of the universe, a discovery that revealed
that the universe contains objects of almost incredible energy.
(Quasars are now believed to be supermassive black holes swallowing
matter at the centers of distant galaxies.)
</P>
<P>
   The telescope was originally operated jointly by the Mount
Wilson Observatory and the California Institute of Technology, but
after years of feuding over the management of the telescope, the
two institutions divorced in the 1980s, leaving Caltech in charge
on Palomar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hale was probably the most famous scientific instrument in
history even before starlight had graced its mirror, and it seemed
to symbolize the 20th century's greatest hopes.
</P>
<P>
   George Ellery Hale, a solar physicist, had a vivid imagination
and a talent for fund-raising. His imagination seemed to overpower
him at times, and he suffered from frequent nervous breakdowns.
Hale apparently sometimes thought that an elf was sitting on his
shoulder, talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   His telescope project nevertheless took on immense importance
when the astronomer Edwin Hubble, of Mount Wilson, discovered that
the universe was expanding. The great ambition of the 200-inch
project was to explore the meaning of the expanding-universe
discovery and determine the overall structure of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Financed by a $6 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation,
the telescope took 20 years to build, until the project become the
scientific equivalent of a cathedral. Hale died before the
telescope was finished, and never saw its full majesty.
</P>
<P>
   The Hale Telescope is seven stories tall and sits inside an
Art-Deco-style dome that is almost exactly the size of the Pantheon
in Rome. It consists of at least 250,000 parts, though not even Hal
Petrie, the chief engineer of Palomar Observatory, is sure of the
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the parts were designed and built for the
telescope, and were machined or cast by hand _ even the smallest
parts of ball bearings,'' Petrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope glides on Flying Horse Telescope Oil, developed by
Mobil Corp. in the 1930s, and it is so beautifully balanced that
only a single grapefruit-sized electric motor is needed to drive
the entire 530-ton behemoth as it follows the stars across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved the telescope by hand,'' Petrie said. There are
only 20 gallons of Flying Horse oil left. Petrie said that he will
soon switch to ordinary motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Hale's main mirror is a waffle-textured disk of Pyrex glass
200 inches (nearly 17 feet, or 5 meters) across, and it weighs 14
tons, making it the heaviest piece of glass in the world. It was
cast in 1934 at the Corning Glass Works, in Corning, N.Y., amid a
swirl of newspaper reports and live radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The glass spent a year cooling in a special oven, and then it
was carried across the United States to the Caltech optical shop in
Pasadena, while crowds gathered along the tracks to watch the
``Telescope Train'' pass.
</P>
<P>
   Polishing the glass took 13 years. During that time, Caltech
opticians ground away 7 tons of powdered glass. The opticians gave
the mirror its final shape by hand, rubbing it with polishing disks
the size of coins, using the finest jeweler's rouge, even using
powdered walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they stroked the glass with their bare thumbs _ the
ridges of a human finger were enough to give the glass its final
polish.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific instruments normally last a few years before they
become obsolete, but the Hale is a striking exception to that rule.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have installed advanced electronic sensors on the
Hale that have kept it competitive with larger ground-based
telescopes, like the Kecks in Hawaii, and it is still being used to
make discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Dr. Stephen Eikenberry, a Caltech astronomer,
used a high-speed infrared camera on the Hale to take ``movies'' of
black holes swallowing matter inside our galaxy, shot at 10 frames
a second. ``We saw evidence of material flowing into a black hole
and suddenly disappearing,'' Eikenberry said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni used the Hale Telescope to
discover the first known brown dwarf star _ a faint star that
resembles a glowing version of the planet Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   And last fall, Philip Nicholson of Cornell University used the
Hale to discover two new moons orbiting the planet Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Hale Telescope be working 50 years from now? ``Yes _
but maybe not,'' Kulkarni said.
</P>
<P>
   Kulkarni said that the best place for a telescope is in outer
space, where the view is clearest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming there are no major wars, and rocket flights are
routine, then I can imagine all astronomy being done in space,''
Kulkarni said. ``I can also imagine an alternative world, where
we'll have our usual problems, and space will remain an expensive
endeavor. Then the Hale will still be part of astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Petrie has collected a large shelf of engineering
textbooks dating from the 1930s for future Palomar engineers to use
as reference manuals.

<P>
   Until quite recently titles like Donald Bartlett and James
Steele's ``America: What Went Wrong?'' typified commentary about
the U.S. economy, and economic journalism was dominated by scare
headlines about downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after a mere two years of good news America's mood has
become startlingly triumphalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many business and political leaders America has
entered the era of the New Economy, in which traditional limits to
economic expansion are no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Because America has a New Economy and the rest of the world does
not, it supposedly is once more indisputably No. 1, and the rest of
the world must adopt its values and emulate its institutions if it
wants to compete.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone with a sense of history, this is deeply worrying. If
pride goeth before a fall, the United States has one heck of a
comeuppance in store.
</P>
<P>
   What of our so-called New Economy? America has had a favorable
turn in the business cycle, abetted by some temporary factors that
have helped keep inflation down, and probably also by shifts in the
labor market that have reduced the bargaining power of workers and
therefore allowed fuller employment without accelerating wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Economy actually looks a lot like the Old Economy.
It has about the same long-run growth rate but can run at slightly
lower unemployment. Things could be worse, but nothing fundamental
has changed _ the amount of good news is not enough to justify the
triumphant rhetoric one now hears so often.
</P>
<P>
   Why, if the U.S. economy is not doing as well as advertised, do
we have the sense of renewed American preeminence? One answer may
be that other economies _ in Europe and in Asia _ have fallen
short. In a world of stagnation and crisis, a country that
continues to make even modest progress may be entitled to some
self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that much of the world has disappointed
expectations that were widely held only a few years ago. The days
when the economist Lester Thurow could confidently predict, ``Over
the next five years Europe will move to full employment,'' and the
journalist James Fallows could declare, in the January 1994
Atlantic Monthly, ``Like it or not, we live in the world that Asian
success stories have shaped. We need to figure out how to compete
in it,'' seem distant now.
</P>
<P>
   But just as pronouncements of American triumph turn out, on
close examination, to be overstated, so do the dismissals of
European and Asian prospects that one now hears.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, compared with the optimism that prevailed at the
beginning of this decade, Europe's economic performance has been a
huge disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly distressing to those who place their faith in
European unity has been the failure of measures aimed at
reinforcing that unity _ the creation of a single market, the drive
toward a common currency _ to jump-start the continent's economy. A
good case can even be made that the efforts of European countries
to meet the criteria for entry into the European Monetary Union
(EMU) at the end of this year have actually aggravated the problems
of slow growth and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Will the achievement of EMU transform the situation? Almost
surely not.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a massive and occasionally bitter debate over
whether on economic grounds Europe really should have a single
currency. EMU advocates have failed to make a convincing case for
large gains, but EMU opponents have also failed to make a
conclusive case for large losses.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that seems clear, however, is that establishing a
single currency will have little if any impact on Eurosclerosis.
The forces that keep unemployment high and job creation low will be
as strong on Jan. 2 of next year as they are today.
</P>
<P>
   My own amateur prediction is that this persistence will lead to
a period of great political disillusionment. Having spent many
years suffering under the disciplines of the Maastricht treaty,
Europe will arrive at the promised land and find that it looks an
awful lot like the desert.
</P>
<P>
   That said, in some respects the European economy continues to
show considerable resilience. Given the general sense that the
United States has once again seized the technological high ground,
it is surprising to learn that the already small gap in
productivity between the United States and advanced European
countries has continued to narrow during this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has taken more rapidly to the Internet and
e-mail than most European countries, largely because of low
telephone charges, although the most wired country in the world is,
surprisingly, not the United States but Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, on the other hand, have technologically superior
cellular phones. Which matters more for business? Never mind; the
point is that Europe and the United States are operating at
essentially the same technological level, with each side of the
Atlantic having a small edge in some things.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, in short, has a poorly functioning labor market, as it
has for the past generation, and as a result has a dreary
employment picture. But on other fronts the gap between Europe and
the United States has narrowed or vanished, not widened.
</P>
<P>
   The only sense in which Europe has fallen behind is its failure
to live up to unrealistic Europhile expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As to Asia, however, rarely in the course of economic events has
a region's reputation suffered as severe a reversal as that of its
emerging economies since last summer. Events are now moving too
quickly to be sure how far and deep Asia's crisis will reach,
although it has already exceeded anyone's worst expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The best available diagnosis of the crisis is that it was made
possible by runaway Asian financial institutions that in effect
gambled with other people's money. The inevitable failure of many
of them was hastened and reinforced by a circular process in which
collapsing asset values undermined banks. An imploding banking
system not only further depressed asset values but disrupted the
normal functioning of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign investors, whose excessive optimism had
helped create the bubble, ran for the exits. The success of
International Monetary Fund-sponsored stabilization plans is still
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   While the scene has been astonishingly grim, however, Asia's
present failures need to be viewed with as much perspective as its
past successes. An economy may suffer a severe financial crisis,
then recover and grow as rapidly as ever. In fact, the
susceptibility of an economy to financial crises and its ability to
deliver sustained growth in general have little to do with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the U.S. economy between the Civil War and World
War I was notoriously crisis-prone. Nor were catastrophes like the
Panic of 1873 pure accidents. They were made much more likely by a
business and political culture in which petty things like
scrupulous accounting were disdained and wholesale corruption was a
matter of course. So too, many business empires were built on the
strength not so much of productive efficiency as of political
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite a steady stream of scandals and the occasional
devastating panic, the United States rose over those years to the
position of economic preeminence that it now, rather prematurely,
claims to have recaptured. In short, emerging Asia will be back.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant to suggest that the United States is in
any sense on the verge of crisis; its economy does seem
fundamentally sound. But the current sense that the United States
is on top of the world is based on a huge exaggeration of the
implications of a few good years here and a few bad years
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Let there be even a mild recession in the United States, a
moderate recovery in Europe and Japan and a rebound in emerging
Asia, and talk of the return of American dominance will start to
sound silly indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Future historians will not record that the 21st century belonged
to the United States.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Lopez left his Bronx home in a big hurry one morning
several months ago and became a medical statistic by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened to him; he felt fine. But the vials of
prescription medications on the edge of his bathroom sink went
unopened that morning, and again that afternoon, and then most of
the rest of the week. By the end of the month he had stopped taking
them at all.
</P>
<P>
   With other things on his mind, Lopez, 41 and disabled, had
joined the ranks of millions of Americans who fail to take their
medications as prescribed _ and who are suddenly attracting a flood
of attention in the health-care world.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study over the last 20 years has shown that misuse
of prescription drugs is a worldwide epidemic every bit as
dangerous and costly as an actual medical illness. It was tagged
``America's other drug problem'' in the early 1990s when
researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent
of hospital and nursing home admissions studied.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association of
pharmaceutical companies, estimated that misuse of prescription
drugs had caused 125,000 deaths a year from heart disease alone. In
1993 the same organization calculated that not taking medicines
correctly was draining upwards of $100 billion a year from the
nation's economy in direct and indirect costs.
</P>
<P>
   And with increased cost consciousness has come a new
appreciation of the problem of ``noncompliance,'' as medicine has
labeled the phenomenon of skipping some doses, doubling up on
others, forgetting to refill at the end of the month, or taking a
few of a family member's antibiotics on the chance they will work
better than the ones prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has been sharpened by new studies clearly demonstrating
that disorders ranging from elevated blood cholesterol to asthma
respond far better when patients take medications as prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side of the equation has been vividly illustrated
by the medications for tuberculosis and AIDS: they may actually
damage a patient's health when taken improperly, by inducing
drug-resistant disease that may be passed on to others and cannot
be treated at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, improving medication-taking behavior may be one of the
few arenas in health care today where widely disparate interest
groups _ including medical researchers, patient advocates, drug
companies, public health authorities and HMO executives _ share a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The result: an outpouring of medical articles and studies on the
subject and a cornucopia of new tactics, devices and programs all
aiming to cajole patients like Pedro Lopez to remember their pills.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, his lapse might have netted him nothing more than
a lecture from his frustrated doctor and a sheaf of new
prescriptions. Instead, only days after he confessed at the
doctor's office, Lopez found himself the center of a flurry of
activity directed at getting him back on track.
</P>
<P>
   He had a set of new medications with fewer side effects, a
simplified schedule for taking them, a stack of informational
brochures about them, a weekly appointment with a health educator,
a little oval tag for his key chain that beeped at pill-taking
time, and an account with a mail-order pharmacy that delivers his
refills automatically at the end of each month. Several weeks later
Lopez said he was taking his medication more regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in general take about 75 percent of their medications
as prescribed,'' said Joyce Cramer, a medical researcher at Yale
University and an authority on drug-taking behavior. But within
that figure the range of misbehavior is wide.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Houston Miller, a nurse who is the associate director of
Stanford University's Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Palo Alto,
estimated that 10 to 20 percent of patients grossly flout
medication regimens _ never filling the prescriptions or taking
only a few token pills.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent take doses more or less correctly. And an
all-important 30 percent to 40 percent in the middle are ``partial
compliers,'' forgetful enough that the medication may have only a
fraction of its desired effect or may actually be harming them, but
well-intentioned and able to be trained.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay of medications and diseases and human behavior
further complicates the picture. Some drugs are more ``forgiving''
than others, said Dr. John Urquhart, a physician and professor of
pharmacoepidemiology at Maastricht University in Maastricht, the
Netherlands, who is one of the world's experts in medication-taking
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The blood-pressure drug reserpine, for instance, continues to
lower pressure for a full two weeks after a dose, forgiving many
pill-taking lapses. Shorter-acting medications demand better
compliance to work.
</P>
<P>
   And some diseases are more forgiving, too. Patients with serious
diseases who are veterans at taking medication _ cardiac-transplant
patients, for instance _ are usually better pill takers than those
with silent conditions like high blood pressure, Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, predicting what patient will display which
pill-taking behavior often yields surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Income, education, sophistication and competence in other parts
of life correlate only very poorly with pill-taking behavior, the
experts agree. People who know the purpose of the medication and
the way it is supposed to work often do better than others. But
education has its definite limits in inducing good pill-taking
behavior _ doctors, for example, are notoriously poor at it. In one
large study of heart-attack prevention in male doctors in the
1980s, a full 30 percent of doctors were disqualified because they
proved unable to take a single pill reliably every day.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as valuable as educational brochures, package inserts and
videotapes may be, they are often now supplemented with a range of
new compliance tools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some tools are million-dollar, labor-intensive programs. At
Stanford, for instance, Ms. Miller has shown that heart-attack
patients assigned to a nurse who spends hours educating them about
diet, smoking, exercise and drug treatment, and then makes
follow-up phone calls at home, are far more likely to stay on their
medications than those who receive standard medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in New York City, a program in which city health
department workers actually hand tuberculosis patients their
medications every morning and watch them swallow has been credited
with dramatically increasing cure rates for the disease in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Other new gadgets encourage patients to supervise themselves. A
famous prototype for these devices was the circular container
developed in the 1960s to help women remember their daily oral
contraceptive pill. Flat blister-packs of prescription medications
are now widely used in Europe to serve the same purpose, Urquhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the AIDS clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital, every patient is
supplied with a large rectangular pillbox whose 28 compartments can
hold a week's worth of medications to be taken several times a day,
said Dr. Gerald Friedland, a professor of medicine at Yale who
directs the AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
   Current treatment for AIDS requires patients to take up to two
dozen pills daily, often with different requirements for each, like
an empty or a full stomach. ``What's special about HIV infection is
the sheer complexity of the medications,'' Friedland said. ``One of
the definite predictors of poor adherence to treatment is the
complexity of the regimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gadgets now on the market include simple electronic alarms
that can be programmed to sound at intervals throughout the day and
more sophisticated beepers that flash messages (``Time to take a
gemfibrozil now,'' it might tell patients with heart disease) as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And the newest devices entering offices and clinics can actually
provide patients with little monthly medication report-cards, for
both patient and doctor to inspect and try to improve.
</P>
<P>
   They are pill-bottle caps fitted with a battery and a computer
chip that remembers every time the bottle cap is opened and closed.
Once a month the chip's memory can be downloaded into a computer
and turned into a graph of exactly when during the month the
patient dipped into the vial.
</P>
<P>
   Originally developed by Urquhart at Aprex Corp. in California in
the 1980s, the bottlecaps have until recently been used almost
exclusively in research studies. But the product is now making
significant inroads into regular medical care. More than 100,000
patients have been monitored with the Aprex device to date, said
Janice Wohltmann, a vice president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Far more accurate than other monitoring devices like medication
diaries or blood levels of drugs, the bottle caps can tell doctors
if ``the drug failed the patient, or the patient failed to take the
drug,'' Ms. Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are seldom aware of the extent of their missed
medication doses, and, if aware, they are unlikely to share the
dismal truth with the doctor. But the information is crucial if
doctors are to figure out if a patient who does not respond to a
medication needs a different one, or just some help in taking the
original prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle cap data can also be used in a kind of behavior
modification system to encourage patients to stay with the
treatment, she said. Patients can see for themselves that when they
take their pills properly, their blood cholesterol, or blood
pressure, or blood sugar reflects the good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the type of monitoring that should become very common,''
Ms. Cramer said. ``It's a part of a diagnostic evaluation'' _ an
objective reflection of the patient's medical condition just like a
blood test.
</P>
<P>
   So far no issues of privacy have surfaced in marketing the caps,
she said. Even schizophrenic patients, generally leery of
surveillance devices on or near their person, have accepted the
caps with equanimity, she said, and greatly improved their
medication-taking abilities as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a medication is a little like enlisting in the army,
Urquhart said. ``You're recruited in an office with the flags and
the uniforms and you hear all about the big picture. But then after
you sign on you find yourself in boot camp'' _ and everybody needs
a little help learning how to march in step.

SALVAGING ISSUE IS HEATING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Priscilla E. Muller can remember the name, but not the face, of
the man who walked through her door Jan. 26, 1995, asking her to
authenticate what appeared to be a centuries-old, gem-studded
rosary.
</P>
<P>
   So many people bearing jewels allegedly recovered from
shipwrecks come in asking Muller, curator of the Hispanic Society
of America Museum in New York City, to identify their treasures
that she can't possibly remember them all, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Muller does recall telling the man the rosary design appeared to
be similar to that found in Spain's New World colonies 250 years
ago. That was about it. The museum prohibits her from outright
authenticating an artifact or allowing herself or the museum to be
mentioned in any promotional material.
</P>
<P>
   So she was somewhat taken aback last week to find herself being
quoted on the Internet as praising the authenticity of the very
same piece of jewelry _ now up for sale for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole field of treasure hunters is replete with people
simply looking for money. I find it all quite troubling, more so
because the field is growing,'' says Muller, who is retiring after
30 years at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure hunting is booming as a result of better and better
technology for finding long-lost wrecks, creating not only a
growing market in recovered artifacts, but an intensifying battle
over whether it's just good business or a greedy rape of our
archeological past.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for example, a Virgina-based treasure hunter, with
a flotilla of television producers in tow, plans to return to the
five-mile deep site in the mid-Atlantic where he has located the
wreck of a Japanese submarine bombed by Americans. The I-52, which
salvors say is the deepest wreck ever located (Titanic is 2 miles
deep), sank in 1944 with approximately two tons of gold destined
for Germany. The salvor, Paul Tidwell, said the Americans dropped
sonar bouys after the bombings, which picked up the sound of
gunshots as the sub's crew committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell hopes to recover the gold and perhaps raise the
submarine. But the submarine is a war tomb, and while the Japanese
government has remained somewhat quiet on the subject with Tidwell,
one embassy official, requesting anonymity, said in an interview
last week that his government will ``strongly object at the proper
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just one example of how ethically muddied the salvage
waters have gotten of late. Some other examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Last February, Spain laid claim to all wrecks of its ships and
their gold, wherever they lie, a step that raised some eyebrows
among some academics who recall that the Spanish crown devastated
numbers of indigenous civilizations in its search for riches a few
centuries ago. Among the wrecks targeted by the Spanish edict are
two ships _ allegedly Spanish warships and carrying gold _ located
just 1,000 feet off a Virginia beach. Legal arguments over the
ownership of these two ships are being prepared at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   _Last month, in an unrelated case, a US Supreme Court decision
essentially granted salvors a giant step forward toward claiming
ownership of wrecks discovered in US waters. The case stems from
the wreck of the sidewheeler Brother Jonathan, which sank in 1865
off the California coast with an army shipment of $2-million in
gold. Excavation can't begin until further litigation establishes
terms of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   _A 500-page tome released this month (``Ship of Gold'' by Gary
Kinder; Atlantic Monthly Press) describes in detail how an Ohio
engineer found the sidewheel steamship Central America, and
continues to salvage it. The sidewheeler sank in an 1857 hurricane
off the Carolinas, taking 21 tons of California Goldrush gold 8,000
feet deep. The details of how the material is being extracted is a
tightly held secret, but the remote control arms of a six-ton robot
built for this job are so versatile they can thread a bolt and nut.
</P>
<P>
   _Next month, the world community will debate in Paris a proposal
by UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural watchdog, to prohibit the
trade in any artifacts salvaged for profit in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   _In August, Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol,
R.I.,will sponsor a symposium specifically addressing issues of
law, technology, and ethics of treasure hunting, and elaborate on
events at the UNESCO conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that these days it's hard to keep discussion on a
rational level, such are the passions involved,'' said Lydel Prott,
organizer of the UNESCO conference.
</P>
<P>
   That passion stems from two very different approaches to
salvaging wrecks, an issue that didn't bubble to the surface until
a dozen years ago when treasure hunters made two significant finds.
Barry Clifford located the remains of the pirate ship Whydah off
Cape Cod, and Mel Fisher located the Nuestra Senora de Atocha _
with some $400 million in bullion _ off the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists argue that an excavation done for profit will not
be done with the time and attention to detail required to tell the
story of the ship and its times, not just recover its artifacts.
And so until funds can be raised and academically trained
archeologists can be assigned to the job, the wreck should remain
untouched, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material will keep under water. Our fear is always that
real history is lost. And none of these guys (the salvors) hangs
around to write the book,'' said James Delgado, author of the
Encyclopedia of Underwater and Maritime Archeology, published last
month by Yale University Press. Delgado is the executive director
of the Vancouver Maritime Museum, which, like many museums, does
not exhibit artifacts salvaged from wrecks for profit.
</P>
<P>
   In the other camp are the treasure hunters _ they prefer
``commercial salvors'' _ who claim that without private enterprise
and the willingness to take risks, humankind will be deprived of
relics _ and the salvors their gold _ as they wait for government
or museum funding for underwater excavations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's something greater at stake here,'' added Peter
Hess, a treasure salvor attorney from Wilmington, Del., who will
speak on the issue of ethics at the Aug. 14 Roger Williams
symposium, to be held in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government laws of late increasingly require salvors to handle
their finds responsibly. Take away private enterprise _ and this
applies most to the UNESCO proposal _ and the salvors will be
forced to work fast and recklessly, because you're never going to
stop treasure hunting,'' says Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Caught somewhere in the middle are the museums, as they try to
sort out what comprises an ``ethical'' exhibit. A year ago, for
example, the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City sponsored
a program on pirate lore and invited Kenneth Kinkor of Eastham, by
all accounts the expert of the Whydah, the only pirate wreck ever
located.
</P>
<P>
   Academic archeologists who disapprove of how the Whydah
excavation has been funded and executed got wind of the invitation.
They told museum officials that inviting Kinkor was akin to
condoning treasure hunting. South Street canceled Kinkor's
invitation, a decision the museum now regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was censorship, plain and simple, and it was wrong. We have
apologized to Mr. Kinkor,'' said Diane Dallal, director of
archeology for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit currently blackballed by academic purists is a
collection from the wreck of the Henrietta Marie, a 1700s-slave
ship discovered off Florida by treasure hunters and excavated in
the mid-1980s. By several accounts, the job was poorly done from an
archeology perspective. Nevertheless, 200 artifacts recovered from
the wreck, including chains and shackles, have enabled researchers
to trace the ship's origins to London, and fill in with graphic new
new details the early days of the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's Vancouver museum considers the exhibit tainted, a
byproduct of profiteers, and therefore would be an improper exhibit
at his museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``By exhibiting artifacts from treasure hunters, we are
condoning their work,'' Delgado said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History
chose to feature the Henrietta artifacts last fall. In the
three-month period they were on display, museum attendance more
than doubled, from 40,000 to 90,300, according to Karen Turner,
director of special programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers fastened onto the show. There are so few tangible
ways teach about slavery,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the purists agree that the public, not the
professors within ivory towers, will decide what is and isn't
ethical. Delgado, for example, points out that two fathers of
modern archeology _ Lord Carnarvon, financier of the Tutankhamen
tomb discovery in 1922, and Heinrich Schliemann, who found Troy in
1870 _ were, first and foremost, collectors, or treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hispanic museum in New York, curator Muller says there
was little doubt in her mind that the man who walked into her
office in 1995 was a collector. With the help of paperwork she
provided, the Globe located Robert I. Colombo, a retired CIA agent,
in Indialantic, &UR;  &LR; Fla. Yes, he said, he remembered the meeting well,
and he suggested that the only way an embellished account of their
exchange got onto the internet was through one of his former
business associates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rosary was recovered by an amateur diver on a 1715
shipwreck in Florida, and is slated for sale at the Sphinx auction
house in London this autumn. Anyone who tries to buy it from the
internet site ``is going to be out some serious money,'' he added,
because the rosary is not for sale on the internet.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the telephone number listed on the web site end in
taped music. Inquiries to the only address listed, an e-mail
address, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more pirates today,'' Colombo said, ``than when all
this stuff went down.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Everything changed after Latrell Sprewell
strangled the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Warriors General Manager Garry St. Jean had agreed
to go wine tasting with me. I would copy down his comments and
write an article about the jock whose taste in beverages extends
beyond Gatorade and Bud Lite. Because that's the truth _ Garry St.
Jean knows from wine.
</P>
<P>
   But there was that unfortunate incident involving Sprewell's
fingers around the throat of P.J. Carlesimo, which was followed by
a hasty call from St. Jean. His tone was apologetic. It wouldn't
look good, he explained, if a photo showed up in print with the
general manager grinning broadly and sipping chardonnay while the
team was in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   I could see his point, although my mind immediately raced ahead
to the caption under the photo: ``Latrell Sprewell may have
strangled coach P.J. Carlesimo, but Garry St. Jean doesn't choke on
merlot.''
</P>
<P>
   We put our outing on hold, let the wine age a little longer. And
about a minute after the Warriors season ended, St. Jean was on the
phone. ``When are we going wine tasting?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   So, about a week ago, we went.
</P>
<P>
   There was St. Jean, his wife Mary Jane (known as M.J.) and me. I
had selected three wineries, Ravenswood, Arrowood and Chateau St.
Jean, all fine Sonoma County producers. And if you've noticed that
St. Jean the coach and St. Jean the winery have the same name,
you've discovered the key to this article. Here's the background.
</P>
<P>
   In his pre-wine days, St. Jean worked as an assistant coach for
Don Nelson on the Milwaukee Bucks. That was in 1980. Nelson
(usually called Nellie) ain't exactly your typical wine
sophisticate. He and St. Jean would chug beer and feel they had
achieved the height of culture. ``I guess we were what you'd call
relative rookies,'' St. Jean told me.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, when Nelson became head coach of the Warriors, he
hired St. Jean as an assistant. Dan Gustafson and Mike Kenton of
Chateau St. Jean noticed. They were wine guys, but they were also
Warriors season-ticket holders, and they thought, hey, wouldn't it
be a blast to meet the coaches and do a little wine promoting at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   So Gustafson and Kenton, who've since moved to Codorniu Napa,
sent St. Jean some wine and invited him and M.J. to the winery, and
pretty soon they all became friends. As time went on, and St. Jean
the coach continued to drink St. Jean the wine, he noticed the
stuff actually tasted good. Before long, he was devoted. When
people asked, ``Is Chateau St. Jean your winery?'' he replied,
``Sure. Drop by the property.'' He and M.J. own a house on Cape
Cod. Over the front door is a sign: ``Chateau St. Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why we found ourselves in a stretch limo
headed north toward Sonoma on a sunny Friday morning. We were
greeted at Ravenswood by David Riffo, head of hospitality, who
explained Ravenswood makes big bucks from its California
chardonnay, known as Chateau Cache Fl'eau. We didn't spend time in
the tasting room. Instead, Riffo took us to a barrel room where he
dipped into a barrel with a long plastic tube that looked like a
turkey baster. In fact, it's called a ``thief,'' and it scooped up
1997 Barricia Vineyard Chardonnay from an old cask and then from a
new cask.
</P>
<P>
   The wine from the old cask had hints of green apples and pears,
all the usual stuff wine writers write about. You feel like a dope
if you don't taste them, too. The wine from the new barrel was
smoky. Riffo said the two wines would be blended together. The
chardonnay was really terrific, especially when you consider that
Ravenswood is a red wine house, well-known for zinfandel. By the
way, if you don't find my wine adjectives specific enough, remember
I'm just a dumb sporstwriter.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean has better adjectives. Riffo was talking about
malolactic fermentation. Pretty soon, he'd have gotten down to the
molecular level _ that's how enthusiastic he was about the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malolactic fermentation,'' St. Jean said, impressed. ``Holy
Moly!''

SHOULD YOU EXERCISE WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By USHA LEE MCFARLING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We've debated this question in the locker room for several
years. Should you stop working out or work out at a reduced level
when you have a cold? Does exercise sap energy needed to fight off
a cold?
</P>
<P>
   A.C., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A sports physiologist and a personal trainer we consulted on
this question say there is no definitive answer to your question
but there simple guidelines to follow when sniffles catch up with
you.
</P>
<P>
   First, decide if the symptoms are more cold-like or flu-like,
says Ken Baldwin, a personal trainer and president of Premier
Fitness Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. If it's simply a cold that's cut
your energy levels and given you a runny nose, you might want to
work out, but at reduced levels. While doing so, make sure your
heart rate and temperature aren't rising excessively. Also, stop
exercising if you feel dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   If symptoms are flu-like, says Baldwin, and you have chest
congestion or fever, you might want to stay off the treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually advise people to go home, rest, and drink a lot of
fluids,'' says Baldwin, an official of IDEA, an international
association that educates those in the exercise industry. ``If
you're wheezing and coughing up phlegm, you just can't exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to exercising _ less than three weeks _ it's
better to err on the side of caution and sit out exercising while
sick, advises Greg Bennett, a senior exercise physiologist at the
Health and Lifestyle Center of Memorial Hospital in South Bend,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Exercisers who have been sick face a second decision as well:
when to return to a normal regimen. Don't try to catch up, or
overdo your exercising to make up for the days missed, cautions
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be symptom-free, but your body is still recovering,''
he says. ``It needs time to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Build up slowly. You won't lose those strength or cardiovascular
gains in just a few days, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin and Bennett say that exercising too soon after you've
been sick, or overdoing exercise, can sap the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than having the resources to fight the flu, you're
trying to recover from a worn-out cardiovascular system,'' says
Baldwin.

 SONOMA, Calif.: ``Holy Moly!''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's just stop here and say a Holy Moly from St. Jean is praise
of the highest order. He used Holy Moly to express his fascination
with malolactic fermentation, and to describe his joy with
delicious, complex wines. Holy Moly is, frankly, as good as any
wine term I've ever heard, and it's a lot less snobby.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, a St. Jean Holy Moly may become the wine equivalent
of two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert. You can just see ads in the
newspaper: ``Chateau So-and-So is proud to announce that its
sauvignon blanc earned the prestigious Holy Moly from Garry St.
Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   We made the transition to red wines, or as Riffo said, ``That's
enough of chardonnay. Let's go taste some real wine.'' St. Jean
tasted an estate merlot from the barrel. Lovely stuff. ``Why so
heavy?'' St. Jean asked. ``It's not filtered or fined,'' Riffo
said, holding his glass up to the light. The liquid was slightly
murky. St. Jean nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Riffo climbed up seven barrels and brought down a sample of
Ravenswood's Gregory Vineyard Merlot. ``What do you taste?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   M.J. St. Jean looked thoughtful. ``It's minty,'' she said.
``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Riffo smiled. ``Because the vineyard is bordered by eucalyptus
trees. The oils are carried by the wind and land on the grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean downed his glass of merlot, a look of deep pleasure on
his face. ``I don't spit it out,'' he said. ``I drink it.'' Then he
added, ``Holy Moly!''
</P>
<P>
   We were greeted at Arrowood by Michael Monahan, hospitality
manager. Arrowood's owner, Richard Arrowood, used to be the
winemaker at St. Jean, put that place on the map before starting
his own winery. He recently opened a new tasting room at Arrowood _
beamed ceilings, fireplace, view of the hills. It looks like a ski
chalet.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan took us to a private tasting room on the second floor.
On a table, he had set out five glasses for each of us. First we
tasted a 1996 Sonoma County Chardonnay, which St. Jean called
``lush,'' but M.J. found too ``oaky'' for her taste. Next came a
1996 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (pronounced vee-ohn-yea). You
probably know that viognier is the newest white-wine craze. M.J.
liked it. ``It smells sweet, but it drinks dry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she tasted a 1994 Sonoma County Reserve Speciale Cabernet,
M.J. said, ``Wow!'' St. Jean said, ``I love it.'' They sprung for
two bottles. The price, $50 apiece. A 1994 Reserve Merlot was also
astonishing, and its price was too: $55.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, St. Jean's attention was elsewhere. Each wine came
with winemaster's notes on an elegantly printed card. St. Jean held
up the card. He said that when he coached, he'd write his plays on
a card just that size. There would be regular plays and ``need''
plays for when he absolutely had to have a bucket at the end of the
game. These need plays might be run for Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway
or Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch (Lakers coach) Del Harris,'' St. Jean said. ``He
holds his card. Nellie and I keep it in our breast pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine this scene, right? St. Jean is coaching.
There's one second left in the game. He's down by a point. He
reaches into his pocket and frantically grabs the card. But it's
the wine card. The players look at him for guidance. He yells,
``Arrowood 1996 Russian River Valley Viognier.'' They make the
hoop, and all the players think he's a genius.
</P>
<P>
   We drove to Chateau St. Jean, where Ken Bailey, the hospitality
manager and a Warriors season-ticket holder, escorted us upstairs
to the Green Room. It used to be part of a guest suite for VIPs.
St. Jean and M.J. have slept there several times, surrounded by
vineyards and green hills. A few years ago, the suite was converted
to a private tasting and eating room. Before that happened, Don
Nelson's son Donnie stayed there on his wedding night. The last
people to sleep there before the conversion were Dusty Baker and
his wife, Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   When we sat down at the table in the Green Room, we noticed the
private menu. It said: ``Luncheon at the Chateau Honoring our
Guests Mr. Lowell Cohn, Mr. Garry St. Jean and Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you think I'm bragging about this, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   They'd matched a wine with each course, the way they do at fancy
restaurants I can never afford. For example, the 1995 Robert Young
Vineyards Chardonnay went with the Salad of Field Greens With Bay
Shrimp, Apple and Dried Cranberries Tossed in Tarragon Dressing.
</P>
<P>
   In my tasting notes on the chardonnay, I have St. Jean saying,
``Boy, is that good.'' He was smiling. He had learned about
chardonnay years ago by drinking the Robert Young, and now, even
though time had passed, the wine didn't disappoint. St. Jean was
falling in love with this wine all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that it's only $22,'' he said. ``I've tasted
more expensive wine that's not as good. Obviously, I'm partial, but
this is my favorite.'' M.J. said, ``It's buttery. I like chardonnay
that melts in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to the 1995 Pinot Noir, Durell Vineyards from
Carneros. In case you're wondering, it went with the Wild Mushroom
Risotto. M.J. was puzzled. She's not been exposed often to pinot
noir and struggled for a vocabulary to express her feelings. ``It's
not my favorite of the day by any means,'' she said. ``But I'm
trying to figure out why. It's spicy.'' She frowned because that
didn't say what she meant. ``It's just different for me.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean had no problem with the pinot noir, which, at $28, was
a gorgeous rendering of that grape.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon, Cinq Cepages, a
blend of five reds, which went with the beef tenderloin. St. Jean
savored the cab, price $24. ``A guy like me,'' he said, ``I don't
understand how Arrowood can charge $50, and this doesn't need to
take a backseat.'' There was much discussion on that subject. It
was decided that with Arrowood, you pay for the name and the
limited production along with the high quality.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean didn't care. He took one more sip of the St. Jean cab.
He let it roll along his tongue and slide down his throat. He gazed
at everyone in the room. ``Holy Moly!'' he said. And he meant it.

THE TREATMENT 
By Daniel Menaker. Knopf. 269 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Freud. Democratized, deified, misunderstood, and finally
vilified, he dared to open the Pandora's Box of the unconscious and
then encouraged us to spill the contents. For this courageous
transgression he has been the celebrated scapegoat of the human
condition ever since, as though he himself were responsible for all
the little cruelties of neurosis and the hidden behemoths of the
id. Ah, well. His spirit is probably safe enough, with a defender
like Dr. Morales. ``You want to slice up Freud the Father like a
sausage, no?'' he might say to a cowering analysand. ``You feel
this patricidal wish of death, and so you visit it upon the man who
is trying to save you! Bah! I have no time for this. Go away; you
are boring me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his hilarious and terrifying construction of the analyst
provocateur at the heart of ``The Treatment,'' Daniel Menaker has
given us a shrink of such adversarial proportion it makes you long
for the Good Witch Glenda in his stead. Cuban, Catholic, a ``madman
privateer'' with an office on the Upper East Side, Dr. Ernesto
Morales uses his emigre English to make heinous accusations and
awful puns, yawns and shuffles papers when he's piqued, then
demands details of his patient's sex life to perk himself up. On
the couch for these harangues is the novel's narrator, Jake Singer,
a 30ish teacher of blue-blazer boys at the tony Coventry School who
has come to Morales for the usual large and small reasons: old
losses, broken relationships, destructively impulsive behavior.
What he finds in the alleged sanctum sanctorum is less epiphany
than pectoral-building battleground: Jake confesses, Morales
insults and humiliates, Jake departs to fight on higher ground.
Theirs is a therapy from Dante as enacted by the Marx Brothers, in
other words, and its diabolical brilliance is that Jake must
change, if only to get away from his tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   This folie a deux forms the larger reality of ``The Treatment,''
even though Jake's story, as lived in the real world, soon branches
out from Morales's grip to the less predictable milieu of work and
love. In keeping with its psychotherapeutic predecessors (David
Lodge's ``Therapy,'' Judith Rossner's ``August''), ``The
Treatment'' presumes to examine the flotsam of life's incidents
through the lens of a therapeutic narrative. Menaker's novel is
actually more at home within this realm; like the community of the
therapized, it has some trouble taking its transitions (and
transformations) to the streets. But you don't have to be a
congregant at the church of Freud to get the jokes in ``The
Treatment,'' or to bask in the luminously treacherous portrayal of
Morales. Finest of all, one is never quite sure if the man is a
loose pistol or a calculating saint. He is delivered to us, after
all, through Jake's less than objective rendering.
</P>
<P>
   That mutability, of both fact and affect, is the major theme
coursing through ``The Treatment'': That life is random and
fiercely relative, that a flat tire in Hoboken can influence the
entire world of a kid in SoHo. Menaker has submerged his serious,
even sorrowful story within the guise of a comic novel; like his
protagonist, he is funny but deep, and the jokes are usually
sublimated (or displaced) signposts pointing to a far darker
anxiety. An editor at The New Yorker for years, Menaker is also the
author of the highly respected story collection ``The Old Left'';
his aesthetic bent seems made for the shorter form, in fact, and
that is both one of the strengths of ``The Treatment'' _ its
laconic, gossamer insights _ as well as its primary weakness. When
the novel diverges into the greater path of Jake's life beyond the
consulting room, it has a tendency to veer toward pastiche. (It
becomes clear, for instance, that the novel is set in the early
1970s and that Jake sits around strumming old protest songs on his
guitar _ none of which has anything to do with the plot.) While one
side-story in particular is fully realized, the vignettes, stitched
together, lack novelistic heft; they also indulge a few plot
contrivances, as well as cringingly bad sexual moments, that
Morales himself would scarcely believe.
</P>
<P>
   But then coincidence, or the mystical power of cause and effect,
may be the one transformative device a guy like Jake can believe
in; thus far, he's been wrestled to the ground by the gods of
chaos, and even Morales concedes ``the general arbitrariness of the
human condition.'' Certainly artifice _ presented here as the
organizing principle of fiction, the idea of a purpose to life's
jumbled narrative _ has sustained Jake at the Coventry School,
where he takes refuge in the classics, passing on those promises to
his half-innocent charges. The only child of a Jewish cardiologist
whose wife died when the boy was 6, Jake has spent most of his life
bucking his father's chilly reserve and trying to recover from the
loss of his mother; he has the heart of a poet, not a doctor, and
that familial misfire has made him a teacher as well as an
alienated prodigal son. When he falls for Allegra Marshall, the
wealthy and recently widowed mother of a Coventry student, their
liaison offers all the possibilities of what Morales would call (no
doubt dismissively) a corrective experience.
</P>
<P>
   Allegra's relations to her two children lead Jake into a
picaresque tale that wanders from Manhattan to western
Massachusetts, reflecting the unresolved themes of his own life:
the contractual loyalty of family, the promise of children, the
mutual relevance of duty and love. Hovering throughout is Dr.
Morales, either in singular three-dimensional form or cathected as
an inner voice _ sarcastic, challenging, and sometimes wise _ in
Jake's ongoing interior monologue. It's high tribute to this
particular Dr. Strangelove that Jake's forays into the larger world
can seem frustratingly diversionary; we long to get back to that
uncomfortable couch, if only to witness the tortures Morales will
inflict from his desk on high.
</P>
<P>
   But Jake _ like any analysand, successful or failed _ must
eventually make his own way. That he emerges here, as the wistful,
seasoned voice of this mostly intelligent novel, is some kind of
proof that the treatment must have taken. That Menaker has rendered
his tyrannical creation with such sweet authenticity is testament
to an even greater truth, one Morales no doubt would cherish: the
core ambivalence of love itself, the inherent wish to kill the
thing we need the most.

<P>
   Whatever its duration and outcome, the Asian financial crisis
will be remembered for destroying the conventional wisdom that East
Asia's economies would prosper indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Still in question are the political lessons that Asians will
draw from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How much, for example, will political freedom be valued as a
necessary corollary to sound economic performance? Or will those
who argue that sound economic management is the political key prove
persuasive?
</P>
<P>
   And will a ``Confucian'' version of the discredited ``Asian
values'' thesis find adherents?
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began on July 2, 1997, when the Thai government
ceased wasting foreign reserves on a defense of the baht and
allowed it to fluctuate versus the dollar. The resulting ``managed
float'' immediately proved unmanageable. The baht's fall triggered
a regional currency and equity cascade.
</P>
<P>
   As it swept from Bangkok through Kuala Lumpur, Manila and
Jakarta to Seoul and Hong Kong, upbeat exponents of ``Asia
rising,'' ``the East Asian model,'' and an imminent ``Pacific
century'' barely had time to edit these phrases from their screens
and diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   A few early warnings had been sounded. The World Bank had
worried about trends in Thailand before July. And some skeptics,
such as the MIT economist Paul Krugman, had doubted that East
Asia's breakneck economic pace could be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most analysts were sanguine and slow to
reconsider. But in hindsight it is clear that for much of Asia,
1997 was an annus horribilis. The crisis appeared to have abated in
some countries earlier this year, notably Thailand and South Korea,
but it worsened in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy,
where President Suharto has finally been forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   These days most observers expect the crisis, or its aftershocks
at any rate, to endure into 1999 if not beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 five East Asian stock markets _ those of Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand _ lost more
than three-fifths of their value in dollars. Economic,
environmental and health problems due to Indonesia's prolonged
drought and forest fires compounded these shocks in maritime
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan's economy remained in doldrums that have lasted
seven years, longer than any other lapse in that country's growth
since World War II. As for China, financially hemorrhaging state
enterprises continue to threaten stability across the Middle
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of East Asia's crisis go beyond the region.
And they amount to more than the question the media keep asking:
``Who else will catch the Asian flu?''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the rupturing of optimism about East Asia
seems to tip the balance between the two most widely discussed
positions about the dynamics of power in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Asian financial crisis ravaged the
credibility of a supposedly distinctive East Asian, or Japanese,
model of economic growth based on cooperation between conglomerates
_ Japan's keiretsu, South Korea's chaebol, Indonesia's konglomerat
_ and astute government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing Asian markets revealed the crony capitalism beneath
the surface of East Asia's ``developmental state.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Asian crisis reduced the chances of a trans-Pacific
``clash of civilizations.'' Falling growth rates and mounting
losses in dollars jeopardized the resources and self-confidence
that leaders of the Asian world would need were they to challenge
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis damaged the Asian leg in the tripod model favored by
those who expected power after the Cold War to coalesce around
three regional blocs, each with its respective hinterland and hub:
East Asia fanning out from Tokyo, the Americas centered on
Washington, and Europe led from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head to head to head'' competition became less plausible as
the Asian head became less formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of this, American observers especially were prone to
believe that just as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 had
vindicated the American political model _ liberal democracy _ so
the fall of Asia's markets in 1997 proved the wisdom of the
American economic model _ free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is presumptuous to think that the crisis foretells Asian
acceptance of American ways _ that Americans can now truthfully
sing, ``We are the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, East Asia's diversity _ historical, cultural, political,
economic _ ensured that the crisis would affect each country
differently. And that has meant different explanations as to why
the trauma occurred and what still needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   For Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, to cite a vocal
example, anything-goes American capitalism was not the solution. It
was the problem. Blaming the crisis on arbitrageurs and hedge fund
managers such as American financier George Soros, Mahathir proposed
global controls on money trading that appalled Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The American model is hardly monolithic, and the issue of how to
resolve the Asian crisis has become contentious among Americans
themselves. On the same page of the Wall Street Journal, one expert
called for higher taxes and lower spending while another advised
the opposite. A third recommended doing nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Especially controversial have been the International Monetary
Fund's efforts to help resolve the crisis. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Laurence Summers, for instance, defends the IMF and its
prescriptions as crucial to Asia's recovery. But Harvard economist
Jeffrey Sachs claims it has made matters worse, while former
Secretary of State George Shultz recommends its abolition. Who can
say which of these men stands for the real American model?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Asians have been under mounting pressure to believe that
freer markets and freer politics could have prevented the crisis in
the first place, or at least mitigated its effects.
</P>
<P>
   As if the prescription of political freedom were a cure for East
Asia's economic ills, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung blames
the Asian crisis squarely on authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every country in Asia, including Korea,'' he has said,
``the major reason for (economic) failure was lack of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a comparison between South Korea and Singapore does not
confirm Kim's sweeping belief in lack of democracy as the major
reason for the economic setback in every country in Asia. For
example, in 1997-98 the value of South Korean stocks was set back
more in dollar terms than Singaporean equities, despite the greater
lack of political freedom in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In his own allocation of blame for the Asian crisis, Singapore's
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has suggested that what distinguishes
the unscathed from the damaged is not political democracy but good
governance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Singaporeans, Lee said, are not champions of human rights or
democracy, ``but we are very fastidious in the way in which we run
our business, and on financial matters we are completely
aboveboard.'' Lee also in effect acknowledged that not all ``Asian
values'' are constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the weaknesses of Confucianism,'' he noted, is
nepotism. The economies least able to resist the crisis are those
where nepotism _ ``the bane of East Asian countries,'' in his words
_ is most entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   But the views of Kim and Lee are more compatible than they first
appear. Electoral democracy can undermine good governance in the
absence of the rule of law. And good governance in a liberal
democracy requires public servants who are insulated from the
blandishments of special interests and the passions and whims of
momentary majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of East Asia are in a race to leave 1997 behind.
The leaders _ Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong _ are politically much
freer than Indonesia, the laggard. And in 1998 East Asia is
changing _ one hopes for the better _ but it is not Americanizing.
It is important for Americans to think realistically, not
wishfully, about the region.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly we may conclude that it is far too early to reinvent
the debunked East Asian miracle as any new parable about ``Asia
rising'' toward liberal democracy.

credibility of a supposedly distinctive East Asian, or Japanese,
model of economic growth based on cooperation between conglomerates
_ Japan's keiretsu, South Korea's chaebol, Indonesia's konglomerat
_ and astute government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing Asian markets revealed the crony capitalism beneath
the surface of East Asia's ``developmental state.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Asian crisis reduced the chances of a trans-Pacific
``clash of civilizations.'' Falling growth rates and mounting
losses in dollars jeopardized the resources and self-confidence
that leaders of the Asian world would need were they to challenge
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis damaged the Asian leg in the tripod model favored by
those who expected power after the Cold War to coalesce around
three regional blocs, each with its respective hinterland and hub:
East Asia fanning out from Tokyo, the Americas centered on
Washington, and Europe led from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head to head to head'' competition became less plausible as
the Asian head became less formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of this, American observers especially were prone to
believe that just as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 had
vindicated the American political model _ liberal democracy _ so
the fall of Asia's markets in 1997 proved the wisdom of the
American economic model _ free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is presumptuous to think that the crisis foretells Asian
acceptance of American ways _ that Americans can now truthfully
sing, ``We are the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, East Asia's diversity _ historical, cultural, political,
economic _ ensured that the crisis would affect each country
differently. And that has meant different explanations as to why
the trauma occurred and what still needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   For Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, to cite a vocal
example, anything-goes American capitalism was not the solution. It
was the problem. Blaming the crisis on arbitrageurs and hedge fund
managers such as American financier George Soros, Mahathir proposed
global controls on money trading that appalled Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The American model is hardly monolithic, and the issue of how to
resolve the Asian crisis has become contentious among Americans
themselves. On the same page of the Wall Street Journal, one expert
called for higher taxes and lower spending while another advised
the opposite. A third recommended doing nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Especially controversial have been the International Monetary
Fund's efforts to help resolve the crisis. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Laurence Summers, for instance, defends the IMF and its
prescriptions as crucial to Asia's recovery. But Harvard economist
Jeffrey Sachs claims it has made matters worse, while former
Secretary of State George Shultz recommends its abolition. Who can
say which of these men stands for the real American model?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Asians have been under mounting pressure to believe that
freer markets and freer politics could have prevented the crisis in
the first place, or at least mitigated its effects.
</P>
<P>
   As if the prescription of political freedom were a cure for East
Asia's economic ills, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung blames
the Asian crisis squarely on authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every country in Asia, including Korea,'' he has said,
``the major reason for (economic) failure was lack of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a comparison between South Korea and Singapore does not
confirm Kim's sweeping belief in lack of democracy as the major
reason for the economic setback in every country in Asia. For
example, in 1997-98 the value of South Korean stocks was set back
more in dollar terms than Singaporean equities, despite the greater
lack of political freedom in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In his own allocation of blame for the Asian crisis, Singapore's
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has suggested that what distinguishes
the unscathed from the damaged is not political democracy but good
governance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Singaporeans, Lee said, are not champions of human rights or
democracy, ``but we are very fastidious in the way in which we run
our business, and on financial matters we are completely
aboveboard.'' Lee also in effect acknowledged that not all ``Asian
values'' are constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the weaknesses of Confucianism,'' he noted, is
nepotism. The economies least able to resist the crisis are those
where nepotism _ ``the bane of East Asian countries,'' in his words
_ is most entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   But the views of Kim and Lee are more compatible than they first
appear. Electoral democracy can undermine good governance in the
absence of the rule of law. And good governance in a liberal
democracy requires public servants who are insulated from the
blandishments of special interests and the passions and whims of
momentary majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of East Asia are in a race to leave 1997 behind.
The leaders _ Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong _ are politically much
freer than Indonesia, the laggard. And in 1998 East Asia is
changing _ one hopes for the better _ but it is not Americanizing.
It is important for Americans to think realistically, not
wishfully, about the region.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly we may conclude that it is far too early to reinvent
the debunked East Asian miracle as any new parable about ``Asia
rising'' toward liberal democracy.

ADULT DIAPERS NOT ONLY OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, Kathy Duffy, a 38-year-old school teacher, tried
many treatments for her severe incontinence _ pills, injections,
exercises, even ``retraining'' her bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Everything helped some. Even so, she was always ducking out on
her second graders to rush to the bathroom. She didn't sleep much,
either. The urge to urinate woke her every hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Duffy and two other women became the first
patients in New England to have a new electrical device called
InterStim implanted near their spines to calm bladder spasms.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, Duffy says, she's sleeping five
hours at a stretch, thanks to the device, which seems to slow the
excessive firing of nerves to the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Urinary incontinence strikes 15 million Americans, most of them
women and most, like Duffy, well under 65. Unlike Duffy, of
Reading, Mass., many of those whose bladders betray them suffer in
shameful silence, avoiding other people lest they have an
``accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, researchers and venture capitalists are not so shy. In
fact, convinced of the demand for something better than adult
diapers, they're racing to develop pills, plugs, and other devices
to keep bladders from their dismal dripping.
</P>
<P>
   Incontinence comes in two main forms _ urge problems like
Duffy's, in which bladder muscles go into spasm, making it
impossible to stop urine flow once it starts; and stress problems,
in which weak sphincter or pelvic muscles fail to keep the bladder
neck closed during sudden physical stresses like coughing,
sneezing, laughing, or exercising.
</P>
<P>
   It can also occur when an obstruction _ usually an enlarged
prostate in men _ blocks urine flow, leading to overflow or urge
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every kind of incontinence, there's a pill, or behavioral
intervention, a device or an operation,'' says Dr. Neil Resnick, an
incontinence specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
``Cure is usually possible, and usually without surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to diagnose what kind of incontinence you have _
you can have more than one _ and be savvy about your options.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, for instance, incontinent women were often told to
have a hysterectomy. But you don't need that, says Dr. Deborah
Lightner, a Mayo Clinic urologist, unless your uterus has prolapsed
and is pressing on the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for most people the best bet is to start with the
simplest, least invasive options.
</P>
<P>
   For stress incontinence, this means Kegel exercises, in which
you strengthen pelvic floor muscles, which can be damaged by giving
birth. To identify these muscles, try stopping urine flow in
midstream. If you can, you've got the right muscles. Once you've
found them, make that same exertion 100 times a day, but not during
voiding lest you retain urine.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't pinpoint those muscles on your own, go to a
continence center (many hospitals have them) and ask for
biofeedback training, a system of electrical sensors on patches on
the skin or in the vagina or rectum that send an unmistakeable
signal when you contract the right muscles.
</P>
<P>
   If your problem is urge incontinence, bladder retraining can
help. You try to stick to a pre-set bathroom schedule, urinating
regularly before the bladder gets too full, and learning to
suppress temporarily the urge to urinate.
</P>
<P>
   If these simple behavioral tricks don't help, there's a slew of
devices to control leaky bladders, most of them available by
prescription. Some women, for instance, use vaginal cones,
tampon-like devices held in the vagina for 15 minutes twice a day
to strengthen pelvic muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Others use pessaries, like Introl, that are inserted into the
vagina to support the bladder neck, though these have to be
carefully fitted and changed regularly. Other women prefer a
product like Capsure that plugs the opening of the urethra; it
stays in place by suction and is pulled out by a nipple during
urination. New devices like Inflow, which is not yet approved, may
be left in the urethra for as long as a month.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, women may also have another option _ a foam patch called
Impress that's designed to stick to the urethral opening like a
tiny BandAid. Impress has been approved but has not yet been
marketed for over-the-counter use.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these options works, you can try collagen injections
_ done via a needle passed through the urethra. The collagen
squeezes the side of the urethra together, slowing urine flow.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer convenience, many women opt for medications rather
than devices. Estrogen, for instance, can make the urethra more
pliable and easier to seal and it can be taken in a variety of ways
_ pills, patches, vaginal cream or a vaginal ring that releases the
hormone slowly.
</P>
<P>
   For urge incontinence specifically, other drugs also help _
including old standbys like Ditropan and newer ones like Levbid and
Detrol, says Dr. David Staskin, director of the continence center
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   These drugs all block acetylcholine, a chemical secreted by
nerves that tells muscles to contract. The newer verions of this
medication cause fewer side effects such as dry mouth and
constipation.
</P>
<P>
   Tofranil, an anti-depressant that has the useful side effect of
relaxing bladder spasms and tightening the sphincter, can also
help, says Dr. Stanley Swierzewski, III, co-director of the Lahey
Clinic continence center.
</P>
<P>
   For men with incontinence caused by an enlarged prostate, drugs
like Minipress, Hytrin, Cardura or Flomax that relax the urethra
can be very helpful. So does shrinking the prostate itself _ with a
drug called Proscar, microwave therapy, or surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is also an option for some women, and for those with
stress incontinence two options work well. In the ``suspension''
procedure _ done through a vaginal or abdominal incision _ surgeons
stitch a drooping bladder to ligaments in the pelvis. In the other,
a ``sling'' is made for the bladder with fascia tissue from the
patient or a cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, surgery has not been a useful option for women with
urge incontinence. But surgery to implant the InterStim
``pacemaker'' like Duffy should become a growing option.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind InterStim is that urge incontinence is
triggered by overactive nerves called C-fibers that run from the
spinal cord to the bladder. The C-fibers are believed to govern
urination in babies, whose bladders empty uncontrollably. These
fibers are thought to be quiescent in adults, though they can be
reactivated, sometimes after back surgery or pelvic trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Applying an electric current to the bladder nerves seems to shut
down the C-fibers but not normal fibers, says Swierzewski, who
implanted the device in Duffy and two other patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are cautious. InterStim has been tried in
fewer than 200 patients at about half a dozen centers, says
Resnick. ``The results are promising, but the number of people
who've had the device implanted is still small.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duffy needs no convincing: ``I'm very pleased.''

HIGH-PROTEIN, NO-SUGAR DIET IS TRENDY, BUT WON'T KEEP THE WEIGHT
OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by DIET-CHART) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people of New Orleans love to eat. And now the people of New
Orleans love to diet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Busters diet is all the rage in the city of etouffee
and remoulade, where a survey recently concluded that a third of
the people are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Now in bookstores nationwide, the Sugar Busters diet _ high on
protein, low on carbohydrates _ was designed by a vascular surgeon,
two gastroenterologists and an oilman in New Orleans. They say
their self-published book sold more than 200,000 copies its first
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best restaurants in New Orleans, including
Commander's Palace, now serve Sugar Busters specials _ such as a
large pork chop on a small mountain of sweet potatoes pureed with
spicy sausage and nestled on a lake of spinach, sauteed with bacon.
</P>
<P>
   What's not on the Sugar Busters menu are sweets, including the
sugars in such dietary superstars as carrots, rice and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Busters is only the latest in a line of trendy
high-protein/low-carb diets, with names like Protein Power and The
Zone. All are simply variations on the Atkins diet, launched in the
early '70s by Dr. Robert Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Such diets are high in fat and, over the long
haul, hard on the kidneys and liver, according to dietitians. They
may result in short-term weight loss, but they'll always leave you
feeling hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association analyzed recipes in the
``Sugar Busters!'' book and found that the calories from fat ranged
from 41 percent to 85 percent. (The healthy recommended level is 30
percent or less.) Total calories ranged up to 1,172 for a single
serving of Emeril's pan roasted filet mignon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atkins diet was launched in 1972 with the publication of
``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution.'' Atkins is still specializing in
diet and nutrition as medical director of The Atkins Center for
Complimentary Medicine in New York City. He has written a revised
edition of his original book, which sold 10 million copies, and
last month published ``The Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answer
to Drugs'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24).
</P>
<P>
   The promise of low-carbohydrate diets zeros in on the fact that
the body first uses carbohydrates (sugars and starches) for its
basic energy needs, because they are quickly and easily turned into
the glucose needed to sustain life.
</P>
<P>
   If the body doesn't immediately need the glucose, it is stored
as fat until blood-sugar levels get low and it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is, if the body doesn't have carbohydrates
immediately available, it will turn to the stored fat as its source
of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atkins diet has been revived,'' said Barbara Gollman, a
Dallas dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. ``It works, at least short term, but the reason it
works is because it is calorie-controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Gollman says, is that you can't stay healthy on
this diet for the long haul because it has too much protein and not
enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much protein for your body to handle. Ultimately the
kidneys will be stressed by all that protein,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate weight loss on a high-protein diet is water loss,
said Dr. Margo Denke of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas. When
protein is broken down, it releases nitrogen, which must be washed
out of the body quickly. Water from tissue cells comes to the
rescue, reducing overall water weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence accumulated in the 1970s documents the fact that if
you restrict carbohydrates and increase protein, you promote the
loss of body water and salt,'' Denke said. ``Remember, the biggest
component of our bodies is water, so if you lose extra salt and
water, you lose weight. You don't lose fat, but you do lose
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   She warns that high-protein/low-carbohydrate diets can give a
false sense of security the first week or 10 days, when you are
likely to lose 5 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most diet tricks, it works for a while,'' Denke said.
``It bespeaks how desperate we are. To restrict carrots because
they contain some sugar is just craziness.''
</P>
<P>
   In people with diabetes or kidney damage, such diets can cause
renal failure, she added.
</P>
<P>
   And high-protein diets are almost invariably high in fat. Most
major sources of protein _ such as steak, bacon, cheese and eggs _
are also high in fat and cholesterol, which can lead to heart
disease, stroke and some forms of cancer, according to Elisabeth
Anderson, outpatient nutrition counselor at Harris Methodist Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are diets that have been around on and off for a long
time,'' Anderson said. ``They are low in calories, very restrictive
and monotonous, for the most part. And they are low in calcium and
vitamins so they can't be good for long.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also low in volume, so you don't feel full for long.

<P>
   It is 30 years now, and yet with each passing year, 1968 _ the
annus horribilis of the American Century _ seems ever more
horrible, its strife ever more unsettling, its losses ever more
unbearable, its meaning ever more portentous.
</P>
<P>
   And though we now sit smugly at the hinge of a new century, the
stock market at giddy heights, the Cold War transformed from menace
to memory, we are haunted, still, by 1968. The tell-tale heart of
that year may have been buried beneath the floorboards 30 years
ago, but if we listen carefully to the rhythms of life in America
we can still hear it beating.
</P>
<P>
   This is its sound: The Tet offensive. The student and antiwar
rebellions. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. cut down in Memphis.
Violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The
election of Richard Milhous Nixon. And the coda: the Apollo
astronauts, in a lunar orbit, reading from Genesis at
Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   All that plus the death of Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy, brother of
a tragic president, senator from New York, candidate for the
presidential nomination, gentle soul with a reputation for
ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary of his assassination is Saturday, and with
it, along with a flood of memories, come two volumes, one a
meditation on the meaning of Robert Kennedy, the other an
affectionate remembrance from the daughter of one of his
confidants. And through the pages of Michael Knox Beran's ``The
Last Patrician'' and Helen O'Donnell's ``A Common Good,'' we can
begin to rethink the legacy of a man who was an attorney general by
dint of his blood, a senator by dint of his sweat, and a martyr by
dint of his countrymen's tears.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's volume covers the high points of the Kennedy era,
and through the pages of her book stride such Kennedy insiders as
Dave Powers, Steve Smith, Peter Edelman, Richard Goodwin, and, of
course, Kenneth O'Donnell, the author's father. While Helen
O'Donnell brings us inside Bobby Kennedy's circle, Beran brings us
inside Bobby Kennedy's head.
</P>
<P>
   Both books are reminders _ of how passionate the political
figures were, how divisive the issues, how (and this we have
forgotten) helpless and hopeless America seemed, and in some sense
was, that year. O'Donnell, who has carried on her father's legacy
of political activism and whose research was actively aided by the
Kennedy family, reminds us of how the personal and the political
intertwined for the generation she recalls. And Beran, a lawyer
with the lilt of a poet, sees Kennedy himself as a reminder, not
only for liberals but also for conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds liberals of the importance of remaining true to the
19th-century liberalism of Emerson and Lincoln; he teaches them
that reforms should help to create self-reliance and self-respect
in individuals, not undermine those qualities,'' Beran writes in
the very last paragraph of his book, adding: ``He reminds
conservatives that any genuine conservatism must be allied to
compassion, and that, in their devotion to the principles of a free
market, conservatives should not forget their obligations to the
less fortunate among us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the purpose of Beran's book-length essay is not to argue
that Kennedy was a latter-day Thomas More, a man for all seasons,
but to argue that, in his heart and in his head, RFK struggled with
the signposts of American politics and sought to find his own way.
If we have a sense of loss this week, it is not only because we
lost Bobby Kennedy, but also because we know that after his death
we lost our way, or at least the way he tried to point.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Beran's thesis is the notion that the United
States was governed through much of the century by an American
establishment that suffered its own identity crisis. The family
patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy, wanted his sons to join an
establishment not of Henry Adams and Henry James (a little on the
effete side) but of Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt _
muscular, masculine, what Beran calls ``an aristocracy of action
and power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Kennedy was a rebel, or would become one. He thought
more deeply than either of the Roosevelts _ or any of the other
Kennedys, for that matter. The others, in the contemporary argot of
sports, played through the pain; Bobby lingered on the meaning of
pain. They excelled within the strictures and confines of politics
but were content to live within them. RFK was not.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man of action _ he climbed mountains, forded streams,
rollicked in the surf with the kids and the dogs _ but by the end
of 1963 he was principally a man of thought. And he rethought
American politics and its meaning and its purpose, finally taking
on the welfare and national-security consensus that governed his
party, his class, and his nation. More than TR and FDR and JFK _
each of whom reveled in being a rebel _ he was the true rebel of
the patrician class.
</P>
<P>
   Here was his greatest act of rebellion: At the height of the
Great Society he broke with the welfare state. He saw and
understood poverty more clearly than did any other American leader,
even (and especially) Lyndon B. Johnson, who had seen it up close
as a boy and as a young teacher. And though RFK was a child of
privilege reared on elite private schools and summers at Hyannis,
he came to believe that the entire anti-poverty effort of the 1960s
was futile. He was famous for opposing LBJ's prosecution of the
Vietnam War, but it was his opposition to the way the War on
Poverty was being prosecuted that was truly revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   With Emerson, Lincoln, and the democrats of ancient Greece as
his guideposts, Kennedy was more interested in community strength
than in national greatness. Perhaps he saw them as the same thing.
And in his effort to build community, especially among the poor,
RFK sought to fight poverty with capitalism, not with socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby did not believe that civic spirit was incompatible with
private enterprise,'' Beran writes. ``On the contrary, he hoped
that a strong community would attract private investment, and that
this investment would in turn lead to the creation of jobs that
gave purpose and meaning to the lives of the community's
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a commonplace idea for conservatives in 1998. It was a
radical departure for liberals in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Beran has written an engimatic little book about an enigmatic
American giant. It is a meditation that meanders, looking into the
forgotten crannies and corners of American political and cultural
life, and it succeeds in having us do what Bobby Kennedy himself
did: look again at what we think we know. The result is a luminous
look at Kennedy and at the country he wanted to lead (and to save).
And now, as we approach the 30th anniversary of his assassination
in a Los Angeles hotel, it makes us wonder if the one brief shining
moment that we hold so preciously in memory and mythology might
have occurred not after the election of 1960 but just before the
election of 1968.

UNDATED: full for long. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because weight loss ultimately relies on using more calories
than you consume, and because protein sources are high in calories,
weight loss requires consuming smaller amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Carbohydrates have long been the mainstay of most weight-loss
diets for exactly the opposite reason: They are relatively low in
calories and high in bulk. Calorie for calorie, you can eat more of
them and feel more full.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sugar Busters diet does not allow potatoes or anything
made from white rice or white flour, including bread, bagels and
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   An added risk, ironically, is that the high-protein/low
carbohydrate diet will work too well.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting carbohydrates can cause the body to start breaking
down some of the fat stored in cells, but that breakdown can result
in ketosis, a nutritional disease that causes bad breath as well as
diarrhea, headaches, weakness, low blood pressure, fatigue and
sleeplessness, according to Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most serious side effect is that, if kept up over a long
time, these diets can cause kidney and liver damage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you might be busting more than sugar.

THE LITERARY LIFE AT WILLIAM SHAWN'S NEW YORKER
</HEADLINE>

HERE BUT NOT HERE 
A Love Story 
By Lillian Ross

REMEMBERING MR. SHAWN'S NEW YORKER 
The Invisible Art of Editing 
By Ved Mehta 
Overlook Press, 414 pp., illustrated, $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lillian Ross calls her memoir a love story. It is also that rare
thing, a happy book. For almost 50 years, she has had the job she
wanted: reporting for the New Yorker. For 40 years, she lived in
Manhattan with the man she loved, and who loved her: William Shawn,
the magazine's legendary editor. Shawn called her his wife, since
neither liked the word ``mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a commuting marriage, Alec Guinness's ``Captain's
Paradise'' but by cab. Cecille, Shawn's legal wife, lived uptown
with the couple's three children, and Ross half a mile away. This
arrangement bothered Ross not a whit: no guilt trip for her, if the
wife knew about the arrangement and didn't want a divorce. ``All
enduring love between two people,'' she begins her memoir, ``feels
intrinsically normal to the couple immersed in it.'' Snatching time
together, Ross would taxi uptown with Shawn on the evenings he went
home for dinner with Cecille. He would taxi back to Ross in time
for the late evening news on TV. He sometimes went back uptown. He
had his own private phone in the uptown bedroom. Ross rang it one
morning in 1992: Shawn was 85 and his heart aging. ``For the only
time in our long life together, his wife answered the telephone,''
Ross reports. ``He's gone,'' Cecille told her. Arriving uptown,
Ross was admitted by Shawn's actor son, Wallace. He ``looked behind
him,'' Ross reports, ``to his mother, for permission.'' On impulse,
Ross reports, she embraced Cecille. ``He died in my arms,'' said
Cecille.
</P>
<P>
   This scene does not appear in Ved Mehta's memoir about Shawn's
New Yorker, though there's plenty about Cecille and the children;
nor does Ross figure, except once. With no more introduction than
that she's a New Yorker writer, she appeals to Mehta, a blind
Hindu, for help in adopting a Burmese or Ajunta baby. ``I saw a
picture of a small, Buddha-like man with a soft, gentle face and
delicate features, a little like Mr. Shawn,'' Ross tells Mehta.
``That's exactly the kind of baby I want. I thought because you're
from that part of the world you could help me.'' In any event, Ross
adopted baby Erik from Norway because she loved the Paul Muni movie
about the Norwegian Resistance during World War II. Mehta reports
about Ross what she can't report about herself: her voice on the
phone. ``A female voice, light and innocent, yet also hard-edged
and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Shawn and Ross's ``marriage'' was by phone. Ross would
be in Hollywood, or in Russia, or hanging out with Hemingway. To
Shawn calling from New York, she would relate the day's happenings,
and this gabfest was a kind of phone sex and editorial conference.
After months watching director John Huston film ``The Red Badge of
Courage,'' she told Shawn she could only tell what she saw as a
novel. Tell it that way then, said Shawn. The articles that became
``Picture'' represented the New Yorker's first nonfiction novel,
not Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood.'' Wondering how to tell his
bloody story, Capote hounded Ross, wanting to talk about
``reportage.'' Ross told him she did ``reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   And reporting is what she does in ``Here But Not Here.'' The New
Yorker profiles of Shawn's era have often been criticized for
taking the subject at the subject's own worth. &UR;  &LR; Ross herself was
criticized for not injecting her opinions into her stories. Somehow
this all comes together to make an endearing but chilling portrait.
She can't stop reporting on her last great subject. Still, there
are times when she does her beloved Bill no favors.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Shawn found they had their fathers in common:
socialists and secular Jews from Middle Europe who
hated &UR;  &LR; hoity-toity intellectuals. One of Shawn's brother's changed
the family name of Chon because it was ``misleadingly Chinese.'' As
``Jackknife Ben,'' Shawn's father parlayed his cutlery shop in the
Chicago stockyards into a jewelry store. When the young married
Shawns moved to Manhattan, it was Cecille who earned a few dollars
by feeding tidbits to the New Yorker for others to polish for the
Talk of the Town section. As the world knows, Shawn succeeded
Harold Ross, the founding editor, in 1952. In 1945, Shawn had hired
Lillian Ross. She thinks it was because she made him laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine junkies should read Mehta for insights into the New
Yorker's many-layered editorial process. Shawn's own hand in this
was ``talmudic,'' Mehta says; not a word or comma was too trivial
to be queried. All he wanted, said Shawn, was to make the words say
what the writer wanted. So he was a chameleon, one day swinging
with a Salinger short story, the next day mired in Hannah Arendt's
German syntax. No wonder Shawn claimed not to know who he was.
``Here but not here'' was one of the many ways he described an iffy
identity. Alec Guinness, another unknowable man, could field two
families with panache but the New Yorker scribes, Shawn's third
family, bled him dry.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn, anonymous in his blue suits, had his innings as Walter
Mitty. He loved French food, preferably at La Caravelle; lunching
Mehta at the Algonquin, he ate only toasted pound cake. When Shawn
said he'd like to taste a bit of the glamour in the New Yorker's
ads, Ross bought him yellow silk pajamas at Sulka's. Then they
drove in his sporty green TR-3 to the Catskills for a weekend out
of a Fred Astaire movie. There was scarcely an actor they didn't
admire. A self-taught pianist, C major his only key, Shawn found
enchantment in jazz and show tunes. When Duke Ellington died, Shawn
and Ross took Erik to see the great man laid out in white tie and
tails. All that evening at home, Ross says they played Ellington
recordings ``very loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn's last years at the New Yorker were unhappy, culminating
in his firing by the new owner in 1987. The next editor, Arthur
Gottlieb, was lifted in the fifth for British speedballer Tina
Brown. It's not the same magazine. Shawn led most issues with two
or three short stories. Brown runs one shortie, in the back, and
her periodic ``fiction issues'' are larded with celebrity chat and
photos in the fashion-shoot style. Shawn's magazine was more
worldly, the topics larger, the reporting more global: nuclear
weapons, ecology, war, religion. Brown's magazine tracks
demographics, is fixated on celebrity and money. Ross, to the
horror of the old crowd, has gone to work for Brown.

<TEXT>
<P>
   An estimated 65 million Americans are on diets right now, many
of them on one of those trendy high-protein, low-carbohydrate
diets. The Sugar Busters diet is the newest, but these diets can
all trace their roots to the Atkins diet of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   We know you're probably not listening, but we have to say this
anyway: The American Dietetic Association would remind you of the
bottom line: In order to lose weight on a regular basis, you must
use more calories than you consume. In other words: Eat less.
Exercise more.

<P>
   The promise: If you cut sugar, you can trim body fat and lose
weight, no matter what else you eat.
</P>
<P>
   No-nos: Potatoes, corn, white rice, bread from refined flour,
beets, carrots and other ``hidden'' sources of sugar, and of

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''  &LR; _
The key to the success of John Berendt's best-selling book on which
this movie is based is its marvelous evocation of Savannah, Ga. The
city is as mysterious as Garbo _ elusive, sexy, dangerous. The
problem with the film is that Clint Eastwood shoots the city as a
tourist might, producing beautiful snapshots but not much else. One
of the problems is John Cusack's performance as the
reporter-narrator. He gets in the way of the story of murder,
mayhem, and female impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Oscar and Lucinda''  &LR; _ Gillian Armstrong directs this
magnificent story of passion, gambling, and organized religion.
Ralph Fiennes, as the gambling-obsessed cleric, brings a manic
intensity, leavened by humor, to the role. A smart picture for
smart people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Home Alone 3''  &LR; _ Three strikes and you're out at home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Student Affair'' &LR;  _ This embarassing hodgepodge of dreamy
sex and marital breakup stars Ed Begley Jr. and Sally Kellerman as
a marriage-on-the-rocks couple whose lives are changed when a
gorgeous babe enters the picture. Gee, I wonder where they came up
with that idea? Kellerman and Begley probably needed one more film
to be vested in the Screen Actors Guild pension. That would be the
only excuse for appearing in this awful movie.

RISING TIDE GOES OUT, LEAVING McCLINTON HIGH AND DRY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delbert McClinton says it plainly, and several times in the
course of a brief phone interview from Nashville: His heart is
broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was riding a wave of exultation I had never known,'' he
said. ``It was looking like I had a record that was going to break
through, and in a heartbeat it was all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is Rising Tide, the offshoot of Universal Records that,
last fall, released McClinton's exceptional ``One of the Fortunate
Few'' CD, easily one of the best in the 57-year-old's storied
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the Fortunate Few'' features cameos from B.B. King,
Lyle Lovett, John Prine, Vince Gill, Mavis Staples, Patty Loveless
and Lee Roy Parnell, among others, and some of McClinton's finest
singing. Released last fall, it picked up strong reviews and
healthy sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a little over two months ago, Rising Tide was no more.
Universal pulled the plug on the label, which means no more
promotion and precious little distribution. Literally overnight,
``One of the Fortunate Few'' went from a hot blues/rock/country CD
to a lame duck. And with it went McClinton's chances of
capitalizing, at least for the time being, on his past successes,
which include a 1992 Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Duo (with Bonnie
Raitt, for ``Good Man, Good Woman'').
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife called me and said, `You better sit down,' '' he said
of the day he got the news. ``I thought somebody had died. She told
me the company had folded, and I was speechless. We had had a
marketing meeting three days before. People are telling me it's not
in the stores _ and all the marketing ceased to exist, you know?
It's a very sad thing. I'm as proud of this record as anything I've
ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   As he should be. McClinton has been one of America's best
roadhouse rockers for more than a quarter-century, but since 1973's
``Victim of Life's Circumstances'' (on which he wrote every tune)
he has let the songwriting go, preferring to fill CDs with cover
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, he says, this was because for years his life was a big
mess: There was a lot of hard traveling, a lot of work and little
money. Also, he notes, four different labels (Clean, ABC, Capricorn
and the Muscle Shoals Sound arm of Capitol) went out of business,
while he was on them.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s he was disenchanted and ``abusing myself pretty
good _ my career was in disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1985, he met his would-be wife, Wendy, (the two wed in
1996) and she helped him turn his life around. The juices started
flowing again, and he made a strong showing on 1992's ``Never Been
Rocked Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to write positive songs,'' he said. ``I don't want to
write from the heartbreak I've felt. I've been through it and I
know how to do it, but I prefer irreverent, funky songs. I write to
please me and that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, ``One of the Fortunate Few'' is a standout effort:
McClinton co-wrote seven of the CD's 10 songs with
producer/guitarist Gary Nicholson and others, including Donnie
Fritts. And these songs _ ``Somebody to Love You,'' ``Monkey
Around,'' ``You Were Never Mine,'' ``Lie No Better'' _ are the CD's
best cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just been writing for years and I had a stack of 'em _ we
were ready,'' he said. ``We could say, `Which ones do we leave
out?' Which is a nice place to be. We didn't have to hunt for
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   McClinton is also proud of how many people volunteered to be on
the CD. Almost every song features a guest artist, and among the
best are Parnell (whose great slide work is on two songs) and King,
who solos on ``Leap of Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on tour with him two years ago, and I gave him a tape of
the song,'' McClinton said. ``He loved it, and when the tour came
to Nashville he put his part on it. There's nothing more important
in the world than having friends, and I have a lot of 'em. The fact
that everyone made time for this is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   So now what?
</P>
<P>
   McClinton doesn't know. He's still signed to Universal, and says
guardedly that ``we're trying to negotiate a position I can deal
with.'' But for now, ``One of the Fortunate Few'' is one great CD
that isn't getting nearly the attention it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Delbert McClinton has been down this road before _ and he's not
giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt snakebit for a long time,'' he said. ``But I know
better _ I'm not my own worst enemy anymore. A lot of it is just
being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The title of my first
album was ``Victim of Life's Circumstances'' and it rings true. But
I'll get through it _ I'm not going away.''

STEPHEN FRY'S WALK ON THE WILDE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spend time with Stephen Fry, and one can almost envision what it
might have been like in the company of Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is his face: the expressive, sad eyes, the fleshy
features uninterrupted by sharp angles, the full, pronounced jaw
suggesting gentle imprudence. Even in a green-and-beige jersey with
his dark hair trimmed back from Wildean lengths, Fry so resembles
Wilde, he could pass for a descendant of the great Irish-born
playwright, novelist, and bon vivant.
</P>
<P>
   Still more importantly, there is Fry's wit, a great unbridled
thing legendary in his native England, at turns erudite,
scatological, provocative, and violently funny. An accomplished
author, like Wilde he is the quintessential dinner guest turning
even casual conversation into a brilliant feast to be savored _
rare, filling, and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with Stephen Fry, and it's impossible to imagine
anyone else playing Oscar Wilde, which Fry does magnificently in
``Wilde,'' a new film biography opening Friday. In many ways, Fry
seems born to play Wilde, author of such works as ``The Picture of
Dorian Grey'' and ``The Importance of Being Earnest.'' Often hailed
as the first true celebrity, a man who relished fame and public
adoration, Wilde died in disgrace and poverty after he was
convicted of ``gross indecency'' for his then-scandalous affair
with a young nobleman, Lord Alfred Douglas. He died in 1900 at age
46, a few years after completing a two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   For most his 40 years, Fry, perhaps best known to American
audiences as the manservent Jeeves of PBS's ``Jeeves and Wooster,''
has been told of his resemblance to Wilde. In his hilarious
introduction to a bound edition of the film's screenplay by Julian
Mitchell, Fry writes he ``was told it with gathering frequency as
my girth thickened and the flesh on my face began to record every
plate of pasta and every glass of vodka and tonic that had been
pushed through it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his unconventioal looks, Fry knows he will never garner the
sorts of roles offered Tom Cruise or Leonardo DiCaprio _ ``If you
are British,'' he writes, ``voiced like an old wireless set,
approaching 40 at dangerous speed, well over six feet in height,
amply padded to the point of minor obesity and endowed with a
complexion not unlike that of freshly applied window putty, there
are few leading roles for which you are suited.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has always wanted to play Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a physical similarity which, of course, is not in and
of itself sufficient to play someone. But it puts it in your head
when people say it enough,'' said Fry recently, between frequent
cigarettes in his Boston hotel room. ``It became something I wanted
to do for some time, and this struck me as being the one. This
struck me as having all the elements that made making a new film a
good idea. There didn't seem much point in just showing the same
old Wilde, a rather fallacious Wilde, the posturing, brittle, camp
arch figure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Love of Wilde
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fry discovered the author as a child, recalling his eventual
reverence for him like ``a slow falling in love rather than an
explosive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with him in stages. I fell in love with his
writing first when I read `The Importance of Being Earnest' when I
was quite small. Then as a teenager I fell in love with his image
in quite the shallow way that teenagers do,'' said Fry, who like
Wilde, is gay. ``I loved the paraphernalia that went with him, the
cigarette holders, the loveliness, the artifice. Then reading his
biographies I fell in love with him because he was wise and kind
and good natured and flawed and human.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Brian Gilbert, and also starring Jude Law,
Jennifer Ehle, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael Sheen, and Tom Wilkinson,
arrives in the midst of a significant Wilde revival in popular
culture. These days everyone, it seems, has something to say about
the playwright. Two recent plays in New York, Moises Kaufman's
``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' and David
Hare's ``The Judas Kiss,'' starring Liam Neeson, dealt with Wilde's
downfall. Several film adaptations of Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,''
his play about a politician embroiled in scandal, are chugging
their way through the Hollywood pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilde, who was a married father of two when he began his
affair with Lord Douglas, nicknamed ``Bosie,'' has long been upheld
as a gay icon and martyr persecuted and disgraced by a small-minded
society, which may have sought to silence a man at odds with the
strictures of Victorian England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrible tragedy of it, and the irony is that 100 years
on, he's changed from being one of the most loathed and
comtemptible of human beings, to someone who in some ways is a
beacon to a lot of people,'' said Gilbert, who also directed the
film ``Tom and Viv.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, uniquely among 19th-century figures, those titanic
figures of that period, I think he's really alive in the culture,''
he said. ``That's high and low _ he's a pervasive influence. He is
claimed by writers, artists, rock stars, and film people.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of creating a Wilde biography is making him more
than a paperbook of quotations and witticisms, Gilbert said. Even
Dorothy Parker, amply and able in any battle of wits, once said:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, with the literate, I am
</P>
<P>
   Impelled to try an epigram
</P>
<P>
   I never seem to take the credit
</P>
<P>
   We all assume that Oscar said it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, since there is no video of Wilde, Fry was not bound by
tried-and-true representations of Wilde's speech patterns or
gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I didn't have the problems say Tony Hopkins had when
he was playing Nixon,'' said referring to the Oliver Stone film
biography. ``Every single person who saw that film knew what Nixon
looked like and knew these gestures with the fingers up, the
slightly sloopy shoulders, the bandy legs. (Hopkins) had to do all
those things just before he could begin to play him as he wanted to
play. With Wilde, all you need really is your hair parted in the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's screenplay is based on the Richard Ellmann biography,
and while there have been other films about Wilde, Gilbert feels
his is the first to deal in detail _ some would say, explicitly _
with the all-consuming doomed love affair which wound up costing
Wilde everything from his reputation to his children whom he never
saw again after his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had much more freedom and the opportunity to be candid
about what caused the catastrophe,'' Gilbert said. ``At the same
time we don't need to apologize for him anymore. And let's not
trivialize his life and interpret it as it has always been
interpreted, under the shadow of the scandal. That's a homophobic
reading of Wilde as the vain, posturing, self-destructive
yearning-for-martyrdom gay criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Film has its critics
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film, which has received positive notices in New York
and Los Angeles, has not been embraced by everyone. Some have
complained about a scene with Wilde watching Bosie have sex with a
``rent boy,'' a lovely young man whose carnal talents are for hire.
Especially critical is Merlin Holland, a writer and Wilde's only
grandchild. When the film opened in London earlier this year,
Holland charged it would leave ``those people unfamiliar with Wilde
with an impression of him as a man who jumped in and out of bed
with young men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In history I don't think there's ever been a film which has
been liked by the family, and it'll never happen,'' Fry said. ``But
I can understand his feelings. Yet, I think it would be dishonest
to the film, the subject matter, and what the audience should go
through to discreetly cut away to the mantelpiece when two people
are making love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are Victorian, we still are very hung up about what
people do with their bodies, however modern we think they are,'' he
added. ``We may think we're very cool about it, but we still have a
salacious, prurient feeling about it. In a way we're worse because
we're even more hypocritical. The Victorians had the honesty to be
straight shocked and disgusted, whereas we pretend not be shocked
and disgusted, although we're quite troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry, who lives in London, recently completed his role in the
film adaptation of Jonathan Harr's ``A Civil Action,'' parts of
which were shot in the Boston area. He is also writing a script
based on John Kennedy Toole's ``A Confederacy of Dunces.'' While he
has at last fulfilled his long-held desire to play Wilde, he
emerged from this film an even greater admirer of the man who,
almost a century since his disgrace and death, is again beguiling
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great conversationalist, and his wit was wonderful
and natural and unforced, even though when you read it, it's
beautifully shaped and the words are quite exotic,'' Fry said.
``There are some really intelligent people who make you feel this
high, and Wilde was of another breed which made you feel 10 feet
tall. He almost showed people how to be witty.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Saltzman sees her part-time job as a mission. By working
with medical students, she hopes to make one of the most
uncomfortable aspects of medicine a gentler, less intimidating
process _ for both patient and doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A New York social worker turned actress, Ms. Saltzman, 36, and
her colleagues around the country are playing an increasingly
important role in medical education. Called genital teaching
associates, or GTAs, they use their bodies as models to teach
breast, pelvic and genital-urinary examination techniques to
medical students, residents and even doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a social worker, I became very concerned about how
women were treated,'' Ms. Saltzman said. When she learned about the
associates through a colleague who was in the field, she became
curious. ``I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do it. But now,
I feel like I'm helping women all over the world. It's very
empowering.'' Some days, she said, ``I come home feeling like I've
done such a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being introduced in the 1970s, teaching associate programs
have expanded to nearly half the nation's medical schools, if not
more, said Gayle Gliva-McConvey, a pioneer in the programs and the
director of the professional skills center at Eastern Virginia
Medical School in Norfolk. Such programs are reaching more and more
students, in effect changing the way the intimate examinations are
conducted, one fledgling doctor at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the era of managed care, the associate's role has become
even more important, as health care companies closely guard their
doctors' hours, said Ms. Gliva-McConvey. But the greater service is
provided by helping to train more nurses, doctors and other
practitioners to handle one of the most stressful parts of patient
examinations _ and in fact to conduct genital examinations at all.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women are involved in associate programs, but the
emphasis has always been on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty clear we were doing a pretty terrible job
teaching medical students how to do pelvic exams,'' said Dr. Robert
Kretzschmar, now in private practice in Iowa City, Iowa. Teaching
was done at clinics on indigent patients who had no choice by
``terrified medical students looking at female genitalia on a live
person for the first time,'' Kretzschmar recalled from the early
1960s when he was an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Kretzschmar sowed the seeds of the nation's
``standardized patient'' programs, using average people to pose as
patients for medical students. He started teaching medical
interviewing techniques to his students using the wives of fellow
staff physicians at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, he had made the leap to the genital teaching
associates, employing an aide from the urology department who had
agreed to be a model for pelvic exams. She requested to be draped
so she could remain anonymous. ``The person was being paid, and not
exploited,'' he said, unlike the disadvantaged women at the clinic.
``It was a great improvement,'' he added. But it still was not what
he wanted: ``I wanted to get rid of the drape. I wanted the patient
to interact with the students.''
</P>
<P>
   At professional meetings throughout the 1970s, he explained his
program and the idea took off, he said. One medical school hired
prostitutes for its program. Others placed ads in local newspapers.
Kretzschmar, though, set about finding bright women who were good
teachers and who wanted to contribute to medical education. He
offered $25 an hour. ``These people could do a better job of
teaching than I, because they were using their own anatomy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The genital teaching associate programs evolved with the
standardized patient programs, which now exist in 83 of the
nation's 126 medical schools, according to Ms. Gliva-McConvey, up
from 69 programs in 1991-92. Exact figures are not available on the
number of genital teaching associate programs, but anecdotal
reports indicate a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little
Rock, for example, both programs have grown significantly, said
Mary Cantrell, who was an actress and a standardized patient before
become director of the school's clinical skills center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the school had one standardized patient. Today, it has
more than 200, including 30 genital teaching associates. ``The
impact it has on students and the amount of doctor time it saves is
amazing,'' she said. ``These medical students can end up doing a
better exam than a practicing nurse or physician.''

</P>
<P>
   Even after years with the books and the lectures, many medical
students admit they are hardly prepared for their first genital
exam. When confronted with their first naked patient they have been
known to faint, cry, vomit, become hysterical and sweat. If they
don't overcome those reactions while working with an associate,
they could experience them with an actual patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``All a student's folkways, all their traditions are being
challenged,'' said Cathey Bienkowski, who has coordinated associate
programs in the New York City area since 1982. ``We are what we
have been brought up to be. We all have certain values about nudity
and touching. The whole class is set up to be safe for the
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Josie Hasle, a retired associate who set up the program at
the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark:
``It's such an invasive exam. And everyone who walks through the
door has baggage. We help them move it from the personal to the
clinical.'' Beginning at Louisiana State University, she since has
managed the programs at Tulane, campuses of the University of
Texas, the University of Alabama and the State University of New
York, among others. With the associates, she said, ``The student
gets a nonthreatening teaching environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Swartz, director of the Morchand Center for Clinical
Competence at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where students from
six New York medical schools practice clinical skills, said that
the reluctance of doctors to perform routine pelvic examinations
needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare the average 25-year-old medical student to the
25-year-old in public relations,'' he said, ``they are very
immature. Medical students have had much more of a sheltered social
background than non-medical students. From college they've been so
directed toward their career that, in many cases, their social
development has been less, and with fewer interactions. They could
be very good at science but they haven't begun to pass
interpersonal skills 101.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes such programs even more necessary, said Dr. Lila
Wallis, a past president of the American Medical Women's
Association and founder of Cornell University's associate program.
``It is every woman's right to have a painless, competent,
sensitive and communicative exam,'' she said. ``A woman with an
unpleasant one in her past means that she won't go for check-ups
and jeopardizes her health.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wallis, an internist, is particularly incensed with doctors
who do not perform them. ``A breast and pelvic is just as integral
to the exam of a woman as an exam of the mouth, throat, lungs,
heart, abdomen and extremities is. Everything is intertwined in the
body. To separate it out is diagnostically invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the associate programs work in different ways,
depending on the school, the model that Ms. Saltzman follows is
among the most sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Male and female associates work with small groups of four or
five medical students, residents or practicing doctors enrolled in
continuing education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Women work in teams of two, first demonstrating an ideal
doctor-patient interaction, beginning with a knock at the
examination room door, through the initial handshake and on through
the actual examination. Next, the medical students themselves
follow the process, from the door through the examination.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saltzman and her fellow associates are mostly part-time
workers. They are often people who are used to being looked at in
their other jobs _ as actors, dancers and models. They are
well-trained as associates, and apprenticed. In a way, they've
donated their live bodies to science, for an hourly fee. In New
York City, women typically receive $175 for a three-hour session,
and men usually make $150 for two hours. Some, like Ms. Saltzman,
work more than a dozen of the three-hour sessions each year.
</P>
<P>
   Male associates function more as live models as a urologist
guides the sessions, though the men do interact with the students
by answering questions and explaining what is comfortable and what
is not during the genital and rectal exams.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can do it, said Robert Speller, an associate for 12
years. ``Nude, and nude and examined are very different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some associates, including Ms. Saltzman, the work brings in
more than money. Last month, she said, she taught a medical student
who had never had a pelvic exam herself, and by the end of the
session, the student was ready to make an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Wang, 23, a second-year medical student, was impressed as
well. After a December session of pelvic and breast examinations at
Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, Ms. Wang said with a mixture of
relief and confidence, ``I thought it would be uncomfortable to be
instructed from that position, but now I don't see a better way of
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paula Stillman of the Lehigh Valley Health System in
Pennsylvania agreed. ``When I went to medical school, we made the
same mistakes over and over again,'' said Dr. Stillman, who has
worked with associates since the 1970s. ``Even a lot of experienced
physicians may not have felt an ovary. When you watch someone doing
a pelvic you can't tell what they're feeling. The only way you can
really tell is if the person you're doing the exam on can tell
you.''

ANI DEFRANCO MAKES SONGS SPEAK DIRECTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fiercely independent Ani DiFranco is a walking, talking,
guitar-strutting rebel. She's proud of her ``indie girl'' status,
her anti-corporate politics, her sexuality, her refusal to sell her
music for TV ads, her saying no to the Lilith Fair and Lollapalooza
festivals, and the creation of her own label, the Buffalo-based
Righteous Babe Records.
</P>
<P>
   Her female empowerment has made her a fascinating subject to the
media, even though many analysts forget to mention the most
important ingredient of her success _ her music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media rarely get to what I actually do,'' says DiFranco,
whose raw, visceral style is best appreciated by the loyal fans who
have followed her most of the last decade, but also by the many
newcomers who have made her an amphitheater headliner this year for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience doesn't come to the shows because I believe in
independence or in trying to fight corporate forces in the music
industry,'' says DiFranco from her Buffalo office. ``I don't think
that would sustain them for very long. They come out to hear the
songs and I come out to play them. And that's really where it
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco, now 27, has become a folk-punk sensation with an
intensity unsurpassed in the acoustic world. This summer, she
headlines Great Woods and plays the Ben &AMP; Jerry's Newport Folk
Festival. And she's done it with a rapier-sharp ability to write
about relationships (``She's the best right now ... I haven't heard
poetry like that since Bob Dylan,'' says Bonnie Raitt), along with
a physical, in-your-face guitar style that has been likened to
karate chops. She achieves it by wearing fake nails and taping her
fingers together to get a dense, edgily percussive tone on the
strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I had a much more folkie sound,'' DiFranco
says. ``I was emulating what I knew and what I heard around me. And
then, as I came into my own, it just got more and more aggresssive
because that's the environment I lived in. I moved to New York and
I played in bars for years. And my playing technique was a way of
surviving in the bar circuit. And also, it's just me. I love my
guitars, but I dole out a certain amount of abuse on them. I've
always been interested in ways to rock hard without a lot of
electricity, with just an acoustic guitar and not with an amplifier
turned up to 11.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco has become a phenomenon with an arena-size audience,
despite never having had a hit single. ``My career is not like the
career of a pop star,'' says DiFranco. ``I have no radio hits and I
will never have a radio hit. People have often commented on the
intensity of the relationship between me and my audience, but they
have to understand that it's been built up over 10 years. And
people also notice that (my fans) know all the words to all the
songs. Again, there is no hit, and it's not like I have one album
and then I had the hit radio single and thousands and thousands of
people are turning up, waiting to hear that familiar song. It's a
much different kind of dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there are no hits, the audience has more of a
relationship to me, than to a particular song,'' she adds. ``And
I'm not really part of a scene. I'm just this bumbling folk singer
that won't give up, so there's a long-term familiarity there; a
history, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``bumbling'' folk singer is really a workaholic whose
talent is evident to anyone who has listened to her better-known
CDs, such as ``Not a Pretty Face,'' ``Dilate,'' and her latest,
``Little Plastic Castle.'' All stretch the boundaries of folk
music. The new album even plunges into ska rhythms, lounge-twang
guitar, primal screams, spoken-word poetry, and folk-jazz to go
along with her core folk-punk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work you have to do in order to get up and
bumble effectively,'' DiFranco says with a laugh. ``It's clearly
not as haphazard as it might appear. But, yes, basically the
songwriting has always been my focus. It's always been the basis of
my music.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco is the daughter of two MIT graduates. Her mother became
an architect and her father an engineer. DiFranco herself grew up
loving the cerebral song craft of Joni Mitchell, but also the
emotional punk music of bands like the Minutemen and Husker Du. To
emphasize her punky side, she also used to shave her head and wear
thick work boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of DIY (Do It Yourself) ethic that I've always
had,'' says DiFranco. ``And I think that, at its essence, folk
music and punk music share a lot in that they're community-based,
subcorporate musical forms, traditionally, anyway. Of course they
can be commercialized and co-opted and found in all sorts of
different contexts, but basically they give voice to what's going
on at a street level in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   What separates DiFranco from the pack is the all-out energy she
brings to the stage. It was apparent when she opened last summer
for Bob Dylan _ and the show at Great Woods (her first tour with a
band) was so impressive that one newspaper headline read ``Ani
DiFranco leaves Bob Dylan blowing in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a lot of interest in doing things halfway,''
she says of her fiery stage persona. ``I think, `If all these
people are going to bother to drag their butts out to the show, and
if I'm going to bother to subject myself to mass criticism, then I
may as well put out. I may as well expend every ounce of energy.
Otherwise, why did we all assemble?' I think that for me, if I have
any ounce of energy left after a show, then I wonder, what was I
saving it for, if not for my work?''
</P>
<P>
   In her younger years, DiFranco was influenced by such folkies as
Suzanne Vega, Tom Paxton, Rod McDonald, Cliff Eberhart, Cheryl
Wheeler, and old-timer Utah Phillips. She went on to produce
Phillips's last album and will do his next as well. ``He's one of
my heroes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco's rise to fame has been rapid in recent years. And her
big concern these days is how comfortable she'll be in the oversize
summer sheds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venues are just getting bigger and bigger as my audience
gets bigger,'' says DiFranco. ``But it's inherently less rewarding
for me to play in these larger venues, because I get off so much on
the intense energy of the more intimate dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should just drop out and start touring under a
pseudonym in little clubs,'' she adds with a laugh. ``I'm actually
one of those crazy people who's pretty content touring at a smaller
level. But we're going to give the sheds a try this summer and make
it as real as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``making it real,'' she means: Don't look for the smoke and
lights of many typical shed shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been into the pomp and circumstance of the rock 'n'
roll show. Basically, at heart, I'm a folk singer. It's pretty
simple stuff. I get up onstage and I play music and I try to talk
to people and get a semblance of a dialogue going. I don't want to
put on a big flashy show. That's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she want to join Lilith Fair or Lollapalooza and have to
shorten her sets to fit in. ``I was much more inspired by the idea
of going out and playing my own shows. If you play for 25 minutes
(at a festival), you can only go so deep with it. But when you play
for an hour and a half or two hours, you really get inside the
music. It can be much more profound.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !! 1/2 ``Full Speed''  An occasionally engaging film about a group
of young people in a Paris suburb and what happens when one of
them, a talented writer, finds widespread success. The film's
biggest fault is failing to flesh out the writer's character so
that his transition into a heel is sharper and the effect on his
friends more poignant. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Home Before Dark''  &LR; Modestly scaled but insightful and
affecting take on an 11-year-old girl forced into assuming adult
responsibilities when her depressed mother attempts suicide and is
institutionalized. Impressive central performance by Stephanie
Castellarin in a sterling debut film by Maureen Foley. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ! 1/2 ``Hope Floats''  &LR; Hope flops as this film never gets off the
ground. It wastes the sweet appeal of Sandra Bullock in a skeletal
and predictable story about a woman retreating to her Texas
hometown in pain and confusion after being dumped by an unfaithful
husband. The movie mopes around more than she does. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ! ``I Got the Hook-Up''  &LR; This is ghetto comedy as its most
crude. Rapper Master P, who wrote and stars in this offensive mess,
fancies his film about two criminals and stolen cell phones is a
screwball comedy _ but only those foolish enough to pay to see this
will feel screwed. (R) (Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FU)!!! 1/2 ``The Last Days of Disco''  &LR; The third and (the
filmmaker swears) last in Whit Stillman's set of three nightlife
comedies about preppies who talk smart and live dumb while sorting
out their lives and struggling to stay on the right side of cool.
Stillman makes canny use of the waning of the disco era and the end
of the youth the characters are afraid of losing. Witty, literate,
great soundtrack. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 ``Lawn Dogs''  &LR; Not unimaginative, but this attempt to blend
social comment and children's fantasy never quite coheres. A
10-year-old girl flees her fenced-in Louisville suburb to enjoy an
innocent but liberating friendship with a gardener her parents and
their neighbors regard as white trash. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``The North End''  &LR; An invigorating debut film from the brother
team of Frank and Joseph Ciota, filled with raw freshness, danger,
atmosphere and a total avoidance of goombah cliche. Fatalistic
locals led by Frank Vincent take a dim view of the changes coming
to their storied neighborhood and of the strains on its codes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Everything changed after Latrell Sprewell
strangled the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Warriors General Manager Garry St. Jean had agreed
to go wine tasting with me. I would copy down his comments and
write an article about the jock whose taste in beverages extends
beyond Gatorade and Bud Lite. Because that's the truth _ Garry St.
Jean knows from wine.
</P>
<P>
   But there was that unfortunate incident involving Sprewell's
fingers around the throat of P.J. Carlesimo, which was followed by
a hasty call from St. Jean. His tone was apologetic. It wouldn't
look good, he explained, if a photo showed up in print with the
general manager grinning broadly and sipping chardonnay while the
team was in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   I could see his point, although my mind immediately raced ahead
to the caption under the photo: ``Latrell Sprewell may have
strangled coach P.J. Carlesimo, but Garry St. Jean doesn't choke on
merlot.''
</P>
<P>
   We put our outing on hold, let the wine age a little longer. And
about a minute after the Warriors season ended, St. Jean was on the
phone. ``When are we going wine tasting?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   So, about a week ago, we went.
</P>
<P>
   There was St. Jean, his wife Mary Jane (known as M.J.) and me. I
had selected three wineries, Ravenswood, Arrowood and Chateau St.
Jean, all fine Sonoma County producers. And if you've noticed that
St. Jean the coach and St. Jean the winery have the same name,
you've discovered the key to this article. Here's the background.
</P>
<P>
   In his pre-wine days, St. Jean worked as an assistant coach for
Don Nelson on the Milwaukee Bucks. That was in 1980. Nelson
(usually called Nellie) ain't exactly your typical wine
sophisticate. He and St. Jean would chug beer and feel they had
achieved the height of culture. ``I guess we were what you'd call
relative rookies,'' St. Jean told me.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, when Nelson became head coach of the Warriors, he
hired St. Jean as an assistant. Dan Gustafson and Mike Kenton of
Chateau St. Jean noticed. They were wine guys, but they were also
Warriors season-ticket holders, and they thought, hey, wouldn't it
be a blast to meet the coaches and do a little wine promoting at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   So Gustafson and Kenton, who've since moved to Codorniu Napa,
sent St. Jean some wine and invited him and M.J. to the winery, and
pretty soon they all became friends. As time went on, and St. Jean
the coach continued to drink St. Jean the wine, he noticed the
stuff actually tasted good. Before long, he was devoted. When
people asked, ``Is Chateau St. Jean your winery?'' he replied,
``Sure. Drop by the property.'' He and M.J. own a house on Cape
Cod. Over the front door is a sign: ``Chateau St. Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why we found ourselves in a stretch limo
headed north toward Sonoma on a sunny Friday morning. We were
greeted at Ravenswood by David Riffo, head of hospitality, who
explained Ravenswood makes big bucks from its California
chardonnay, known as Chateau Cache Fl'eau. We didn't spend time in
the tasting room. Instead, Riffo took us to a barrel room where he
dipped into a barrel with a long plastic tube that looked like a
turkey baster. In fact, it's called a ``thief,'' and it scooped up
1997 Barricia Vineyard Chardonnay from an old cask and then from a
new cask.
</P>
<P>
   The wine from the old cask had hints of green apples and pears,
all the usual stuff wine writers write about. You feel like a dope
if you don't taste them, too. The wine from the new barrel was
smoky. Riffo said the two wines would be blended together. The
chardonnay was really terrific, especially when you consider that
Ravenswood is a red wine house, well-known for zinfandel. By the
way, if you don't find my wine adjectives specific enough, remember
I'm just a dumb sporstwriter.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean has better adjectives. Riffo was talking about
malolactic fermentation. Pretty soon, he'd have gotten down to the
molecular level _ that's how enthusiastic he was about the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malolactic fermentation,'' St. Jean said, impressed. ``Holy
Moly!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Let's just stop here and say a Holy Moly from St. Jean is praise
of the highest order. He used Holy Moly to express his fascination
with malolactic fermentation, and to describe his joy with
delicious, complex wines. Holy Moly is, frankly, as good as any
wine term I've ever heard, and it's a lot less snobby.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, a St. Jean Holy Moly may become the wine equivalent
of two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert. You can just see ads in the
newspaper: ``Chateau So-and-So is proud to announce that its
sauvignon blanc earned the prestigious Holy Moly from Garry St.
Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   We made the transition to red wines, or as Riffo said, ``That's
enough of chardonnay. Let's go taste some real wine.'' St. Jean
tasted an estate merlot from the barrel. Lovely stuff. ``Why so
heavy?'' St. Jean asked. ``It's not filtered or fined,'' Riffo
said, holding his glass up to the light. The liquid was slightly
murky. St. Jean nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Riffo climbed up seven barrels and brought down a sample of
Ravenswood's Gregory Vineyard Merlot. ``What do you taste?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   M.J. St. Jean looked thoughtful. ``It's minty,'' she said.
``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Riffo smiled. ``Because the vineyard is bordered by eucalyptus
trees. The oils are carried by the wind and land on the grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean downed his glass of merlot, a look of deep pleasure on
his face. ``I don't spit it out,'' he said. ``I drink it.'' Then he
added, ``Holy Moly!''
</P>
<P>
   We were greeted at Arrowood by Michael Monahan, hospitality
manager. Arrowood's owner, Richard Arrowood, used to be the
winemaker at St. Jean, put that place on the map before starting
his own winery. He recently opened a new tasting room at Arrowood _
beamed ceilings, fireplace, view of the hills. It looks like a ski
chalet.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan took us to a private tasting room on the second floor.
On a table, he had set out five glasses for each of us. First we
tasted a 1996 Sonoma County Chardonnay, which St. Jean called
``lush,'' but M.J. found too ``oaky'' for her taste. Next came a
1996 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (pronounced vee-ohn-yea). You
probably know that viognier is the newest white-wine craze. M.J.
liked it. ``It smells sweet, but it drinks dry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she tasted a 1994 Sonoma County Reserve Speciale Cabernet,
M.J. said, ``Wow!'' St. Jean said, ``I love it.'' They sprung for
two bottles. The price, $50 apiece. A 1994 Reserve Merlot was also
astonishing, and its price was too: $55.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, St. Jean's attention was elsewhere. Each wine came
with winemaster's notes on an elegantly printed card. St. Jean held
up the card. He said that when he coached, he'd write his plays on
a card just that size. There would be regular plays and ``need''
plays for when he absolutely had to have a bucket at the end of the
game. These need plays might be run for Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway
or Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch (Lakers coach) Del Harris,'' St. Jean said. ``He
holds his card. Nellie and I keep it in our breast pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine this scene, right? St. Jean is coaching.
There's one second left in the game. He's down by a point. He
reaches into his pocket and frantically grabs the card. But it's
the wine card. The players look at him for guidance. He yells,
``Arrowood 1996 Russian River Valley Viognier.'' They make the
hoop, and all the players think he's a genius.
</P>
<P>
   We drove to Chateau St. Jean, where Ken Bailey, the hospitality
manager and a Warriors season-ticket holder, escorted us upstairs
to the Green Room. It used to be part of a guest suite for VIPs.
St. Jean and M.J. have slept there several times, surrounded by
vineyards and green hills. A few years ago, the suite was converted
to a private tasting and eating room. Before that happened, Don
Nelson's son Donnie stayed there on his wedding night. The last
people to sleep there before the conversion were Dusty Baker and
his wife, Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   When we sat down at the table in the Green Room, we noticed the
private menu. It said: ``Luncheon at the Chateau Honoring our
Guests Mr. Lowell Cohn, Mr. Garry St. Jean and Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you think I'm bragging about this, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   They'd matched a wine with each course, the way they do at fancy
restaurants I can never afford. For example, the 1995 Robert Young
Vineyards Chardonnay went with the Salad of Field Greens With Bay
Shrimp, Apple and Dried Cranberries Tossed in Tarragon Dressing.
</P>
<P>
   In my tasting notes on the chardonnay, I have St. Jean saying,
``Boy, is that good.'' He was smiling. He had learned about
chardonnay years ago by drinking the Robert Young, and now, even
though time had passed, the wine didn't disappoint. St. Jean was
falling in love with this wine all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that it's only $22,'' he said. ``I've tasted
more expensive wine that's not as good. Obviously, I'm partial, but
this is my favorite.'' M.J. said, ``It's buttery. I like chardonnay
that melts in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to the 1995 Pinot Noir, Durell Vineyards from
Carneros. In case you're wondering, it went with the Wild Mushroom
Risotto. M.J. was puzzled. She's not been exposed often to pinot
noir and struggled for a vocabulary to express her feelings. ``It's
not my favorite of the day by any means,'' she said. ``But I'm
trying to figure out why. It's spicy.'' She frowned because that
didn't say what she meant. ``It's just different for me.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean had no problem with the pinot noir, which, at $28, was
a gorgeous rendering of that grape.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon, Cinq Cepages, a
blend of five reds, which went with the beef tenderloin. St. Jean
savored the cab, price $24. ``A guy like me,'' he said, ``I don't
understand how Arrowood can charge $50, and this doesn't need to
take a backseat.'' There was much discussion on that subject. It
was decided that with Arrowood, you pay for the name and the
limited production along with the high quality.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean didn't care. He took one more sip of the St. Jean cab.
He let it roll along his tongue and slide down his throat. He gazed
at everyone in the room. ``Holy Moly!'' he said. And he meant it.

PERSONAL HEALTH: ADDING YEARS TO LIFE AND LIFE TO YEARS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People with bad health habits that they will not or cannot
abandon often make excuses: ``What's the point of living longer _
you'll only spend more years in a nursing home?'' or ``A healthy
life really isn't any longer, it just seems that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the saddest excuse of all dates back to 1964 when the
surgeon general issued the first report on smoking and health.
Diehard smokers told me, ``By the time I get lung cancer, they'll
know how to cure it.'' If only that had happened. But 34 years
later we are hardly closer to curing lung cancer than we were then.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is none of these excuses hold up under the scrutiny of
sound medical research, and a recently published study of more than
1,700 men and women followed for 32 years puts the lie to them all.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in April in The New England Journal of
Medicine, clearly showed that people with healthier habits not only
live longer, they live better, experiencing only half as much
chronic disability as their less-prudent age mates.
</P>
<P>
   The findings strongly suggest that vitality into one's later
years is less a matter of genes and more a question of how a person
chooses to live. Those who smoked the least, stayed trim and
exercised regularly not only lived longer but were less likely to
develop disabilities. Even among participants who died, the
low-risk people had shorter periods of disability before dying.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dr. James Fries, professor of medicine at Stanford
University, published a provocative article suggesting that
preventive health practices would keep Americans healthier longer
and change the shape of the nation's disability and death curve
from one that resembles a water slide to one that looks more like a
cliff.
</P>
<P>
   According to his ``compression of morbidity'' hypothesis, most
Americans, instead of experiencing a more-or-less steady rate of
increasing disability and deaths starting at mid-life, could live
reasonably well into their 80s, before they begin to die at an
accelerated rate.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, if people could be persuaded to choose
more prudent health habits, the majority would reach their ninth
decade in good health and then die after, at most, a relatively
brief period of illness.
</P>
<P>
   But some skeptics challenged Fries, suggesting instead that
practicing good health habits, while likely to add years to life,
would also swell the number of years during which people are beset
by chronic illness and disability. If true, critics said, this
would further overwhelm an already overburdened system struggling
to care for millions of elderly Americans with costly,
debilitating, lingering health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two decades after Fries' proposal, he and his
colleagues have data that dispute the naysayers. According to their
new findings, living healthfully would not only add years to life,
it would also add life to years, keeping people well and able to
enjoy life far longer than they otherwise might have.
</P>
<P>
   Although the participants' average age was only 75 at the last
assessment, there is every indication that those with healthy
habits will on average remain in better health however long they
live. Those whose habits put them at lowest risk for health
problems delayed the average age at which they developed even
minimal disability by nearly seven years _ to age 73 as against age
66 for those at highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tracked 1,741 men and women who graduated from
the University of Pennsylvania in 1939 and 1940. These alumni were
surveyed by other researchers at the time of graduation and again
in 1962, 1976 and 1980 before the Stanford team took over and
reassessed their health habits and health status annually for seven
years starting in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were classified as being at high, moderate or low
risk based on three modifiable factors known to contribute to poor
health: cigarette smoking, excess weight and inactivity. At every
assessment _ even when the participants were only about 43 years
old _ those at highest risk were more likely to report disabilities
than those at moderate risk, who in turn had more disabilities than
those at low risk.
</P>
<P>
   The authors emphasize that for the overwhelming majority these
risk factors are matters of personal choice. But it is all too
obvious that a growing number are making the wrong choices.
</P>
<P>
   Although tens of millions of adults have quit smoking in the
last 34 years, we now face the chilling fact that as many as 40
percent of students in some high schools are smoking. The tobacco
industry has been particularly successful in hooking teen-age girls
and young blacks on this noxious weed. And if you think young
Americans smoke too much, in many European countries it is hard to
find any young person without a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity, too, is a growing concern. Americans on the whole are
fatter now than at any time in our history. People tend to blame
the ready availability of high-calorie foods and the constant
temptation to eat too much, especially too much fatty, sugary
foods. Few seem to have the will to resist overindulging.
</P>
<P>
   But the food supply and eating habits are not the only culprits.
Inactivity has a major, deleterious influence on the weight of
Americans. Having created a society replete with labor-saving
devices, we failed to compensate adequately for our relative
inactivity by building more exercise into our daily routines and
leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one American in five gets enough exercise to keep
weight down and health up. And there is virtually no physical
activity in the lives of 60 percent of Americans, whose exercise
consists of little more than pressing a finger to the television
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those who exercise regularly weigh less and are better able
to achieve and maintain weight loss. Thus, in addition to its
direct health benefits, for example, in preventing cardiovascular
diseases and cancer, exercise can help control weight.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors not assessed in the Fries study also influence
health. But the people who stayed trim and exercised, in all
likelihood, regularly ate more healthfully as well. I think you get
the point: at any stage of life, it pays to pay attention to
preventive health practices. Good health and longevity are largely
in your hands.

   Americans will be traveling more this summer, and _ in spite of
lower gasoline prices _ spending more in the process, according to
the Travel Industry Association of America and AAA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United States travelers will take a total of 251 million
``person trips'' (a family of four taking a trip together counts as
four person-trips). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That number is an increase of 3 percent, on top of a 9 percent
jump in 1997, according to a survey undertaken by the Travel
Industry Association of America. That family of four will spend
$218 a day on meals and lodging, $19 more than it spent last year,
according to a survey of vacation costs by AAA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida, California and Hawaii continue to top the list of
places Americans most want to visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of the 1,500 travelers surveyed, 51 percent, will
be taking children _ either their own or grandchildren _ up from 43
percent last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time travelers were asked if they expected to
attend a family reunion this year, and 25 percent said yes; the
proportion was the same among travelers with children and those
without. &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Yes, you may have to duck a flying cow at the latest attraction
at Universal Studios Florida. In Twister ... Ride It Out, based on
the movie ``Twister,'' the cow is from a sign, however, not a
farm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attraction opened May 4 after a one-month delay out of
respect for the 42 people who died in tornadoes in February in
central Florida, not far from this Orlando theme park. (Universal
says it donated $100,000 in aid for the victims.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Twister experience, using a video with Bill Paxton and Helen
Hunt, the stars of ``Twister,'' guides guests into a sound studio
displaying the movie's scene of the wreckage of Aunt Meg's home.
</P>
<P>
   The sky darkens, the temperature drops and winds howl. The
guests, warned of an impending tornado, are evacuated to the
drive-in theater and Quonset hut seen in the movie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There they see, hear and feel the power of a five-story twister,
including winds (kept to 35 miles an hour) created by dozens of
powerful fans; the ubiquitous ``freight train'' roar (through 54
speakers), and pelting rain created by 150,000 gallons of recycled
water daily (guests (italics)will(end italics) get wet). For about
five minutes, the building shakes, sparks from downed electric
wires fly, and the landscape is ripped apart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Florida offers a number of options for
admission to the 444-acre park, including a single-day pass for
$44.52, $36.04 ages 3 to 9; a two-day pass, $65.72 and $55.12; and
a ticket to two or three other theme parks, including Sea World,
Wet 'n Wild, and Busch Gardens in Tampa, costing $82.95 to $129.95.
The park opens at 9 a.m. daily; closing time varies from 7 to 10
p.m. Information: (407) 363-8000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rushmore National Memorial _ the 60-foot-high sculpture in
the Black Hills of South Dakota of George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt _ will hold a
grand opening for its new visitor center and museum on June 15,
marking the end of a decade of construction work.
</P>
<P>
   Additions include a grand entry and visitor plaza, a restaurant,
a gift shop, an amphitheater, a walking trail and a viewing
platform. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new interactive museum offers exhibits on the sculptor,
Gutzon Borglum, and the 392 original workers on the project, which
began in 1927 and was dedicated in 1941. The four presidents and
the history of the United States are also part of the focus. A
13-minute orientation film will be shown in two new 125-seat
theaters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grandview Terrace, the new viewing platform, offers an
unobstructed look at the faces (with their 20-foot noses), and
allows visitors to get closer to the sculpture than ever before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $60 million project was paid for with private money.
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial Society raised $23 million;
the federal government provided $3 million, and the rest came from
the companies that operate the concessions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rushmore National Memorial is in Keystone, about half an
hour from Rapid City. More information: (605) 574-2523. &QL;

   Two more historic houses are opening their doors to visitors in
Newport, R.I., this summer. Both are recent acquisitions of the
Preservation Society of Newport County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chepstow, a three-story Italianate villa designed by the Newport
architect George Champlin Mason, is scheduled to open on Friday. It
will be available for tours, by appointment only, on Fridays and
Saturdays through October.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1860 as a summer residence for Edmund Schermerhorn _ a
first cousin of one of the town's most active hostesses, Mrs.
William Astor Jr. _ Chepstow was bought in 1911 by Mrs. Emily
Morris Gallatin, of the Morris family, prominent members of New
York's Old Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The property, named for the own in Wales that the family came
from, overlooks Narragansett Avenue, where generations of summer
visitors have strolled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although far less grand than some of Newport's mansions,
Chepstow houses an outstanding collection of art and furniture,
including some from other Morris family residences.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many American paintings bequeathed to the society and
hanging here are works by George Harvey, Fitz Hugh Lane and
Granville Perkins. Among the furnishings is a walnut Queen Anne
side chair said to have belonged to William Penn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late summer _ probably in early August _ the Isaac Bell House
on Bellevue Avenue will also open to visitors on Fridays and
Saturdays _ as a work in progress. The mansion, named for its
original owner, a prosperous New York cotton broker and a key
investor in the trans-Atlantic cable, is undergoing an extensive
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Built from 1881 to 1883 by the New York architectural firm of
McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the house is said to have been a great
influence on Frank Lloyd Wright. It is one of the country's finest
examples of the shingle style. Although the exterior restoration
was completed early this year, research for the interior is still
going on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to viewing the elaborately detailed exterior of
uniquely patterned cedar shingles, towers, chimneys, porches and
columns, visitors can expect to see firsthand how such a
complicated restoration develops. There will be no furniture or
collections in the rooms until the project's completion, which is
expected to take several years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tours cost $8 each, $5 for students and children. For
information, call the Preservation Society of Newport County at
(401) 847-1000; its Web site is www.newportmansions.org. &QL;

ANOTHER REASON TO WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday June 3)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of Little League moms were discussing the chores their
kids did.
</P>
<P>
   One mother said her son made his bed every morning, folded
laundry and cut the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Another said her son prepared his own breakfast, vacuumed the
rugs, updated the family's Web page on the Internet and rotated the
tires on the car.
</P>
<P>
   I was pretty dizzy by the time the third mom spoke, but I think
she said her 12-year-old son had recently re-marcited the pool,
performed an emergency appendectomy on the family cat and
restructured their stock portfolio, but that he was ``not perfect''
and sometimes needed to be reminded to pick up his socks.
</P>
<P>
   As if the heat, the dust and the hard bleacher seats were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   As if I don't have anything better to do than eat stale popcorn,
sip watery Mountain Dews and shout ``good eye!'' whenever a batter
refrains from swinging at a pitch that is 10 feet over his head.
</P>
<P>
   As if all of this were not enough, I now have to deal with the
possibility that my son may be ``chore deficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Until I overheard the Little League moms, I didn't realize that
one could be deficient in chores, just as one could be deficient in
vitamin A, vitamin C or thiamine. The symptoms of chore deficiency
were not spelled out by the moms (and I was much too ashamed to
ask), but one can assume they include listlessness, lassitude,
ennui and, in the later stages, chronic ``South Park'' viewing
interrupted by long periods of staring morosely into the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   If I had thought about it, which of course I hadn't, I would
have guessed that our 12-year-old was well within the normal range
of chore performance. On good days, for example, we only have to
tell him 18 times to pick his clothes up off the floor and my wife
says she recalls a time he walked the dog without being threatened,
though I personally think she's confusing our son with someone she
saw on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But now I know that, compared to the ultra-choring kids of the
Little League moms, our son is severely chore-deficient to the
point that we should be glad he gets out of bed at all, let alone
at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The Little League moms did not tell me, and again I did not ask,
what the ramifications are of chore deficiency. For example, will
it affect his chances of getting into a good college? Will the dean
of admissions deduct points because he failed to empty the
dishwasher when he was 12? Will a future employer (assuming there
are any) deny him promotion because of his history of sloppy
towel-hanging?
</P>
<P>
   If it is true that doing chores builds character, is the reverse
also true? Are our prisons bulging with people who, as children,
failed to regularly take out the trash?
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to ask successful people about the kind
and number of chores they performed as children, assuming you could
count on them to tell the truth, which you probably couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because I suspect (as well as hope) that adults
exaggerate the number of chores they did as children to the point
that you wonder how they had time to go to school, so busy were
they chopping wood, plowing fields and just generally thumbing
their snotty little noses at the child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably be more useful to ask the parents of
successful people how many chores their kids did, assuming, after
all the sordid stories we've heard about him so far, that we really
want to know that Bill Clinton had to be told twice to pick up his
socks.

BIG SPENDERS IN CALIFORNIA RACE MAY GET LITTLE RETURN ON
INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The 1998 primary campaign for California
governor has shown more clearly than ever that two things are
inevitable in America: excess and television.
</P>
<P>
   These forces came together during the past eight months to
produce a political campaign existing almost entirely within a
wallpaper of television advertising and fold-out brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Two millionaires opened their wallets and helped make this the
most expensive state campaign in history _ $55 million and rising.
Even the poorest candidate, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, neared a record in
spending.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis said this week: ``In California politics, if you're not
on TV, you don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   This astonishing display of money and media aloofness came in
the middle of a radical change in California politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primary allows all voters to vote for any candidate,
regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 primary campaign has left even the most battle-worn
political consultants shaking their heads in astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be books written about this campaign, a few
books,'' said Garry South, Davis' campaign adviser, ``Heck, I may
write one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an unprecedented race that will be analyzed for
years to come,'' said Darry Sragow, an adviser to Al Checchi, the
former Northwest Airlines co-chairman who faces fellow Democrats
Gray and Rep. Jane Harman in the primary race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the veneer of television, the Democratic primary also
became a story about three disparate personalities: the career
politician, the mother, the corporate take-over artist.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, all three made appearances at the top of
the polls, and seemed like capable opponents to the certain
Republican nominee, Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen this many heavy hitters in one race
before,'' said Mark Petracca, chairman of the Political Science
Department at the University of California at Irvine. ``We don't
appreciate that enough in this state. Maybe we would if we were
living in Louisiana, where the choice is between who spent the
least amount of time in federal prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi, 49, is by far the most unusual and contradictory figure
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillionaire grandson of Italian immigrants, Checchi
started his campaign poring over dense books on California
political history. He dined with America's best consultants and
pollsters, at the trendy Ca Brea and Ivy in Los Angeles. But he
spent his final days on a hot rented school bus, traveling to El
Centro and Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi now blames himself for being stereotyped as the rich
candidate, but he was the one who spent more money on a primary
than anyone else in the history of state politics _ at least $30
million, most on it on dozens of television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's financial portfolio, which grew $130 million as the
stock market rose during the campaign, paid for a series of
malevolent television attacks, mostly against the wealthy Harman.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strategy South calls an act of political
``murder-suicide.'' Checchi's biggest problem now is that people
overwhelmingly dislike the image he presented on television, but
they seem to adore him on the campaign trail where he can meet only
a few people at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi hit the road and met more people than any other
candidate, but got criticized for living exclusively in the
televised ether of political theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he lives in a vast mansion, Checchi had the most
pessimistic view about California. He saw the schools crumbling,
roads collapsing and jobs leaving. He had $14 billion in plans to
fix things, including what seemed like a reasonable request: get
the state up to the national average in school spending.
</P>
<P>
   Harman, 52, is articulate, experienced, tough, telegenic. She
entered the race almost at the spur of the moment, after popular
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, decided to forgo the race for
the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Harman was hammered for saying she didn't know the answers to
everything, even though she often did. Her health-care reform ads
demanded changes that had already occurred. She zinged Checchi for
his negative ads, but then called him a wheeler-dealer attempting a
corporate take-over of California.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop, Harman was asked what her legacy
should be: ``That she has guts, she wants to heal California, and
she made the best possible run in three and a half months.''
</P>
<P>
   Once described as the ``Energizer bunny'' of California
politics, the methodical and phlegmatic Davis seemed like just
another political has-been after Harman and Checchi got up to
speed. Davis, 55, didn't even air a television commercial until the
campaign's final six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County Register columnist seemed to hit the mark when
he suggested several months ago, when Davis was behind in the
polls, that people look at who Californians have elected governor
since Jerry Brown left office in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Democrats nominated popular Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley. He could have been the first black governor of California.
Then came Feinstein's nomination in 1990, with predictions that she
would be the first woman governor. It seemed like time. Then came
Kathleen Brown in 1994. For a while she appeared destined for
glory, the continuation of a unique family dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But California voters ultimately picked two sedate and
conservative men, Republicans George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson.
Two terms for each. Wilson's term ends this year and he cannot seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The open primary has been called a test run of the November
election, since people aren't restricted to voting within their
party.
</P>
<P>
   Could the voters be reacting in the 1998 primary candidates in
the same way they did during past four general elections?
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Gray Davis and Dan Lungren, who have run in
several statewide campaigns, are known to the public,'' Deukmejian
said. ``The people feel comfortable with them, and they feel that
since the state is in fairly good shape, they don't need radical
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy from watching the Checchi-Harman spending binge, few
political insiders paid attention to this theory, until a series of
polls showed Davis with a 2-1 lead over the millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The Energizer Bunny appears to have turned into the tortoise
who, at least according to the polls, may win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, the Checchi campaign was saying they would spend
whatever it took to get the job done,'' said Roy Behr, a campaign
consultant to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and former adviser to
Harman. ``I think at that point most people viewed it as a bluff.
It turned out that it wasn't. Now, it turns out that all the money
in the world may not be enough.''

   LONDON _ There are some moments that may have swayed the English
football coach's mind against the mercurial midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the free-kick which he insisted on taking, then
trundled straight to the first Moroccan defender. Or perhaps it was
the off-the-ball kick at Belgium's Vital Borkelmans. It could have
the times he was caught in possession, the times he gave the ball
away, the times he raged at the referee.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things Glenn Hoddle saw as he watched Paul
Gascoigne playing in Morocco last week. Most telling of all,
however, were the constant little breaks for a breather.
</P>
<P>
   All this nagged away at Hoddle's mind as he considered his
England team this weekend and then he acted.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle, who has backed Gascoigne over his wife-beating, his
``re-fuelling'' problems, his late nights and early baths, finally
accepted that this prodigal son could not be kept in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``football and fitness'' issue but it is impossible to
separate the way Gascoigne lives his life from the effect it has on
both.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him in Morocco, the idea that he would once again lead
England to World Cup glory seemed fanciful. The precocious talent
of Italia90 is older, slower, but no more mature. He remains the
best passer in the side but his growing vulnerability affects the
whole balance of the team and, by extension, the squad.
</P>
<P>
   If Gascoigne plays, Hoddle has to pick Ince and Batty to
compensate for his lack of mobility and his tendency to give the
ball away in dangerous areas. That means the front players get
isolated and, with Teddy Sheringham out of form, the team lose
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   So much of England's World Cup planning had been based around
Gascoigne. It is not that Hoddle was clinging on to a romantic
vision of what he once was. It is because, as was evident against
Chile and Switzerland, there appeared no alternative. Now he must
find one.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckham can see and play a pass but he has not got the
pace and dribbling to go past people.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse applies to Steve McManaman, while Paul Merson, who
has a bit of both, often struggles to impose himself on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Scholes is a possibility but it could be Darren Anderton.
He may still be feeling his way back into regular football but he
can attack defenses with the ball or pass it through them.
</P>
<P>
   Gascoigne was on the playing field for 170 minutes in the three
games against Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Morocco this last week but
he only played in short bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these teasingly hinted at his quality. The dribble and
shot against the Saudis, a reverse pass that opened up space for
Rob Lee against Belgium. However, it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after the Belgium game, Glenn Hoddle had said: ``He
needs to get fitter and sharper but he's worked extremely hard and
he's still got time.'' Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, Gascoigne may yet come back, although it will depend upon
how he reacts to this blow.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle had added: ``There's no question that he has the talent,
that he can pass the ball. He proved to me in the four matches he
put together for me last year (France, Brazil, Moldova, Italy) that
he can do it still.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me in the past if he'd ever come back fully
but I think he's given the answer on the pitch. He nailed it to the
mast with performances like the one he gave in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gascoigne fails to revive his career, if he instead wallows
in self-pity with the aid of his celebrity friends, Rome may prove
to be his final hurrah with England. It was a high note to go out
on, but far too premature. &QL;

   LONDON _ There are some moments that may have swayed the English
football coach's mind against the mercurial midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the free-kick which he insisted on taking, then
trundled straight to the first Moroccan defender. Or perhaps it was
the off-the-ball kick at Belgium's Vital Borkelmans. It could have
the times he was caught in possession, the times he gave the ball
away, the times he raged at the referee.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things Glenn Hoddle saw as he watched Paul
Gascoigne playing in Morocco last week. Most telling of all,
however, were the constant little breaks for a breather.
</P>
<P>
   All this nagged away at Hoddle's mind as he considered his
England team this weekend and then he acted.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle, who has backed Gascoigne over his wife-beating, his
``re-fuelling'' problems, his late nights and early baths, finally
accepted that this prodigal son could not be kept in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``football and fitness'' issue but it is impossible to
separate the way Gascoigne lives his life from the effect it has on
both.

   BEIRUT _ In Saudi Arabia, it's selling on the black market for
$30 a pill. In Egypt, it's banned but costs $15 a pill under the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, no man would even dream of suggesting he needed it _
which is just as well because the government refuses to import the
drug until it has conducted tests. But Viagra has arrived in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, male potency is not a subject you discuss
over the dinner table _ or anywhere else _ because many men appear
to be obsessed with the subject. The production of children is
regarded as proof of manhood.
</P>
<P>
   A married man without children is constantly and publicly asked
_ to the point of harassment _ why he has no offspring. So is it
any surprise that dreams of male virility are now running amok in
the region?
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian chemists claim privately that they have been
overwhelmed with requests for Viagra, which is one reason why the
Cairo police and health ministry officials have been raiding
pharmacies in the capital to hunt for the black market drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gamila Moussa, the deputy Egyptian health minister,
Pfizer has applied for permission to sell the pills in Egypt. ``But
the drug is illegal and we want to test and try it before we allow
it in our market,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Already three Egyptians have been taken ill after using Viagra
which the health ministry at first claimed Egypt's highly
productive male population did not need. The government, a
spokesman said, ``had taken account of the fact that the nature of
the Egyptian man was different to that of an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless 60 married men have voluntarily agreed to take
Viagra, a step which was greeted by two of Egypt's best known
humorists, Ahmed Ragab and Mustafa Hussein in the daily
``Al-Akhbar,'' with a plea for government-subsidized contraceptives
to offset the effects of the magical blue pill.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mahmoud Khalifa, an official
in the Department of Islamic Affairs, has announced that a married
man might be permitted to use the drug with his wife but that it
would be banned for unmarried men because it ``provokes vice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dubai pharmacies are being inundated with telephone calls
for the drug; one man in his seventies offered nearly $60 for a
single Viagra pill.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, a single pill is selling for $20 under the
counter in Jeddah but just under $50 in Riyadh _ what that says
about the virility of Jeddah men remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In Yemen, there is talk of Viagra replacing the lethargic
effects of qat, the nationally famous drug without which no holiday
is complete (its principal effect on the user is to make him fall
asleep _ the very opposite of Viagra's purpose).
</P>
<P>
   Women, too, have been telephoning chemists in the Arab world,
demanding to know if they have stocks of the pill.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, there hasn't been a male potency drug around since
the civil war _ when armed men would regularly shoot at migrating
storks. Boiled down, it was claimed, the birds' beaks could be
consumed, transforming the gunman's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   If Viagra really hits town, there are likely to be a lot more
storks flying over the Middle East. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Nine love letters that are to be sold at auction in
New York later this month reveal a liaison that took place between
Albert Einstein and a married Russian woman in the United States in
the closing months of World War II that may have been a good deal
more dangerous than the physicist ever realized at the time.
</P>
<P>
   All the letters were written by Einstein, the father of the
theory of relativity, to Margarita Konenkova between 1945 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   They have been passed on to Sotheby's, the auction house, by an
unnamed relative of Konenkova. With other mementoes of the affair,
they will be sold on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   The missives reveal a man smitten with a woman who at the time
was married to the Russian sculptor, Sergei Konenkov. She had
apparently also had had an affair with Sergei Rachmaninov. Whether
the relationship began before or after the death in 1936 of
Einstein's second wife, Elsa, is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Much more likely to stir fascination in the sale, however, are
suggestions that Konenkova was a Russian spy and that introducing
Einstein to Soviet diplomats in New York was part of her mission.
</P>
<P>
   Konenkova's secret side was, according to the New York Times,
uncovered first by Paul Needham, a consultant to Sotheby's. Needham
stumbled on references to her in a 1995 book written by Soviet
spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov and his son Anatoly, called ``Special
Tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   Konenkova, the book suggests, had been directed by Moscow to pay
special attention to the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer at a secret
installation in the New Mexico desert called Los Alamos, the
Manhattan Project was the cradle of America's atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Special Tasks,'' Konenkova was supposed to
``influence Oppenheimer and other prominent American scientists who
she frequently met at Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University was home at the time to Einstein. It is
known that she succeeded in introducing Einstein to the Soviet
consul in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in Einstein's letters, all written in German,
to suggest that the author had any notion of Konenkova's role as a
spy. And since Einstein had no direct role in the Manhattan
Project, it seems improbable that he could have helped, consciously
or otherwise, in Moscow's effort to build its own bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letters reveal a soppy side to Einstein that has
barely been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   In one, dated Nov. 27, 1945, he writes: ``Just recently I washed
my head by myself, but not with the greatest success; I am not as
careful as you are. But everything here reminds me of you:
`Almar's' shawl, the dictionaries, the wonderful pipe that we
thought was gone, and really all the many little things in my
hermit's cell; and also the lonely nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almar,'' it is supposed, is an elision of the first names
Albert and Margarita. &QL;

<P>
   Headed by scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer at a secret
installation in the New Mexico desert called Los Alamos, the
Manhattan Project was the cradle of America's atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Special Tasks,'' Konenkova was supposed to
``influence Oppenheimer and other prominent American scientists who
she frequently met at Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University was home at the time to Einstein. It is
known that she succeeded in introducing Einstein to the Soviet
consul in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in Einstein's letters, all written in German,
to suggest that the author had any notion of Konenkova's role as a
spy. And since Einstein had no direct role in the Manhattan
Project, it seems improbable that he could have helped, consciously
or otherwise, in Moscow's effort to build its own bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letters reveal a soppy side to Einstein that has
barely been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   In one, dated Nov. 27, 1945, he writes: ``Just recently I washed
my head by myself, but not with the greatest success; I am not as
careful as you are. But everything here reminds me of you:
`Almar's' shawl, the dictionaries, the wonderful pipe that we
thought was gone, and really all the many little things in my
hermit's cell; and also the lonely nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almar,'' it is supposed, is an elision of the first names
Albert and Margarita. &QL;

   DELHI _ With the detonation of two more nuclear devices in
Baluchistan Saturday, Pakistan's declared number of tests is now
seven _ two more than India's this year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand of my Karachi taxi driver two weeks ago for ``six
tamashas'' (dazzling exhibitions) to outdo India's five was thus
gloriously fulfilled, and the ferocious sibling rivalry between the
world's two newest nuclear weapons states was acted out on the
biggest and most fearful stage of all.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan are not conventional enemies, militarily or
in any other sense. A sort of malignant magic seems to entwine the
two countries, tainting and poisoning their endeavors, shackling
them to one another, hobbling their destinies, forcing them
endlessly into confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Never better than cool, their relationship is more tortured than
comparable enmities _ North and South Korea, East and West Germany
_ across borders of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is the religious divide which led to the
creation of Pakistan. The ghosts of the hundreds of thousands on
both sides who died during the Partition that brought the two
states into existence half a century ago seem to haunt them still.
</P>
<P>
   After India conducted its nuclear tests, Pakistan followed suit
as quickly as possible. That much was predictable: the neighbors
have, after all, fought three wars in the past 50 years, all of
which Pakistan has lost.
</P>
<P>
   But less readily understandable was Pakistan's need to outdo
India. And just as shocking to the outside world was the popular
excitement and enthusiasm that the tests generated in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, as in Delhi two weeks ago, people were dancing in
the streets, letting off firecrackers and handing out round ladoos,
traditional sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners, myself included, were aghast. How could such
horrendous events be greeted with the mad glee of a victory at
cricket?
</P>
<P>
   I settled on ignorance as the likely explanation: the common
people simply didn't know how vile these weapons were. But even
well-educated people manifested the same sort of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the vileness contributed to the glee. The people were
deeply glad that India had got in such a low blow to their bitter
enemy. Pakistanis were deeply glad that Pakistan had got in a low
blow back.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea as in Germany, Cold War real politik drew cruel,
arbitrary lines through real countries, cutting families in pieces,
destroying lives and communities.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Pakistan was similarly cruel and arbitrary, but
because it derived in part from the will of the inhabitants, not
the dictates of superpowers, its aftermath has been infinitely more
neurotic and convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   At places along the Line of Control, the cease-fire line that
divides the state of Jammu and Kashmir, only 60 feet divide the
Indian and Pakastini troops, who have been eyeball to eyeball for
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day people get shot and killed by one side or the
other, but in 49 years, that line has not moved one inch.
</P>
<P>
   At Wagah, the border post in Punjab, the lowering of the Indian
and Pakistani flags each day is accompanied by an elaborately
orchestrated frenzy of stamping and goose-stepping and glaring by
soldiers of the two sides, a sort of spastic, formalized cockfight,
a vicious ballet of hostility. Of course it could not have been
choreographed without their intimate cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same border post each Aug. 14 for the past few years, on
the eve of the anniversary of both countries' independence, a
hundred or more Indian peaceniks troop as close to the border as
they can get, to sing songs of friendship and conciliation to the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is that an equivalent group arrives at the other side
at the same time, and together they sing of the hopes of dissolving
the barriers that divide them. But it never seems to work out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani side fails to show up, or the no-man's-land in
between is too wide and the voices do not carry, or the guards
break the gathering up. In 50 years, the sane and sensible desire
to come together and clasp hands has gained very little momentum.
</P>
<P>
   One persuasive view of the relationship _ and it's not the
monopoly of Indians _ is that Pakistan was just a ghastly mistake.
In Lahore last week a senior Pakistani journalist spelled it out to
me very clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he said, ``the British should never have come
to India. But seeing as you did come, you shouldn't have left so
quickly. If, instead of rushing off in 1947, you had stayed for
another 20 years, things might have been very different.''
Pakistan, for a start, might never have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Large areas both in the northwest and the east of British India
had Muslim majorities.
</P>
<P>
   During the decades of struggle for freedom, tensions between
Muslim and Hindu leaders within the freedom movement led to demands
for a measure of autonomy within free India for these regions. But
the demand for a wholly independent state only gathered force as
late as 1940.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations leading to independence unfolded, Lord
Mountbatten tried hard to persuade the Muslim side that they should
throw in their lot with a united India. But the Muslim leader
Mohammad Ali Jinnah's position hardened, and with its self-imposed
deadline of 15 August 1947, Britain had little room for maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was composed of all the Muslim majority regions in both
the northwest (West Pakistan) and the east (East Pakistan) The
borders between the new, bifurcated state and India were drawn up
by in furious haste by the British lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   As preparations for the inauguration of the two fresh-minted
countries went ahead, it was assumed that their creation would be
pacific, the borders themselves porous, and that comings and goings
between them would be unhindered. No one expected the baptism of
blood that transpired.
</P>
<P>
   As the new borders became known, the first great disaster of the
postwar era got under way, as hundreds of thousands of people were
massacred, and millions more fled their homes to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one million people died, and 12 million were uprooted.
It was an ominous beginning. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,050. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   From the start, Pakistan's identity was disturbingly
one-dimensional: as the only artificially created Islamic state in
history, exaggerated Islamic piety became its hallmark, and
Pakistani governments have long been vulnerable to the shrill
demands of religious extremists.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three weeks it has inevitably been the minority
religious parties that have been clamoring most vociferously for
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   With its vastly greater size, wealth, and cultural and religious
variety, India should have a far more mature and confident
political persona than Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of poor economic performance and internal political
strife, and the chronic fear that the state might disintegrate into
Pakistan-like chunks, have sapped the self-confidence that India
projected under Nehru.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indian Prime Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, complained
recently that he had sought to steer India away from perennially
defining itself in terms of its rivalry with Pakistan, but that the
nuclear tests had revived old habits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hindu nationalists are in power, and their chauvinism
and paranoia mirrors that of Pakistan. Locked in mortal combat, the
two fearsome siblings are on the lip of disaster. &QL;

<P>
   DELHI _ With the detonation of two more nuclear devices in
Baluchistan Saturday, Pakistan's declared number of tests is now
seven _ two more than India's this year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand of my Karachi taxi driver two weeks ago for ``six
tamashas'' (dazzling exhibitions) to outdo India's five was thus
gloriously fulfilled, and the ferocious sibling rivalry between the
world's two newest nuclear weapons states was acted out on the
biggest and most fearful stage of all.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan are not conventional enemies, militarily or
in any other sense. A sort of malignant magic seems to entwine the
two countries, tainting and poisoning their endeavors, shackling
them to one another, hobbling their destinies, forcing them
endlessly into confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Never better than cool, their relationship is more tortured than
comparable enmities _ North and South Korea, East and West Germany
_ across borders of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is the religious divide which led to the
creation of Pakistan. The ghosts of the hundreds of thousands on
both sides who died during the Partition that brought the two
states into existence half a century ago seem to haunt them still.
</P>
<P>
   After India conducted its nuclear tests, Pakistan followed suit
as quickly as possible. That much was predictable: the neighbors
have, after all, fought three wars in the past 50 years, all of
which Pakistan has lost.
</P>
<P>
   But less readily understandable was Pakistan's need to outdo
India. And just as shocking to the outside world was the popular
excitement and enthusiasm that the tests generated in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, as in Delhi two weeks ago, people were dancing in
the streets, letting off firecrackers and handing out round ladoos,
traditional sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners, myself included, were aghast. How could such
horrendous events be greeted with the mad glee of a victory at
cricket?
</P>
<P>
   I settled on ignorance as the likely explanation: the common
people simply didn't know how vile these weapons were. But even
well-educated people manifested the same sort of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the vileness contributed to the glee. The people were
deeply glad that India had got in such a low blow to their bitter
enemy. Pakistanis were deeply glad that Pakistan had got in a low
blow back.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea as in Germany, Cold War real politik drew cruel,
arbitrary lines through real countries, cutting families in pieces,
destroying lives and communities.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Pakistan was similarly cruel and arbitrary, but
because it derived in part from the will of the inhabitants, not
the dictates of superpowers, its aftermath has been infinitely more
neurotic and convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   At places along the Line of Control, the cease-fire line that
divides the state of Jammu and Kashmir, only 60 feet divide the
Indian and Pakastini troops, who have been eyeball to eyeball for
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day people get shot and killed by one side or the
other, but in 49 years, that line has not moved one inch.
</P>
<P>
   At Wagah, the border post in Punjab, the lowering of the Indian
and Pakistani flags each day is accompanied by an elaborately
orchestrated frenzy of stamping and goose-stepping and glaring by
soldiers of the two sides, a sort of spastic, formalized cockfight,
a vicious ballet of hostility. Of course it could not have been
choreographed without their intimate cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same border post each Aug. 14 for the past few years, on
the eve of the anniversary of both countries' independence, a
hundred or more Indian peaceniks troop as close to the border as
they can get, to sing songs of friendship and conciliation to the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is that an equivalent group arrives at the other side
at the same time, and together they sing of the hopes of dissolving
the barriers that divide them. But it never seems to work out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani side fails to show up, or the no-man's-land in
between is too wide and the voices do not carry, or the guards
break the gathering up. In 50 years, the sane and sensible desire
to come together and clasp hands has gained very little momentum.
</P>
<P>
   One persuasive view of the relationship _ and it's not the
monopoly of Indians _ is that Pakistan was just a ghastly mistake.
In Lahore last week a senior Pakistani journalist spelled it out to
me very clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he said, ``the British should never have come
to India. But seeing as you did come, you shouldn't have left so
quickly. If, instead of rushing off in 1947, you had stayed for
another 20 years, things might have been very different.''
Pakistan, for a start, might never have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Large areas both in the northwest and the east of British India
had Muslim majorities.
</P>
<P>
   During the decades of struggle for freedom, tensions between
Muslim and Hindu leaders within the freedom movement led to demands
for a measure of autonomy within free India for these regions. But
the demand for a wholly independent state only gathered force as
late as 1940.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations leading to independence unfolded, Lord
Mountbatten tried hard to persuade the Muslim side that they should
throw in their lot with a united India. But the Muslim leader
Mohammad Ali Jinnah's position hardened, and with its self-imposed
deadline of 15 August 1947, Britain had little room for maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was composed of all the Muslim majority regions in both
the northwest (West Pakistan) and the east (East Pakistan) The
borders between the new, bifurcated state and India were drawn up
by in furious haste by the British lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   As preparations for the inauguration of the two fresh-minted
countries went ahead, it was assumed that their creation would be
pacific, the borders themselves porous, and that comings and goings
between them would be unhindered. No one expected the baptism of
blood that transpired.
</P>
<P>
   As the new borders became known, the first great disaster of the
postwar era got under way, as hundreds of thousands of people were
massacred, and millions more fled their homes to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one million people died, and 12 million were uprooted.
It was an ominous beginning. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,050. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   From the start, Pakistan's identity was disturbingly
one-dimensional: as the only artificially created Islamic state in
history, exaggerated Islamic piety became its hallmark, and
Pakistani governments have long been vulnerable to the shrill
demands of religious extremists.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three weeks it has inevitably been the minority
religious parties that have been clamoring most vociferously for
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   With its vastly greater size, wealth, and cultural and religious
variety, India should have a far more mature and confident
political persona than Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of poor economic performance and internal political
strife, and the chronic fear that the state might disintegrate into
Pakistan-like chunks, have sapped the self-confidence that India
projected under Nehru.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indian Prime Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, complained
recently that he had sought to steer India away from perennially
defining itself in terms of its rivalry with Pakistan, but that the
nuclear tests had revived old habits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hindu nationalists are in power, and their chauvinism
and paranoia mirrors that of Pakistan. Locked in mortal combat, the
two fearsome siblings are on the lip of disaster. &QL;

   DELTA-BRAZIL _ Delta Air Lines is being asked to buy a chunk of
Transbrasil, its marketing partner in Brazil. Transbrasil
apparently needs cash amid fare wars that followed deregulation of
Brazil's industry. Delta, which bought 35 percent of AeroPeru in
March, declined comment but acknowledged its code-share partnership
with Transbrasil is important to its own service. (Thurston,

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe, roughly a

   TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. The publicity about the
company's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping
sales. After all, most home users will figure a program that
attracts so many headlines must be danged important. So my job
today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first
month or so. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED

<P>
   CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _
use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a
much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
Take fishing, for instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites
that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about
the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as
well. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MACREPORT02 _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than
wooing software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who
will make or break this computer. With useful, entertaining and
progressive software, the Mac will thrive again. It won't matter
how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the
platform. Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted
suitor, all dressed up with nowhere to go. (Haddad, Atlanta

   TECHREPORT02 _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack
of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for,
pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to
just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing? You can,
if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player.
(Kannell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

<P>
   TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy
computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an
excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes
much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the
nine CDs that come with the deluxe version. (Warner, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   MARKET-TECHNICIANS02 _ Score one for the technicians. These are
the stock market wizards who practice technical analysis, an
approach based on the idea that supply and demand explain the price
movements of a stock or the entire market. Technicians look at
factors that can be quantified, such as volume, the number of new
highs and new lows, price-to-earnings ratios, 200-day moving
averages and a host of others. (Walker, Atlanta

   CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct
mail and telemarketing lists? There are many ways, easy ways, to
get on the lists. To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so
simple. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-COLUMN _ For many people, the most frustrating part of
vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price.
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians, when
we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs, it's not unlike
trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science.
Normally, I feel confident about automotive topics, but a recent
experience proved that under some circumstances, I can be just as
lost at the repair shop as the next guy. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade
association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of
the cost of college tuition. But a second look shows that we
actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just
tuition _ of a year in college. The American Council on Education's
study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages
$3,111. In a telephone poll, respondents guessed an average of
$9,694. That guess is not far off from the total cost, including
tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069. (Ezell,

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They call them the Righteous Brothers. James
Dobson, Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new
conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After some years in the political wilderness, America's
religious right is back.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken
them for granted, led them down the garden path and given nothing
back in return.
</P>
<P>
   They want an end to abortion, gay rights and gun control, and
their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up
for elections.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Britain's Labour Party of the early 1980s crossed with
the schisms of the early Church, and you're close.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, 62, is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Bauer, 51, a former Reagan Administration official, heads the
Family Research Council. Ashcroft, 56, is a senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in
America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years.
But they feel that the party _ Reagan included _ scorned them,
refusing to adopt their key demands, and that the Republican
party's candidate in the 1996 Presidential race, Robert Dole,
betrayed the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want to put things right, in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that religion is on the march in America; church
attendance are down over the last decade. But there is a community
within a community _ what conservative thinker William Kristol
calls a ``parallel universe'' _ a flourishing world of radio
stations, syndicated columns and newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   It intersects with the political universe when candidates are
being nominated, and small groups of highly motivated individuals
can be very influential.
</P>
<P>
   The Righteous Brothers have money, and they have an audience.
Bauer's Political Action Committee, the Campaign for Working
Families, has raised $3.7 million in contributions in a year.
Nearly 6 million people listen to Dobson's radio show every day;
millions more have bought his books.
</P>
<P>
   All three are astute, confrontational and uncompromising figures
who know how to promote themselves and their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you can't legislate morality,'' says Ashcroft.
``Well, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has made them important is, in some ways, the weakness
of the conservative Christian leadership. Pat Robertson, its star
in the 1980s, has been in eclipse for years. His Christian
Coalition, once the moving force behind the religious right, lost
influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum,
with a brisk, family-oriented, authoritarian moralism.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to
Discipline, a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of
hand. And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the
Republican Party: the smack of firm government.
</P>
<P>
   At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year, Dobson
publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party
altogether unless it started adopting his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had to listen: since his demarche, the
quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, has veered towards the trio's positions and taken a much
harder stand on morality questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety amongst the official Republican
political class to see that these guys are aboard,'' says Mark
Silk, director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Political
Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern about people like Dobson and Bauer is not an
interest in what they can do positively, it is the fear of what
they can do negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Influence behind the scenes is not enough, however: Bauer and
Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a
presidential candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ashcroft, with plenty of on-the-stump experience, is
more likely, and could be one of three or four Republicans with a
serious shot at the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But his righteous partners are already having a political
impact, backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year's
Congressional races with their words and their cash, which in turn
has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular
as ever, but the Republicans could still have expected a good
showing in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right, however, is causing near-civil war in some
of their key campaigns. While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have
not been that successful, they have driven wedges into cracks that
were already opening up within the Right.
</P>
<P>
   Their most notable victory was a primary for a special
Congressional election in California, where their candidate beat a
moderate for the Republican nomination, only to be trounced later
by the Democrat. Ironically, Reagan's home is in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it
increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives, and
the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and
the moderates is on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free
market than in morality, and have sparked angry words from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the Republican leadership to abandon their plans to
follow Bauer and Dobson to sure electoral defeat and instead
develop a message to the fiscal conservative voters who dominate
the center of the American electorate,'' wrote Mark Miller of the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a trenchant analysis of the party's ills in the Atlantic
Monthly, Christopher Caldwell, a conservative, argues that the

   DELTA-BRAZIL _ Delta Air Lines is being asked to buy a chunk of
Transbrasil, its marketing partner in Brazil. Transbrasil
apparently needs cash amid fare wars that followed deregulation of
Brazil's industry. Delta, which bought 35 percent of AeroPeru in
March, declined comment but acknowledged its code-share partnership
with Transbrasil is important to its own service. (Thurston,

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe, roughly a

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. The publicity about the
company's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping
sales. After all, most home users will figure a program that
attracts so many headlines must be danged important. So my job
today is to urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first
month or so. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE02 _ Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _
use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a
much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
Take fishing, for instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites
that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about
the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as
well. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

<P>
   MACREPORT02 _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than
wooing software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who
will make or break this computer. With useful, entertaining and
progressive software, the Mac will thrive again. It won't matter
how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the
platform. Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted
suitor, all dressed up with nowhere to go. (Haddad, Atlanta

<P>
   TECHREPORT02 _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack
of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for,
pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to
just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing? You can,
if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player.
(Kannell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

<P>
   TECHTOOLS-COLUMN02 _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy
computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an
excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes
much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the
nine CDs that come with the deluxe version. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-TECHNICIANS02 _ Score one for the technicians. These are
the stock market wizards who practice technical analysis, an
approach based on the idea that supply and demand explain the price
movements of a stock or the entire market. Technicians look at
factors that can be quantified, such as volume, the number of new
highs and new lows, price-to-earnings ratios, 200-day moving
averages and a host of others. (Walker, Atlanta

   CONSUMERWATCH _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct
mail and telemarketing lists? There are many ways, easy ways, to
get on the lists. To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so
simple. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-COLUMN _ For many people, the most frustrating part of
vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price.
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians, when
we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs, it's not unlike
trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science.
Normally, I feel confident about automotive topics, but a recent
experience proved that under some circumstances, I can be just as
lost at the repair shop as the next guy. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED

<P>
   MONEYTALK02 _ A report last week from an educational trade
association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of
the cost of college tuition. But a second look shows that we
actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just
tuition _ of a year in college. The American Council on Education's
study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages
$3,111. In a telephone poll, respondents guessed an average of
$9,694. That guess is not far off from the total cost, including
tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069. (Ezell,

   WASHINGTON _ They call them the Righteous Brothers. James
Dobson, Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new
conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After some years in the political wilderness, America's
religious right is back.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken
them for granted, led them down the garden path and given nothing
back in return.
</P>
<P>
   They want an end to abortion, gay rights and gun control, and
their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up
for elections.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Britain's Labour Party of the early 1980s crossed with
the schisms of the early Church, and you're close.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, 62, is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Bauer, 51, a former Reagan Administration official, heads the
Family Research Council. Ashcroft, 56, is a senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in
America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years.
But they feel that the party _ Reagan included _ scorned them,
refusing to adopt their key demands, and that the Republican
party's candidate in the 1996 Presidential race, Robert Dole,
betrayed the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want to put things right, in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that religion is on the march in America; church
attendance are down over the last decade. But there is a community
within a community _ what conservative thinker William Kristol
calls a ``parallel universe'' _ a flourishing world of radio
stations, syndicated columns and newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   It intersects with the political universe when candidates are
being nominated, and small groups of highly motivated individuals
can be very influential.
</P>
<P>
   The Righteous Brothers have money, and they have an audience.
Bauer's Political Action Committee, the Campaign for Working
Families, has raised $3.7 million in contributions in a year.
Nearly 6 million people listen to Dobson's radio show every day;
millions more have bought his books.
</P>
<P>
   All three are astute, confrontational and uncompromising figures
who know how to promote themselves and their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you can't legislate morality,'' says Ashcroft.
``Well, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has made them important is, in some ways, the weakness
of the conservative Christian leadership. Pat Robertson, its star
in the 1980s, has been in eclipse for years. His Christian
Coalition, once the moving force behind the religious right, lost
influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum,
with a brisk, family-oriented, authoritarian moralism.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to
Discipline, a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of
hand. And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the
Republican Party: the smack of firm government.
</P>
<P>
   At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year, Dobson
publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party
altogether unless it started adopting his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have had to listen: since his demarche, the
quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, has veered towards the trio's positions and taken a much
harder stand on morality questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety amongst the official Republican
political class to see that these guys are aboard,'' says Mark
Silk, director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Political
Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern about people like Dobson and Bauer is not an
interest in what they can do positively, it is the fear of what
they can do negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Influence behind the scenes is not enough, however: Bauer and
Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a
presidential candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ashcroft, with plenty of on-the-stump experience, is
more likely, and could be one of three or four Republicans with a
serious shot at the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But his righteous partners are already having a political
impact, backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year's
Congressional races with their words and their cash, which in turn
has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular
as ever, but the Republicans could still have expected a good
showing in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right, however, is causing near-civil war in some
of their key campaigns. While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have
not been that successful, they have driven wedges into cracks that
were already opening up within the Right.
</P>
<P>
   Their most notable victory was a primary for a special
Congressional election in California, where their candidate beat a
moderate for the Republican nomination, only to be trounced later
by the Democrat. Ironically, Reagan's home is in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it
increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives, and
the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and
the moderates is on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free
market than in morality, and have sparked angry words from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the Republican leadership to abandon their plans to
follow Bauer and Dobson to sure electoral defeat and instead
develop a message to the fiscal conservative voters who dominate
the center of the American electorate,'' wrote Mark Miller of the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a trenchant analysis of the party's ills in the Atlantic
Monthly, Christopher Caldwell, a conservative, argues that the
party, caught between economic conservatives, the religious right
and its moderate wing, will tear itself apart. It is becoming
``obsolescent,'' he argues.
</P>
<P>
   How much does that bother Dobson or Bauer? ``I believe a
Republican meltdown is preferable to ... the present betrayal of
the moral agenda,'' wrote Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   His ally puts it more simply, saying: ``We are the party.'' &QL;

STOCK MARKET GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW DOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are in our late 40s and our main financial
goal is to retire in 12 years when our $85,000 mortgage is paid
off. We earn $65,000 combined, and have these savings: $70,000 in
stock IRAs to which we make the maximum allowed contributions,
$44,500 in eight taxable mutual fund accounts, mostly dominated by
stocks; $62,000 in blue-chip stocks, and $50,000 in a company
savings plan, with 80 percent of this in Textron stock. What would
you estimate the value of these investments in 12 years if no
contributions were made beyond fully funding the IRAs? Should I
sell some of the individual stocks, perhaps to pay down the
mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Sharon
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFanswer &LR; If we assume 10 percent average annual growthover that
time, you would have $800,287.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that while I believe 10 percent is reasonable for
long-term stock market growth, I'm not particularly happy with it
for the next 12 years. I've long thought it was time for the market
to take a rest, and the way things seem to be going that rest might
last for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, from the highs of the late 1960s, it took about a
decade for the Dow to return to those levels (although to be fair,
the Dow is a narrow measure, and those statistics don't include
dividends).
</P>
<P>
   The point is that it would be only prudent to consider average
returns of 8 percent over those 12 years, which would mean the
combined accounts would reach $649,039.
</P>
<P>
   What does all of this mean? If you have other retirement assets,
such as pensions, these would combine with Social Security to put
you in a pretty comfortable situation in retirement, whatever the
market does.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no pension, I suggest you keep plugging away _ to
the company savings plan and to the taxable fund accounts as well
as the IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   I have no major problem with the portfolio, which mainly
consists of solid large-cap funds. And selling off any of the
common stock likely won't cause pain on tax day.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you want to adopt a modest alternative plan to selling
stock to pay down the mortgage: redirecting all dividends from the
stock accounts to mortgage repayments.
</P>
<P>
   If you do that, however, it will reduce those growth
projections, which presume reinvestment of all returns. You should
probably continue to reinvest these dividends, not in more of the
common stock but in a balanced fund account such as the Vanguard
Wellington position you already hold, treating this as the first
step in a long series of moves designed to make the portfolio more
conservative and more yield-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Four years ago I opened a Uniform Gifts to Minors account for
my new great-grandson. Based on a recommendation from one of your
columns, I chose Vanguard Index Value fund. It has done well, as
you know. I now have a new great-granddaughter and wish to open a
similar account for her. Do you still recommend this fund?
</P>
<P>
   P.F., Chula Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFanswer &LR; Yes, and I think the numbers back me up.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Index Value was launched Nov. 2, 1992, and from that
time through April 30 it has averaged 21.98 percent annual total
returns. On the same day a sibling fund, Vanguard Index Growth, was
also launched, and its comparable record is 21.72 percent average
annual total returns.
</P>
<P>
   The two funds have complementary portfolios, with Index Value
holding the two-thirds of the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock with the
lowest price-to-book ratios, and Index Growth holding the remaining
issues.
</P>
<P>
   My distrust of the current market, of course, makes me favor
Index Value particularly.
</P>
<P>
   My assumption is that when stocks come under pressure, those
with the higher yields and the lower price-to-earnings ratios will
be relatively stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The last reports from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows an average
portfolio P/E of 21.4 for Index Value, compared with 32.1 for Index
Growth. Yields were 1.5 percent for Index Value and 0.9 percent for
Index Growth _ both puny, of course, but a good reason why the more
defensive Index Value is the better bet now.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, though, I should point out that Morningstar
gives Index Growth five stars, its top grade, while Index Value
wins only four, meaning above average; these ratings are entirely
statistical, and the bulk of the difference can probably be found
in those five-year comparative results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The smile, to tell the truth, is a little scary. Worn
fixedly by Josef Sommer in ``Labor Day,'' A.R. Gurney's new play at
the Manhattan Theater Club, it has a beleaguered, on-the-edge
quality, like that of a long-persecuted martyr who is finally about
to crack.
</P>
<P>
   A playwright who bears more than a passing resemblance to his
creator and who first appeared in Gurney's 1988 hit comedy, ``The
Cocktail Hour,'' Sommer's character smiles hard while quoting
sentimental passages from Dickens, enumerating the virtues of his
children and listening to a hot-shot young theater director tell
him frankly what's wrong with his latest play. The smile may be
part of an armor of willed benevolence for a man who has recently
been seriously ill, but you half expect this guy to pull a pistol
out of his well-worn khakis and start shooting anyone in his line
of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the sort happens, of course. This is the world of
Gurney, deft chronicler through 20-some plays of the vanishing
American species called WASP, and people don't do such things
there. The Land of Gurney is as circumscribed and rule-ridden as
that of Jane Austen; his characters may complain, but they
certainly don't ``act out,'' especially not in front of an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney has been criticized for the limitations of his plays'
subjects, and so, not surprisingly, has John, his alter ego in
``Labor Day.'' In this stiff and, by Gurney's standards, strangely
awkward comedy, which opened last night, those criticisms are
addressed at length. So is the dilemma of the writer who is torn
between life and art and who preys upon his own family for
material.
</P>
<P>
   John considers these issues, with his wife and children and with
a professional colleague, in a manner wedged between apology and
accusation. He lashes out wittily a couple of times, and on one
occasion erupts into full temper. Mostly, though, he is as
determinedly humble as Uriah Heep. And like the play in which he
appears, he seems hamstrung by self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney probably shouldn't listen to his critics. When he tries
to answer them, either directly or by expanding his thematic
horizons, his plays, which can be delightful, start to feel
uncomfortable and inauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtime,'' his modern-day sequel to ``The Merchant of
Venice,'' seen at the Manhattan Theater Club two seasons ago,
seriously misfired as a jaunty, wisecracking look at levels of
American ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day'' is so busy anticipating what might be said against
it that it never gets down to the business of creating full,
breathing characters. Though sparked by instances of Gurney's agile
wit, the evening, directed by Jack O'Brien, feels mostly like a
checklist of concepts, of ingredients that never merge into a
natural flow of life.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't true of the work to which ``Labor Day'' is a sequel
of sorts. In ``The Cocktail Hour,'' John visits his parents to seek
their approval for a play he has written more or less about them.
As Mom and Dad express their displeasure at the idea of such public
exposure, they make a sad and often witty case for the lives they
have led, embodied by the ritual of evening cocktails. The play
suffered from contrivance, but it gleamed with eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day'' finds John defending the world his parents
defended to him, trying to hold on to his ``own small circles of
civility'' in a turbulent age. He is also again in the position of
having his latest play, a self-portrait of the artist as an older
man, attacked. This time, his attackers are both the work's
subjects, his wife, Ellen (Joyce Van Patten), and his children,
Ralph (James Colby) and Ginny (Veanne Cox), and its director,
Dennis (Brooks Ashmanskas), who is gay, hip and well versed in the
political demands of institutional theater.

 NEW YORK: institutional theater.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Set in John's converted chicken coop of a studio (attractively
realized by Ralph Funicello) at his home in northwestern
Connecticut, the play chronicles the tail end of a Labor Day
weekend for which John's children and grandchildren have gathered.
Dennis breaks into this pastoral scene in a jangle of big-city
urgency, announcing that the Shuberts and the Seattle Repertory
Theater are both interested in John's new script. The only problem
is the play's ending.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the play-within-the-play finds its John-like
hero retreating to the bosom of his beloved family. Dennis wants
John's character to break out into the larger world, preferably in
the name of engagement with an idealistic cause. This allows Gurney
to joust gently with some of the bugaboos of political correctness
explored by Jonathan Reynolds in ``Stonewall Jackson's House.''
</P>
<P>
   John winces (quite rightly) at the idea of ``closure,'' and in
response to Dennis' proposed alternative ending, which could
involve either Rwanda or the Pacific Rim, he answers testily, ``And
I'll top it all off with a profoundly moving speech about the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the wry but affectionate Ellen is worried that
John will humiliate their children by portraying them onstage, even
as she expresses the wish that John would be more honest in
depicting her relationship with him. Ralph, a connoisseur of action
films, questions the very raison d'etre of his father's talky brand
of theater. There are throughout such Pirandelloesque lines as:
``You and me, standing around, setting the scene. It's like the
beginning of one of his plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its pre-emptive self-awareness, ``Labor Day'' keeps
popping in elements that might have come from a generic Gurney play
kit, most notably a romantic entanglement that triggers the
denouement and is reminiscent of Lady Chatterly-like situations
discussed in both his early ``Children'' and ``The Cocktail Hour.''
And John's big speech about civilized values feels like a rote
retread of similar declarations from previous plays.
</P>
<P>
   Both John and Gurney, being open-minded, polite fellows, give
full weight to all sides of the arguments in the play. Even as
``Labor Day'' makes fun of Dennis' theatrical trendiness, it
acknowledges that such trends do reflect real changes in society
and even close to home. John, it makes clear, is not without his
delusions. It also suggests that his latest work does indeed
oversimplify its characters.
</P>
<P>
   So does ``Labor Day.'' O'Brien's direction is nimble enough, as
are the performances, although Sommer's ticking time bomb
interpretation gives the play a slightly sinister quality it can't
support. It's always a pleasure to see Ms. Cox and Ms. Van Patten;
and Colby and Ashmanskas don't overplay their characters' opposite
versions of masculinity. But there's never any convincing emotional
urgency to these people or the sense, finally, that much is at
stake for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is dangerous; he can hurt,'' says Ellen of her
husband. Well, not on the evidence of ``Labor Day.'' Still, for the
Manhattan Theater Club, coming off a week of highly fraught
publicity surrounding Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi,'' the
relative toothlessness of Gurney's latest work may be a comfort.

ILLNESSES FROM EATING S.F. BAY AREA OYSTERS IMPERILS LOCAL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Calif. _ Tomales Bay oyster farmers who have earned a
national reputation for their sweet morsels say that an outbreak of
illness traced to oysters from their beds imperils their market
niche and perhaps even their survival.
</P>
<P>
   The number of documented cases of illness attributable to eating
Tomales Bay oysters early this month has hit 110, and the mystery
lingers: What contaminated the succulent bivalve mollusks in one of
the cleanest bodies of water on either coast?
</P>
<P>
   More than three weeks after the first case was reported, state
health officials still don't know, and until they do, the
harvesting of Tomales Bay oysters, which have graced the menus of
the West's finest restaurants, is suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frankly at the point where we're looking at survival. We
have to figure out ways of making it work, and I haven't figured it
out yet,'' said Drew Alden, owner of Tomales Bay Oysters, which has
been in business since 1909.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very frustrating,'' agreed Terry Sawyer, a co-owner of
Hog Island Oyster Co. He said he hopes state health investigators
find ``a smoking gun. Our reputation is based on quality, and
having people get sick hits us hard. ... Some people say they can't
wait till we're back in business, but there are people who aren't
going to want to eat oysters ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Local markets and restaurants that relied on Tomales Bay oyster
farmers are turning to other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a California oyster in more than two weeks,''
said Steve Sancimino of San Francisco's venerable Swan Oyster
Depot. ``We're getting them from Puget Sound and British
Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Tomales Bay farmers themselves are buying oysters from
the Northwest _ to resell to customers so they won't turn to other
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to carry on,'' said Hog Island co-owner Mike
Watchorn, grimacing as he unloaded bags of oysters trucked in fresh
overnight from Washington. ``These can't hold a candle to ours, but
we have to stay in business for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension catches the oyster farmers at the cusp of the
retail season. ``This is when we get rockin' and rollin', when
people start coming to West Marin and barbecuing oysters,'' said
Alden.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters feed by filtering whatever floats by and concentrating
it. They filter about a quart of fluid a day, consequently they're
the first indicator of toxins in seawater.
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of contaminant got into the beds of the Hog Island,
Point Reyes and Tomales Bay companies in early May and was passed
onto diners who ate raw or undercooked oysters. They complained of
diarrhea, cramps, vomiting, low-grade fever and chills. The
companies voluntarily recalled their oysters from restaurants,
retail outlets and distributors. All the oysters were off market
shelves by May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Tomales Bay oysters account for more than 80 percent of the
$2.5-million-a-year Marin County shellfish industry. The bay is
considered ideal because it's unusually free of industrial
contaminants; its mouth is so shallow that large, deep draft
vessels can't enter. And development along the bay is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The current harvest suspension is the longest in at least 15
years. Manure runoff from dairy farms in the hills east of the bay
is one possible source of contamination. To lessen that risk, the
State Department of Health Services prohibits oyster harvesting for
four to five days after any storm that drops one half to two thirds
of an inch of rain on the Marin coastal watershed.
</P>
<P>
   But the oysters that sickened people were harvested during a dry
period. ``We harvested during an `open' period, and that makes it
(the contamination) kind of mysterious. It had nothing to do with a
typical rainfall closure,'' said Martin Strain, owner of the Point
Reyes Oyster Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Werner, chief of the disease investigations section at the
state Department of Health Services, said the reported illness
could be caused either by a virus or bacteria. But ``we don't know
the specific etiology of the disease. ... Very few adequate studies
have been done.''

NOW IT'S IRISH-AMERICANS' TURN TO MOVE FORWARD FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The page that has been turned in Ireland now needs
to be turned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   May's astonishing ``Yes'' votes in the North and South,
ratifying April's miraculous peace agreement and empowering a new
majority that can relegate sectarian concepts of the republic and
its still-British North to the past, needs to spark a complimentary
transformation in this country. It can't happen as dramatically,
but America's 44 million citizens of Irish extraction need to
organize a critical mass capable of sustaining a future-centered
relationship between their country and the new Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans have done it well _ Italians, Greeks, Jews and,
increasingly, Asians, come to mind. Now it's the Irish-Americans'
turn to transcend traditional charity, culture, religion, and
knee-jerk republicanism, and mobilize a new generation ready to
support a grown-up relationship with a rapidly changing country.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, the short-term danger is that the parties
to the peace agreement will reconvene in a new Northern Ireland
assembly in late summer and gridlock over issues like prisoner
release and the turning over of arms and explosives. The analogy
would be with post-Dayton Agreement Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Over here, the danger is a loss of momentum. America's Irish
voice, to pick an absurdly extreme example, must not be that of the
ostriches in the organizations that flaunted their surly, quixotic
republicanism in full-page newspaper ads urging rejection of the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   My metaphor for the future can be found in donated space at a
law firm here, where the US-Ireland Alliance is taking shape under
the organizing leadership of an amazing bundle of energy and vision
_ Trina Vargo, until this month Senator Edward M. Kennedy's foreign
policy staff person and one of the heroes in the back-breaking
labors that went on in recent years to make a negotiated settlement
possible.
</P>
<P>
   What she is building is an American organization with support
from both sides of the ocean that will promote the US side of a new
relationship with the republic and the North.
</P>
<P>
   This means vigorous public education, deep involvement in policy
issues, and relentless promotion of new coalitions and joint
ventures here and there. It will be tax exempt for individual and
corporate donors, but not afraid to use the 20 percent of its
resources for lobbying that US law allows tax-exempts.
</P>
<P>
   A model that quickly comes to mind is the frequently powerful
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, with two important
differences. The alliance will not support political candidates,
and it is vital that it avoid the kind of identification with the
Likud movement in Israel that on occasion diminishes AIPACs impact.
Vargo's special interest in Ireland is peace, justice, and a new
economic future at both ends of the island with much more US
participation.
</P>
<P>
   She plans a public television program, dreams of a Rhodes
Scholar-like program for American students, and she can't wait to
take on immigration, trade, investment, and other issues. And,
above all, Vargo labors to release the untapped energies of those
unorganized 44 million people here, nearly half Protestant, and
nearly all inactive in Irish matters.
</P>
<P>
   In part to satisfy Senate ethics rules, her initial fund-raising
and organizing has been In Ireland, and it is revealing. Some of
the new powerhouses of the Irish Miracle are on board with
six-figure contributions, including the Doyle Hotel Group, the Elan
Corp., the Jefferson Smurfit Group, and Citywest, a major Dublin
business park. And her letterhead will have the names of big shots
North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vargo is starting in on the US side. Of course, her now
ex-boss is proudly aboard as is former Coca Cola CEO Don Keough and
Mutual of America. She'll take a hundred bucks or six figures
gratefully.
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, the alliance represents an essential shift of the
American Irish voice out of Congress. During the Troubles, a call
to the late Tip O'Neill or to Kennedy might suffice at a critical
moment. No longer, and Kennedy himself has been one of the first to
recognize this.
</P>
<P>
   Also as a metaphor, Trina Vargo herself is ideal. Her
grandfather came out of the chaos of Eastern Europe. She is Irish
on her mom's side (a Daugherty), but the roots go back to 18th
century Pennsylvania, and she doesn't know if they're North or
South, Catholic or Protestant. She was not into being Irish until
she started working for Kennedy. Now she makes Top 100
Irish-American lists because of her widely recognized role as a
player in the peace process. Most important, while she has a deep
respect for the past and the most intimate knowledge of it, Vargo
is not obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Her obsession is the future for Irish-Americans and for Ireland.
This concentration on new ideas, new links, new activism is the
next page to which a new generation of the 44 million needs to
turn. It promises to be a very exciting time.

 &HT;    Author talks about her new Civil War book, the 'Oprah hoopla'
and why she tossed out 900 pages
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in a season ripe with Civil War fiction, regular readers of
Kaye Gibbons may be surprised that the North Carolina writer's
newest novel has taken a turn toward the historical.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons, more noted for her contemporary family stories, has
just published ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon'' (Putnam,
$22.95), which begins in 1842 with protagonist Emma Garnet
chronicling her life at Seven Oaks, her father's Virginia
plantation. Emma's father is a tyrant who verbally abuses his wife
and six children. He treats the servants even worse, except for
Clarice, a strong woman who opens Emma's eyes to the brutality of
slavery. Emma escapes by marrying a Northern doctor, Dr. Quincy
Lowell, and moving to Raleigh. But what begins as a harmonious life
is soon shattered by the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War presents a bottomless bounty,'' Gibbons says.
``I've always been interested in crucibles of history and I love
research. So for a year and a half I sat on the sun porch of the
house and read and took notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons' interest in the Civil War was partly responsible for
the publication of ``Cold Mountain,'' Charles Frazier's
best-selling 1997 novel. She met Frazier in 1988 and learned he was
working on a book. When Frazier's wife took her the manuscript
several years later, Gibbons says, she called her agent about the
book and said ```This is going to be an extraordinary event. Fasten
your seat belts.''' She was right. Frazier's romantic odyssey about
a Civil War deserter has been on best-seller lists for nearly a
year.
</P>
<P>
   It took Gibbons three years to write her newest novel, and the
project presented special challenges. Last December, Oprah Winfrey
chose two of Gibbons' novels for her television book club and
thrust the writer into the national spotlight. As ``Ellen Foster''
(Vintage, $10) and ``A Virtuous Woman'' (Vintage, $10) soared up
best-seller lists after her TV appearance, Gibbons, 38, found that
fame came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oprah selection was a blessing,'' says Gibbons, but it
brought a barrage of mail and calls. One day the phone rang 65
times, she says. And Gibbons was having problems with ``On the
Occasion of My Last Afternoon.'' In January, she threw out 900
pages and started rewriting, determined to meet the publisher's
deadline on schedule this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pressure, not from the publisher, but from myself to
get it out as close to the Oprah hoopla as possible,'' Gibbons
says. ``I had a book but it wasn't a story. The research had taken
over. I would write a chapter just to get in an interesting detail.
It was boring, flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Sale, her editor at Putnam, agreed. ``When I saw it, I
said, `I don't think this is what you want to be doing.' Every page
was valuable because she was learning how to integrate the details
of the period, but she hadn't put any real live characters in it.
They were there, but they weren't feeling anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 weeks, Gibbons rewrote the entire book,
beginning each evening and working through the night. ``In the
book, Emma Garnet talks about livable chaos,'' Gibbons says. ``I
got that directly from my life in those months.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Gibbons' research was from primary sources such as
diaries, letters and vanity press books published by women after
the war. ``I stayed away from the revisionist, politically correct
books,'' she says. ``I didn't want my history regurgitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons says she was amazed at the resourcefulness and toughness
of the women in the 19th century. ``I knew about the high rate of
infant mortality, but when I started reading women's journals, I
was devastated by the constant loss that these women felt. I don't
think women now are capable of doing what women had to do back
then. I sit in my kitchen and I look at my microwave and my
stainless-steel coffee warmer. We live on easy street.''
</P>
<P>
   When her national book tour is over in July, Gibbons wants to
write a biography of her mother, a manic-depressive who committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons touched on her mother's death in ``Ellen Foster,'' her
critically acclaimed 1987 debut novel based on her traumatic
childhood. Growing up in poverty in a four-room frame house in
Rocky Mount, N.C., Gibbons was orphaned at 10. Diagnosed with
manic-depression, Gibbons at one time was taking 27 pills a day to
control her mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ellen Foster'' did not delve very deeply into her mother's
life, Gibbons says. ``That's why I'm interviewing relatives and
going over her medical records. I want to piece together her life
because I want to know my mother as a woman. It's become an
obsession. In the summers my mother always wore wide-brimmed straw
hats. A girl should know that about her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the book, she plans to take some time off. ``I
want to be Martha Stewart,'' says Gibbons, who lives in Raleigh
with her husband, Frank Ward, and her three daughters from a
previous marriage. ``I want to be a housewife. One who reads a lot,
takes naps in the afternoon. I want to clean out my underwear
drawer. Little things like that that I haven't been able to do. I
have probably 100 pairs of socks with no mates. I want to fix my
socks.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: You've gotta put f-u-n in vacation
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have determined that men and women define ``fun''
differently. (See last month's column on Viagra.) So it stands to
reason that ``vacation'' is also a disputed concept.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone takes vacations in the '90s. We don't even take
lunch. Vacation is for academics and the French, people who can
dally at the shore for months at a time. Our summer is a two-week
dash, jammed between camp and Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Since I spend most of my working days in a concrete box, I long
for a breath of air during my brief time off. A little walk in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   But backpacking is not Maureen's kind of leisure. She will walk
you to death in the city, but won't seek out a waterfall. She has
worn fellow travelers to a nub hiking the canyons of Manhattan, but
has yet to log significant mileage on the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   This summer we're going to New Hampshire. I'm hoping that my
plan for a modest, two-day jaunt in the White Mountains will tempt
the wife away from the tearooms and outlet malls. I have described
the scent of juniper and balsam in the air, the eerie world above
the tree line, fields of Alpine flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But I know what Maureen really wants is a week at the Safety
Harbor spa with her mom, aerobics every morning, a massage every
afternoon and low-fat gourmet meals every night.
</P>
<P>
   Come on. Where's the fun in that? Here's a compromise: an
aerobic hike up Mount Washington, an outdoor bath in a Jacuzzilike
glacial stream and a nutritious Snickers bar at night. Everybody
happy?
</P>
<P>
   COLUMN: But just be sure to spell it r-e-s-t
</P>
<P>
   By Maureen Downey
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Summer is great if you're a man. Time for soda and pretzels and
beer. Time to wonder where the children went.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a clue: They went to the five different summer camps that
your wife spent many woman-hours arranging. Surveys tell us that
men are assuming more responsibility for child care, but how many
men know that the city recreation programs were filled to the
waiting lists back in March?
</P>
<P>
   Summer, for women, is business as usual. That's why we don't
look for more pressure when it comes to our meager playtime. We
want less work, not more _ a little contrast with the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, we want to increase sleep, decrease stress and squeeze
in a bit of pampering.
</P>
<P>
   What does Bo want? He wants to scale large, unfriendly rocks
with a backpack full of fleece garments. He wants to rise at 6 to a
breakfast of glutinous oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that he enjoys communing with nature, but I think what
he really likes is shopping at REI, obsessing over boots and stitch
counts and such.
</P>
<P>
   I've found that the only way to calm him down from these
adventures is to remind him that Grandma Gatewood hiked the full
length of the Appalachian Trail outfitted only with an apple and a
pair of Keds high tops.
</P>
<P>
   Walking counts as my favorite pastime, but I need greater
motivation than the promise of a dry patch of ground and a handful
of gorp. Just point me in the direction of a good bakery or coffee
shop, and I'll march for miles.

 &HT;    Jim Carrey on another magazine cover, Bart Simpson in Time
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hollywood publicity machine is running full speed for Jim
Carrey. The rubber-faced comedian, who was on the cover of Time
last week, graces the covers of New York ($2.95) and Entertainment
Weekly ($2.50) this week. New York writer Chris Smith says Carrey
is the perfect actor for ``The Truman Show,'' a movie about a man
whose entire life has been a 30-year television soap opera. In real
life, pursued by paparazzi and inquiring reporters, Carrey says he
often feels like the movie character.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR FALLOUT: Newsweek ($2.95) examines the implications of
the nuclear weapons revival in Pakistan and India. Newsweek's
writers say the threat of warfare is real, but U.S. intervention
would be unlikely. Also: Evan Thomas reports on Robert Kennedy's
last campaign on the 30th anniversary of RFK's assassination and
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. speculates what the country would have been
like if Kennedy had survived. His conclusion: Vietnam would have
ended sooner and there would have been no Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   CULTURAL ICONS: In a list bound to spark debate, Time ($3.95)
picks the 20 most influential artists and entertainers of the
century. Among the greats are Pablo Picasso, Frank Sinatra, James
Joyce, The Beatles, Lucille Ball, Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein, Bob Dylan,
Charles Chaplin, Louis Armstrong, Aretha Franklin and Bart Simpson.
That's right, Bart Simpson. The underachiever who's been in the
fourth grade for 11 years has finally overachieved.
</P>
<P>
   CITIES THAT WORK: Once the federal government labeled it the
dirtiest city in America, but Chattanooga pulled itself up by its
bootstraps and is now enjoying a surprising renaissance, with a
lively riverfront, the Southeast's most popular aquarium and
children's museum, plus the world's largest fleet of eco-friendly
electric buses. The Tennessee River town is spotlighted by U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) as one of six ideal ``cities of
tomorrow'' _ the others being Minneapolis: Vancouver, British
Columbia; Tilburg, Netherlands; Curitiba, Brazil; and Melbourne,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   GEOIRGIA HERO: Jim Thomas, 69, is featured in this week's People
($2.79) for his heroic action in clearing a Dalton, Ga., carpet
factory worker of a 1997 child molestation conviction. Thomas, who
was Juror No. 7 in the case, was haunted by the thought that he had
helped convict an innocent man. So he hired an attorney to appeal
Wayne Cservak's case. The conviction was overturned and the key
witness in the case recanted his testimony. ``I just did what I
considered the right thing to do,'' Thomas says. Also of note is a
flattering profile of Julian Bond, who talks about his journey from
being a fiery member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee to becoming chairman of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   DEADLY HONEYMOONS: GQ ($3), thicker than ever, offers some meaty
material in the midst of glossy fashion ads. Writer-at-large Robert
Draper investigates the murder of a Filipina mail-order bride at
the hands of her husband and takes an in-depth look at other women
desperate to escape poor conditions in the Philippines. In a witty
essay, Anthony Giardina bemoans the fact that popular culture has
overemphasized the importance of parenthood. And a must-read for
married couples is Demorest, Ga., author Frank Gannon's humorous
piece titled ``Midnight in the Living Room of Good and Evil.'' The
premise: spouses who don't support other spouses, especially when
there is a moral dilemma about reporting free HBO to the cable
company.

 &HT;    Sinatra re-releases multiplying
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a group of re-released Frank Sinatra
albums now in stores, with a second wave set for Sept. 8 by Reprise
and Capitol Records. Now available in remastered fashion with the
original vinyl-album packaging replicated for CD packages are
``Sinatra at the Sands,'' ``Francis Albert Sinatra &AMP; Antonio Carlos
Jobim,'' ``September of My Years,'' ``Ring-A-Ding-Ding,'' ``Come
Dance With Me,'' ``Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely,'' ``In
the Wee Small Hours'' and ``Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!''
Preferences vary, but the title tune, ``It Was a Very Good Year''
and ``The Man in the Looking Glass'' make ``September of My Years''
_ a Grammy winner in '65 _ a superlative choice.

 &HT;    P's a master at raising an audience
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you're scanning Monday's results of the Top 10 movies at the
box office this past weekend. At the top is ``Godzilla.'' You've
probably heard of that.
</P>
<P>
   Down past the Robert Redford movie, five, six ...
</P>
<P>
   Six? ``I Got the Hook-Up''?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this new Hollywood assault on the English language?''
you ask. A month ago it was ``He Got Game.'' Now it's ``I Got the
Hook-Up''? And who is this Master P _ the movie's producer, writer
and star?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you were among those wondering about the movie and how
it debuted at No. 6 nationally and No. XX in Atlanta _ obviously
you're in need of a ``hook-up'' (meaning: a favor or special deal).
And here it is. Your Master P primer:
</P>
<P>
   -- Who is Master P: The entrepreneur who wrote, produced and
stars in the comedy about illegal cellular phone service. He's also
a rapper who will release his supposed final CD today, ``Da Last
Don,'' so he can concentrate on other business ventures such as
film and a clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   -- The P stands for: Percy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal info: The 28-year-old was born in New Orleans. He is
single.
</P>
<P>
   -- Professional background: He got into the music business as a
retailer, opening a No Limit Records store with a $10,000
malpractice settlement his family received. His 6-year-old No Limit
Record label includes his brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder,
TRU, Mia X, Mystikal, Fiend, Young Bleed, Sons of Funk and new
signee Snoop Doggy Dogg. It has sold more than $120 million in
records. Only Warner Bros. has more artists in pop music's Top 40.
</P>
<P>
   -- You know that's Master P on a record when: You hear his
signature grunt (``unngghhh'').
</P>
<P>
   -- In comparison to the other P man: Master P is bigger than
Puff Daddy right now. When Master P wanted a label, he started one
with his own money. When he wanted to get into film and couldn't
find a distributor, he released the million-selling ``I'm Bout It''
straight to video and retail outlets. ``Whenever somebody told me I
couldn't do something because of where I'm from, what color I am or
whatever, I've proven them wrong,'' he said.

   CLINTON-PRIVILEGE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to
limit his legal appeals to his assertion of attorney-client
privilege in the Monica Lewinsky matter could yield two advantages:
reducing the case to make it seem too minor for the Supreme Court
to take on an expedited schedule, and limiting questioning of Bruce
Lindsey, the Clinton confidant and director of damage control. Does
this mean that presidents will begin surrounding themselves with
aides with law degrees? (Malone, Cox News Service).

destroy tumors by freezing them. Branham's managed-care health
plan, CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio, refused to pay for the surgery. It
took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to
review Branham's appeal, even though its experts said the surgery
was an accepted medical technique. Branham's tumors, meanwhile,
doubled in size. And four months after her initial request for
coverage, she died. Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that
Branham's husband, Craig, has the right to sue CIGNA because a
company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and
therefore non-binding. (Jasper, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

agricultural methods, or can they afford to? Federal officials
assert that peasants encroaching on the rain forest are partly to
blame. But the peasants say there is no other way. (Harmon,

 AMERICA THE BOASTFUL  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (1,500 words) EDITORS: For the opposing view, see Mortimer
Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the
world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will
not record that the 21st century belonged to America.

Institute of Technology. &LR;

<P>
   &UR; AMERICANIZING ASIA? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DONALD K. EMMERSON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial
crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways. The Asian
economies holding up the best may be those with the most political
freedom, but the real key may be competent government. East Asia is
changing, but not Americanizing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Donald K. Emmerson is professor of political science at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison and editor of ``Indonesia Beyond
Suharto: Polity, Economy, Society,'' forthcoming in 1998. &LR;

<P>
   &UR; JAPAN IS IN DENIAL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By EDWARD J. LINCOLN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Tokyo's economic sluggishness is souring life at
home and setting off international reverberations. Scandal after
scandal exposes unethical or illegal behavior. Yet the impulse to
reform is weak, and those who believe Japan will adopt an American
economic model are mistaken.
</P>

   &UR; FRANCE IS IN A BAD MOOD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DOMINIQUE MOISI &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,450 words) The French always seem to be opposing the United
states on some issue or another. Why is France so difficult to deal
with? It is, quite simply, in a bad mood, unsure of its place and
status in a new world. The French are jealous of America, which
seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

stifling their homeland's economic growth by stealing from Russia

</P>
<P>
   Part II:  &UR; FROM DUMA FISTFIGHTS TO FIRINGS, RUSSIA ISN'T
DEMOCRATIC &LR;  _ As Boris Yeltsin's cabinet firings show, Russia's
system of checks and balances is underdeveloped, leaving the
country prone to the whims of a mercurial chief executive.
(slugged: BC-RUSSIA-NOT-DEMOCRATIC-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   Part III:  &UR; RUSSIA: WHAT IS TO BE DONE? &LR;  _ A new set of rules
must be established. The power of oil and gas tycoons must be
curtailed. The law making Duma members immune from prosecution
should be repealed. The large number of criminals running for Duma
seats to gain immunity is repulsive. (slugged:

   &UR; GLOBALIZATION and ITS DISCONTENTS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Richard Haas and Robert Litan &LR;  &QC;

<P>
   (2,800 words) The crises of globalization will be solved by
neither a super-IMF nor an unfettered market. This article

seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. In a recent staff meeting, the director of
purchasing reminded all of us that if our work hours are 7 a.m. to
4 p.m., we are to keep those hours. We are salaried employees but
were told that regardless of whether we come in an hour earlier to
catch up on work, we cannot leave any time before 4 p.m. However,
there are some employees who are ``exceptions'' to this rule, but
the director will not let me move my hours. What do you suggest I
do? S.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. The director is using a managerial philosophy from George
Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' in which all employees are equal, but some
are more equal than others. Unfortunately, when management demands
adherence to company rules and then allows certain ``exceptions,''
it is a sign of other managerial problems, including a lack of
trust, respect and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that management would be rigid about work hours in
an era that is typified by increased flexibility. More and more
companies are implementing flex-time programs and relying on a
philosophy that builds jobs around people rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   One step is for you and several of your associates to meet with
the director and your supervisor regarding the work hours. This is
not a complaint session, but rather a constructive discussion in
which you suggest an experiment with a flex-time program. Be
prepared to discuss the program's benefits, the specifics of how it
will work and how you will measure its success. Flex-time can truly
help a company's effectiveness, and so can flexible management. &QL; 
Q. One of my co-workers can get real obnoxious and make comments to
me that he thinks are cute, but they're not. I read that in this
type of situation, a person should act the same way right back at
the person and that will get the offensive comments to stop. Do you
agree? L.A. &QL; 
A. Comments that are obnoxious and supposedly cute actually sound
like harassment, and the last thing that is going to stop a
harasser is more harassment. If you want him to stop, you need to
be clear, firm and direct.
</P>
<P>
   By making some equally obnoxious comments in return, all you
will be doing is placing yourself in an escalating verbal joust.
Rather than stopping him, your volley will just encourage him to
try even harder to top you. In essence, you will be increasing the
unpleasant behavior, rather than decreasing it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you decide at some point to report the matter to your
manager, how will you feel when this person relates some of the
obnoxious comments that you made to him? He could even play victim.
</P>
<P>
   If someone is making these kinds of comments to you, the best
approach is to let the individual know your feelings about the
comments, be specific about the behavior that must be stopped, and
then add that you hope you will not have to take any further action
on this matter. The idea of using the same behavior as an obnoxious
co-worker has a catchy visual appeal, but it does not work. And, if
you do so, you might not work either.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been the marketing director for the past 10 years in a
family owned business that is still run by the 85-year-old founder.
I find that he is threatened by me and tries to sabotage my success
by withholding information, telling other people not to involve me,
and manipulating things that I bring in so that he does not have to
pay me. I am considering several actions, but I am not sure what to
do. G.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Threats, sabotage and manipulation are hardly the hallmarks
of a successful working relationship. However, while the founder's
behavior may be exactly as you describe, you also need to consider
his perceptions. Like many entrepreneurs, he may be having
difficulty letting go of the marketing reins, as he was most likely
the original marketing department. In addition, do you think he may
have some arguably solid reasons for the way he has been dealing
with you?
</P>
<P>
   The best initial action is to meet with him to discuss the
problem. Importantly, be sure to use your sales and marketing
skills during this meeting. For example, let him see the costs
associated with excluding you from any key processes, along with
the direct benefits that accrue to him and the company when you are
appropriately involved, informed and rewarded. Try to pace your
presentation to match his style, and be sure to use words that have
a strong emotional charge for entrepreneurs, such as profit,
achievement, growth, challenge and success. His reaction will help
you determine your next action.

     GINGRICH PAYS ANOTHER $50,000 TOWARD
ETHICS SANCTION
 &HT;     By MARK SHERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich made his second $50,000
payment Monday toward the $300,000 he owes taxpayers in connection
with his violation of House ethics rules last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who returned from a trip to the Middle East and Europe
on Monday, used personal funds, spokesman Andrew Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to pay another $50,000 on Nov. 30. The final
$150,000 is due Jan. 2, 1999, the last day of the 105th Congress.
Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to
lend Gingrich $150,000 for the last payment, but Gingrich has yet
to decide whether to take the loan, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The installment plan was the culmination of a lengthy
investigation by the House ethics committee into the partisan
political role of tax-exempt, not-for-profit organizations with
close ties to, or directly controlled by, Gingrich. Groups that are
exempt from taxes may not take part in partisan activities.
</P>
<P>
   With his speakership on the line, Gingrich eventually agreed to
admit that he violated ethics rules by providing false and
misleading statements to the committee about the involvement of
GOPAC, the political action committee he once led, in the
development of a college course he taught in Georgia. He also
acknowledged that he should have sought the advice of tax lawyers
about the financing of the course, which was widely broadcast, by
tax-exempt groups.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a reprimand from his colleagues in the House,
Gingrich agreed to a $300,000 sanction, roughly equal to the cost
of the investigative work that was required after the speaker
provided the false information to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty was extraordinary in that marked the first-ever
ethics punishment of a sitting speaker, but it was sufficiently
lenient that Gingrich could continue to serve as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In his report to the committee, James Cole, the lawyer hired by
the committee to lead the investigation, said, ``In addition, the
violation does not represent only a single instance of reckless
conduct. Rather over a number of years and in a number of
situations, Mr. Gingrich showed a disregard and lack of respect for
the standards of conduct that applied to his activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his recent book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,''
Gingrich blamed his lawyers for most of the problem, suggesting
that their sloppy work and his lack of attention to their work
accounted for his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was adamant that he would not agree to any kind
of fine. ``I flatly refused to accept any agreement that would
involve or impose a fine,'' he wrote. ``There is a sharp
distinction to be drawn between the principle of reimbursing the
House for expenses I had been the cause of and paying a penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   While final payment will mark the end of this ethics case, the
House ethics committee still has a pending complaint to resolve
involving Gingrich. The committee has yet to take action on
allegations Gingrich benefited from hundreds of thousands of
dollars in undisclosed, prohibited aid from GOPAC starting in 1990
re-election campaign and continuing perhaps until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether the
tax-exempt organizations violated their non-profit status by
helping fund political activities, including the speaker's college
course. The ethics committee did not reach a conclusion on that
issue, deciding instead to let the IRS investigate.

ONE FALSE NOTE IN THE LIFE OF JAZZ MUSICIAN TIPTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning of Jan. 21, 1989, Billy Tipton, 74, a gifted jazz
musician who was a veteran of the tiny clubs and VFW posts of
small-town America, collapsed on the floor of a mobile home in
Spokane, Wash. Tipton's son William summoned paramedics, and as
they opened Tipton's pajamas to perform resuscitation, they made an
extraordinary discovery. Tipton, who most people had assumed to be
a man, who had had at least five wives and had adopted three sons,
was in fact a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did your father ever have a sex change?'' the paramedics asked
William, he later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Tipton, a pianist and saxophonist, was a woman
came as a shock to nearly everyone, including the women who had
considered themselves his wives, as well as his sons and the
musicians who had traveled with him.
</P>
<P>
   And the story has intrigued writers and composers ever since.
The figure of Billy Tipton has become an emblem for the current
fascination with gender, manifest in films like ``The Crying
Game,'' the play ``M. Butterfly,'' and in the burgeoning academic
field of ``queer theory,'' which is entirely devoted to the subject
of sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   Tipton's life has inspired an opera, ``Billy,'' with music by
Timothy Brock and a libretto by Brian Willis; a play, ``Stevie
Wants to Play the Blues,'' by Eduardo Machado, and a jazz musical,
``The Slow Drag,'' by Carson Kreitzer, which was performed
off-Broadway in 1996. It was also featured in a theatrical revue,
``The Opposite Sex Is Neither,'' by Kate Bornstein, a woman who
used to be a man. In Seattle, a group of feminist jazz musicians
founded the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a biography, ``Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton,''
has been written by literary scholar Diane Middlebrook, a Stanford
University professor best known for her biography of the poet Anne
Sexton. That book was criticized in some circles for incorporating
transcripts of tape recordings of Sexton's sessions with her
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fascination of Tipton's story is in the window it
provides on the world of jazz in the '30s, '40s and '50s, when
popular tastes in music had been honed by radio, and jazz could be
found in almost every town in America. With a few exceptions, like
Hazel Scott, jazz was a man's world. Whether simply as a matter of
sexual choice or to get work in jazz, Tipton lived the life of a
man.
</P>
<P>
   She was an acute observer of male and female style, and such a
successful mimic, that she seems to have been able to deceive even
those with whom she had the most intimate contact. For Ms.
Middlebrook, Tipton was a case study in the essentially fluid
boundaries of human sexuality. The subject provided an opportunity
to explore the question of how much of what is called male and
female is the result of biology, and how much is the result of a
performance, acted according to cultural norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a great performer,'' Ms. Middlebrook said in a recent
interview. ``I don't think she thought she was born in the wrong
body. That's a contemporary narrative. She's not a lesbian, because
the women she was with didn't know she was female. She occupied an
undefinable space. She was someone who worked creatively in the gap
between biology and gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, of course, women have assumed male disguises
for economic and social reasons. During the Civil War, Ms.
Middlebrook notes, an estimated 400 cross-dressing women posed as
men and served in the Union Army. George Sand and Colette both wore
men's clothes. James Barry, a doctor who lived from 1795 to 1863,
and who is credited with performing the first successful Caesarean
section, was assumed to be a man until her death, when her true
identity was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Tipton literally became a poster boy for raising
consciousness about the confusion of sex (biological) and gender
(culturally meaningful physical and social attributes),'' Ms.
Middlebrook writes. ``Billy's story lets us watch one woman's bold
solutions to gaining a certain amount of recognition in what was
largely a man's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Tipton was born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma City
and grew up in Kansas City, Mo., a center of jazz. Dorothy came
from a prosperous family. Her father, George, was an aviator, and
her mother, Reggie, to whom she was close, was beautiful and
glamorous. Dorothy was musically talented and studied organ, piano
and saxophone in school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Middlebrook's interviews with members of Tipton's family
revealed that the cross-dressing began when Dorothy tried to find a
job as a jazz musician. Indeed, said Leslie Gourse, author of
``Madame Jazz,'' a book about female jazz musicians, ``There was an
unwritten code in the jazz world, that women just didn't get
hired.''
</P>
<P>
   To pass as a man, Dorothy bound her breasts with Ace bandages
and wore a prosthetic device. Later, she would tell people that she
wore the bandages because of a childhood accident in which her ribs
were broken. Tipton, who had a tenor voice, eventually joined a
group called the Banner Cavaliers, and obtained a Social Security
card as a man.

<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Early in her career, in late 1938, she played with Wayne Benson,
a bass player. ``She looked like a young boy,'' Benson said in an
interview. ``She was acting like a boy. No one said anything, but
as far as I was concerned, she was a woman. I was surprised by
their surprise when she died and they found out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Middlebrook's book is a glimpse into the mass culture of the
period. One of Tipton's first girlfriends was Non Earl Harrell, 14
years her senior and a star of the marathon dance contests popular
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, women found Tipton gentle, affectionate and
kind. And she in turn preferred women who were somewhat
self-involved. ``She chose people who don't pay attention to other
people,'' said Ms. Middlebrook. ``People who don't notice things.
She was also able to create a feeling of intimacy without
attracting notice.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Tipton met a shy, pretty 18-year-old, Betty Cox, and
they lived together as man and wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great performer,'' Ms. Cox said in a recent telephone
interview. ``He had a neat voice, and was very personable.'' They
had a sexual relationship, Ms. Cox said. But still, she said, she
didn't know Tipton was a woman. She came from a sheltered
background where sex was never discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women didn't go around undressed,'' said Ms. Cox. ``You wore a
robe. You didn't leave the lights on when you had sex.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she and Tipton tried to conceive a child, Ms. Cox
said, but she believed she had suffered a miscarriage. Ms. Cox
accompanied Tipton on the road, but she eventually tired of it, and
after seven years together, the two broke up. ``I wanted to go back
home; that was the end of it,'' said Ms. Cox, who went on to marry
and have five children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Tipton formed the Billy Tip Tipton Trio. As leader, she
slicked back her hair and wore a white dinner jacket. The group's
style was reminiscent of Benny Goodman's trio and quartet. It
played hits including ``Exactly Like You,'' ``All of Me,'' ``The
Way You Look Tonight'' and ``It's Only a Paper Moon'' and recorded
two albums, ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' and ``Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi
on Piano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he was a woman,'' said Kenny Richards, who
played bass and sang with the trio. ``I didn't know until he
died.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 Tipton had a chance to break into the big time when the
group was offered a recording contract and a gig opening for
Liberace in Reno, Nev., at more than double its usual fee. But
Tipton said no. One reason he turned down the chance, Ms.
Middlebrook theorizes, is that bigger exposure might have revealed
who Tipton truly was.
</P>
<P>
   Tipton settled in Spokane, Wash., continuing to play jazz, and
working as a booker in a theatrical agency. There he met Kitty
Kelly, a stripper known as ``the Irish Venus.'' In a letter to Ms.
Kelly, Tipton called her ``a wonderful person, decent and honest.''
In another, she wrote: ``I love you with everything that is in me,
and I only hope that I can make you happy for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly and Tipton settled down together. Now married and
known as Kitty Oakes, she said she never knew that Tipton was a
woman. Ms. Oakes said she had an illness that prevented her from
having a sexual relationship with Tipton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't share a room,'' she said.``I was taught to judge the
person head on, as they were. Billy was funny, gentle as a human
being. We liked the same kind of music. We liked each other.''
</P>
<P>
   And they both wanted children. They went on to adopt three boys,
John, Scott and William. By all accounts, Tipton was an ideal
father, a Scout master who loved to go on camping trips with his
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only father I ever knew,'' William said recently.
``He was there for us. He didn't go out and get drunk and beat on
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a close relationship. We would go to movies. It was
more like good buddies. We went out to dinner, or we just sat and
talked. It never occurred to me he was a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, it was a happy family, Ms. Oakes said. Tipton
once told her in a letter: ``You are instilled so deep in my heart
that you have become part of me. It would be difficult to imagine
life without you. In our seven years together we have seen much
hurt and much pain, both physical and mental, and we still cling to
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the boys reached adolescence, tensions began to emerge in
the marriage. Ms. Oakes said she felt that Tipton was not tough
enough on them. ``Billy, for whatever reason, couldn't, or
wouldn't, control them,'' she said. Finally, in 1981, the couple
separated, and the boys went to live with their father.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Tipton was suffering from arthritis, emphysema and
ulcers. What Ms. Middlebrook calls his ``lifelong trait of
avoidance'' had prevented him from going to a doctor. Death finally
came from a perforated ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   After he died, it was left to his family to unravel the mystery
of his life. ``I know he wanted to tell me,'' said Ms. Oakes. ``But
he couldn't say, `I'm tired, I'm old,''' and tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy did a great Houdini,'' Ms. Oakes said, then laughed.
``Instead of treating this as a grand deception, don't you think
it's funny?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Middlebrook writes: ``Billy demonstrated by her
accomplishment that gender, unlike sex, is in large part a
performance. She was the actor, he was the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her death, Tipton had discarded all her sex-concealing
gear, Ms. Middlebrook writes. ``Billy had prepared to emerge from
behind his screen like the Wizard of Oz, to dissolve the magic into
wisdom, revealing by her nakedness in death that `the difference'
between men and women is largely in the eye of the beholder.''

 McGWIRE FAST BECOMING A BASEBALL IMMORTAL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SOMMER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When it comes to baseball lore, Babe Ruth's
presence has loomed so large that he might just as well be one of
the gods on Mount Olympus. That has made the accomplishments of
Mark McGwire in recent years all the more astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   It can now be argued the veteran player has been hitting home
runs farther, and more frequently, than anyone who has come before
him, the Babe included. Indeed, it sounds like heresy to say it,
but the St. Louis Cardinals slugger may actually be hitting more
home runs of Ruthian proportions that the almighty Ruth himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where casually tossed around terms like
``superstar'' and even ``star'' have lost much of their meeting,
both in sports and entertainment, McGwire is metamorphosing before
our eyes into a living, breathing baseball immortal. For a public
constantly retrofitting the present with a wistful glance back to
the past, he's the real thing in present time.
</P>
<P>
   Take McGwire's latest home-run tear: From May 12 to May 24, he
launched seven home runs that rocketed out of ballparks at
distances estimated between 440 and 545 feet, with five traveling
more than 470 feet. Those statistics are simply staggering.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to tape-measure home runs, McGwire last year
deposited a pitch delivered by fireballer Randy Johnson some 538
feet from home plate, and tagged another months later that went 517
feet. He crushed six other balls during the season that traveled at
least 445 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has homered over Busch Stadium's left-field scoreboard,
reached the fifth deck in Toronto's Skydome, blasted a ball on top
of the left-field roof at Tiger Stadium and tattooed the Budweiser
sign on the Jacobs Field scoreboard in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire seems to have entered another realm in his
playing, the 12-year veteran has been one of the premier home run
hitters in baseball since coming into the league with the Oakland
Athletics in 1987. That year he shattering the rookie home run
record by hitting 49.
</P>
<P>
   But the baseball world began to really take notice of McGwire's
home-run-hitting prowess when he hit 52 home runs in 1996, despite
missing 32 games due to injury. Speculation mounted that he could
make a run at what is baseball's most appealing record, Roger
Maris' all-time season mark of 61 homers set in 1961. McGwire came
close last year with 58, despite a weeks-long tailspin that
preceded his late-season trade to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   This season's pace, with two-thirds of a season still to go, has
McGwire hitting over 80 home runs, which simply isn't going to
happen. Whether he can eclipse Maris' coveted record, which has
stood the test of time 37 years, longer than Ruth's previous record
of 60, also remains very much to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who doubt whether McGwire really belongs in the
same league with Ruth, consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Percentage. McGwire recently edged past Ruth to have the
highest percentage of home runs per at bats over the course of a
career. Whether McGwire's frequency eventually tails off, it's an
almost certainly the two will be 1-2 in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   _ Distance. During much of Ruth's playing days, he was in a
class by himself when it came to hitting homers. But it was rare
when anyone actually measured how far balls went. What we know is
simply anecdotal, but stories abound of Ruth hitting king-sized
home runs. McGwire, of course, seems to hit colossal shots with a
greater frequency than such prodigious modern-day home run sluggers
as Mickey Mantle, Willie McCovey, Richie Allen and Cecil Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballparks. Ruth had the advantage of playing in Yankee
Stadium, with its cozy right-field porch that was a left-handed
hitter's dream. Maris benefited from that, too. McGwire, on the
other hand, has had to play most of his career in cavernous Oakland
Coliseum, until the last couple of seasons one of the tougher parks
in the majors for hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Career totals. McGwire recently passed Ruth to become the
fastest player to reach 400 home runs. That still leaves McGwire
around 300 home runs behind the Sultan of Swat, and it's doubtful
he can reach him, given his age (34) and that he is injury-prone,
which accounted for missing more than 300 games alone between 1993
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the frequency and distance of McGwire's home runs have
earned him the right to be put in the illustrious company of the
mythical Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   The two also share something that'll never show up in the record
books: their love of children. The Babe's affection for kids is
legendary. Last year, a teary-eyed McGwire announced he was setting
up a special foundation to aid abused children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people put my name next to Ruth's name,'' McGwire
recently said, ``it still blows me away. I'm still in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   So are we. But it can now be said. Babe Ruth. Mark McGwire.

DMITRY RACHMANOV: GIFTED PIANIST , ADMIRABLE INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By one count, Dmitry Rachmanov, a Russian-born
pianist now widely active in the New York area, played three
encores on Thursday evening in his recital at Merkin Concert Hall.
Almost inevitable under the circumstances were Liadov's ``Musical
Snuffbox'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Flight of the Bumblebee,'' but a
Scriabin nocturne for the left hand made for a distinctive close.
</P>
<P>
   By another reckoning, Rachmanov played hardly anything but
encores. His program, ``The Art of the 19th-Century Russian
Character Piece,'' offered ditties and little more by 10 composers
ranging in fame from Felix Blumenfeld (a ``moment lyrique'') to
Tchaikovsky (``Reverie du Soir'' and ``Dumka'').
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the term ``thematic programming'' seemed to
become a value judgment: Any theme was good; any program without
one was fatally flawed. The resulting experience has amply shown
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Character, or characteristic, pieces are pianistic attempts to
capture moods, often fleeting, using a dance, a march, a pastoral
or nostalgic turn, or the like. They are best taken in small,
concentrated doses. An evening of them, especially in a single
national style, palls quickly with repetitive gesture, now gentle,
wistful or nostalgic, now dark, bold or brave.
</P>
<P>
   Rachmanov's initiative in turning up unusual items is admirable.
The audience, largely Russian, seemed appreciative, and with good
reason, for Rachmanov is in addition a suave and gifted pianist. He
brought considerable color and focus to the individual works.
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally the music had something substantial to say,
particularly in the concluding run of works by Rachmaninoff,
Medtner and Scriabin. Rachmaninoff's Preludes in G (Op. 32, No. 5)
and G minor (Op. 23, No. 5) seemed models of structural probity in
relation to anything that had come before, and Rachmanov made
Scriabin's B minor Fantasy seem the Lisztian epic he hinted at in
his program notes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his playing was almost everywhere admirable. Gentle
moments, sometimes finicky, were more often fetching. And he
mustered big technique when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't quite master the finger-boggling bravura of Sergei
Liapunov's ``Lesginka,'' a ``transcendental etude'' after Liszt, he
is surely in good company there. And if his program left a listener
starved for sustained musical argument, perhaps Rachmanov will
supply that next time around.

`BABY IT'S YOU': ONE COUPLE'S DULL TRAVAIL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``P.O.V.,'' the public television showcase for
independent documentaries, begins its summer season Tuesday night
with an offering from the true-confessions department. Having
discovered the magic of the camera, producers commonly turn the
lens on themselves and their families and friends on the principle
that they must be as fascinating to others as they are to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, It's You'' is Anne Makepeace's earnest report of a year
of trying, with her husband, Peter Behrens, to have a baby in the
new-fashioned way, with the help of fertility drugs and techniques
that pluck unfertilized eggs from a woman's ovaries, combine them
with sperm and insert them in her fallopian tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on artificial insemination have become a staple of
television news magazines, with the camera bringing viewers such
intimate sights as the ovary. For all the biological differences,
to my unexpert eye, those pictures look a lot like the fuzzy show
my urologist puts on during our periodic visits; it never occurred
to me that anybody else might find them of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The hour's angst is filled out by encounters with family
members. The most compelling and emotionally charged connection is
between the couple's efforts to have a child and the more
successful yet tragic efforts of Behrens' older sister and her
lesbian lover to do likewise. His younger sister's recent abortion
stirs painful memories of Ms. Makepeace's own abortion 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Makepeace's two brothers, who take up a fair amount
of time _ a reclusive goat herd and an aspiring polygamist (he
plans on having 20 children) _ they demonstrate that people can be
unconventional yet remain uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting Ms. Makepeace's honesty, but watching her
watch her ovaries is not exhilarating. The documentary is infected
with the self-absorption that is evidently encouraged at film
festivals. (``Baby, It's You'' was a Sundance Film Festival
selection.)
</P>
<P>
   The writing sometimes seems borrowed from the travelogue
repertory _ ``This year has been a journey to our past and our
families'' _ and the program might have benefited from sterner
editing of the desultory interviews. The exchanges between Ms.
Makepeace and Behrens as they endure their emotional ups and downs
become particularly wearing. I was happy to see the couple go off
into the sunset, even if it looked stagy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makepeace has nothing good to say about the long-abandoned
rules of privacy that her older relatives tell of observing before
the video revolution, but inhibitions about baring in public what
used to be considered private matters did, at least, spare
audiences some tedium.

WYNALDA MATURES INTO POWERFUL SOCCER FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JILL R. DORSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eric Wynalda grew up in the 1970s in a Southern
California town where boys played ball in the streets and parents
sent their children into the community to test their mettle. Yet
Eric Wynalda was scared.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Dave and Sue Wynalda's middle child went to
the drugstore in Westlake Village with his brother Brandt to buy
some candy. But the slight boy who would become one of the most
recognizable names in his sport was unable to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandt (Wynalda's older brother) made his purchase and left
the store, but Eric was kind of hanging back,'' Dave Wynalda said.
``Brandt went to see what was going on and Eric whispered in his
ear and Brandt made his purchase because Eric was too shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Eric Wynalda overcame that shyness on a global
stage. Before an international television audience, before tens of
thousands of fans, a long way from the cocoon of Westlake Village,
Wynalda was so bold in World Cup '90 in Italy that he threw an
elbow and became the first U.S. player ever to get ejected from a
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives people the wrong impression,'' Wynalda said.
``I did that in 1990 and it was a world-scale nightmare. I became
all the things that people thought I was and I'm still living with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. men's national soccer team opens World Cup '98
June 15 against Germany in Paris, Wynalda will be on stage again.
But this time, Wynalda, among the most celebrated players in U.S.
soccer history, will be trying to make a different kind of
statement.
</P>
<P>
   America's all-time leading goal scorer is haunted by that most
embarrassing, defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   Since that incident, Wynalda has grown from upstart forward for
a fledgling U.S. team to veteran goal scorer _ 32 international
goals in all _ for a team that hopes to break into soccer's elite
by advancing to the second round of the Cup. And Wynalda's hope is
to change the image he so carelessly created eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll live with that for the rest of my life,'' Wynalda said.
``But I think it's one of the greatest things that has ever
happened to me because it taught me so much about myself. Maybe I
wasn't ready for that and I needed to handle it differently. I
created that situation with my attitude, I'm a target now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda is known as the brash bad boy of his sport. On a
basketball court, Eric Wynalda's counterpart is Charles Barkley. On
the baseball diamond, it is Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   They are players known as much for temperament as talent,
defined more by their miscues than their triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an enigma,'' said Brian Quinn, coach of Wynalda's MLS
team, the Clash. ``He's such a diverse personality. He's serious,
smart, funny, bright, impatient. ... But the maturity shows on the
field, he doesn't get rattled as easily. Before he would have said,
`Screw you' and lashed out. But now, he is more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda's growth is borne out by his tempered persona on the
field, his decision to forgo a second chance to play soccer in
Germany so he could be in the United States to focus on the World
Cup, and his desire to give back to the game. To those closest to
him, Eric Wynalda has become a leader, an advocate, a teacher and a
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People compare him to Barkley or (Dennis) Rodman, but how many
kids can go and touch Barkley after a game?'' said Eric's wife,
Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, as Dave and Sue Wynalda tell it, saved their son. Before
the game fell into their lives, Wynalda was prone to tantrums and
trouble. ``He would just stand there with his hands on hips and
just kick things,'' Sue Wynalda said. ``He was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But one day, when Eric was 5, he went to watch Brandt play
soccer. The kid absorbed the game, the strategy, the atmosphere. He
may not have known then what he could become, but he certainly knew
that he had found his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thunk it?'' asked Dave Wynalda. ``I'm serious,
you can't make a soccer player like this. But we have this saying
in our family, that God touches every one of us with genius. Eric
found his in soccer.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   An unusually strong jet stream stretching from Montana to the
Northeast will propel several powerful disturbances across the
northern half of the nation. The contrast in temperatures across
the Plains will be remarkable for early June with as much as a 50
degree change between southeast Colorado and western South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   An intensifying low-pressure system moving east of Lake Huron
will draw increasingly humid air northward into the Middle Atlantic
states and New England. The result will be increasing clouds with
thunderstorms erupting along an approaching cold front in the Ohio
Valley and eastern Great Lakes. Several strong to perhaps locally
severe storms are possible once again from Ohio to western New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with torrid weather over the South will be marked
by a few thunderstorms in the Carolinas and western Tennessee
Valley. Record heat is expected in the western Gulf States and
interior Southeast where readings will soar to near 100 degrees.
Very cool weather will spread across the northern Plains along with
variable clouds. Light rain will begin to fall in the western
Dakotas as chilly winds from the east ascend the sloping terrain.
Clouds and showers will also dampen parts of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure building southward from Saskatchewan will direct
dry air into the Northwest promoting sunny skies. A corridor of
moisture from the Pacific will keep morning ocean clouds along much
of the West Coast and bring streamers of high clouds into
California, Nevada and southern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Gulf Coast Drought
</P>
<P>
   Not a drop of rain fell on Corpus Christi, Texas, during May for
the first time since 1887. In fact, it was exceptionally dry from
the mouth of the Rio Grande River to the Mississippi Delta with New
Orleans only measuring .43 inches, less than 10 percent of the
usual May rainfall. In Corpus Christi, a typical May brings 3.33
inches of rain, which is similar to New York City. However, the
proximity of most Northeast cities to the retreating jet stream
prevents a rainless month. Persistent high pressure over the
western Gulf of Mexico last month suppressed the common afternoon
showers along the coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (UNDATED) _ ...Time to collapse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We set up camp just 10 feet or so from the river's edge. There
we cooked our meals, wash ed up, slept. At night, the five of us
would gather to eat dinner, talk and joke, and wait for the stars
to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife was seemingly scarce, but on one evening a group of
bats swooped above our heads, presumably seeking their own dinner
of insects. This went on for about a half-hour: the bat stage show
for tourists from the big city.
</P>
<P>
   On our first full day camping by the river, we thought a day
hike was in order. Although it might seem more logical to rest
one's weary legs (whic h get the brunt of the abuse), going on a
moderate excursion is a better idea. It loosens tight muscles and
helps make you whole again.
</P>
<P>
   I learned about what Canyon hikers call ``exposure.'' This means
the trail you're on has areas in which a c areless step would mean
sure injury. Like dropping off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Our day hike toward Lava Canyon Rapids, roughly two hours
northeast, was said to have some of these exposure areas. As it
turned out, without our backpacks and by using care, the exposures
were no problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful day for a beach picnic, there by the
Colorado. We took our lunches and a purifier to pump water for the
return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to help, and to learn about camping lore, I offered to
help pump the w ater. A little too eager: While I was working the
pump's lever, a key plastic part snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the experience of my fellow campers showed in the axiom
``Always have two.'' We had another pump back at camp.
</P>
<P>
   Our days down by the river were simple and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by the dawn, a simple breakfast of instant oatmeal or a
bagel and wonderful, wonderful coffee. One team member would not
compromise on that, thank goodness, and brought a whole pound of
premium blend. The first cu p in the crisp morning air is the stuff
caffeine dreams are made of.
</P>
<P>
   Small, light hammocks were a nifty accessory for three of the
crew. They strung them up between mesquite trees for a siesta. I
sat near the constantly roaring river and read,
</P>
<P>
   or let my mind wander.
</P>
<P>
   I slept one night out of the tent, with the sleeping bag on the
ground. After the sun went down, we picked out the Big Dipper, off
near the eastern horizon. During the night, I happened to wake up
and see the Dipper again , this time directly overhead, the
sparkling centerpiece of a sky filled with stars. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All too soon, it was time to plan our trip out. We would split
the uphill effort in half, camping near the trail at Asinine Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to
</P>
<P>
   leave our little home by the roaring rapids, but I didn't know
yet how hard. The walk back to the rim was something I'd dreaded
almost from the first time I took the expedition seriously. Now, it
finally was beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say it tu rned out to be the hardest physical
challenge of my life. The main thing was to just put one foot in
front of the other, I kept telling myself.
</P>
<P>
   At least the distractions were plentiful. While huffing and
puffing, I could look to my left and se e incomparable beauty.
Having a small tape recorder playing Aaron Copeland's ``Appalachian
Spring'' in my earphones didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging up Asinine Hill was the toughest, but the two of us in
the back of the pack finally made it, as the other s called from a
bluff where they had set up the tent.
</P>
<P>
   The awesome view was matched by the wind, which was playing
havoc with our nylon tent. We scrambled to lash our shelter down,
but the gale had other ideas, tearing the tie-down straps in th e
process. Acknowledging this force of nature, we sought and found a
lower campsite with more natural protection.
</P>
<P>
   After a last, cold camping night, we awoke to a glorious day,
perfect for hiking. I was getting the hang of it now. With less foo
d and water, the pack was lighter, and I finally had the straps
adjusted about right.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being one of the slower hikers, I was not always in the
back of our group. I took the lead after our midmorning break, and
began the last ascent alon e.
</P>
<P>
   It was a special time; indescribable, really, in the feeling of
solitude, and of the belief that life could be simple: just one
foot in front of the other.
</P>
<P>
   It started getting colder again, and we saw patches of snow as
we stopped for lunch to refuel for the last push of our trek, back
to the rim. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, more snow appeared on the trail, though because we were
going uphill and had better footing, we tried and succeeded on
marching through without crampons.
</P>
<P>
   I had
</P>
<P>
   fallen to the end of the pack again. During lunch, there was the
inevitable attempt to gauge how much time we had left to hike.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., we guessed, it all would be over but the celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Walking was even slower now, due to the snow un derfoot and my
fatigue, but I kept at it. Then, up above, I heard rebel yells. I
dared not hope that the hike would be shorter than we thought.
</P>
<P>
   But then I saw signs _ certain trees, or turns in the trail _
that I remembered from the trip down.
</P>
<P>
   The realization came to me that, indeed, I was almost up and out
of the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   As I staggered near the trailhead sign, there were the others,
camera ready to capture the finish. ``Give us a yell!'' they
called.
</P>
<P>
   What they got was a whimpe r. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In days immediately following the hike, the temptation was to
think of it as a life-altering experience. With time, I've found
that's not quite the case, but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   What stuck was a renewed feeling of confidence in my abil ity to
set a goal and achieve it; that, with hard work, I still could do
something difficult. I can, indeed, push myself when the goal is
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than feeling insignificant amid the grandeur of one of
the wonders of the world, I felt re newed, and sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   There was a light at the end of my middle-age tunnel. &QL;

<P>
   NY-DAMATO-CAMPAIGN (New York) _ Throughout his career, Sen
Alfonse D'Amato has been a tireless fundraiser, a politician who
works the phones with a barker's gusto. Yet since taking over the
Banking Committee in 1995, he has made his previous fundraising
seem almost pedestrian, harvesting millions of dollars from
individuals and companies in the financial industry that have a

   SD-TORNADO (Spencer) _ There's no explaining the things fate

flattened house; an 89-year-old woman searching for her injured
husband's false teeth; a Nazarene minister mourning his wife, who
broke away from him on the way to the storm cellar to fetch their
dog, and never returned. There were vows to rebuild, but little
conviction to them. By Pam Belluck.

   YUGO-KOSOVO (Belgrade, Serbia) _ President Slobodan Milosevic of

Albanians. By Chris Hedges.
</P>

   RUSSIA-ECON (Moscow) _ Despite President Clinton's effort to
help stabilize the ruble, Russia's financial markets continued to
worsen on Monday. Russia's stock market fell by more than than 10
percent. Russia's futures exchange suspended trading. Meanwhile,
the Fitch IBCA agency lowered its ratings for 14 major Russian
banks. By Michael R. Gordon.

CHALLENGING CANYON HIKE IS ANSWER TO MIDLIFE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES   (With photo) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON RENFROE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ During my b irthday party in January, my best friend
asked if I'd like to join a group hiking the Grand Canyon in early
April.
</P>
<P>
   My friend didn't know that turning 40 had thrown me into a
midlife crisis. I was looking down a corridor that seemed to be
getting
</P>
<P>
   shorter by the minute. What, after all, had I done with my life?
Where had the years gone? Why am I suddenly getting tasteless
birthday cards?
</P>
<P>
   These troubling thoughts coupled with a third beer clouded my
reason: ``Yes, I'd very much like to do that,'' I responded.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking the Canyon would force me to get in shape, clear my head,
give me a goal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My friend had applied to the Park Service for a
backpacking/camping permit last year. He had wanted to hike the
Grandview, Esc alante and Hance trails as a loop, but the Park
Service had other ideas. We were given the Tanner Trail to hike.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanner begins at the far eastern end of the South Rim, not
far from the Desert View Watchtower.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanner is one of the
</P>
<P>
   more difficult trails in the park, listed as ``very strenuous''
by most guidebooks. It's between 8 and 12 miles long (every
reference had a different figure, though it's probably eight or
nine), and very steep at the beginning, with another very st eep
portion about two-thirds of the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Although I like to hike, the longest trail I ever had covered
was about seven miles, at Usery Park, near the Superstition
Mountains southeast of Phoenix. Its gently rolling hills and access
to a lo cal Dairy Queen would be nothing like this challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sauce for the goose!'' I naively thought to myself. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are benefits to getting up really early. It's nice and
calm at 4:30 a.m., and still dark; the stars and moon are o ut, the
streets are clear of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, of course, is that it's 4:30 a.m., and I barely
can make my legs move. But my friend had said hiking Squaw Peak
would be the best way to simulate the ``very strenuous'' conditions
of our trip , and morning worked best for my schedule. As long as
sleep wasn't important.
</P>
<P>
   I decided I'd hike Squaw Peak two or three times a week for
about a month and begin carrying a pack after I had gotten into
better shape.
</P>
<P>
   So with 20 pounds of do g food plus other weight inside a
borrowed backpack, I began the real training around mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Having never backpacked, I was unprepared for the feeling weight
adds to the hiking experience. I felt like an out-of-balance turtle
walking upri ght, swaying back and forth unsteadily on the trail.
The shoulder straps hurt my shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   This was taking some getting used to. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early March, I had arranged for rental equipment and had
gotten advice about what to pack for our four-day, three-night
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Power bars, instant oatmeal, jerky, small cans of tuna, bagels
and instant soup topped the list.
</P>
<P>
   We'd also take along three precooked frozen meals for all five
of us to share. These would be cooked on gas-f ueled stoves, as
campfires were forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Each would carry about a gallon of water, half of which would be
cached along the way. I'd need enough clothes to keep warm at
night, though the sleeping bag I'd rented was supposed to be cozy
down to
</P>
<P>
   15 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Things were coming together, and I actually was getting excited.
What we hadn't planned on was a little guy named El Nino. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, Arizona's weather in March was pretty
unusual. There was a substantial amount of rain in Phoenix, and,
concurrently, lots of snow up north.
</P>
<P>
   Although weather is a lot less predictable at the Grand Canyon
than it is here, one usually can count on the temperature at
Phantom Ranch (on the floor of the Canyon) being about th e same as
it is in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But all that snow and rain had us worried. My friend recommended
I be prepared for the worst. Yet another trip to REI for a
weatherproof top and bottom. Dressed in the black outfit, I looked
(as one of our team later
remarked) like the Orkin man. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drive from Phoenix to our hotel on the South Rim was
uneventful. Although we passed many snow-blanketed areas near
Flagstaff, we made good, easy time.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop after checking in at the hotel was the trailhead.
It was our first chance to see where we would hike the next day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little scary. The trail was about 2 feet wide and
covered with snow. There was probably a beautiful vista of the
Canyon buttes, but we barely could ma ke them out through the
chilling fog.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, we reconsidered our plan. Perhaps another trail
would be better. But after checking in at the backcountry office,
and getting reassurance that the trail was passable with crampons,
our original mission was a go.
</P>
<P>
   Crampons: yet another new experience. These spikes strap onto
boot insteps, and help provide footholds in snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was issues like using crampons, and all the other unknowns,
that kept me awake during Tanner Hik e Eve. As often happens with
me, when I need sleep the most, I don't get it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up at 5:30 a.m., on the trail by 7:15. I was layered and layered
again with clothing; it was only 8 degrees outside.
</P>
<P>
   Eight degrees, with blowing snow. We were still game, but I was
nervous. When I started down the trail, I nodded to myself: Yep,
nervousness was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the crampons, the trail seemed treacherous. I might
have adjusted faster if it hadn't been for the sweat streaming
</P>
<P>
   into my eyes and soaking my head.
</P>
<P>
   I had overdone it on the layers. I shed a couple and began to
feel better. Slowly I got used to the trail, the snow, the crampons
and the weirdly beautiful landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Many writers have tried to capture the Grand Canyon in words;
just as many have tried to paint or photograph one of the world's
wonders. All have failed; it's just a matter of how much.
</P>
<P>
   I won't try, except to say that if you love seeing the Canyon
from the rim, imagine all that
</P>
<P>
   beauty and majesty multiplied when hiking into the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   It takes your breath away, and puts things in their proper
place. In many ways, this trip was about perspective. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we made our precarious way down past the snow line.
The crampons came off and more layers of clothes. Still cold and
windy, we made our way slowly down, down.
</P>
<P>
   The morning wore on, with one fantastic vista after another.
Morning gave way to midday, and we had our lunches of tuna, powe r
bars and trail mix. We almost had reached the halfway point,
nicknamed Asinine Hill.
</P>
<P>
   This drop-off is very steep. Though there are switchbacks,
these, too, are very steep. Falling backward is easy, especially
with a heavy pack, as I proved t wice. Besides feeling a bit
desperate with that extra weight pinning me down, I escaped without
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was filled by passing through bizarre
environments. Hoodoos _ stone columnar formations _ towered on our
left as we mar ched on. The trail skirted the sides of slanting
hills; instead of falling forward, my body kept trying to fall
sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after about 6{ hours, we heard the roar of the Colorado
River at Tanner Rapids. Time to collapse. &QL;
</P>

`SAVVY' RADIO HOST HAS TRAVELED FAR AND WELL, ISN'T DONE YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ After covering politics and hard news for the
Washington Post and ``Washingtonian'' magazine for 22 years, Rudy
``The Savvy Traveler'' Maxa might miss delving into scandals in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's off for a weekend in Hong Kong. He
</P>
<P>
   might jet to London for dinner. He has traversed Europe, done
Asia, explored Africa.
</P>
<P>
   What's Monica Lewinsky to a man who once was detained for four
hours in Port Said, Egypt, and paid off his captor with $30 cash
and a few minutes of fawning
</P>
<P>
   over the general's photos of Mickey Mouse?
</P>
<P>
   When you owe your life to the Mouse, you're not eager to return
to the Washington rat race. Nine years ago, in fact, Maxa turned
down an offer to contribute political commentary to Public Radio
Intern ational's ``Marketplace'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really care (about politics),'' he says, ``but I don't have
a point of view. I just like to watch the circus. I don't care what
clowns are in it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Maxa is more likely to run into one of
</P>
<P>
   those fancy French clowns in Paris than Bozo on the banks of the
Potomac. As host of PRI's ``Savvy Traveler'' program, he's either
traveling the world or advising his listeners on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Between his radio work, a gig writing a business -travel column
for ``Worth'' magazine and writing business-travel columns for
MSNBC and abcnews.com, Maxa has to make time to actually take the
trips he's still dreaming of.
</P>
<P>
   But ask him when the bulls are running in Pamplona, Spain, or
the tul ips are blooming in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and he has
the information at his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savvy Traveler'' has been on the air just 10 months and
already is heard in 125 cities, including 18 of the top 30 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The show's produc er is J.J. Yore, who knew Rudy back in
Washington. When Yore moved to California to produce
``Marketplace,'' he asked Maxa to contribute political commentary.
Insisting he lacked the opinions of, say, a firebrand such as Pat
Buchanan, Maxa instead p itched the idea of a consumer-oriented
travel segment.
</P>
<P>
   The boy Rudy, an Army brat raised primarily in Europe, had
always been fascinated by airlines' too-good-to-be- true offers. He
developed the habit of reading fine print and amazed his frie nds
by quoting limits and restrictions on so-called good deals.
</P>
<P>
   Those instincts served him well when he grew up to write
articles advocating for the travel consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At first, however, Yore did not share his enthusiasm for the
notion of a
travel segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a business show,'' he told Maxa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are business travelers!'' Maxa pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy Rudy was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Yore decided Maxa's segments had become so
successful they deserved to be spun off into their own show. ``The
Savvy Traveler'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savvy'' since has developed into a combination of ``Car
Talk,'' ``Oprah Winfrey'' and the Encyclopaedia Britannica of
Travel Information.
</P>
<P>
   Like Click and Clack, the ``Car Talk'' gu ys, Maxa fixes
listeners' broken vacation plans. Can't afford Majorca? How about
Puerto Vallarta?
</P>
<P>
   Like a one-man reference library, he spews data about happenings
in the four corners of the world. Hoping to attend the Rose of
Tralee Festival in
Tralee, Ireland? Maxa has the time, place, admission price.
</P>
<P>
   Every show offers the travel Deal of the Week _ cheap airfares,
for instance. There is a theme of the week _ call in with your
stories of vacation horrors or the most useful foreign p hrase.
(Please and thank you are rivaled only by ``ein bier, bitte'' _ the
proper way to order a beer in Germany.)
</P>
<P>
   Freelancers contribute reports from exotic places, such as a
hotel where scuba-diving guests enter the lobby underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ` `Savvy Traveler'' invites listeners to call a toll-free number
with their responses to weekly themes and with questions for Maxa.
Producers work their magic, logging the messages and phoning
respondents to arrange a time when Maxa can call them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Maxa sits at the phone for several hours, laptop and
Rolodex at his side, and calls listeners in succession, recording
for the next week's show.
</P>
<P>
   The format works and is necessary because different radio
stations air the program at d ifferent times and days. Actual live
call-ins would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   With all the work Maxa does as a travel journalist, he stays
abreast of the industry. ``I'm trying to keep new,'' he says,
making an effort to travel whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   T his summer, the divorced father of two is taking his son on a
barge trip through Burgundy, France. Alex, 15, will pilot the barge
(it's not as hard as it sounds, Maxa says) while Pop sits on deck
and enjoys a glass of _ what else? _ Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   At age 48, Maxa has done the usual destinations and now is
longing to visit more out-of-the-way places such as Australia, New
Zealand, Cambodia, Vietnam. He's almost breathless naming the miles
he has to go before he sleeps at the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   As he jets around the world, he's not one to crash at a hostel
or grab a snack on his way up a mountain. Maxa is no Rick Steves,
whose public-television series on European travel finds him happily
bunking in someone's spare room and counting a hot b ratwurst as
fine dining in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Maxa tends toward the upscale, even bringing gourmet meals on
airlines where dinner is a sack lunch. His seatmates turn green
with envy, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes a nice hotel _ mint on the pillow, please.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Maxa is averse to roughing it. He once wrote an article
for the Washington Post headlined ``A wimp's week in the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's a wimp with good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let someone else do the adventure travel,'' he says. ``I want
room
service.'' &QL;

EL NINO MAY RAIN ON THIS PARADE OF CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ During a particularly wicked rainstorm at last
year's U.S. Open in Bethesda, Md., shelter was at a premium. The
various hospitality tents were packed, and that concerned Jon
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Barker was at Congressional Country Club on a fact-finding
mission. As the championship coordinator for the 1998 U.S. Open, to
be played at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, Barker worried
aloud about the need for bigger tents in case of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just looked at me and said, `Don't worry about that.
Never, ever worry about that in San Francisco. It never rains in
San Francisco in June,''' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to never-never land.
</P>
<P>
   The June 18-21 tournament is nigh and, strange as it seems,
Barker's concerns don't seem so far-fetched anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just amazing to all of us,'' Barker said Thursday as
El Nino dropped another day of rain on the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Though rain fell on the past three U.S. Opens, San Francisco was
supposed to provide a respite. But now, with the city already hit
by near-record rainfall and with an unpredictable June here,
officials are bracing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather has hampered some construction around the
course, though United States Golf Association championship manager
Steve Worthy said rain was more an ``annoyance'' than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   As for playing conditions, the rough is the greatest concern.
According to Tim Moraghan, the USGA's agronomist for championships,
continued rains can make the rough difficult to trim, and rough
that is too tall has a tendency to lay over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the grass is growing too fast before we can get out
to cut it,'' Course superintendent John Fleming said. ``And once
you mow it, if you don't mow it when it's relatively dry, it just
clumps up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the plan was for the rough to be at 5 inches when
the tournament begins, but ``all it takes is a good rain and two to
three days of not being able to mow, and you're up to 7. It's hard
to get mowers up that high.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget acting. Forget $20 million a movie. Forget Ace Ventura,
The Mask and even Truman Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey was born to be a movie critic. And, typically, he has
some Carrey-style outrageousness to share.
</P>
<P>
   ```Titanic' wasn't that big a deal,'' he proclaims as he settles
into a Beverly Hills hotel suite. ``Big deal, you fall in love _
you know you're gonna die. They're saying, `This is till the end of
time' _ which is coming in about 20 minutes. `So let's hang on,
let's really work at this.' That's no commitment, man!''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian comic and former ``In Living Color'' star
presumably thinks better of another film, one he himself is
headlining and which, even before its June 5 release, has earned
sensational buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profound'' is not a word usually associated with Jim Carrey
movies or, for that matter, with summer flicks in general, but many
who've seen the film have been applying it to Carrey's latest
cinematic effort, ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor/comedian plays Truman Burbank, a 30-year-old man who
unknowingly has grown up from birth before America's eyes on
television: His entire life is a mammoth extravaganza set in a
giant sound stage built to resemble an idyllic oceanside village.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden cameras dot the faux community, zeroing in on Truman as
he goes about his days: Greeting the neighbors, selling life
insurance, mowing the lawn. His wife and best pal are actors, who
enter their ``scenes'' with Truman by plugging beer or some other
product.
</P>
<P>
   He is the unwitting focal point of this town, yet he is
restless, and as the facade of his tele-existence slowly peels
away, he becomes increasingly desperate. ``The Truman Show''
comments on the invasiveness of the media, as well as how much we
are willing to conform to societal norms to stay happy.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Australian auteur Peter Weir _ director of
``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' (1975), ``Gallipoli'' (1981),
``Witness'' (1985), ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989) and ``Fearless''
(1993) _ is deep and deeper, a far cry from Carrey's ``Ace
Ventura'' noodlings or ``Liar, Liar'' (1997). Nevertheless, it
allows the comic moments for his trademark uproarious inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This script was a realization of something that I'd already
thought about, suddenly come to fruition somehow,'' says Carrey, a
tall, lanky guy looking uncharacteristically GQ in a dashing,
pinstriped navy suit. ``And also it was a major departure for me,
so when Peter was connected to it, I thought, `How can I go wrong?
If I can't trust him, I basically can't be directed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, who himself has lived in a media fishbowl since his hit
movies earned him an asking price of $20 million per film,
responded to the material on a personal level, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very parallel to my life in many, many ways,'' Carrey
says. ``There are a lot of levels to think about on this movie.
Everybody at some point gets to a point where they have to separate
themselves from what other people want for them and what they want
for themselves. And in order to do that, you have to go into
unknown territory, you have to take a risk of losing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also the reality of my life and the media attention _
people love me, and their kids love me,'' he says. ``But if I meet
50 of them in a day, someone's gonna be disappointed, you know?
Because I have emotions, and I get tired and everything else. That
adoration, when you don't realize how much is being metered out to
a person, can actually be dangerous. This film has so many
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey revels in the fact that ``The Truman Show'' is unlike
anything he's done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you do come out of this picture with are
thoughts,'' he says. ``A lot of films, you walk out and you're
ready to go see the next whatever, the next thrill ride. I think of
this as a psychological thrill ride _ it's a thrill ride, but it
takes place inside you.''
</P>
<P>
   After often working with journeyman filmmakers who were content
to point their cameras and let him uncork his crazed
improvisations, Carrey relished working with a director of Weir's
stature, not to mention his trademark meticulous preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed up at my house with a binder full of pictures and
things that he had put together that might inspire me to feel the
aesthetic of this movie,'' Carrey recalls. ``There was some
Salvador Dali stuff in there, sometimes just a cutout of a kid
standing on a beach looking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `Oh my gosh. This guy's really working at this.
He's an artist, and I'm gonna have to do my best.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Carrey found Weir's approach a far cry from the
almost-anything-goes style of his early films.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do is you give 'em all the crap first, then anything
is an improvement,'' he says. ``I used to write that way on `In
Living Color.' Honest to God, we wanted to get such bizarre stuff
on there that sometimes I would have to include even more bizarre
stuff that I knew was totally over the line, so they'd have
something to cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd go, `Well, you definitely can't do that.' I'd
negotiate,'' he recalls. ```Dammit,' I'd say, but I got the stuff
in that I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of how Carrey is running his career now. Having won
an enormous fan base by exploiting his maniacal persona, he has won
the clout to make films which speak more personally to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a Salvador Dali painting, this movie, in
the way that personally, I've been showing you what's on the
surface and all that,'' he says, ``but now I'm lifting up the ocean
to show you the sleeping dog there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a sleeping dog, that thing about to be
revealed,'' Carrey adds, ``and I'm grateful that I had Peter at
this moment to lead me into that and allow these other colors to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is my adolescence as an actor,'' he says. ``I'm not
just satisfied with looking at everything whimsically, I have other
things to discover.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth is imperative as a performer, Carrey says. He's come a
long way from his early days in show business, wowing audiences at
comedy clubs in Toronto and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to drive me crazy,'' he says. ``I saw guys there that
had been doing stand-up since I started, which was a good 15 years,
and they were still doing the same 20 minutes of material.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't live that way,'' Carrey insists. ``You can't. You've
got to believe, `If I go into the abyss, and I take a chance, there
will be a reward for me sometime.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be willing to make a fool of yourself in this
business, otherwise you don't get to those interesting places.''

 Includes a color slide of Harrison Ford with Anne Heche in a scene
from ``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some questions apparently have to be asked, especially about
Harrison Ford's new film, ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' which
co-stars Anne Heche.
 &HT;    No, not the ones about Heche's high-profile lesbianism _ she's
Ellen DeGeneres' companion _ or how it affected Ford's romantic
scenes with her in the desert-island film.
 &HT;    No, not any of the who're-you-sleeping-with-lately questions
that spice many current interviews. Ford is notorious for his
unwillingness to get personal.
 &HT;    ``It is unseemly to air your problems in public,'' the actor
says. ``Plus I don't feel any obligation to make myself sound
interesting to a reporter. The most interesting thing about what I
do is up there on the screen for everyone to see.''
 &HT;    No, apparently what inquiring minds want to know is what would
Harrison Ford take with him to a real-life desert island?
 &HT;    In a day of interviews at Manhattan's Essex House, he's been
asked the question 27 times in English, plus two in Spanish. For
the record, here are some of the answers:
 &HT;    ``I'd bring my wife and children. Is that one choice or three?''
 &HT;    ``Some books, but I don't know what.''
 &HT;    ``Gold Coast hot dogs from Chicago.''
 &HT;    ``I just don't know.''
 &HT;    And then there are the more specialized questions.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what cereal I would bring to a desert island. I
do not eat cereal.''
 &HT;    And now Ford is heading into a press conference with a whole
room of foreign reporters.
 &HT;    ``Right now that desert island is looking pretty good,'' he
whispers as he heads in.
 &HT;    He settles in, and the first question is asked.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Ford, let's say you were really stranded on an island.
What would you bring?''
 &HT;    Ford pops a peanut M&AMP;M, as if to give himself time to think.
 &HT;    ``Hmmm, you seem to be the first person who has thought of that
one,'' he begins.
 &HT;    Ford has answered a lot of questions in his time, most of them
many times. It's no surprise _ after all, he remains the
biggest-box-office draw in Hollywood history, having starred in
films that sold more than $2 billion worth of tickets.
 &HT;    ``I read those numbers. I don't relate,'' Ford says, relaxing
after the press conference in a suite at the hotel, looking
handsome in a dark-olive suit, his hair cropped short and a hint of
a tan on his face.
 &HT;    ``I don't take it personally,'' he adds. ``I'm very lucky to
have stumbled upon those roles. It's my enormous good fortune. I'm
glad people take some pleasure in them.''
 &HT;    Ford has been on a roll of late, with ``Clear and Present
Danger'' (1995), ``The Devil's Own'' (1997) and ``Air Force One''
(1997) all having scored at the box office.
 &HT;    ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' which opens June 12, varies the
action formula of those three films, casting Ford as a rough bush
pilot who crashes his plane on a desert island, ending up stranded
with his passenger, an imperious magazine editor played by Heche.
 &HT;    ``It's kind of an `African Queen' type of situation,'' Ford
says. ``It's an unlikely love story.''
 &HT;    Heche's relationship with DeGeneres began _ and went public _
after she'd already been cast in the film. Suddenly everyone was
buzzing about whether there could be romantic chemistry between
Ford and half of Hollywood's most famous lesbian duo.
 &HT;    ``I think we have great chemistry. It's called casting,'' Ford
says with a bit of an edge to his voice. ``Anne impressed us the
first time we read with her. We knew she'd bring something unique
to the film. She has a slightly off-center sense of humor. She also
brought great wit and energy, and she is a very skilled actress.
She's a natural.''
 &HT;    As for her sexuality, Ford says it's not an issue: ``I could
care less about my co-stars' personal lives.''
 &HT;    Most of Ford's characters have been men of action who were
nonetheless sensitive, caring people. That isn't necessarily the
case this time out.
 &HT;    ``I don't know the exact definition of a guy's guy anymore,''
the actor says, ``but I guess it's someone who says, `Take what you
get, warts and all.' I play a man who is not exactly PC, but what
he lacks in manners he makes up for in passion.
 &HT;    ``Maybe it's nice to see this guy because we're a little too
serious about male-female parameters these days,'' Ford says. ``I
understood his pain and his ambition to control his life by
simplifying. I personally empathized with that one.''
 &HT;    Actually, as movie stars' lives go, Ford's is already pretty
simplified. He lives in Wyoming with his wife _ Melissa Mathison,
screenwriter of ``ET'' (1982) _ and their children, coming to
Hollywood only to work.
 &HT;    ``I don't do the star thing,'' he says. ``I don't do premieres,
I don't talk about my charities. You don't need me to nominate a
cause.''
 &HT;    His success, Ford says, means only one thing to him.
 &HT;    ``It means that I have the opportunity to have some control over
the work that I do,'' he says. ``And that is what is really
important.''
 &HT;    Unlike many actors, however, Ford doesn't use that control to
experiment with more risky roles in lower-budget art films. He
feels no great need to ``stretch,'' as actors say.
 &HT;    ``You know what would happen? The press would treat it like a
big Hollywood movie, and that's not good for the movie,'' Ford
says. ``That's what happened when I did a smaller film like
`Regarding Henry' (1991). It was supposed to be a little film, but
the press blew it out of proportion. And that was tough on the
movie.
 &HT;    ``I like the kinds of movies that I do,'' he says firmly. ``My
sense of this is that I'm in a service occupation. I am a
storyteller, and movies are so expensive these days that you have
to tell your story well. I want to tell stories that people around
the campfire want to hear.''
 &HT;    Among those stories are upcoming reprises of his roles as Jack
Ryan and Indiana Jones, but not as Han Solo, who won't be seen in
the new ``Star Wars'' prequels.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, I wanted Han Solo to die at the end of the last
one, but George Lucas didn't find that too amusing,'' Ford says.
``I'm pleased George Lucas has found something that interests him
again. But I don't feel involved in it at all in the prequels,
except I know my kids will enjoy them.''
 &HT;    Ryan and Jones should be enough to ensure that Ford will stay on
top of the Hollywood heap for the foreseeable future _ a prospect
that he sees as not an unmixed blessing.
 &HT;    ``My anonymity is almost like a commodity I would like to buy
back,'' he says, sipping coffee.
 &HT;    That isn't likely, however, which was borne home to him recently
when he was pursuing one of his fascinations, flying. Fog forced
him to make an unscheduled landing at an airport in Trenton, N.J.
 &HT;    Waiting for the fog to lift, he reports, ``I started to wander
around the airport. I got a lot more attention than I ever
imagined.
 &HT;    ``It's so funny,'' he says. ``It's like people have radar
detectors and they center in on me. They will mouth, `You're
Harrison Ford.'
 &HT;    ``I used to shake my head as in, `No, I just look like him,'''
the actor says, smiling. ``Now I just wink and nod my head. I think
a few little old ladies in the airport still didn't believe me.''

 Includes a color slide of Magic Johnson in a scene from ``The Magic
Hour.'' 
 By FRANK SANELLO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In the late-night talk-show wars, basketball superstar Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson has already won an important battle.
 &HT;    The challenge: getting other superstars to appear on his
syndicated show, which debuts June 8 on Fox affiliates nationwide.
 &HT;    The pilot, which will not air but was used to market the show,
featured a Triple-A guest list of Mel Gibson, Cher, Laurence
Fishburne, singer/songwriter Babyface and supermodel Tyra Banks.
Oh, and unannounced and unscheduled, lightweight boxing champ Oscar
De La Hoya dropped by to say hello to a favorite fellow athlete.
 &HT;    ``When you have a superstar host, it's a lot easier to book
superstars as well,'' says executive producer Geovanni Brewer, a
former documentary filmmaker for the Ford Foundation.
 &HT;    A whole lot easier, actually: Harrison Ford, the Howard Hughes
of celebrity interviewees, was making a reluctant appearance on Jay
Leno to promote a film when he heard music he loved coming from
next door. Told it was Sheila E. conducting the band for Magic
Johnson's upcoming talk show, Ford _ who normally would rather
undergo root-canal work than volunteer to be interviewed _ asked if
he could be on the show.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to meet him,'' Ford said, according to
Brewer.
 &HT;    The executive producer says that the Lakers legend hasn't abused
his position as the athlete everybody _ including celebrities _
wants to meet. When Johnson meets a star at a sporting event, ``he
has to bite his tongue'' not to pitch an appearance on the show,
Brewer says. But he only buttonholes ``close personal friends'' to
sit on his couch, leaving the grunt work of bagging Gibson and
company to the talent coordinators.
 &HT;    ``He doesn't want to put anybody on the spot,'' she says.
 &HT;    Johnson tells a different story, though.
 &HT;    ``I've called everybody,'' he says on the telephone from his
office on Paramount's back lot in Hollywood. So far, he reports,
he's received only two rejections, ``and that's because they don't
do talk shows, period.''
 &HT;    Johnson refused to name names, but laughed when asked if the
``no-shows'' were Salman Rushdie and Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    Johnson's roster of advisers is as star-studded as his guest
list, representing the Tiffany's of Talk. Jay Leno's ``Tonight
Show'' occupies a competing time slot in much of the nation, but
nevertheless Leno has become ``The Magic Hour's'' unofficial
``dialogue coach.''
 &HT;    ``Jay told me to relax, make it my space,'' Johnson says. ``Make
the show fit my personality. Don't do things that aren't me, like
trying to get up there and do a monologue. That's not me.''
 &HT;    Instead, Johnson will open each show with a casual discourse
more in the spirit of Andy Rooney than of Andrew Dice Clay _ ``not
a monologue,'' he hastens to add, ``but something that happened to
me that day or something in the news, just my perspective on it.''
 &HT;    Then a professional comic _ who at the time of this interview
hadn't been named yet, with two finalists vying for the job _ will
trade a few quips with Johnson and finish with a polished monologue
without the host's participation.
 &HT;    ``The Magic Hour'' tapes on Stage 29 at Paramount. The location
has special resonance for Johnson, since another African-American,
Arsenio Hall, set up couch on the same sound stage and for five
years gave Johnny Carson a run in the ratings.
 &HT;    Hall has also helped Johnson get launched. His advice was
similar to Leno's, the former athlete says: ``Have fun. Let my
personality come out, and don't worry about what people say,
because if you make it your show, it's going to happen and people
will like it. But if you try to please people or make it somebody
else's show, it won't work.''
 &HT;    Johnson has attacked the talk-show game the same way he attacked
that other game which made him one of the most beloved figures in
America, a three-time NBA most valuable player and member of five
championship teams: He works out a lot.
 &HT;    ``I've been practicing for a year,'' he says. ``It's like being
a rookie, something you've never done in your life, so I've had to
learn technique and how to do these things.''
 &HT;    Besides freebies from Leno and Hall, Johnson is also aided by an
interview coach and a speech therapist. The interview expert helps
him ``form'' questions, he says, even offering tips on how to
interrupt a rambling guest to go to a commercial.
 &HT;    Making his interview chores easier, executive producer Brewer
suggests, is the fact that many stars have told her that they
themselves have questions they have always wanted to ask Magic.
 &HT;    ``A lot of times,'' Brewer says dryly, ``he's a bigger star than
his guest.''
 &HT;    Johnson has battled Larry Bird and Michael Jordan on the
basketball court and the HIV virus in his bloodstream. He says
hosting a talk show is ``scarier'' than either of those opponents.
 &HT;    ``I like scary challenges _ I thrive on that,'' he says.
``That's what keeps me working hard. If you're not scared, you
don't work hard. Fear is a motivating force for me.''
 &HT;    The new combination therapy of AIDS drugs has cleared the HIV
virus from his system, Johnson reports, and he has declared himself
``healed'' _ not cured. The battle against his disease has turned
into minor skirmishes, mostly when he forgets to take the fistfuls
of protease inhibitors that have dropped the virus to levels
undetectable in his bloodstream.
 &HT;    ``The virus is outta here,'' he says firmly.
 &HT;    His business empire continues to grow, but for the time being
the former athlete is leaving it to his advisers while he focuses
on his new venture.
 &HT;    That empire is impressive by any standards: Johnson owns a chain
of successful movie theaters plus Starbucks and TGIF restaurant
franchises in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta. All are located in
the inner city, where pessimists said such ventures would fail.
 &HT;    Oh, and Johnson recently teamed with Janet Jackson to buy a bank
_ which, like his first multiplex, is located in South Central Los
Angeles, site of the devastating riots after the Rodney King
verdicts in 1993.
 &HT;    The jock-turned-business-magnate will admit to no qualms about
doing business in the ghetto, despite the reluctance of others to
follow his lead.
 &HT;    ``They read things, they got scared off,'' Johnson says. ``But
we're the biggest consumers. We're very loyal people. If you bring
a first-class organization to the inner city, we will support it,
even more so because a minority is involved. They say, `One of us
owns this!'''
 &HT;    On ``60 Minutes'' recently, Johnson proudly noted that none of
his businesses has ever been vandalized.
 &HT;    Johnson has also teamed with his former agent, impresario
Michael Ovitz, on an effort to bring a National Football League
franchise to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Given all of these ventures, and the financial rewards they have
brought him, some have expressed surprise that the former Laker is
stepping into the crowded talk-show arena.
 &HT;    The answer, Johnson says, is as simple as that he was bored. In
fact, he had already turned over the day-to-day operation of his
business empire to the president of Magic Johnson Enterprises,
because its success meant it was no longer challenging.
 &HT;    Hosting a talk show is a new challenge, and Johnson welcomes it.
The biggest surprise so far, he says, is how much fun he's having
playing couch potato with celebrities. Despite his own fame, he
confesses that he's always been something of a groupie, especially
toward movie and rock stars.
 &HT;    ``I'm having a great time,'' Johnson says. ``This is what I
needed. I just didn't know I'd have this much fun.''

PETER WEIR: A ONE-OF-A-KIND DIRECTOR STEERS `THE TRUMAN SHOW'

 Includes a color slide of Peter Weir talking with Jim Carrey on the
set of ``The Truman Show.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Peter Weir isn't shy about the box-office performance of his
most recent film, the plane-crash drama ``Fearless'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``It died,'' the Australian director says calmly. ``It was a
commercial disaster.''
 &HT;    Many directors would have responded to this reverse by
immediately signing onto the most obvious commercial hit they could
find, no matter how brainless, for fear that they'd get a name in
Hollywood as box-office poison.
 &HT;    Weir, on the other hand, let several years go by, then invested
three years of work in the June 5 release, ``The Truman Show,'' a
strikingly original drama/comedy starring Jim Carrey which is, if
anything, even more commercially problematic than ``Fearless.''
 &HT;    ``I have nothing against hits,'' the soft-spoken Weir says as he
lounges on a couch at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan. ``I've been
fortunate enough to have a long career, and I feel that I'm still
in my prime. I just believe that the only way to keep going is to
push oneself.
 &HT;    ``Films can be tough,'' he admits. ``You can attract unpleasant
people at times. The stakes are high and, above all, it's difficult
to make a good film.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how many films I've got left in me and, not to
sound pretentious, I'd like to try to protect the art of making
films,'' he says. ``The only way to do that is to choose something
I'm fascinated by.''
 &HT;    The stories that fascinated Weir in the past have produced a
diverse, critically acclaimed body of films, among them ``Picnic at
Hanging Rock'' (1975), ``Gallipoli'' (1981), ``The Year of Living
Dangerously'' (1981), ``Witness'' (1985), ``Dead Poets Society''
(1989) and ``Green Card'' (1990).
 &HT;    ``My films may or may not be commercial, and that's fine,'' the
53-year-old director says. ``To me, filmmaking is quite unlike
life.
 &HT;    ``In life you supposedly get wiser or, as some call it, more
conservative,'' he says. ``You experience things and don't do them
anymore. You've burned your fingers, had your crazy times and
become wiser. That's not unreasonable.
 &HT;    ``In the creative life, you can't do that,'' Weir adds. ``You
just can't.''
 &HT;    Dark-edged and ambitious, ``The Truman Show'' ushers audiences
into the candy-coated world of Truman Burbank (Carrey), a giddily
happy man who slowly comes to realize that his entire life has been
spent as the unwitting star of a nonstop, internationally beloved
television show. All the people around him _ including his mother
(Holland Taylor), wife (Laura Linney) and best friend (Noah
Emmerich) _ are actors paid to play their parts.
 &HT;    Overseeing everything is the show's enigmatic creator/director,
Christof (Ed Harris), whose 5,000 cameras capture Truman's every
move as he roams about picture-perfect Seahaven, actually a domed
set built specifically for Truman. There are no standard
commercials during the show _ instead, the characters promote
products as they interact with Truman.
 &HT;    Moviegoers may see ``The Truman Show'' as an indictment of
television, the media and/or the insatiable thirst for the most
intimate details about our favorite celebrities, and any of those
views pleases Weir.
 &HT;    ``The film pokes a stick in the eye of the beast,'' Weir says.
``In a way, you're sane if you laugh. Fame is one aspect, gossip is
another and the media as a whole is another.
 &HT;    ``My carpenter was chatting with me one day about Leonardo
DiCaprio,'' he recalls. ``He was the last person in the world I
expected to know or care about a celebrity's private life.
 &HT;    ``But he did, because no one can get away from any of it.''
 &HT;    Least of all Jim Carrey, the $20 million man, who begins and
ends each day under the glare of paparazzi flashbulbs. That, plus
his agreeing to a relatively modest payday of $12 million, made
Carrey perfect for ``The Truman Show,'' as far as Weir and producer
Scott Rudin were concerned.
 &HT;    ``My thinking was that we needed a star to play Truman,'' says
the director, who did the same funnyman-goes-dramatic with Robin
Williams in ``Dead Poets Society.'' ``Truman was a natural star who
just didn't know he was a star. So I had to have a star.
 &HT;    ``I looked at a short list of actors, but none of them seemed
very suitable,'' he recalls. ``Tom Hanks did, but he'd just done
`Forrest Gump' (1994). A couple of weeks later, Scott Rudin rang
and suggested Jim.
 &HT;    ``I thought he was great, brilliant, and Scott said he was
interested,'' Weir says. ``After `Liar, Liar' (1997), Jim wanted to
broaden his range, his possibilities as an actor.
 &HT;    ``We met, and I just knew that Jim had what I needed in Truman,
who's a man with charm and a simpleness to him, a man who's not
quite normal, like a boy raised by wolves.
 &HT;    ``We agreed that Jim would explore the broader possibilities of
the humor and that I'd pull him back if necessary, or that I'd use
a subtler take,'' the director says. ``Jim and I had a good,
collaborative working relationship, and I'm very impressed with his
work in the film.''
 &HT;    Still, the director acknowledges, ``The Truman Show'' may leave
some people cold.
 &HT;    ``It had to be real and restrained,'' he says. ``Might some
people find the movie too unemotional for them? Perhaps. But it's
as emotional as I thought necessary.''
 &HT;    Will audiences ultimately get what ``The Truman Show'' is all
about?
 &HT;    ``There will be people who are interested in its dense story,
who enjoy reflecting on the story's context, who just get the
joke,'' Weir says. ``Probably an equal percentage or a larger
percentage might not, but I think they'll at least appreciate the
entertainment value in it.''
 &HT;    Weir himself, who created 30 years of backstory for both Truman
and Christof, tinkered with and fine-tuned ``The Truman Show''
until the last minute.
 &HT;    ``I feel a certain lightness getting ready to let it go out
there to the public,'' he says. ``It has been a long three-year
period.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand,'' he adds, ``I started to see Truman-esque
moments in my life, on TV, in the media. In my head, I keep
spinning the story on: `Is that real? Where are the cameras?'''
 &HT;    The director chuckles.
 &HT;    ``Maybe it is time I let the film go.''
 &HT;    When not working, Weir retreats to a house in Australia that he
shares with his wife and children. Even at home, though, the
director sometimes can't help but call the shots.
 &HT;    ``I'm not at all nostalgic about my old films, but I'm rather
difficult to live with right after I finish a movie,'' he says,
laughing. ``A shopping expedition can be painful for my wife, I'm
so busy taking charge of the purchasing.
 &HT;    ``I've got a certain impatience that carries over,'' he admits.
``But it fades away very quickly. When everything calms down, I'm
pretty normal.''
 &HT;    Normal and grateful, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Each film I do is a world unto itself,'' Weir says. ``I was
absolutely absorbed by the tragedy that happened on Mt. Everest a
couple of summers ago, and I've used it as a filmmaking analogy
since, not at all to diminish the tragedy.
 &HT;    ``A couple of extremely experienced climbers lost their lives,''
he recalls. ``Directors are, in a sense, mountain climbers. I'm an
extremely experienced one, and I have all the knowledge of how to
do the craft of climbing, but each film is a new mountain.
 &HT;    ``If my luck changes, if the weather turns on me, I can lose my
way and fail,'' Weir says. ``That's what keeps me true and
grounded.''

 By ROBERT WINKLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fascination with birds, mammals and other animals takes hold
in early childhood and, in many of us, never abates. And there's
nothing quite like photographing a wild animal to give you the
thrill of the hunt without harming the animal itself.
</P>
<P>
   A wildlife photographer's greatest asset is not equipment nor
scientific knowledge, but patience. Failures, near misses and
numbing repetition are as much a part of the experience as any
glossy photograph of a bird or beast.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the fragility of their subjects, wildlife
photographers adhere to a strict code of ethics. The cardinal rule:
If anything you do directly or indirectly endangers, restricts or
harasses an animal, stop it and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity of a wildlife photograph vanishes if the subject
is not free to come and go, if it shows fear or anxiety, or if it
has been provoked to attack or to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners must impose upon themselves additional constraints.
Under no circumstances should a novice photograph a bird's or
mammal's nest, for example. Your presence is a severe strain on the
parents and young, and can have dire consequences: abandonment of
the young, exposure of the nest to predators or exposure of
unattended young or eggs to life-threatening heat or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even check the robin's nest outside your front door. A
skunk or raccoon may later follow your scent trail to the young,
whose only defense is their camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Risk can go both ways, of course, if animals perceive you as a
threat. It was an attack from a disturbed owl that cost British
bird photographer Eric Hosking an eye.
 &UR; CHOOSING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best wildlife photographs are the most natural ones, and by
no means do you need powerful or costly equipment to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Although professional wildlife photographers use
super-telephotos in the 400-to-1,000-mm range, a 70-to-210-mm zoom
lens _ standard equipment for many users of 35-mm,
single-lens-reflex cameras _ is adequate in most situations. Use
200-to-400-speed color film for a good balance between sharpness
and light sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   At many wildlife refuges, animals are plentiful and, because of
the almost constant presence of nonthreatening human visitors,
relatively tame. The 200-mm focal length of your zoom lens will
often give you a frame-filling image of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   At the world's most famous wildlife areas, such as the
Galapagos, Florida's Everglades National Park, Antarctica and East
Africa's wildlife preserves, where the tameness of birds and
mammals can be remarkable, even the 200-mm setting may be too
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Some wildlife-photography enthusiasts, however, find the lure of
a longer lens hard to resist. For the more timid species, or for
potentially dangerous animals from which you must maintain a safe
distance, consider a 300-mm lens. It provides an image 50 percent
larger than that of a 200-mm lens, and usually is about as
``fast,'' meaning that it gathers almost as much light _ f/4.5 is
commonly the maximum aperture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the increase in size and weight is significant, in good
light a 300-mm lens can be hand-held. Longer lenses almost always
require a tripod, because as image magnification increases, so do
the blurring effects of camera shake.
</P>
<P>
   You can get extreme close-ups, the kind you see in wildlife
magazines, by using a blind _ a tent or wooden structure with
openings only large enough to accommodate a lens.
</P>
<P>
   For viewing and photography, some wildlife refuges have
permanent blinds in strategic locations. A blind is especially
effective in photographing birds, which lack the keen sense of
smell that warns a mammal when the blind is occupied.
 &UR; `STALKING' WITH A CAMERA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a blind, you'll have to use stalking techniques. The
tips that follow are designed to minimize an animal's alarm while
letting you get close enough for a good shot:
</P>
<P>
   + Approach slowly in a zigzag fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A fast, direct approach will cause the animal to flee sooner.
Sometimes it helps to walk sideways, like a crab.
</P>
<P>
   The eyesight and hearing of birds is so acute that, short of
using a blind, there is little point in trying to hide. Simply
approach without making any sudden movements. With mammals such as
deer, whose sense of smell is much better than their vision, you'll
be able to get closer if you approach downwind.
</P>
<P>
   If an animal stops feeding and begins staring at you before
you've gotten close enough, either stop or retreat until it again
appears unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep low.
</P>
<P>
   As you near the point from which you'll be able to get a good
shot, stay low and take only occasional quick glances at the
subject to get your bearing. If trees are nearby, lean against one
to blend with the surroundings. Animals are suspicious of the
upright posture of humans, and it makes them nervous when a
perceived predator stares.
</P>
<P>
   + Raise your camera slowly.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an autofocus lens, don't waste time focusing
and refocusing _ you may get only one brief chance for your shot.
Be prepared for the bird to flush or for the mammal to bolt.
There's no need for caution then _ stand up straight and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hound an animal by endlessly repeating the above steps.
Attempt to photograph it once or twice, then leave it alone. If you
need more than two chances, practice your stalking, focusing and
shooting with an imaginary subject.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be discouraged if you can't get as close as you'd like.
Group wildlife shots and pictures that incorporate the landscape
are valid, too. Wildlife magazines have conditioned us to believe
closer is better, but often the best wildlife photographs show the
animal in relation to more than just its immediate environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the automobile is one of the wildlife photographer's
most valuable tools. A car can be used as a movable blind from
which animals perceive little threat.
</P>
<P>
   When you photograph from a car, move up to your roadside subject
slowly. Shutting off the ignition will eliminate engine vibrations,
but when you start up again the noise may scare off the subject.
For long lenses, camera stores have damps with pan-tilt heads
designed to support a camera from a car window.
</P>
<P>
   From the hatch of a Land Rover, the vehicle often used on
African photo safaris, a beanbag will cushion a 300-mm lens as you
photograph lions, wildebeests, zebras, gazelles and cheetahs.
</P>
<P>
   If you photograph on a safari, be sure to vary your camera
position _ shooting only from the Land Rover's hatch will give your
pictures that telltale look of a camera always aiming down.
</P>
<P>
   Protect equipment in a foam-padded camera bag. A plastic bag
over that will keep out dust and sand. In extreme heat, store film
in an insulated bag or cooler, allowing it time to reach air
temperature before use.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, a van or Land Rover will allow you to get within
50 feet of the world's most famous animals. At such ranges a 200-mm
or 300-mm lens may be too powerful, but it may not be powerful
enough for extremely wary animals such as jackals and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Successful animal portraiture involves the same patience, skill
and quick reflexes that you need for good portraits of people. Look
for something characteristic, unusual, exciting or evocative _ and
remember that the light itself may create your picture. Have
patience, but react quickly when the moment occurs.
 &UR; REPAYING THE ANIMALS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the rewards of wildlife photography are so great, can we
do something to repay the animals that make them possible?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, photographs alone do not fully reveal, and may
even conceal, the plight of wildlife. Habitats diminish day by day.
Humankind continues to encroach on nature, and the risk of
extinction increasingly threatens the weakest links in the wildlife
chain.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the cause of conservation, a photographer helps
strengthen awareness of wildlife's predicament and proves that his
or her interest is in the animals themselves, not merely in their
images.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Given how much time your family spends in the car, you want your
vehicle to be as safe as possible. Lessen the chances of mishap or
injury with these safety, maintenance and driving strategies. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CHILD-SAFETY SEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All kids, especially those in car seats, are safest riding in
the back. Make sure that your child uses the right safety seat for
her age and weight _ a rear-facing seat for infants up to 1 year
and 20 pounds, a forward-facing seat for children over 1 year and
weighing up to 40 pounds, and a booster seat for kids who are too
big for a car seat and too small to fit correctly in a lap/shoulder
seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety seats cannot fit in some cars because of the
configuration of their belts or the shape of the seat. When buying
a car seat, be aware that it might not fit your vehicle. You may
need to return it and try another.
</P>
<P>
   Read the safety-seat instructions and your car manual carefully
to make sure you install the seat correctly _ as many as half of
all safety seats are used improperly.
 &UR; TIRES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some tires are made for speed, some for control and some for bad
weather. Tell the salesperson your priorities before buying.
</P>
<P>
   Worn or improperly inflated tires give you less control when
steering and braking, and may be prone to blowouts. To check the
treads on your tires, stick a penny into the grooves. They should
be deep enough to touch the top of Lincoln's head. If the tread is
unevenly worn, replace the tire.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the life of your tires, it's important to keep them
inflated at the recommended air pressure, which can be found in the
owner's manual, on a label in the glove compartment or on the
driver's doorjamb. Check the air pressure of your tires monthly
with a pressure gauge, which is inexpensive and easy to use.
 &UR; EMERGENCY KIT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You should carry these items in your trunk in case of a
breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   + flares or a reflective triangle
</P>
<P>
   + a well-stocked first-aid kit
</P>
<P>
   + jumper cables
</P>
<P>
   + a can of tire inflater
</P>
<P>
   + gloves
</P>
<P>
   + rags or paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   In cold weather, add an ice scraper, a shovel, a bag of
nonclumping cat litter _ for traction on ice _ spray de-icer and a
blanket.
 &UR; GLOVE COMPARTMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep your glove compartment stocked with a flashlight, a
tire-pressure gauge, your owner's manual and maps of your home
state and of anywhere else you may be driving. It's also a good
idea to travel with a cellular phone in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Using a cell phone and driving at the same time can be as
dangerous as driving drunk. If you must make a call, pull off the
road first.
 &UR; BRAKES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antilock-braking systems prevent skids by automatically easing
the brake pressure on the wheels before they lock up. This helps
the driver maintain control during emergency braking.
</P>
<P>
   Because the braking technique for ABS is different from that for
standard brakes, some drivers misuse them. If you have an ABS,
learn the proper emergency-braking technique: Don't pump the brakes
to avoid a skid _ instead, keep your foot firmly on the brake, and
let the ABS pump the brakes for you.
</P>
<P>
   Try practicing in an empty parking lot.
 &UR; SEAT BELTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making sure that you and your kids wear your seat belts
correctly every time you get in a car is the most effective way to
prevent injury in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder belt should fit straight across the chest without
cutting into the neck. The lap belt should lie low and snug across
the lap, not across the abdomen.
 &UR; AIR BAGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All new vehicles in the United States have driver-side and
passenger-side air bags. Though air bags have saved thousands of
lives, they can cause injury or even death if a passenger is too
close to one when it deploys.
</P>
<P>
   Always wear your seat belt, and sit so that your breastbone is
at least 10 inches from where the air bag deploys _ either the
steering wheel or the passenger-side dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   The safest place for kids under 13 to ride is in the back seat,
properly restrained. If you can't avoid having a child ride up
front, put the oldest in front, properly secured, and slide the
seat as far back as it will go. Never place a rear-facing car seat
in the front seat of a car with a passenger-side air bag.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can now petition the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration for permission to have an air-bag on/off switch put
in their vehicle, but this option will be needed by only a few
people, such as those with no alternative but to place an infant or
child in the front seat.
 &UR; WINDSHIELD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worn wiper blades can reduce visibility by insufficiently
clearing off rain and snow. Change your blades at least twice a
year, at the start of spring and of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Grime and debris also reduce visibility, so keep the
windshield-washer reservoir filled with no-freeze washer fluid, and
remember to use it frequently.
 &UR; UNDER THE HOOD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Battery.
</P>
<P>
   A leading cause of breakdowns is a weak battery. Extreme heat or
cold can make a battery lose power, so if yours is more than two
years old, ask your mechanic for a load check before driving in
very hot or cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   + Radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme heat or cold can make the water in your radiator
evaporate or freeze. Check regularly to make sure the radiator is
filled with a 50/50 mix of water and antifreeze/coolant.
</P>
<P>
   + Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping your oil clean and at the right level is important. Pull
the dipstick once a month to see if you need to add oil _ your
owner's manual will have information on proper maintenance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Ann Rafferty didn't know she had eye problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a new pair of frames,'' she recalls. ``But when
the doctor examined my eyes, I knew by the look on his face that
something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more tests confirmed that Rafferty had glaucoma, a disease
in which too much fluid pressure builds up inside the eye and
damages the optic nerve. More than 3 million Americans have
glaucoma, and 80,000 are blind because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole world turned upside down,'' Rafferty says. ``At 41,
all I could think was that I was too young to go blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, her condition was caught early enough to save most of
her sight. Two surgeries have allowed Rafferty, now 49, to see well
enough to continue working for a pharmaceutical company in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent vision loss is to get routine eye exams.
These checkups should include a dilation, in which eye drops are
used to enlarge your pupils, allowing a doctor to see inside your
eyes to check for signs of disease. These screenings are especially
important as you get older.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you should see an ophthalmologist or optometrist
every two to three years until the age of 40. After that, a yearly
exam is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the top causes of vision trouble, and what you can
do about them.
 &UR; GLAUCOMA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it is: This eye disease is often called ``the silent thief
of the night,'' because irreversible vision loss can occur before
it's diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   As the disease gets worse, peripheral vision narrows. Depending
on the type of glaucoma, you may notice eye pain, blurry vision or
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Who is at risk: People 60 or older, as well as African-Americans
and those with diabetes, nearsightedness, high blood pressure or a
family history of glaucoma
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: Get routine eye exams. Vision loss from
glaucoma can usually be prevented through eye drops, pills and
conventional or laser surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Latest news: Preliminary studies suggest that regular aerobic
exercise, such as biking or brisk walking, may help reduce your
glaucoma risk.
 &UR; DIABETIC RETINOPATHY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it is: About half of the 16 million Americans who have
diabetes suffer from this disorder, and each year more than 24,000
of them go blind from it.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood-sugar levels cause
tiny blood vessels to leak in the retina. There may be no initial
symptoms, but later there may be blurriness as the retina starts to
swell. Blood vessels can also bleed into the vitreous humor _ the
clear, jellylike substance that makes up the center of the eye _
and cause vision loss.
</P>
<P>
   Who is at risk: Diabetics and those at risk for diabetes,
including African-Americans, pregnant women, overweight people and
those with high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: To prevent diabetes, stay slim and exercise. A
yearly eye dilation can also help detect diabetes at its earliest
and most treatable stage. If you already have diabetes, monitor
your blood sugar carefully. Eat right, exercise and take your
medicine _ most cases of blindness from diabetes can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Latest news: To slow vision loss, laser surgery is often used to
seal off leaking blood vessels. Advanced cases may be helped by a
vitrectomy, in which a blood-soaked vitreous humor is replaced with
a clear solution.
 &UR; MACULAR DEGENERATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it is: A progressive eye disorder that affects the macula _
the center area of the retina _ causing central vision to become
blurry or distorted.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of age-related macular degeneration: ``dry''
and ``wet.'' The dry form, which accounts for 90 percent of cases,
occurs when macular tissue thins as a result of aging. The wet
form, however, is more serious and can cause sudden vision loss. It
occurs when new blood vessels grow and leak fluids behind the
retina, creating blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   Who is at risk: Anyone over age 65, or who has a family history
of the disease. Scientists have recently identified a gene that may
account for as many as 16 percent of AMD cases. Other possible risk
factors include a high-fat diet and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: While there is no cure for AMD, some patients
with the wet form benefit from laser surgery to seal off leaking
blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Latest news: Scientists are looking into whether antioxidant
supplements, such as vitamins C, E and bela-carotene, and minerals
such as zinc can slow down the disease. And researchers have
recently found that a substance called vascular endothelial growth
factor causes new blood vessels to grow in the retina. They hope to
find drugs to counter its effects.
 &UR; CATARACT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it is: A condition in which the eye's lens gradually loses
its clarity. This clouding prevents the lens from bringing light
into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But as the
disease progresses, vision will get blurry or distorted. You may
also become more sensitive to light, and colors may look dull.
</P>
<P>
   Who is at risk: Everyone will get cataracts if they live long
enough. In fact, more than half of Americans ages 65 and older have
some form of the disorder. While it isn't clear what causes the
condition, one recent study found that smoking 20 or more
cigarettes a day triples your risk of early cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: ``Surgery is the only proven way to treat
cataracts,'' says Dr. Richard E. Braunstein, assistant clinical
professor of ophthalmology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's also very effective: More than 90 percent of patients who
have the procedure, in which a cloudy lens is replaced by a clear
artificial one, improve their vision.
</P>
<P>
   Latest news: Research shows that vitamin C may have a protective
effect. In one study, women who took as much as 250 milligrams of
the supplement a day for 10 years or more experienced 77 percent
fewer cases of early cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may also
delay the onset of cataracts.
 &UR; REFRACTIVE DISORDERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they are: Visual disorders that occur when the lens and
cornea do not bend light properly. For instance, nearsightedness,
also called myopia, makes it difficult to see distant objects.
Farsightedness, or hyperopia, makes it tough to see close objects.
Astigmatism occurs when the eye can't focus because its cornea is
misshapen.
</P>
<P>
   Who is at risk: Nearsightedness often hits in grade school, gets
worse during the teens, then stabilizes until age 40.
Farsightedness often strikes after 40.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: Get glasses or contact lenses. Or consider
refractive surgery, in which the cornea is reshaped with a surgical
instrument, laser or both. The average cost is about $2,000 per
eye. In radial keratotomy, tiny incisions are made in the cornea to
correct nearsightedness. A similar technique is used in astigmatic
keratotomy to treat astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Latest news: Photo-refractive keratectomy surgery _ in which a
laser is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness or an
astigmatism _ has become more popular in the last two years.
Nearsightedness or astigmatism may also be helped by a newer
procedure, laser in-situ keratomileusis, done with a surgical
instrument and a laser.
</P>
<P>
   While 75 percent of patients will be able to see without
glasses, perfect vision is not guaranteed, says Dr. Ernest W.
Kornmehl, a refractive surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear
Infirmary in Boston. Depending on the procedure, some people may
become more sensitive to the light. In rare cases, vision loss
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But most patients are pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``PRK changed my life,'' says former contact-lens wearer Barbara
Murphy of Mineola, N.Y. ``I forgot how great it is to wake up and
be able to see on my own.''

 By KEN McALPINE  
 c.1998 Spirit magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This kind of story research I could get used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull on your earlobes,'' Tracy Walton tells me over the
telephone. ``Now go all the way around, pinching your earlobe
gently between your fingers. Now squeeze your eyebrows with your
thumb and index finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel that point where your brow meets the bridge of your nose?
Push up right there, real gently. Isn't it amazing how sensitive
that is?''
</P>
<P>
   The question needs no response. A massage therapist and head of
the science department at the Muscular Therapy Institute in
Cambridge, Mass., Walton knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing,'' she says. ``Massage is booming, but very
few people think about self-massage. There's still a sort of
rhetoric that you need to get a massage from someone else. But
self-massage has benefits, too.''
</P>
<P>
   You may know that traditional massage _ one person administering
a massage to another _ improves circulation and reduces muscle
tension and stress.
</P>
<P>
   You may be surprised to learn, though, that massage may also
help migraines, colic, diabetes and hyperactivity. Massage has
helped asthmatics breathe more easily, improved autistic children's
ability to concentrate and boosted immune function in HIV-positive
patients.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional massage has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it's expensive. Not everyone can afford $50 for a
45-minute session on a regular basis. Traditional massage also
requires a massage therapist, and one isn't always handy.
</P>
<P>
   But you yourself are both accessible and cheap. And all that's
required to perform effective self-massage is a little knowledge, a
little time and a little change of mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Bob McAtee, a Colorado Springs, Colo.-based massage
therapist with a client list of top-notch athletes. McAtee isn't
averse to massaging himself while seated at a traffic light or on a
plane _ ``I'll do my hands, forearms and shoulders, since I use
them a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes of self-massage on the neck and shoulders will
make a huge difference in the way you feel,'' McAtee says. ``Done
regularly, self-massage can really help reduce chronic tightness
and improve the circulation in trouble spots like the neck and
back. It helps keep your muscles healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're enjoying a degree of privacy, your feet _ much abused
and filled with tension _ are a great place to start. Five minutes
of foot massage can work wonders, Walton says. Try it right before
you go to sleep _ on the road, those little hotel bottles of lotion
make an ideal massage oil.
</P>
<P>
   The face is another repository for tightness and stress, and a
few minutes of facial massage will release muscular tension and
shake out the cobwebs. Simply scratching and rubbing the scalp,
Walton says, accesses a host of tight scalp and neck muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-to-reach places can be addressed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're traveling or sitting at your desk, take a tennis
ball and place it between your lower back or your shoulders and the
seat,'' Walton says. ``Rolling gently around on it has the same
effect as someone else's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   This piecemeal approach can be applied in any fashion. Massaging
your legs for five to 10 minutes after a run, McAtee says, helps
flush accumulated waste products from traumatized muscles, letting
you recover from workouts faster and with less soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Desk-bound folk can greatly reduce chronic tightness by
indulging in a few minutes of self-massage several times during the
work day _ maybe the hands and forearms if you clack away at a
keyboard, or the neck and shoulders if you feel tight there.
</P>
<P>
   McAtee still recommends an occasional massage from a
professional. But the beauty of self-massage is that it can be part
of every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With massage, it's long-term consistency that really brings
results,'' he says. ``Daily self-massage is a wonderful way to get
more in tune with your body and take good care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do you need the magic hands of a professional masseuse to
perform self-massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need to know technique to give yourself an effective
massage? Absolutely not,'' Walton says. ``A lesson or a few
techniques can help. But it's your body _ you know what feels
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the biggest roadblock to the benefits of
self-massage is mental. Americans are flocking to massage
therapists in record numbers _ some 25 million Americans make about
60 million visits to massage therapists each year. But self-massage
is still largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre,'' Walton says. ``I think there's this unspoken
taboo in our culture about getting pleasure or relaxation from
touching our own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   For those afflicted by guilt or skepticism, McAtee has some
simple advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't try self-massage, you won't know,'' he says. ``Do
it four to five times over the course of two weeks and see what you
think.''
 &UR; SIDEBAR: AH, THERE'S THE RUB &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Self-massage can be done when, where and however you like.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of self-massage,'' massage therapist Bob
McAtee says. ``With the exception of making sure it doesn't hurt,
there are no hard-and-fast rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to get a bit more out of your self-massage,
McAtee offers a few ground rules:
</P>
<P>
   + General technique.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what body part you're working on, it's best to start
with large, vigorous strokes that involve the entire muscle. Large
strokes include rolling, kneading or long, gliding strokes along
the entire length of the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Follow these with smaller strokes working across the grain of
the muscle, to help separate and relax the muscle fibers. Use
moderate thumb pressure to relieve tender spots or muscle knots.
Then finish up with large strokes again.
</P>
<P>
   + The feet.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze, rub and poke. Use your thumbs, fingers or knuckles to
dig a bit deeper around tender spots, then do some soothing strokes
with the flat of your hand. As with tender spots anywhere on your
body, work them for 30 to 60 seconds, then move away and come back
a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   If your fingers get tired, try a wooden spoon, a golf ball or
some other blunt object to apply pressure to tender spots. There
are also plenty of massage tools available to ease the burden on
your hands and help with hard-to-reach places.
</P>
<P>
   + The calves.
</P>
<P>
   Sit comfortably _ it makes no sense to stress one body part to
massage another. Bend your knee and place your foot flat on the
floor. Shake, squeeze and knead the calf muscle, using one or both
hands. Move up and down the entire calf.
</P>
<P>
   Now mentally divide the calf into two or three long strips.
Pretend your fingers are glued to the skin and use your fingertips
or thumbs to rub back and forth across the grain of the muscle. Rub
so that the skin is moving with your fingers _ that ensures you're
working the deeper muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   + The quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   Shake, squeeze and knead the quads to loosen and relax the
muscle. Then place your hands on the inside and outside of the
thigh and roll the quads between them vigorously. Divide the quads
into three or four long strips and use your thumbs or fingers _
keeping them glued to the skin _ to work across the muscle grain.
</P>
<P>
   + The hand.
</P>
<P>
   Pull and separate the fingers. Massage the palm of the hand by
interlocking your fingers and then working the surface of the palm
by applying direct pressure or stroking with the thumb.
</P>
<P>
   + The upper arm, shoulder and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Use your massaging hand to knead, squeeze and run the length of
your chest, shoulders, biceps and triceps on the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   Clasp your fingers behind the back of your neck. Pointing your
thumbs down toward your back, use them to apply deep strokes to the
neck muscles there. Squeeze the palms together to apply pressure to
the back of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   When you find tender spots, stop and hold pressure on them for
30 to 60 seconds.

THE MILLENNIUM'S LAST FASHION REVOLUTION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY M. SPINDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flush fashion companies have thrown a lot of money at a lot of
talented young designers in the last few years, setting them up at
the ritzy labels that rule the duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
   All those beneficent companies are hoping for in return is a
dinky little breakthrough like the one Tom Ford had at Gucci. They
would just like the kind of collection that, after it is shown,
alters the eye and esthetic of the fashion-buying population,
saturates editorial pages and has a look so resonant that even the
interior-design market feels its influence. Editors think it's
creative; retailers think it's commercial. Customers think,
``Finally, those designers aren't dressing me like a'' (choose one
or all) ``schoolgirl/prostitute/nun/mom.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the companies haven't found their Tom Ford
yet. In fact events seem to have conspired to make Ford the last
big breakthrough designer that fashion is destined to have before
the end of the millennium. Which, if true, is very bad news. The
American market, at least, is as loaded as it was in the '80s, but
no one seems to be able to find a revolutionary new talent to throw
their money at.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about a designer's big breakthrough is that it can
happen only once. Designers can burst into public consciousness and
change the way worldly women dress just one time. Within 10 years
they've become part of the establishment, then they settle into
that four-decade routine of building their reputation, rewarding
expectations, boring their audience, then eventually parodying
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the past 100 years have had only 10
really big breakthroughs, designers who came on the scene and
immediately changed the esthetic of the fashionable, at high prices
and at low. In one startling season they transformed what women
wanted to wear. Any such list is subjective, but here's one
opinion: Poiret, Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Courreges, Yves Saint
Laurent, Halston, Claude Montana, Giorgio Armani, Donna Karan and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The staggered pacing of those breakthroughs makes it unlikely
that before the millennium a new force will dictate another look
for women. And in many ways, the last big breakthrough of fashion,
that of Ford in 1994, has left a stylistic scorched earth for those
who have followed him. Ford has emerged as the ultimate
fin-de-siecle designer. It hasn't been only his nihilistic
esthetic, which has seemed so eloquently to speak for the sneering,
bored end of the modern age. It is how he's been able to turn
himself into the prototype of a designer for the next millennium,
in which, with a new five-year contract at Gucci, he's sure to
continue his influence. His is such a unified esthetic that it has
seemed to put a veneer on the whole marketplace, a tough lacquer
finish that no designer has been able to crack since.
</P>
<P>
   What's made Ford's success so difficult to surpass or upstage _
a must for whoever has the inevitable next breakthrough _ was a
unique set of circumstances. Unlike those who had big breakthroughs
before him, Ford was working for an established label with a
history that meant something. (Is there any designer who is going
to make women want a dress with, for example, ``Byblos'' written
across it?) He was able to lead with a men's wear collection, then
show the women's collection that mirrored it, making it clear that
this esthetic could dress everyone. He had an advertising budget
that allowed him to put the iconic vision of Amber Valetta flanked
by two smoldering men in nearly every high-profile fashion
magazine. And he further underlined the look by, within one season,
introducing complementary home furnishings and photographing his
collections in the '70s-style modern stage sets that made mere
clothes a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   More than any designer before him, Ford was selling a mood. And
what he conveyed was more than the sum of its parts. Too many of
his contemporaries are selling parts, the sum of which is, frankly,
parts. ``Fashion is not just about clothes, especially today,''
Ford said last week. ``Fashion is about attitude. That's what
you're marketing. The product has to be there but on top of that
you're marketing hip, you're marketing cool.''
</P>
<P>
   What he had in common with the other big breakthrough designers
was his timing. ``If those designers hadn't hit on something at the
time it was in the air, someone else would have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford decided to sell decadence at the peak of a particularly
long-running minimalist moment that had swept fashion, turning even
Chanel suits bland. ``People had forgotten about sex,'' Ford said.
Or more accurately, when they were thinking of it, it conjured
negative images. ``If you remember what AIDS did to the world, it
made sex something you weren't supposed to have,'' Ford said.
``What I wanted to do was bring back sexuality or sensuality we
hadn't seen as a mass culture in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford seduced the fashion editors by holding a mirror up to his
audience at the shows, tapping into the jaded attitude of the
jet-set fashion pack who had seen every trick played on the runway
before, except that one. By exposing their real feelings about
fashion, fatigue, Ford has created a hostile environment for
designers with a more exuberant vision. The knowing worldliness of
his clothes makes others look earnest by comparison. And
earnestness is a pejorative term in this era.

 UNDATED: this era.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because Ford's vision was so jaded, it was terminal. Ford has
performed like Paul Newman in ``The Hustler.' He has nearly cleared
the table, and left those who follow him in the game not a single
clear shot.
</P>
<P>
   How does any designer follow a collection that reads as utterly
bored with artifice, when, after all, fashion is only artifice?
Even Ford has found himself in a creative cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to undo the jaded esthetic that Ford has wrought, some
designers have opted for ultra-romantic and ultra-ornamental.
Unfortunately, those tricks are the generic goop of fashion design,
owned by no one, used at one time by everyone, but certainly not
the basis for anyone's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Young designers who have received the most attention of late _
and youth is relative _ are those who have proven not that they
have inventive ideas, but those who have proven they can toe the
commercial line.
</P>
<P>
   But the creative lull isn't being caused only by the timid
younger generation. There's a lot of graceful aging going on in
fashion, with no small help from Botox injections and
behind-the-scenes staffs full of young, uncredited advisers.
</P>
<P>
   What fashion needs right now is for some of its aging designers
to be a little ungraceful, take a risk, a big risk. Think Warren
Beatty making ``Bulworth,'' not Robert Redford making ``The Horse
Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is now a billion-dollar company, built on a generation's
fascination with sex and cynicism and a designer's savvy in tapping
into it. ``That really had a huge effect on fashion, on the way
people dressed,'' Ford said. ``It made what we did in the mid-'90s
possible. The kind of sexuality that was dangerous. Beauty, but
non-touchable beauty. Slightly hostile, angry fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   That has run its course. But no one yet has found a more
optimistic way to express the same sophistication. Perhaps
sophistication became too synonymous with cynicism. For fashion,
moving on might mean embracing a little innocence.

49ERS' RICE WORKS ON HIS KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice won't be doing much this week besides
ensuring his knee is progressing back to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers has been working
out regularly and underwent a minor operation earlier last month to
remove screws from his damaged left knee. The screws, which had
been placed inside the knee to facilitate healing after his second
operation, were taken out because of irritation within the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who injured the knee twice last season and played in only
two games, is expected to be at full strength when training camp
begins in July. As expected, coach Steve Mariucci won't have him
involved in too many drills this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's doing well, but he'll be very limited,'' Mariucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' final minicamp will run through Thursday. Mariucci
also held camps in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this minicamp is two-fold,'' Mariucci said.
``We're trying to progress with certain situations we haven't
practiced yet _ short-yardage, goal line, nickel and dime _ so when
we come to training camp it will be review. And we're going to
continue to evaluate our rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   One area Mariucci and his staff will be watching closely, as
they have since the offseason began, is offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pollack, the team's only proven reserve at the position,
recently underwent surgery to repair a disk in his back and won't
be able to practice until late July at the earliest. He suffered
the injury during a workout, and it's similar to a problem he
endured during the 1992 season. He spent that year on injured
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's injury leaves the 49ers with two experienced tackles
for this camp _ starters Derrick Deese and Jamie Brown. There's
little behind those two. Former starting right tackle Kirk
Scrafford retired earlier this offseason after struggling with a
bulging disk in his neck. Former tackle Harris Barton, who missed
all of last season with a bad knee, is expected to play guard this
season. As a result, two untested tackles, Dave Fiore and rookie
Tom Ruhman, can expect a fair amount of evaluation during this
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Pollack on the sidelines for this camp will be free
safety Merton Hanks, who still is recovering from surgery to repair
a torn chest muscle. He's expected to be ready for training camp.
Mariucci also is pleased with the progress that defensive end Gabe
Wilkins is making with his rehabilitation from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins' knee has been a question mark since he signed a
five-year, $20 million free-agent deal in February, and he won't
return until mid-August. However, it has helped make veteran
defensive Chris Doleman a happier player.
</P>
<P>
   Doleman recently signed a new deal and has been assured a chance
to compete for a starting job. His future with the team appeared
all but over when Wilkins joined the 49ers.

 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Astronauts report that one of the most striking
visions in space is approaching the Russian Mir space station,
which first appears as a distant point of light. Drawing closer,
Mir _ with its cruciform configuration of modules and arrays of
wing-like solar panels _ slowly begins to resemble a giant cosmic
insect glowing bright against the blackness of space.
</P>
<P>
   Now, visits to this celestial dragonfly by U.S. space shuttle
crews are about to end. After being a focus of U.S. manned space
activity for the last three years, stays on Mir are about to join
Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as historical artifacts of the
nation's space program.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir this week
and retrieve Andrew Thomas, a U.S. astronaut who has spent four
months conducting research on the Russian outpost. But unlike in a
half-dozen previous missions, the shuttle will not be carrying a
replacement astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to launch the Discovery Tuesday at 6:10 p.m. with a
six-member crew. During the next 10 days, the shuttle crew is to
rendezvous and dock with Mir, transfer more than a ton of supplies
to the station while retrieving a like amount of scientific
experiments and equipment, and bring Thomas back home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a mechanical engineer, is the last of seven Americans to
live and work on Mir during the past three years. The shuttle-Mir
program, which began in 1994 with Russian astronauts' joining the
crews on shuttle missions and a shuttle flying around the Russian
station, was billed as the first phase of a program leading to
building the planned international space station.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Thomas' flight, NASA officials say, U.S.
astronauts will have spent a total of 31 months on Mir, including a
continuous stretch of 27 months that began in March 1996. This
total of 962 crew days in orbit is more than Americans have
accumulated in 17 years of flying space shuttles on missions that
typically last less than two weeks, NASA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Culbertson Jr., an astronaut who directs the shuttle-Mir
program for NASA, says the program provided not only experience in
long-duration space flight and research, but also invaluable
lessons on how to run a multinational space station.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dealing with language and cultural differences,
he said, the experience contributed to crucial design changes in
the future space station and a better understanding of how to
handle crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine beginning the international space station
without what we've learned from shuttle-Mir,'' Culbertson said in
an interview, ``We learned that there was a lot we didn't know. We
learned from the problems that occurred and we learned a lot from
the Russians about how to run a space station.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals were to get engineering and operational experience,
and that's what we got,'' Culbertson said of the program, which he
said cost about $370 million, not counting shuttle flights to and
from Mir. The program was part of a $400 million, four-year
agreement signed by NASA in 1994 to compensate Russia for seven
shuttle-Mir docking missions for research and for financing a $100
million module for the proposed international station. In 1996,
NASA extended the program by adding $73 million for two additional
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The international space station is to be a giant research
outpost assembled in sections above Earth over a five-year period.
The project, estimated to cost more than $40 billion, is sponsored
by a partnership of 16 nations, including the United States,
Russia, Japan, Canada and members of the European Space Agency.
Construction of the station is tentatively set to begin this fall,
more than a year behind schedule. The delay has mainly been caused
by failure of the Russian Space Agency to get sufficient money to
complete a critical module that is to be the third piece of the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Thagard, a former astronaut who was the first
American to stay aboard Mir, said the cooperative program was worth
doing, despite some rough spots. Thagard, a physician and engineer,
was the only American to fly to Mir with his crewmates aboard a
Russian Soyuz spacecraft instead of an American craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost us very little to look over Russian shoulders and
learn how to _ and not how to in some cases _ run a space
station,'' said Thagard, who spent 115 days aboard Mir starting on
March 14, 1995. ``You would think that some astute engineers could
think things through and come up with everything you would need for
a good space station,'' he said. ``But there is no substitute for
being there and doing it to learn how to do something right.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While officials of the NASA and outside experts generally agree
that the shuttle-Mir program was valuable for both nations, it has
been a source of controversy from the beginning. Some critics saw
it as mainly a foreign aid program, a way for the United States to
subsidize a faltering Russian space program that has been short of
cash since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The effort was
designed, they say, to keep unemployed Russian engineers and
scientists from exporting rocket and weapons technology to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   The program came under increasing criticism last year after the
aging Mir, designed for a five-year life but now in its 12th year
of operation, suffered a series of problems and near-disasters that
threatened the safety of the Russian and U.S. astronauts aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a fire broke out in a Mir module when a solid-fuel
oxygen generator burned out of control for almost 14 minutes. The
crew, including the American astronaut Jerry Linenger, found that
the fire extinguishers aboard could not put out the blaze, which
blocked the route to the Soyuz escape capsule. The extinguishers
did manage to cool the walls until the flame died out.
</P>
<P>
   In June, while the crew was testing a new system for docking
Progress supply ships to Mir, a cargo vessel crashed into Mir,
damaging some solar power panels and cracking the hull of the
station's Spektr science module. As air leaked out of the station,
the crew, including an American, Michael Foale, prepared to escape
in the Soyuz vessel but was able instead to seal off Spektr and
restore pressure in the rest of the station.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these mishaps, Mir's control computers began
breaking down, setting the station adrift several times, and
cracked pipes leaked toxic coolant into the station.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about Mir's deteriorating condition and crew safety,
members of Congress, including the House Science Committee,
demanded that NASA certify Mir's safety before committing any more
Americans to long-term visits.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, NASA's inspector general, Roberta Gross,
released a report requested by the committee on Mir safety. In the
report and subsequent testimony, Ms. Gross listed numerous safety
concerns and questioned whether the agency was getting objective
analysis from the various groups it had asked to assess safety. In
a series of letters to agency officials, Col. Blaine Hammond, a
former shuttle pilot and the top safety official in the astronaut
office, called the Mir-shuttle program ``a disaster waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several powerful members of Congress, including space program
supporters like as Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who heads the
science committee, said the United States had learned enough from
having five astronauts stay aboard Mir for periods of four months
or longer and that the last two visits should be canceled. The
critics told Daniel Goldin, the administrator of the space agency,
that if he allowed any more Americans to stay aboard Mir, he would
be held personally responsible if anything went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the shuttle Atlantis took off for Mir last
Sept. 25, Goldin, saying that two safety committees concurred,
approved a four-month stay aboard Mir for the astronaut David Wolf.
Because of numerous repairs to Mir systems and the absence of any
major accidents, the stays of Wolf and Thomas, who replaced him
aboard the station, proved largely uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns were reasonably well grounded,'' said Dr. John
Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy
Institute. ``It was no picnic up there and probably more dangerous
than we would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon said the shuttle-Mir program produced valuable
information and experience for NASA at a bargain price, but it was
time to end it and start building the next space station. ``There
is both a sense of gratification and relief that we have gotten
through it without any of the really bad things happening,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The space agency says the shuttle-Mir experience resulted in a
long list of enhancements and modifications of the international
space station and its planned operations. For instance, managers
refined procedures for running the station from control centers in
the United States and Russia, where flight officers speak different
languages. One result was a better system of notifying partners of
emergencies, Culbertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fire on Mir occurred, it took 12 hours before we were
notified of it,'' he said. But after the collision, Culbertson
said, he was on the telephone with Russian controllers as the
astronauts were sealing the hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Other space station changes resulting from the shuttle-Mir
program include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Addition of more lights and sensors to help in rendezvous and
docking with the station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Demonstration of a wireless communications system that will
reduce the number of data cables needed throughout the station,
saving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes in computer programs, equipment and procedures to
allow simple, single-command shutdown of ventilation systems to
prevent fire from spreading, and improved fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enhanced emergency procedures, including quick disconnect
cables, in case of depressurization.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rerouting of cooling lines and electrical cables to prevent
moisture condensation, and adding a protective coating to coolant
lines to prevent corrosion and leaks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes in how fluids are vented from the space station, based
on studies in the vicinity of Mir of contamination from the purging
of fluids and waste.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved psychological support of crew members, including
enhanced electronic mail and news, better video and audio
conferences with family members, and routine delivery of CD-ROMs
containing mission-related information and recreational material.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better countermeasures to minimize the physical effects of
weightlessness, including using Russian methods of zeroing in on
specific muscles, like those in the neck, for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modified scheduling to give astronauts more flexibility in
completing daily tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA is expert at flying 10- to 14-day shuttle missions, but
operating a space station is very different,'' said Jim Van Laak,
deputy director of the shuttle-Mir program, ``It wasn't until we
began operating on Mir that we began to appreciate the subtleties
of this. It was quite a learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, questioned how much the lessons of the
shuttle-Mir program would apply to the new space station.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg, a Houston-based consultant on the Russian space
program, said NASA might be overstating the benefits gained from
the program. Mir and its systems are so different from the
international space station that some of the things learned are
irrelevant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned some critical things, such as how to work with the
Russians to jointly control a space station and the effects of
long-term flight on people, but we didn't need Mir to teach us to
address some safety issues more seriously,'' Oberg said. ``Most of
what was learned was obvious or could have been learned in
simulations. To brag about how much we learned on Mir is to brag
about how little we knew about space stations before we started
building one.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the shuttle-Mir program, questions remain on the
immediate fate of Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Russians planned to keep Mir in orbit until
December 1999, when the first elements of the international space
station are to be operational and routinely occupied. But the
United States has pushed for Russia to stop supporting Mir earlier,
perhaps as early as the spring of 1999, to free up the limited
supply of Progress supply ships and manned Soyuz capsules in
support of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, said
his nation's desperate cash shortage might force it to abandon Mir
a year earlier than planned and bring the station down as early as
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Using a series of rocket firings from attached Progress ships,
Russian astronauts plan to gradually lower Mir's orbit to an
altitude of 120 miles from 250 miles. Several weeks after the final
crew leaves Mir, Russian ground controllers will guide Mir into
Earth's atmosphere with a series of rocket firings.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the timetable, Mir is to end its life after a fiery
descent into the atmosphere, where most of it is to burn up and
heavier pieces of debris are to fall into the ocean, probably the
South Pacific.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As all readers of ``The Wind in the Willows'' know,
Mole, Rat and Badger are ever the most agreeable of companions. And
if Toad of Toad Hall is sometimes self-absorbed and silly and in
need of a good talking-to, well, that makes life among the
characters created by Kenneth Grahame in his classic tale of
friendship in the English countryside all the more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   So it is surely a pleasure to see these eternal friends brought
to life once again, this time in the equally agreeable New Victory
Theater, where an ambitious musical version of the 1908 children's
novel is playing through June 14.
</P>
<P>
   If this collaboration between the upstate resident theater
company Syracuse Stage and professors, recent graduates and
students of Syracuse University falls somewhere short of the pure
enchantment and innovative Orwellian political vision of last
year's short-lived film version, it is nevertheless a colorful,
cheery, tuneful and spirited return to Ratty's river, Toad Hall and
the unfriendly confines of the Wild Wood.
</P>
<P>
   As adapted and directed (with Anthony Salatino) by Gerardine
Clark, a professor in the Syracuse University Drama Department who
also wrote the intelligent lyrics, this production hits the high
spots of the novel. These include the meeting of Mole and Rat;
their truncated outing with Toad in his gypsy caravan; the
beginning of Toad's motor-car mania; Mole's excursion into the Wild
Wood; refuge with Badger; Toad's jailing and escape; the takeover
of Toad Hall by the weasels and stoats, and the friends' ultimate
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful cast is a definite plus. Both as a singer and as an
actor, Eric Collins makes a delightful Mole; the clear-voiced,
athletic Timothy A. Fitz-Gerald proves an agile Rat, and Michael
Poignand creates a properly dignified, wise and thoughtful Badger.
Lee Zarrett works hard as Toad, and Price Waldman makes a strong
impression as the magistrate who sentences the imprudent Toad to 19
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The consistently melodic score by Dianne Adams McDowell and
James McDowell is highlighted by the title tune, and the set by
Beowulf Boritt, the costumes by Mirena Rada, the lighting by A.
Nelson Ruger IV, the sound by David Schnirman and the sound effects
of James Wildman all play a powerful, unified role in evoking the
ambiance of the novel and the spirit of the familiar Ernest H.
Shepard illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   One could wish for a bit more in the way of dance (there's a
funny tango, though); English accents that remember not to stray
occasionally across the Atlantic; an elimination of the
magistrate's final cackles, and a more generous helping of
inventive humor.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as there is an engrossed child in the audience, as
there was on opening night, who helps out (and brings down the
house) by shouting, ``He went that way'' when Toad escapes Mole's
custody, all is well _ very well, indeed _ at Toad Hall.
</P>

TRADITIONS AND CHARM OF COLOMBIA

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What would a newcomer to Colombian folk dance have
learned from the program presented by the Ballet Nacional de
Colombia on Friday night at City Center? Not a great deal if that
newcomer understood no more than rudimentary Spanish, since the
commentary and single-sheet program information were in Spanish.
But this was an event that was clearly aimed at nostalgic displaced
Colombians, though the presentation was supported in part by City
Center. And their delight was eventually infectious, as they sang
and clapped along, sighed when a favorite dance was announced, and
cheered at the frequent mention of their native land.
</P>
<P>
   The program got off to a late and rocky start. Ballet Nacional,
founded in 1971 by Sonia Osorio, the company's artistic director,
choreographer and costume designer, has toured throughout the
world. But a surprising number of onstage and technical mishaps
here suggested there had been very little rehearsal time in New
York. By the second half, however, the charming, well-trained
dancers were irresistibly in command. The raucous, lilting music of
the live band took off. And the quality of the choreography, too
often of a nightclub glitziness at the start, rose considerably.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the evening's 18 dance numbers, which
reflected Colombia's Indian, African and Spanish heritage, was ``La
Cumbia,'' a group dance performed in the coastal villages. Opening
with a characteristic gliding trot for the machete-wielding men,
``La Cumbia'' built steadily with lines of candle-bearing women and
their men moving slowly back and forward and weaving across the
stage in dancing that was both exuberant and restrained. Another
highlight was the finale, ``Mercado Campesino'' (``Peasant
Market''), a piece that evoked Sunday market days in small towns in
the Andes. The swirling, vividly costumed processional included
vendors of fruit, vegetables and bread as well as birds, baskets
and utensils. A make-believe burro carried sacks of Colombian
coffee. An uppity customer accompanied by her scrambling maid wound
comically through the proceedings.

`THE SLEEPING BEAUTY': APPEALING, BUT NOT TO RESTLESS YOUNGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although most children surely know the story of ``The
Sleeping Beauty,'' the great ballet of that title is, at least in
its complete form, essentially for grown-ups. Just as long,
rhapsodic speeches in a poetic drama may delight adult ears but
make children restless, so the many beautiful solo variations of
``The Sleeping Beauty'' may tax young dancegoers' attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   To please audiences of all ages, American Ballet Theater
presented two versions of ``The Sleeping Beauty'' on Saturday at
the Metropolitan Opera House. In the evening, when Charles Barker
conducted, the production was danced in its entirety by a cast that
emphasized its choreographic glories.
</P>
<P>
   With her speedy leaps and turns and her unshakable balances,
Nina Ananiashvili was a confident Princess Aurora whose movements
possessed such clarity that they shone with diamantine brilliance.
Julio Bocca turned Prince Desire into an ardent hero. He and Ms.
Ananiashvili were in total harmony in a grandly scaled wedding pas
de deux that became a dance of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kent, a tender Aurora in an earlier performance, looked
equally sweet as the Lilac Fairy. And Martha Butler and Ethan
Stiefel offered a buoyant Blue Bird Pas de Deux.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon performance, billed as a special family matinee,
offered an abridged ``Sleeping Beauty,'' conducted by Jack Everly,
that might well have stimulated youngsters' imaginations without
taxing their patience. All the fairy variations were omitted except
for the Lilac Fairy's solo, which was warmly danced by Christina
Fagundes. Only the adagio of the Blue Bird Pas de Deux was
included, pleasantly performed by Ekaterina Shelkanova and Giuseppe
Picone, and the entire hunting scene was left out.
</P>
<P>
   Paloma Herrera made Aurora a quick and eager young princess. But
she also became appealingly wistful in the vision scene. Maxim
Belotserkovsky was a gallant prince. And Michael Owen was icily
haughty as the evil Carabosse.
</P>
<P>
   Some little girls in the audience dressed for the occasion,
wearing crowns on their heads and carrying magic wands in their
hands. Others brought dolls and teddy bears to the theater.
Everyone ought to have had a good time.

ARTE TV EYES ALL OF EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France _ Most Europeans still think of themselves as
French, German, Italian, British or whatever first and Europeans
second. Even the weather reports on the nightly television news in
any country seldom report what is happening just across the border.
So building a truly European public television station was a mighty
challenge for Arte, a Franco-German cultural broadcasting channel
based in this European city, when it started up six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arte now transmits cultural and public affairs programming in
French and German by satellite to 50 million homes from North
Africa and Israel to Scandinavia. The programming is produced by
the French, German, Belgian, Swiss, Spanish, Austrian and Polish
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically based in a Rhineland city claimed by both France
and Germany over the centuries and last fought over in World War
II, the Arte consortium has a budget of $280 million, most of it
provided from the television tax that France and Germany levy on
all set owners.
</P>
<P>
   The original French and German stations that set up Arte produce
most of what it uses, but it has its own Spartan production
facilities scattered over this Alsatian capital. The people who run
it say they want to do for European cultural television what CNN
and Britain's Sky News have done for commercial news television,
but in a distinctively European way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning that although we were a
Franco-German enterprise, our future lay in Europe,'' said Hans
Robert Eisenhauer, the station's deputy program director, over a
glass of riesling and a plate of Alsatian pike-perch and sauerkraut
at a restaurant near the station recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we'd like to be developing more extensive links
with British producers at the BBC or Channel Four television,
because without English you can't have a truly European network,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   You probably can't do it by broadcasting only in the evening,
either, as Arte has had to do because of limits on available
broadcast time in Germany. There, Kinderkanal, a public channel for
children, suddenly metamorphoses into grown-up Arte at 7 p.m. In
France, as La Sept/Arte, it shares space until then with La
Cinquieme, a public channel with which it may eventually merge. In
both countries, it continues until the small hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite and German cable subscribers can zap onto either the
French or the German soundtrack as they like, a possibility that
French technology does not yet permit. But Arte is not for
everybody. It had an average market share of 3.3 percent in France
last year and only 0.6 percent in Germany, where more channels
compete for viewer attention.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the station here take comfort from surveys showing
that 27 million people overall of continental Europe last year
watched regularly last year. Still, with more than 300 million
European citizens, there's obviously a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both France and Germany today, there is far more national
programming, particularly in movies, than there was 10 years ago,''
said Andreas Schreitmueller, who commissions movies for Arte and is
German like Eisenhauer.
</P>
<P>
   When European leaders defend European culture against the influx
of Hollywood entertainment, Schreitmueller said, the result is the
production of more French, German, Italian, etc. television movies
and entertainment programs, not more ``European'' ones.
</P>
<P>
   Arte tries for a more international flavor; for the end of this
year, it has commissioned a series of hourlong films by African,
European, Brazilian, Canadian and Taiwanese directors called ``The
Collection 2000 Seen by ...'' What the films have in common,
Schreitmueller said, is at least one scene dealing with the final
minutes of the 20th century a year hence. For instance, Don
McKellar's Canadian entry, ``Last Night,'' has the world end
promptly with 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're always looking for is a new perspective, a new way
of looking at things,'' he said. ``Internationalism is a big part
of that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   All the movies that Arte broadcasts have to be prepared with two
soundtracks, in French and German, or if in English, with French
and German subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also thinking of doing a 10-week family soap series that
would take place in the cities that have been designated European
cultural capitals,'' Schreitmueller said. ``One episode might play
in Cracow, the next in Bologna, the next in Avignon, in Santiago de
Compostela and so on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arte aspires to be cultural television, and high culture at
that, but isn't afraid to poke fun at itself, particularly with its
imaginative logos and promotion spots. One of them features an
actor posing as George Harrison in Liverpool or Herbert von Karajan
in Bayreuth, always of course making a pitch for Arte programs,
under the slogan ``Arte looks at Europe, and Europe watches Arte.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious image, and we want that, but we don't want
to scare off people by making them think we're elitist,'' said
Henri L'Hostis, who leads a team of graphic artists that produces
Arte spots.
</P>
<P>
   News consumes 11 percent of the $175 million program budget,
with a nightly magazine-format program at 7:30 weekdays and the
main daily news report, with no anchor and voice-over news clips,
at 8:30. On Saturdays, the 7:30 p.m. slot is filled by ``Parallel
History,'' a series that often takes events of World War II and
analyzes how differently movie news programs of the day covered
them in countries on opposite sides (Germany, Britain, Russia and
occupied France, for instance).
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to look at events in a different way from the national
news programs,'' said Georg Schmolz, director of news programming,
who now has two correspondents in Bonn and Paris and uses a bicycle
to get around to the five different news production sites that Arte
has in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
   With a slightly bigger budget, he says, the news programs will
start at 7:50 p.m. and run consecutively for nearly an hour, with
in-depth explorations of the main events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, three, four or five consecutive evening
programs are devoted to aspects of a single subject.
``Falsifications: Appearance and Reality'' last January, for
instance, started with Helmut Dietl's 1991 film ``Schtonk,'' a
satire based on a Hitler-diaries hoax that fooled the German weekly
magazine Stern, among others, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The evening of fakery continued through two documentaries on
Konrad Kujau, the counterfeiter who pulled off the diary fraud. It
ended with a game that tested viewers' own credulity, quizzing them
and then giving the answers after a documentary that showed how
easy it is to manipulate photographs and videotapes electronically.

3 SEATTLE ARTISTS NAMED TO RECEIVE MACARTHUR `GENIUS' GRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three Seattle artists _ two writers who teach in the
creative writing program at the University of Washington and a
video artist _ are among the 29 winners of this year's ``genius
grant'' fellowships conferred by the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle winners of the prestigious awards are Linda Bierds, a
53-year-old poet from Bainbridge Island who is chair of the UW's
creative writing program; Charles Johnson, the 50-year-old novelist
and National Book Award winner who also teaches in UW creative
writing program; and Gary Hill, a 47-year-old video artist with an
international reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur awards, which are shrouded in secrecy and
speculation, are intended to honor creativity in all fields of
human endeavor. They confer, over five years, a six-figure grant
with no strings attached, in hopes of spurring time and resources
for recipients to devote to their work.
</P>
<P>
   The actual amount conferred is determined by the fellow's age.
Bierds will receive a grant of $320,000, Johnson $305,000 and Hill
$290,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bierds and Johnson Monday expressed surprise and delight at
their selection, which they learned of last Wednesday but had to
keep secret until the awards were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bierds said she was in the midst of preparing a grilled cheese
sandwich at her home when the call came from the MacArthur
Foundation office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caller asked if I was familiar with the `work of the
foundation' and, for one moment, I thought he was going to ask for
a donation,'' Bierds related. ``But when he then told me that I had
been awarded a MacArthur fellowship, I immediately became
incoherent, saying, `Oh no! Oh no! I don't believe it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has had some dealings with the MacArthur Foundation
in the past, returned a call on his answering machine from the
foundation, with every expectation that he was going to be asked to
give a comment on a prospective fellow. When he himself turned out
to be an award winner, Johnson kept his characteristic cool on the
phone, but not after he hung up.

<P>
   ``Then I fell apart,'' Johnson recalled. ``I finally had to sit
down and meditate in order to focus myself. . . . I felt like I won
the lottery, even though I didn't buy a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierds and Johnson were particularly thrilled to have two
MacArthur winners from the small creative writing program in the
UW's Department of English _ which foundation officials described
as ``a rare coicidence.'' Richard Kenney, a poet who also teaches
creative writing at the UW, is a past MacArthur fellow, which means
that three of the 10 teachers in the small program (40 graduate
students) have now received this distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Socolow, director of the MacArthur Foundation, said
Monday, ``To have three fellows does say something about that
program _ that is doing well indeed and must have some wonderfully
talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur awards come at a particularly propitious time for
the three Seattle winners.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of Hill's video work is now at the Donald Young
Gallery on Capitol Hill, where it is the final exhibition before
the gallery closes. Hill is the 1995 winner of the Venice
Biennale's top prize for sculpture, among other awards.
</P>
<P>
   In making the grant to Hill, the MacArthur Foundation praised
the self-educated artist for being ``one of the major video artists
of his generation.'' It described him, in a written statement, as
``a formalist of the medium of video, noted for his precision, his
capacity to structure illusion and space.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierds published her fifth volume of verse at the end of last
year, ``The Profile Makers.'' It is a powerful and profound
meditation on various ways that images are captured, from paintings
to silhouettes to code, with reflections as well on life, death,
grief, war and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Profile Makers,'' which Bierds wrote with the assistance
of a Guggenheim Fellowship, has received the strongest praise of
any of her collections. Only two hours before the call from the
MacArthur Foundation, Bierds received a call informing her that
``The Profile Makers'' has won the PEN/West prize for poetry from
the writers organization.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation praised Bierds as ``a poet whose
attention to historical detail and to narratives of lyric
description sets her apart from the prevailing contemporary
styles.'' It also said that ``her verse is clear, efficient and
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this MacArthur award has already done for me is give me
such a boost of confidence,'' Bierds emphasized. ``I'm leaving for
Europe next week for work on my next book and now I can't wait to
get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had recently returned to Seattle after completing an
arduous national tour to 23 cities on behalf of his new novel,
``Dreamer,'' the first fictional treatment of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. This challenging intellectual novel focuses on
King's beliefs, especially the philosophical underpinnings of
non-violence.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation praised Johnson as an artist whose
``works address fundamental philosophical questions and transcend
the boundaries of class, ethnicity and culture that separate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's wide-ranging works (from cartoons to screenplays to
novels) recently were the subject of their first book-length
appraisal, ``Charles Johnson's Spiritual Imagination'' (University
of Missouri Press, 172 pages, $19.95) by Jonathan Little.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won the 1990 National Book Award for his novel, ``Middle
Passage,'' which examined the African slave trade. Johnson said the
MacArthur is far more significant to him than the National Book
Award, especially since it honors people in many disciplines and
also provides a degree of financial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue with my work,'' Johnson emphasized. ``And I
will get back to work, once this shock wears off.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation has awarded 531 fellowships and spent
$166 million on its ``genius grants'' since the program's inception
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Among the past winners are 10 people who live in the Seattle
area: James F. Blinn, computer animation; Thomas L. Daniel,
biology; Victoria E. Foe, biology; Mott T. Greene, history; Richard
Kenney, poetry; Suzanne D. Liebsock, history; Margie J. Profet,
biology; John E. Toews, history; Trimpin (cq no first name), music;
Richard White, history.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation has assets of $4 billion (which makes
it unlikely that it would be using telephone solicitation to seek
donations from poets).

HIGH COURT OPENS DOOR TO SUITS AGAINST FEC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday opened the door to
lawsuits against the Federal Election Commission by voters claiming
that the commission has not adequately enforced the disclosure
requirements imposed by federal law on certain political groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision, recognizing what the court referred to as
``voter standing,'' was surprising for a court that has often
appeared to go out of its way to shield federal agencies from
having to defend their administrative actions in court.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued on behalf of the FEC that
lawsuits of this type expressed no more than ``generalized
grievances,'' shared by the populace at large, and were not
sufficiently particular or concrete to come within the jurisdiction
of the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was, however, little more than a pyrrhic victory
for the plaintiffs in the case, six former politicians and
diplomats who oppose U.S. support for Israel and were trying to
force the FEC to require a leading pro-Israel lobbying group to
disclose membership and financial information.
</P>
<P>
   While ruling that the six men were entitled to bring their
lawsuit, the court sent the merits of the nine-year-old dispute
back to the election commission under circumstances that make it
highly likely that the organization, the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, will never have to make the disclosures the
plaintiffs have been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, which was
joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined
by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The case presented the substantive question _ of interest to a
broad array of grass-roots lobbying organizations _ of the
definition of a ``political committee'' under the FEC Act of 1971.
Under the law, political committees must comply with extensive
record-keeping and disclosure rules, which include listing any
donor who gives the group more than $200 in a year as well as
disclosing the amount and purpose of expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines a political committee as ``any committee'' that
receives or spends more than $1,000 in a given year for the purpose
of ``influencing any election for federal office.'' The six
plaintiffs in this case sought in 1989 to have the FEC apply this
definition to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known
as AIPAC, and to require disclosure of its members and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   AIPAC, a nonprofit membership organization that does not endorse
candidates or make direct political contributions, argued that it
was not a political committee within the meaning of the law.
Because its spending was for communication to its own dues-paying
membership of 50,000 on political subjects of mutual interest,
AIPAC said, it did not meet the $1,000 threshold to be counted as a
political committee.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC did not agree, but it decided not to make AIPAC subject
to the disclosure requirements in any event. If an organization did
not have as its ``major purpose'' the nomination or election of
candidates, the commission said, it would not be considered a
political committee even if it came within the law's technical
definition. On appeal, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled last year that there was no basis in the
law for the ``major purpose'' test and that the commission would
have to treat AIPAC as a political committee.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, FEC vs. Akins, No. 96-1590, the
commission argued vigorously that the six plaintiffs never had
standing to bring their suit in the first place. The government
argued that a policy dispute with the commission did not
sufficiently distinguish these plaintiffs from others with
generalized grievances or give them the concrete, personal stake in
the litigation required by Article III of the Constitution, which
limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to ``cases or
controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs was Paul Findley, a former Republican
member of Congress from Illinois who has blamed AIPAC for his
re-election defeat in 1982 and has publicly referred to the federal
government as ``Israeli-occupied territory.'' Another, James Akins,
is a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. All are highly
critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion for the court Monday, Breyer offered a two-part
analysis for why the plaintiffs, and other voters in future cases,
were entitled to bring the election commission into court. First,
he said, the wording of the 1971 law, which authorizes ``any party
aggrieved by an order of the commission dismissing a complaint'' to
file suit in U.S. District Court, indicated that Congress intended
to permit suits of this kind, particularly when the suit requested
information of the kind that the law requires to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   And further, Breyer said, the lawsuit met constitutional
requirements by asserting a ``genuine injury in fact'' _ the
plaintiffs' inability to obtain information that, if they are
correct about the law, they have a right to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The informational injury at issue here,'' Breyer said,
``directly related to voting, the most basic of political rights,
is sufficiently concrete and specific such that the fact that it is
widely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutional power to
authorize its vindication in the federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he continued, the court should not address the validity
of the disputed definition of a political committee because the
commission was currently considering a new rule that could make the
question irrelevant to AIPAC's status.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's proposal would take a broader view of the type
of ``membership organization'' that AIPAC has always claimed to be,
a change that would in turn be likely to treat AIPAC's expenditures
as ``membership communications'' rather than the kind of spending
that would bring it within the definition of a political committee.
In that eventuality, Breyer said, the campaign law would not apply
and the dispute over the commission's ``major purpose'' test would
be moot.
</P>
<P>
   AIPAC was not a party in the case before the court, but filed a
friend of the court brief suggesting the course the court took
Monday. A lawyer for the group, Thomas Hungar, said Monday that the
court ``did exactly what we asked'' and that AIPAC would ``clearly
qualify'' as a membership organization under the commission's
proposed new approach.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Scalia said the court had expanded
the concept of standing ``beyond what the Constitution permits''
and that consequently the court should have interpreted the 1971
law more narrowly so as not to allow the lawsuit. ``A system in
which the citizenry at large could sue to compel executive
compliance with the law would be a system in which the courts,
rather than of the president, are given the primary responsibility
to `take care that the laws be faithfully executed,' '' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, Andrew Killgore, said his group would
continue to press for AIPAC to be defined as a political committee
and expected to prevail in forcing disclosure of AIPAC's
activities. ``In the clear light of day, AIPAC's activities will
cease to be those of an 800-pound gorilla on Capitol Hill when it
comes to U.S. policies in the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second case Monday, the court agreed to hear a government
appeal in one of the country's longest-running immigration cases,
the effort to deport a group of seven Palestinians and a Kenyan for
their activities in support of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The government has lost most of the numerous legal battles in
the 11-year-old case. Most recently, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in San Francisco, ruled last July that a preliminary
injunction against deportation should be kept in effect to enable
the eight to collect further evidence to support their claim that
they are victims of selective prosecution based on constitutionally
protected advocacy of an unpopular political viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   While the government regards the Popular Front as a terrorist
group, the eight have been involved in fund-raising and have not
been charged with any acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration law has changed several times during the
course of the case. The government is now arguing that the most
recent change, the 1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility Act, retroactively stripped the
federal courts of jurisdiction over the case and should be applied
to lift the injunction. The government argues that the new law left
the courts with jurisdiction to review only a final order of
deportation, which has not yet been issued.
</P>
<P>
   In its order Monday granting review of the case, Reno vs.
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, No. 97-1252, the
justices narrowed the question to an intepretation of the
jurisdictional provisions of the new law. However, because the
lower courts have found that the Palestinians' First Amendment
rights are at stake, the justices may have to address the question
of whether Congress can close the courthouse door to constitutional
challenges to immigration decisions.

FREE TRADE ZONE TIGHTENS RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLON, Panama _ ``A den of pirates,'' one U.S. government
official snorted when asked about the warren of shops, warehouses
and banks just off the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal. In
recent books, spy novelist John Le Carre has portrayed the
1.5-square-mile walled compound as a steamy, seedy nest of intrigue
where, for the right price and with the right contacts, just about
anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   That much isn't fiction. The free-trade zone here is the largest
in the world outside Hong Kong, selling more than $6.2 billion in
goods each year to customers from all over Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But name a dubious commercial activity of interest to U.S.
law-enforcement or intelligence agencies, and chances are someone
has been caught doing it in Colon. The laundering of drug money,
the smuggling of arms to guerrilla and paramilitary groups in South
and Central America, the sale of goods to Cuba in defiance of the
U.S. economic embargo, the counterfeiting of trademarks _ all have
traditionally been part of the local landscape, perhaps reaching a
peak during the corrupt military dictatorship of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as it prepares to celebrate its 50th Anniversary, the
Colon Free Zone is trying to clean up its act. With competing
duty-free centers popping up all over the Western Hemisphere, it is
scrambling to hold onto the business that for decades it all but
owned. Huge new ports have been built, rail lines upgraded, fees
lowered and inefficiencies attacked. And, to make sure the world
takes the image change seriously, it has launched one of the
harshest crackdowns on money laundering in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to position ourselves for the 21st century as a huge
distribution and transshipment center to all of Latin America,''
said Nessim Bassan, vice president of Fila Sportwear Corp. and a
former president of the Colon Free Zone Users' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Established in June 1948, the Colon Free Zone has enjoyed a
virtual monopoly on free trade in Latin America for most of its
existence because governments almost everywhere else imposed high
tariffs on foreign goods to protect inefficient domestic
industries.
</P>
<P>
   For smugglers, this protectionism created a market of 450
million people stretching from Tijuana just south of the U.S.
border to Tierra del Fuego at South America's southernmost tip.
Merchants from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti, Jamaica, the
Dominican Republic and other nearby countries flocked here, knowing
they could always find the electronic appliances, car parts,
clothing, liquor, perfume and jewelry their customers wanted but
could not obtain legally at home.
</P>
<P>
   Asian manufacturers were especially quick to pour their goods
into the free-zone pipeline; today, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan account for about 60 percent of the goods sold from
here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the global economy of the 1990s, many of the old
protectionist barriers have fallen, a process that is expected to
accelerate as a result of last month's summit meeting of
hemispheric heads of state in Santiago, Chile. Spurred by the North
American Free Trade Agreement and other regional pacts, countries
throughout Latin America are racing to open their markets, and
rival free-trade zones have now emerged to challenge Colon's
hegemony at sites as far-flung as Miami, Manaus in Brazil, Iquique
in Chile and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to reinvent themselves,'' said Victoria
Figge, the Free Zone's government-appointed chief administrator
from 1994 to 1997 and now the head of the Panamanian government's
money-laundering monitoring unit. ``The rules of the game worldwide
are totally different now, and they have to adjust themselves to
these new conditions and better exploit our privileged geographic
position'' at the mouth of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody thinks they are up to the task. Richard Wainio,
the just-retired director of planning for the Panama Canal
Commission, the U.S. government body charged with administering the
waterway until its handover to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, predicts
that Colon's role will shrink as world trade expands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the doomsayers,'' Wainio said. ``The zone is a huge
operation, and it's not going to disappear. But the future lies in
container transshipment, not warehousing. As barriers come down and
you have a free flow of goods, you don't need that kind of
operation conducted, legally or no, out of the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders here, though, say they are adjusting to the new
realities, and they point to a 15.6 percent increase in business
last year as proof. Even with the regional boom in free trade, they
argue, it is both quicker and cheaper for merchants in nearby
countries to rely on Colon as a distribution point than to deal
directly with manufacturers in Asia or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a huge warehouse,'' with up to $1.5 billion in goods on
hand at any time, said Nidal Waked, the current president of the
users' association that represents the zone's more than 1,200
businesses. ``We have everything here. If you want to put together
a container with a thousand different products, you can do it here,
and we can get it to you in almost no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign manufacturers also have reason to retain the Colon
connection rather than to export directly to Latin American buyers,
merchants here said. ``We know what the Colombian, the Venezuelan,
the Chilean likes because we have people who travel there every two
weeks to visit clients,'' said Waked, whose family business, Vida
Panama, sells refrigerators, washing machines, stoves and microwave
ovens. ``I suppose that the big brands could do that, but they
would have to start from zero, and why do that when we are here and
have 50 years of experience?''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the zone's growth was slowed by high fees,
inefficiency, corruption and theft at the nearby port of Cristobal.
But that problem has been attacked by huge investments in projects
to speed up the shipment of goods across the isthmus. A pair of
giant container terminals have recently opened here, two more are
nearing completion, and a railway line across the isthmus is being
renovated. All these measures have ended Cristobal's monopoly and
slashed freight costs in half.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Panamanian authorities have taken drastic
action to make Colon less attractive to the drug cartels from
Colombia and Mexico that have laundered billions of dollars here
over the years. Since 1996, businesses here have been required to
declare all transactions that exceed $10,000, for instance, and can
no longer accept traditional forms of payment like money orders,
travelers checks, third-party transfers or checks drawn on Mexican
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules _ which on paper are even tougher than those in the
United States _ have not been especially popular among traders, who
argue that they are losing business to other free zones, Miami in
particular. In any case, many of them have never acquired the habit
of asking questions of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the money comes from, I can't say,'' said Marcos Almed
Meza, a salesman for Nemo Traders, a small merchant house that
sells clothing and electronic appliances. ``If a customer has made
a declaration, then it's not my problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the efforts to clean up traditional financing
practices have drawn mixed reviews. While Panamanian officials tend
to emphasize the progress that has been made, their U.S.
counterparts take a more jaundiced view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want to wean themselves from this, but they don't
quite know how to do it yet,'' said a U.S. government official who
specializes in money laundering. ``Something has happened to open
the dialogue, but I have to be very candid: This isn't a honeymoon,
and we are not going to be happy until the whole system is
disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen the erosion of their traditional franchises, tax
evasion and smuggling and black marketeering, since they are not
the sole source anymore,'' the official continued. ``So they feel
they have to start tightening up and not be tagged as a rogue
money-laundering center.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders here have drawn the line, however, at helping the United
States enforce its economic embargo against Cuba. For decades, the
Cuban government has come here to buy products it cannot obtain
from the United States _ from television sets and air conditioners
for hotels to car parts and pharmaceuticals _ and is treated as a
prized customer.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian businesses, Ms. Figge said, ``have the right to deal
with whomever we want, as long as we do so according to our laws.''
But ``if an American company uses the Free Zone to divert its
products to Cuba, that's a different matter,'' she added, one best
resolved by American authorities. ``What can we do under our laws
to stop it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about weapons deals also persist, especially in light
of recent news reports of arms shipments to Croatia and to both
paramilitary and guerrilla forces in neighboring Colombia that
appear to have been channeled through the Free Zone. But Giovanni
Ferrari, vice president of Farmazona, a pharmaceutical concern, who
is also a former president of the users association, dismissed such
dealings as an aberration of the Noriega period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a large degree of tolerance on the part of the
government to do those operations, which is no longer the case in
Panama,'' he said. ``The cronies who operated with carte blanche in
the Free Zone are not there anymore, so I would say there is very,
very little of that. In fact, I would even go so far as to say it
may have been eradicated.''

CLINTON TO ENTER CENSUS FRAY OVER NEW COUNTING PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's census for 2000 already has
politicians playing the numbers game and the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton enters the debate Tuesday in Houston on the
side of the Census Bureau and Democrats who want a new counting
method they claim will better tally minorities and poor people left
out of the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, who claim the new method is unconstitutional,
hope to put the issue before the Supreme Court this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are billions of dollars in public and private funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far going to be the most controversial census
ever,'' said a Republican staff member involved in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The last major census controversy was in 1920 when the
population count revealed more Americans living in cities than the
country for the first time. Rural lawmakers refused to procede with
the reapportionment that would have cost them control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will appear Tuesday at the Magnolia Multi-Service Center
near downtown Houston to hold a round-table discussion with
business executives, minority leaders and academics to talk about
the impact of the 2000 census and the need for an accurate count.
It will mark the first time Clinton has entered the census fray.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Census Bureau plan, developed by the National
Academy of Sciences, to use a statistical sampling, rather than an
actual hard count, of 10 percent of the population to project the
number of people who fail to respond either by mail or to personal
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials fear statistical sampling, which
would add more low-income people who traditionally vote Democratic,
could cost them as many as 24 House seats and 400 seats in state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies politics is a motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first census of the information age. It makes
sense to use the most modern technology to ensure that we get the
most accurate information,'' said spokeswoman Ann Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is the most accurate census using the most up-to-date
scientific methods and the best technology with the most
cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was chosen as the venue for Clinton's first remarks on
the topic, Lewis said, because the city had a big undercount of
Hispanics. Officials estimate 66,748 people, most of them Hispanics
and children, were left uncounted in Houston. They estimate 482,738
people, half of them children, were uncounted for the state of
Texas, one of the largest disparities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials estimate the 1990 undercount cost the state $1
billion in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the newest Americans, the ones we
most need to learn about, are the hardest ones to find,'' said
Stephen Klineberg, professor of sociology at Rice University and
director of the annual Houston Area Survey. He will be on the panel
discussing the issue with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the hardest to convince that it's safe to fill out the
census. They're the hardest to reach in terms of language and in
terms of mobility because they've just arrived and they don't have
a permanent residence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement that the 1990 census left out a
significant number of people, but no one knows how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accuracy is critically important because America is in the
process of rapid social change and rapid demographic change and
only the census gives a meaningful picture of what's actually
happening,'' Klineberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee
on the census, disputed the accuracy of the sampling system and
suggested that politics was the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partisan calculations of political science are driving the
Clinton administration census sampling scheme,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than committing himself to do the hard work necessary
to end the minority undercount, the president is out peddling
statistical snake oil to the public that will add millions of
`virtual people' in some areas while subtracting millions of real
people from other areas,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for
economic affairs, said no American will be subtracted from the
count and that the sampling method was developed by statisticians,
not politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real stake is how well is America governed,'' Shapiro
said. ``The census data is used in the allocation of $180 billion
in federal funds every year. Census data is used for the planning
and evaluation of scores of very important federal programs. It's
used to make decisions about where to site hospitals, where to
build schools, where to build sewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said he is baffled by the Republican
reaction to the census plan. He said the people who weren't counted
already live in congressional districts and already are registered
to vote. The main issue, he said, was one of financial fairness to
growing states such as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican staff member maintained if the bureau had used
statistical sampling in 1990 it would have mistakenly given an
additional House seat to Arizona and taken one away from
Pennsylvania. A sampling the bureau conducted after the last
enumeration contained many errors that officials repeatedly
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point to a General Accounting Office report
released in March. The report concluded that the bureau remains
confident about its ability but the GAO officials expressed concern
``that important questions remain unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans maintain the Census Bureau could continue its
old enumeration plan but update its address lists and coordinate
with other agencies such as Medicaid. The ``actual enumeration'' is
required by the Constitution, they argue in their lawsuit. Houston
and other cities have contested the GOP court action, which will go
directly to the Supreme Court once the district court makes its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But Klineberg noted the first enumerators in 1790 left out a
critical element of the population _ American Indians _ a
difficulty akin to surveying today's reluctant immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the idea of a census was accuracy and it turns out
it's politics,'' Klineberg said. &QL;

SILVER LAUNCH FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM BELMONT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nick Zito, who lost Halory Hunter five days before the Preakness
with an ankle injury, lost his shot at the Belmont Stakes Monday
when an ankle injury forced him to withdraw Silver Launch six days
before the final race in the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Silver Launch left a prospective field of 11 for
the 130th running of the Belmont, not counting Grand Slam, the
winner of the Peter Pan Stakes one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam's status is still being evaluated by his trainer, D.
Wayne Lukas, who has to decide by Thursday morning whether to enter
the colt.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam, winner of the Belmont Futurity and the Champagne
Stakes last fall, was severely cut on the leg during the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile and did not run in the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. But he ran powerfully in the Peter Pan.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Launch's injury was detected Sunday afternoon at Belmont
Park when he began favoring his right leg, which seemed to be
swollen. Zito called Dr. Jim Hunt, who took X-rays of both legs,
found a chip in the left ankle and reasoned that the right leg was
swollen from stress because the colt had been babying his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we could have had fun in the race,'' Zito said.
``Maybe not win it, but be up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Launch, who figured to be a long shot in the Belmont, has
won two of his 13 starts and ran in the money seven times. In his
most recent appearance, he ran second to Thomas Jo in the Sir
Barton Stakes at Pimlico on Preakness Day.
</P>
<P>
   There was no racing Monday at Belmont Park, but a festive mood
was gathering in anticipation of Real Quiet's attempt to become the
12th horse to win the Triple Crown. Real Quiet, who won the
Kentucky Derby by half a length and the Preakness by two and a
quarter lengths _ both times beating Victory Gallop _ will earn a
$5 million bonus if he sweeps the three races.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the second year in a row that his trainer, Bob
Baffert of California, is taking aim at the feat. He got there last
year with Silver Charm, who missed winning the Belmont by
three-quarters of a length to Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was keeping Real Quiet in virtual seclusion at Churchill
Downs before flying his horse to New York tomorrow. Real Quiet
galloped a mile and three-eighths Monday morning, and will work
five furlongs Tuesday before being shipped to Belmont Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very boring here,'' Baffert said from Churchill
Downs. ``But things are good. He looks good. He's put all his
weight back that he lost after the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet in the Derby and the
Preakness, was planning to fly from his home in Los Angeles to
Louisville to join Baffert and the colt's owner, Mike Pegram,
before traveling together to New York. The jockey said he had been
pumping Gary Stevens, who rode Silver Charm in last year's Triple
Crown, for advice on the final act in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pinned Gary in a corner and tried to get everything from him
on how to conduct myself this week,'' Desormeaux said. ``He's been
there. I know that it's the opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt this horse can go a mile and a half. We don't
run that distance too often. It takes a lot out of a horse. But if
there is any horse today who can get a mile and a half, it's Real
Quiet. He's no sprinter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram, who bought Real Quiet as a yearling for $17,000,
agreed that the distance would not defeat the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distance will not be a problem,'' Pegram said. ``If we
lose the race, it will not be because he had to run an extra
quarter-mile beyond the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Belmont track early Monday morning, Parade Ground put in
his final breeze, going five furlongs in 1:02. At Churchill Downs,
the Lukas colt Yarrow Brae worked five furlongs in 1:00 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other horses preparing to take their shot at Real
Quiet were expected to hold final workouts Tuesday or Wednesday
after heavy rainstorms Sunday night made the track muddy and forced
them to delay their countdown to the main event.

FARMERS SEEKING DROUGHT-STRICKEN STATUS IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ With no crops in the ground and scant
prospect of significant rain, farmers in Galveston and other
southeast Texas counties are expecting major losses this year.
</P>
<P>
   To help soften the blow, farmers are asking county commissioners
courts to start the paperwork for declaration of their counties by
state and federal officials as drought-stricken areas qualified for
insurance payments, low-cost loans and other possible aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Galveston County was only a half-inch off on its normal
annual rainfall as the new month began, Monday marked the 76th day
with no rain on about 30,000 acres of land on which milo, corn and
soybeans normally would have been growing this time of year, farmer
and rancher J.B. Evans told commissioners court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not how much rain we had, but when it fell,''
Evans said after addressing commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   March's 1.92 inches marked the last rain in Galveston County,
Evans said. Nearly 13 inches fell in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Early rains kept farmers from preparing fields for planting and
lack of rain since late March left fields without the moisture
needed for planting seed, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have had five inches of rain in May,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's affected a lot of people, even the rice farmers,'' said
Evans, who said his losses could hit $150,000. ``Most of them got
their rice planted, but with the weather the way it is, it's going
to kill the quality of the crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he has talked with officials at the National Weather
Service about the lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national weather bureau is not quite ready to holler
`disaster' because we're actually only a half-inch off in annual
rainfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans lives in Algoa in western Galveston County but plants
crops on about 1,200 acres of land near La Marque.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston County Judge Jim Yarbrough agreed Monday to forward a
request for disaster declaration to state officials as soon as he
gets the necessary paperwork in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Campbell, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Farm Service Agency in Galveston and Brazoria counties, plans to
ask Brazoria County Judge John Willey to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from state and federal agencies will meet at her
Angleton office Tuesday to discuss drought problems and assess
existing and future agricultural losses, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration process is especially important in
making crop insurance claims, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers ``don't recognize drought as a cause for claims on
insurance unless it's documented through the county,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said farmers might be able to plant soybeans if they get
enough rain by June 15 to moisten fields.

MEDIA SHOULD STAY OUT OF HOSTAGE SITUATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the life of a hostage is at stake, the news media need to
butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some did not do so last month when an armed
killer was holed up with a hostage in a service station north of
Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa radio station and the St. Petersburg Times drew
criticism from law enforcement officers and a journalism ethics
scholar for contacting the killer before officers were able to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of the two hurt the credibility of all the news
media at a time when journalists cannot afford such damage.
</P>
<P>
   You probably read about Hank Earl Carr's deadly rampage on May
19. What you probably did not hear about was the deplorable
performance by the radio station and the newspaper, because it drew
little national attention. It should have.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's rampage began with the slaying of the 4-year-old son of
Carr's girlfriend in their Tampa apartment. Carr was arrested but
managed to slip out of his handcuffs and kill two Tampa homicide
detectives who were accompanying him in a car.
</P>
<P>
   In his flight north from Tampa, he killed a state trooper before
abandoning his car and taking a 27-year-old female clerk hostage in
a service station. Carr later killed himself after recounting his
killing spree and releasing his hostage.
</P>
<P>
   When law enforcement officers tried to contact him by phone at
the service station, the line was busy because Carr had already
been contacted by Don Richards, news director for radio station
WFLA-AM, who kept the fugitive on the line for six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Ellis, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times, also managed
to get Carr on the line for a brief time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our negotiators were trying to make contact and (Carr) was on
the phone with the radio stations that were trying to get a
scoop,'' Hernando County Sheriff Thomas Mylander said later.
``We're going to have to get some control if they won't control
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole said that police finally were
forced to call the radio station and ask it to get off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Richards and his boss defended the call to Carr. ``My first rule
is, do no harm,'' the Times quoted him as saying. ``And if they
(police) needed that phone line, we would have lost it very easily.
They can cut in.''
</P>
<P>
   His boss, WFLA general manager Dave Reinhart, was quoted as
saying: ``I'm proud of him. First of all, he thought to do it. Then
he handled it in a very admirable manner. And I believe he was
instrumental in the hostage coming to no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Their views didn't convince Bob Steele, director of media ethics
at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg. (The institute owns the
St. Petersburg newspaper.) He issued this statement to The
Associated Press after the radio station and newspaper started to
draw criticism for their actions:
</P>
<P>
   ``To call the gunman at the gas station at the height of the
crisis is totally unjustified and unethical. It's a stupid thing to
do. There are lives at stake. It was clear that the gunman was
irrational. It would be very easy to ask the wrong question or say
something that would trigger the gunman to harm the hostage or
himself or law enforcement officers.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the St. Petersburg newspaper, which ran only the
first sentence of Steele's statement, was somewhat restrained in
his response to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sensitive situation,'' the newspaper quoted its
executive editor, Paul Tash, as saying. ``Our basic purpose is to
get the news and to do that in a way that doesn't interfere with
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he couldn't have included an apology, because it is
pretty obvious that the calls by the two journalists did interfere
with the work of law enforcement officers. This paper could use a
tough ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   I think such ethical violations are the ultimate responsibility
of the publishers and editors of newspapers and the managers and
news directors of broadcast stations. They are the ones who set the
ethical standards for their news organizations, and they are the
ones responsible for the actions of their staff members. If the
staffers know of the ethical standards of their bosses, they are
not apt to violate them.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said that even though Richards handled this particular
situation pretty well, things might not go as well the next time.
Contact with those fleeing from police should be left to those
trained to negotiate in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   I served with Steele on a Society of Professional Journalists
task force that looked into the performance of journalists who
covered the 51-day standoff between federal agents and David Koresh
and his followers at their compound outside of Waco in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The task force was critical of a number of news organizations
that got or tried to get phone interviews with Koresh during the
early hours of the standoff without the approval of federal
negotiators. At one point, a representative for one of the TV
tabloid-like programs tried to get an operator to interrupt a
conversation between Koresh and a federal negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also was critical of a radio talk-show host who
broadcast messages of support to Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   We were not critical of KRLD/1080 AM when that Dallas station
broadcast a message from Koresh. It did so only after consulting
with federal authorities. That is the way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recommendations issued by the task force stated:
</P>
<P>
   ``Resist the temptation to telephone a gunman or hostage taker.
Journalists generally are not trained in negotiation techniques,
and one wrong question or inappropriate word could jeopardize
someone's life. Furthermore, just calling in could tie up phone
lines or otherwise complicate communication efforts of the
negotiators.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the St. Petersburg newspaper and the Tampa radio
station had not heard of the recommendation or simply chose to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Such performances overshadow the many good things done by the
news media in this country every day. Such performances weaken the
foundation on which the First Amendment rests.
</P>
<P>
   As media scholar and author Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a
talk at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996: ``Journalists are
creating the coverage that is going to lead to their own
destruction.''

DOMINANT CELL PHONE IN EUROPE TO BE OFFERED IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Audiovox Corp. and the Bosch Telecom unit of Robert
Bosch GmbH of Germany plan to announce Tuesday the availability of
a wireless telephone that can operate on different continents
without modification.
</P>
<P>
   The new phone is based on a digital technology known as global
system for mobile communications, or GSM. While other technologies
are more popular than GSM in the United States, GSM is the dominant
digital wireless technology overseas, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint Corp., which provides wireless service in the New York
area using GSM technology, plans to announce that it is offering
the new phone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   George Schmitt, president of Omnipoint's wireless operation,
said the phone would probably cost $299 and would let users make
and receive calls in foreign countries as if they were at home.
People who use Omnipoint and other GSM wireless carriers can often
do those things already, but they generally must first get a
special phone for use abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically makes it a lot simpler for our customers to roam
around the world,'' Schmitt said. ``It's equally important that
people coming here from overseas be able to get a clear service.''
</P>
<P>
   The GSM Alliance, a group made up of 13 North American GSM
wireless companies, said the new phone could be used in more than
110 countries.
</P>
<P>
   After Omnipoint, the next carrier to offer the new phone will be
BellSouth's Mobility DCS operation. The GSM Alliance said North
America's other major GSM carriers would offer the new phone by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the alliance are: Aerial Communications
Inc., Airadigm Communications Inc.; the Conestoga Wireless Company;
Cook Inlet PCS; DIGIPH PCS; Microcell Telecommunications Inc.; NPI
Wireless; Pacific Bell Mobile Services; Powertel Inc.; Western
Wireless Corp. and Wireless 2000 PCS.

CAN THE SHOW GO ON? STAR'S DEMISE DOESN'T ALWAYS DOOM A TV SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``NewsRadio'' has always been considered the tough little show
that could, living the perilous life of a series mighty close to
being axed, yet surviving at the last possible moment with a
miraculous reprieve. But can it survive this?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman's death last week, reportedly at the hands of his
wife, who later fatally shot herself, has the creators of the NBC
situation comedy shaken and perplexed about exactly how to move on.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which will start its fourth season in the fall,
focused on the quirky workaday lives of the staff of a struggling
radio station. Hartman had been part of a relatively unknown though
deeply talented ensemble cast, playing Bill McNeal, the
manipulative news anchor with a healthy respect for himself and a
mere tolerance for others.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to write major characters out of the script
without enduring some viewer backlash, as ``Homicide: Life on the
Street'' and ``NYPD Blue'' will find out next season without their
respective stars, Andre Braugher and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   But when a regular character dies, putting producers in the
position of writing out a character without the character being
around, you have to address it in a way that's both apropos and
sensible for an audience that is, for the most part, grieving for a
fictional character to whom they can't give a proper farewell.
</P>
<P>
   When John Hancock, 51, died of a heart attack at his Los Angeles
home in 1992, he was co-starring in the CBS comedy ``Love and War''
as the gruff but lovable bartender of a bar frequented by the
show's romantic leads, played by Susan Dey and Jay Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Diane English shut down production for a week. In
the show, Hancock's character also died of a heart attack, and the
principal characters reminisced about the bartender, with the aid
of funny and touching clips.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock was a big, burly guy playing a distinctive character
whose presence was missed. His absence may not have been the sole
reason the series was eventually canceled, but it couldn't possibly
have hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Stars far more essential to the original premise of a series can
cause a considerable number of creative problems, often fatal ones.
``Chico and the Man'' was gone within a year after star Freddie
Prinze committed suicide in 1977. And when Redd Foxx died 23 days
after the premiere of his family sitcom, ``The Royal Family,'' in
1991, its producers knew it would be hard pressed to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It was. ``The Royal Family'' was quickly taken off the air and
retooled. It returned with actress Jackee (now on ``Sister,
Sister'') as Foxx's sister-in-law, but audiences rejected it, and
CBS quickly canceled the series.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom ``Too Close for Comfort'' had found a comfortable
life in syndication after ABC canceled the series. Then its star,
Ted Knight, died of cancer in 1986 at age 62. The producers wanted
to write him out and move on, but stations weren't convinced the
show could succeed without him, even though he was missing in
episodes during his illness. They balked, and the series ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum, 26, playfully held a prop
gun loaded with blanks to his head and pulled the trigger. He was
critically injured and died six days later. In a month, the CBS
drama ``Cover Up,'' in which Hexum played Mac Harper, an undercover
operative traveling the world to help Americans in trouble
overseas, was back on the air with another actor playing the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was explained that Hexum's character had been killed in
action, and a short filmed tribute was part of that episode. The
series wasn't renewed after failing to find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Some transitions go smoothly. During the third season of
``Cheers'' in 1985, Nicholas Colasanto, who played the dimwitted
but cuddly bartender, Coach, died after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   The series was already established, and Colasanto hadn't
appeared for several weeks before his death. As a result,
Colasanto's character was phased out over several episodes.
</P>
<P>
   His death, at the end of the season, also gave the show's
creators time to recast the role, which went to then-unknown Woody
Harrelson, who also played a character with a missing bulb or two.
(Only trivia buffs can even remember Colasanto's name these days.)
</P>
<P>
   There was also 58-year-old Michael Conrad, Sgt. Phil Esterhaus
on ``Hill Street Blues,'' who died of cancer in 1983. On the NBC
cop drama, Conrad was known for the opening scenes of roll call
when he'd tell officers to ``Be careful out there,'' as they headed
out for street duty. His final episode was perhaps the most
memorable, because writers dreamed up the scenario of his character
``dying happy'' while in bed with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In true ``Hill Street Blues'' fashion, the final shot was of
Sgt. Esterhaus' ashes being scattered on the city's streets, only
to be swept up by a street cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Others are trickier. Larry Riley, then 39, died of AIDS while
playing the policeman-turned-attorney Frank Williams on ``Knots
Landing.'' His character was promptly sent to visit his daughter at
a Midwestern college and simply written out of future scripts. No
one seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the back-to-back deaths on ``Night Court.''
First Selma Diamond, playing a court bailiff in the comedy that
starred Harry Anderson as a comical judge, died of lung cancer at
age 64. The opening show of the season dealt with fellow bailiff
Bull Shannon's (Richard Moll) reaction to her character's death.
</P>
<P>
   She was replaced with Florence Halop, who just a year later
would die of cancer at age 63. In the opening show of the 1986-87
season, Anderson's Judge Stone invoked the memory of both
characters during a personal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It became a morbid, though funny, running gag in Hollywood that
Halop's replacement, Marsha Warfield, was doomed. But Warfield was
alive and well through the series' end in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, the solution would have been to
simply cast a new actor in the same role. Audiences accepted it
then _ there wasn't much of an uproar when Dick Sargent replaced
Dick York as the husband on ``Bewitched'' _ but contemporary
audiences tend to find such changes unacceptable. (Does this say
something about the blurred lines of fantasy and reality?)
</P>
<P>
   For a series on the proverbial bubble of renewal and
cancellation, the loss of a key character can be crippling.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what ``NewsRadio'' may be facing. Although critics have
praised the series for its sharp writing and engaging characters,
viewers have not embraced the show. Even in its second season,
sandwiched between hits ``Mad About You'' and ``Frasier'' on
Tuesdays, it barely made the top 70 out of 158 series. Still, this
fall ``NewsRadio'' had earned a new Wednesday slot between ``3rd
Rock From the Sun'' at 8 and the law drama ``Law &AMP; Order'' at 9.
</P>
<P>
   What may help''NewsRadio'' is its strong ensemble cast. Despite
his ``Saturday Night Live'' credentials, Hartman was a support
player. The series centers on the low-key, boyish Dave Foley as
Dave Nelson, a mild-mannered station manager presiding over a cast
of misfits. The series has one of the better casts on television
with Foley, a former comedy troupe member of Kids in the Hall, and
the hapless naif of a reporter, Andy Dick, a master of
improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   Khandi Alexander left the series this season, but the cast still
includes Vicki Lewis as a mischievous secretary, Joe Rogan as a
conspiracy-theorizing technician, Maura Tierney as the insecure
news writer and Stephen Root as the rich but clueless station
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hartman's death may give ``NewsRadio'' a new fan
base, as curious viewers sample the summer reruns. For that reason
alone, its first episode in the fall will probably draw a sizable
audience.
</P>
<P>
   As for the producers, they are probably only now starting to
take stock, looking at the future of their series and what needs to
be done to retool it.
</P>
<P>
   It is, perhaps, the most unpleasant part. It's where you have to
start thinking about what Hartman's death means in terms of not
just emotion, but the reality of business.

BIG LOSSES TO CONFRONT LIVENT'S NEW LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: N.Y., Calif., Canada)  (ja)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Ovitz had better relish a challenge. Livent
Inc., the Toronto-based entertainment company that Ovitz is to
assume control of this week, has announced that it lost $20 million
in the first quarter of the year, which, added to grim financial
results for 1997, means the company has lost approximately $50
million over the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Livent, the producer of recent Broadway musicals like
``Ragtime,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' is the
world's only publicly held company whose primary business is live
theater production. Over the last five years it has borrowed
heavily to build theaters _ notably the Ford Centers for the
Performing Arts in Vancouver, New York City and Chicago (the
Chicago theater is scheduled to open in October) _ and to begin
creating several musicals from scratch, of which ``Ragtime,'' which
now has three companies running, is the first.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, issued Friday, the company said the quarterly
loss, which compared with a profit of $2 million in the first
quarter of 1997, was largely a result of the planned closing later
this year of one of its two productions of ``Show Boat,'' which is
now playing in Washington and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's accounting required the company to count all of the
money it spent to put together the show as an expense in the last
quarter. A portion of preproduction expenses is recognized as an
expense each quarter in a process known as amortization. But if a
show closes, all of those costs must be recognized at once.
</P>
<P>
   By recognizing the expenses immediately, which was done with the
input of the new management, Livent effectively removed costs that
could have weighed down its financial performance in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1993, and the stock, which reached a
high of $12.75 last July, began to slide when ``Ragtime,'' a show
the company hoped would support the company until its other
projects were ready to be presented, performed poorly in a
pre-Broadway run in Los Angeles. In spite of the show's success so
far in New York _ it garnered 13 Tony Award nominations and has
been virtually selling out at the Ford Center each week _ the
company was viewed by Wall Street to be too heavily debt-ridden and
the stock price never recovered; it closed at $8.125 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the company announced a retooling of its top
leadership. Ovitz, the former Hollywood power broker who has been
largely absent from entertainment since his much publicized
departure from Disney Corp. in December 1996, bought $20 million of
Livent stock and will join the company as a board member and
chairman of the executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and his management team, led by the investment banker Roy
Furman, who replaces Garth Drabinsky as chairman and chief
executive officer, are officially to assume control of the company
if, as expected, the shift is approved at a shareholders meeting on
Friday. Drabinsky, who previously ran the company's creative and
financial sides, remains with the company as chief creative
director, i.e., as a theater producer.

   Television Vision
</P>
<P>
   Q. My mother says sitting too close to the TV will ruin my eyes.
Is she right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. In
fact, the academy's public information office says, children can
focus up close without eye strain better than adults. That is
because the lens, which changes its focus for nearby and faraway
viewing, tends to lose some of its flexibility as people grow
older.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, sitting very close to the television set is a habit
that children grow out of. However, the academy says, sitting close
to the screen to get a clearer image may be a symptom of
uncorrected nearsightedness, and children who persist in doing it
should be tested for myopia.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the traditional parental warnings about ruining your
sight are only partly valid, according to ophthalmologists. For
example, reading in dim light may tire your eyes, but it will not
damage them.
</P>
<P>
   Eye fatigue is a risk when reading in dim light and when using a
computer screen for long periods, but it is reversible and
preventable with common-sense measures like accurately ground
corrective lenses designed for the distance at which they will be
used and sufficient blinking to lubricate dry eyes. The academy
especially recommends taking regular breaks to look up or across
the room, because looking at objects farther away usually relieves
the strain on eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If vision blurs or eyes tire very easily, the academy says, it
is time to get an eye examination from an ophthalmologist.

CLINTON AND GORE URGE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO USE PLAIN ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: HEADLINE stands for GORE-ENGLISH in budgeted story)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plain talk in the federal bureaucracy? It may never
happen, but the administration said Monday it's going to try.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered all executive departments and agencies
to issue documents in clear English and avoid wordy technical
jargon that often confuses the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using plain language, we send a clear message about what
the government is doing, what it requires and what services it
offers,'' Clinton said in a memorandum to executive department
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that by this October simple language should be
used in all new federal documents including letters, forms, notices
and instructions distributed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The order also said documents created before October should be
rewritten by January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the write-clearly directive, the administration's
latest initiative in its ``reinventing government'' effort, Vice
President Al Gore said, ``Clarity helps advance understanding, and
understanding can help advance trust. The point is to make sure the
American people understand us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the language in some of these forms is like
gobbledygook. Most people are left confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged agencies to revise such documents as forms for tax
payments, immigration and naturalization applications, and Social
Security benefits by using active rather than passive voice,
shorter sentences and everyday words.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's directive also said regulations printed in the Federal
Register, a daily publication that contains presidential and
federal agency documents, should be rewritten by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several departments and agencies have already adopted
plain-English policies. They include the Veterans Affairs
Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, Occupational Safety
and Health Administration and the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's write-clearly effort is the first since President
Jimmy Carter urged federal agencies to simplify their documents in
1977. But most agencies failed to comply, according to a spokesman
for the Jimmy Carter Library Center in Atlanta.

   ``During the Beatles' sessions,'' she writes, ``Linda and I
quickly learned that our husbands were not all buddy-buddy. John
and Paul were both talented but very strong-willed people. There
was some tension there. Linda and I left them alone. But we didn't
go chummy-chummy, wink-wink, `Aren't they silly boys?' either. We
both stood by our men. That was how we were.''
</P>
<P>
   After  &UR; John Lennon &LR; 's death, Yoko and Linda talked from time to

strong, I felt strong. She took a sad song and made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview in the magazine,  &UR; Sean Lennon &LR; , 22,
describes his childhood. ``I wasn't allowed to watch commercials. I

I grew up completely macrobiotic. The sweetest thing I had were
these little dried fish, these Japanese fish. That's what he would
give me as candy.''

   Lennon says his father ``definitely had a violent temper,'' and
``I think it was also hard for him to become a sensitive
monogamist. ... He was a macho pig in lots of ways, and he knew it.
I think his greatest accomplishment was recognizing that he was a
macho a_ and trying to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon says he's friendly with  &UR; Harper Simon &LR; , whose father,
 &UR; Paul Simon &LR; , ``is constantly showing him chords on the guitar. It's
nice. He's lucky. On another level, I think it's made it hard for
him, that his dad is constantly over his shoulder musically. But
that doesn't mean that I don't wish my dad was around. Even if my
dad had totally repressed me and not allowed me to play music at
all, I would take that over him being gone.''

COUP CHARGES AGAINST FORMER ZAMBIAN LEADER DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Kenneth Kaunda, the former
president of Zambia, was set free on Monday after prosecutors
dropped charges that he had a role in a botched coup attempt last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain and ruled it
for 27 years, had been in jail or under house arrest for nearly six
months, barred from speaking to his supporters or the media.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently released released in Lusaka, the Zambian
capital, as part of a deal brokered by President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa, whom he thanked in brief remarks on the steps of the
courthouse while hundreds of cheering supporters crowded around
him. The case against Kaunda had always appeared weak.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Mandela sent his defense minister to Zambia on a
shuttle diplomacy mission between Kaunda and Zambia's President
Frederick Chiluba, a South African government representative said.
</P>
<P>
   No one would officially disclose details of the deal, but it is
said to include Kaunda's agreement to retire from politics
permanently. He said at the courthouse on Monday that ``nothing can
stop me'' from pursuing his campaign against Chiluba. But in a
later speech outside the headquarters of his United National
Independence Party, he said he was calling a party congress to
elect a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day and accused of being behind
a brief coup on Oct. 28 in which army officers led by a ``Captain
Solo'' invaded the house of the army chief of staff and the
national radio station. The officers declared that they ran the
country and that Chiluba had until 9 a.m. to surrender or be
killed. No troops rallied to their cause, and three hours later
they were arrested after a brief gun battle. The first reports were
that it had been a drunken foray by a few captains and majors
unhappy about living in poverty while generals enjoyed generous
perks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chiluba quickly declared a state of emergency and
started rounding up his political opponents. Kaunda was in South
Africa on a lecture tour but was arrested soon after he returned.
Another opposition leader, Rodger Chongwe, who was wounded with
Kaunda last August when the police opened fire on their car at a
political rally, is in Australia, fearing arrest if he returns.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people still face charges in the coup plot, and human
rights groups say that several people, including another opposition
leader, Dean Mungomba, have been tortured in jail. Some, including
Capt. Steven Lungu, the erstwhile ``Captain Solo,'' face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda's lawyer, Sakwiba Sikota, said on Monday that the release
was ``a bit of a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd come this far, we were ready for trial and we wanted to
prove his innocence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zambian law, the prosecution reserved the right to
resurrect the charges later, but Sikota said that ``seemed
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's case against Kaunda became progressively weaker
after his arrest. The only evidence it made public against him was
an interview he gave shortly before the coup in which he said there
would soon be ``an explosion'' in Zambia. In February, the charge
against him was reduced from plotting the coup to concealing
knowledge of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government declined publicly to confirm
Mandela's role but expressed its happiness over the release. South
Africa has longstanding ties to Kaunda. At considerable risk of
attack by apartheid South Africa, he allowed the African National
Congress to keep its headquarters in Lusaka while it was in exile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kaunda and Chiluba are engaged in a bitter personal feud. Kaunda
locked up many dissenters under his own one-party state, but after
pressure from the West allowed a slow transition to democracy.
Decades of low copper prices and mismanagement of the economy
impoverished the country, however, and Chiluba, a trade unionist
Kaunda had once jailed, defeated him in multiparty elections in
1991. Chiluba quickly shifted economic policy to aggressive
capitalism, cutting food subsidies and selling state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But things soon went sour. Layoffs and price increases hurt the
poorest Zambians. Cabinet members were accused of corruption and
drug-dealing and his multiparty coalition broke up. His attacks on
Kaunda's legacy so angered the former president that he came out of
retirement to oppose Chiluba in 1996. Chiluba pushed through a
constitutional amendment barring Kaunda from running, which
prompted Western donors to temporarily cut off badly needed
assistance. He won re-election, but the election was widely
considered rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the two have lost no opportunity to attack each other
in speeches and to spread disinformation through sympathetic
newspapers.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON STANCE AVOIDS HIGH-PROFILE CONFRONTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The dispute over executive privilege now embroiling
President Clinton resonates with great legal and historical
principles, pitting the sanctity of presidential communications
against the majesty of the law.
</P>
<P>
   But this clash of forces also boils down to more mundane matters
_ the political calendar and the loyalty of Bruce Lindsey, the
closed-mouthed guardian of the president's most intimate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   With its carefully-calibrated legal response Monday, the White
House continued a strategy it has pursued throughout the serpentine
Whitewater investigation: Challenge Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel directing the inquiry, at every turn and delay the
completion of the investigation in hopes the public will lose
interest over time.
</P>
<P>
   This approach avoids a high-profile confrontation before the
Supreme Court, with all the obvious reminders of the battle that
finally doomed the presidency of Richard Nixon. It gives the
appearance of cooperation and compromise while slowing Starr's
inquiry and moving the case off the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr is stymied in the courts, this reasoning goes, he will
be forced to play out his hand in his report to the House of
Representatives, a political forum where Clinton has numerous
allies and where talk of impeachment over what the public sees as
largely personal matters sends shivers down even Republican spines.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, said at a
briefing for reporters that Monday's legal filing was about
constitutional imperatives and presidential prerogatives _ and
nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will undoubtedly be folks out there and in this room who
suggest that this is part of a great scheme to delay,'' Ruff said.
``That's just nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr won an important victory last month with an order from a
federal district court compelling the grand jury testimony of
Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House communications
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The president Monday morning concurred with the recommendation
of his legal advisers that he forego an appeal on Blumenthal. The
calculation appears to be that the president has little to fear
from the testimony of Blumenthal, because he was not privy to the
most sensitive of the president's discussions on how to respond to
accusations that Clinton carried on a sexual affair with a former
White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and then directed her to lie
about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is digging in his heels on Lindsey, asserting
that lawyer-client privilege shields their conversations about how
to handle the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals will likely take months to resolve, as Americans'
attentions turn to summer vacation and other distractions.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the president ultimately loses and Lindsey is forced
to testify, there is little expectation that Lindsey will become
another John Dean and turn on the president.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the first lady, there is no one in the White House
closer to the president and no one less likely to submit to
pressure to reveal his secrets than Lindsey, a friend, confidant
and shadow of Clinton for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has testified on numerous occasions in the Whitewater
matter and other White House investigations and he retains the
confidence of the president, White House officials noted. This is
not because he lied to protect Clinton, they added, but because he
told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said Monday that the decision on
the privilege appeal was ``made by lawyers based on the law and
based on principles.'' They insisted that the White House is
seeking to preserve the president's right to confidential advice
from his closest aides _ not to bury illegalities beneath a
mountain of legal paper.
</P>
<P>
   The president's political advisers played no part in the
discussions that led to the legal pleading filed with the Supreme
Court late Monday afternoon, several White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But that assertion belies the political nature of the
president's legal team and the role that the president and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton play in such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The central participants in the weekend's discussion were Ruff,
David Kendall, the president's personal attorney, W. Neil
Eggleston, an outside expert on executive privilege claims, and
Mickey Kantor, a longtime friend of the Clintons and the manager of
the president's 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All have been by the president's side as he has confronted a
range of accusations from perjury to financial fraud to personal
misconduct. None is a stranger to the capital's political
cross-currents and all are loyal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But their deliberations this weekend, and the case they
presented to the president in the Oval Office Monday morning, were
not about political survival or partisan advantage, aides insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the concern I've heard the president and Mr. Ruff
raise with respect to this matter is an institutional concern that
relates to this president and future presidents,'' said Michael
McCurry, the White House spokesman.

   With a Song on Your Web
</P>
<P>
   Listen carefully: Is that the song of a cerulean warbler outside
your window?
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure _ and most people aren't, even while looking
at a bird book _ a new Web site will play the song for you. The
site has been designed to help scholars collect information from
birders to build a database on North American wood warblers. Some
of the 51 species are endangered or threatened, and all will
migrate thousands of miles to nest and breed from April through
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Web project marks the first online census of the warbler
migration, a project set up by the Cornell University Laboratory of
Ornithology and the National Audubon Society. The site for
sightings is http://birdsource.cornell.edu. At the Web site, you
can learn which states have the most sightings (New York,
Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida), or the greatest variety by
species (Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Louisiana).
</P>
<P>
   The site's goal is to track these thumb-sized birds of yellow,
blue, red, green, black and white, who sing with a range of rich
warbles or trills or rings, and to improve the data on the routes
of the warblers, whose annual commute from South and Central
America homeward to Canada and the United States typically covers
thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Birders are asked to respond to questions and post observations.
The site has received more than 2,200 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Making the Best of It
</P>
<P>
   Waste from factory-style livestock farms is a growing source of
pollution around the country. Now the Research Service of the
federal Department of Agriculture is exploring a factory-style
solution to the problem: a 77,000-square-foot composting center
that can handle 100 tons of cow and poultry manure and used
livestock bedding a day.
</P>
<P>
   The center opened last fall on the service's farm in Beltsville,
Md. One area of emphasis has been finding rapid techniques for bulk
composting of organic byproducts, in which the heat produced _
temperatures in a heap can top 130 degrees _ kills all disease
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Waste trucked into the center is dumped in one of 20 rows, each
160 feet long, 5 feet wide and 40 inches high. The rows, called
windrows, are churned once a week by a machine to speed
decomposition by letting in more air. Most of the rows are fully
``cooked'' in 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the center has more ambitious goals, said Lawrence J.
Sikora, a microbiologist for the research service. He and his
colleagues hope to develop designer composts, mixes of farm,
industrial and urban materials that can be used to prevent
particular diseases in crops.
</P>
<P>
   Once Upon a Magnetar
</P>
<P>
   Traces of a dark relic of a once-bright star 40,000 light-years
from Earth have confirmed the existence of a class of neutron stars
called magnetars, according to a team of scientists at the Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The team said the magnetars have the most intense magnetic
fields observed in the universe, fields one thousand trillion times
the Earth's magnetic field. The fields can heat the star's surface
to 18 million degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of magnetars points to vast new frontiers in
space, said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou, a gamma-ray astronomer at the
center who directed the team. ``It gets at many mysteries,'' she
said. Many such neutron stars still exist, she added, but are
burned out and have been almost impossible to observe in the
spectrums in which they are usually observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't understand where they had all gone,'' Dr.
Kouveliotou said. ``Now we know they still exist. There may be
hundreds of thousands around us, maybe millions. Now we can start
looking at other ways they show themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Using satellite data, her team measured the fields by assessing
how the speed of rotation of the star is slowing, which is linked
to the power of the magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   A neutron star is one that has collapsed because of
gravitational forces. Neutron stars are created in supernovae
explosions and spin at rates up to hundreds of revolutions per
second. A magnetar has a magnetic field that is 100 times stronger
than the typical neutron star.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the discovery was in the May 21 issue of the journal
Nature.

     CLINTON LEGAL TACTIC COULD KEEP LID
ON KEY INFORMATION
 &HT;     By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision Monday to focus on the
attorney-client privilege to prevent a key aide's testimony could
substantially delay the unraveling of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton abandoned his defense of executive privilege in
briefs sent to the Supreme Court, he dug in on efforts to shield
his closest confidant, Bruce Lindsey, from having to answer crucial
questions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, in an opinion that
cites secret information, has already ruled that Lindsey must
answer Starr's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, citing procedures used in the Watergate investigation of
President Nixon, has asked the Supreme Court to skip the appeals
court level and give an expedited June hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to Starr, Clinton argued that the question of
attorney-client privilege has still not been resolved and requires
a full airing at the appeals court level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,''
said White House counsel Charles Ruff said. ``That's what courts
generally do. This is not steel seizure, this is not Iranian
hostages, this is not U.S. vs. Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   If the high court agrees, that would delay a final ruling until
next fall or winter at the soonest whether Lindsey must answer
Starr's questions that the White House has refused to let him
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, a White House deputy counsel, has coordinated much of
the administration's response to allegations that Clinton had a
sexual liaison with former White House intern Lewinsky and then
urged her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Lindsey is widely seen as the key witness who could tell
whether or not there has been an attempt to tamper with witnesses
or suborn perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Lindsey may know a great deal,'' said C. Boyden Gray,
former White House counsel in the Bush administration. ``There are
hints that there may be some fertile ground to plow,'' especially
in allegations that Lindsey may have ``coached'' witnesses before
they testified to the Starr grand jury, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Although predicting what the nine justices will decide is always
risky, experts said Monday that legal arguments might weigh in
favor of the White House on giving a long, hard look at the
attorney-client claim.
</P>
<P>
   Even critic Gray said that the issue is ``more complicated''
than executive privilege, which courts have already greatly
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have already dealt the Clinton administration one
defeat on the issue. The 8th U.S. Court of Appeals last year
rejected a claim of confidentiality for First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's conversations with government lawyers after her
appearance before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the appeals court ordered all notes to be
handed over to Starr. ``To allow any part of the federal government
to use its in-house attorney as a shield against the production of
information relevant to a federal criminal investigation would
represent a gross misuse of public assets,'' said the appeals
court. The Supreme Court allowed that ruling to stand.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mark Tushnet, professor of law at Georgetown
University, said that this decision was not expansive enough to
settle the whole question of who in the administration could claim
confidentiality and under what circumstances. That might require a
full judicial airing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a difficult issue, which the court would do well to
see how the court of appeal resolves it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the White House said Clinton's decision was based on
a desire to delay Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I wouldn't do the same thing,'' Gray said of the
tactic. ``They're better off if they can get past the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats retake the House (where impeachment
proceedings must originate), then you're home free,'' he said.

BOEHNER USING DISPUTE WITH MCDERMOTT AS FUND-RAISING TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner
is using his dispute with Rep. Jim McDermott as a fund-raising
tool, urging potential campaign contributors to send money to
``help me bring the Democrats to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner is using his campaign treasury to pay for a lawsuit
against McDermott, who he believes provided newspaper reporters
with a tape of an illegally recorded phone conversation between
Boehner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other top House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are fed up with self-righteous liberals who think
eavesdropping, illegally taping private conversations, and leaking
privileged information are OK as long as it's the Democrats who are
doing it,'' Boehner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the fund-raising appeal, Boehner also appeared to threaten
Attorney General Janet Reno, who he says has ``hemmed and hawed,
stewed and stalled, diddled and delayed'' instead of bringing
charges against McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown weary of her foot-dragging and his legal tactics to
hide the truth,'' Boehner wrote. ``It's time for Janet Reno to do
her job or face the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner, R-Ohio, did not specify in the letter what consequences
Reno should face for declining to prosecute McDermott, D-Wash,
although at one point he wrote ``if Janet Reno won't do her job,
she shouldn't have her job.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg said Monday ``the
investigation (of McDermott) is ongoing and active. I'm not in a
position to be any more specific.'' He declined to comment on
Boehner's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Boehner and McDermott began in December
1996, when Boehner, sitting in a car in the parking lot of a
Florida waffle house, used his wife's cellular telephone to
participate in a phone conversation with GOP leaders. The call was
picked up on a police scanner and taped by a couple active in
Democratic politics in Florida. The couple gave the tape to
McDermott, who was the senior Democrat on the House Ethics
Committee investigating Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, stories about the tape appeared in three newspapers,
one of which described its source as a congressman hostile to
Gingrich. McDermott has refused to say whether he provided the tape
to the papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of no public action by the Justice Department,
Boehner filed suit against McDermott, accusing him of violating
federal and Florida laws protecting the privacy of electronic
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's fund-raising letter, sent in late March, was filed
Monday in U.S. District Court by McDermott's lawyers, who cited the
letter as evidence that the case is motivated by a partisan battle
and not by serious legal matters.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, McDermott's lawyers insisted that the
Constitution protects the Seattle Democrat's right to leak to
newspapers the contents of an illegally recorded telephone call.
There is no question that the Florida couple who recorded the
conversation violated the law _ they have been fined for their role
in the incident _ but McDermott argues that simply receiving the
tape and passing it to a newspaper is not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case presents about as stark an issue of free speech as
can be imagined: one political leader is seeking to punish another
political leader for allegedly disclosing a conversation among some
of the nation's top political leaders on a political topic,''
McDermott argued.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott argued that the content of the conversation _ how
Republican leaders should respond to the upcoming reprimand of
Gingrich _ was a matter of significant public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is core political speech, and lies at the very heart of
the First Amendment,'' McDermott argued. ``If a citizen who
lawfully obtains such speech can be punished for disclosing it to
the media, the protections of the First Amendment are more illusory
than real.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Boehner said McDermott's brief ignores the legal
issues and is notable mostly for its absence of any denial that
McDermott leaked the recording of the telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pursuing a two-pronged attack, the first being to toss in
a bunch of fiery rhetoric and invective, and the second being to
ignore the legal arguments that were made in our response,'' said
Ted Cruz, a lawyer for Boehner. ``No court in the history of our
nation, federal or state, has accepted the argument that he's
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz also defended Boehner's right to raise money for the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly true that Congressman McDermott is going to
defend this case in a way that's going to pursue delay and cost a
lot of money, and I think Congressman Boehner is perfectly
justified in trying to raise the funds to try to counteract that,''
Cruz said. ``This would be a very simple case if it weren't for
Congressman McDermott's repeated efforts to hide the facts and use
every legal tool he can to drag it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A McDermott campaign adviser said the Seattle congressman has
not used the dispute with Boehner as a fund-raising tool, but that
it is possible he will do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The brief filed Monday was the last in a series of written
arguments over whether Boehner's lawsuit should be dismissed. U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Hogan is now expected to schedule oral
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boehner's lawyers have sent McDermott a series of
written questions, demanding to know exactly what McDermott's role
was in the transmission of the tape to newspaper reporters.
McDermott is expected to attempt to avoid responding to those
questions at least until after a judge decides whether to dismiss
the case.

FRUIT OF THE LOOM UPDATES ITS MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (ja)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the days when Carmen Miranda wore fruit on her
head, consumers have been urged to wear Fruit of the Loom apparel
on their bodies. Now the brand is changing its advertising in an
attempt to create a more contemporary image.
</P>
<P>
   A lighthearted campaign being introduced this week by Warwick
Baker O'Neill in New York, which focuses on newer, more colorful
and fashionable types of clothing, declares that ``Every body loves
Fruit.'' The television, print and outdoor ads are the first the
agency has produced since winning the account late last year, with
billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This advertising is the public expression of efforts going on
at Fruit of the Loom to modernize their offerings,'' said Kevin
O'Neill, president and chief creative officer at Warwick Baker, who
offered a preview of the campaign. ``Its mission is to reawaken the
affection and awareness consumers have for the brand and to expand
the understanding of Fruit's products.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is indicative of large-scale attempts by venerable
brands to update their sales pitches, particularly in crowded
consumer-product categories like apparel. Fruit of the Loom Inc.
has been laying off employees, closing plants and shifting
production to cheaper sites overseas, in response to intensifying
competition among makers of underwear and casual wear for men,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanes brand sold by Sara Lee Corp. has long battled Fruit of
the Loom for supremacy in the market segment of lower-priced
clothing sold by mass merchandisers. Hanes is widely considered to
have successfully freshened its advertising with slick, upbeat
campaigns by Long Haymes Carr in Winston-Salem, N.C., part of the
Interpublic Group of Cos., which carry the theme ``Just wait till
we get our Hanes on you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as the economy improves, many consumers who
have bought Fruit of the Loom are tempted to ``trade up'' to
higher-priced brands, especially those bearing designer labels.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign represents a gamble for Fruit of the Loom
because the company does not want to alienate traditional,
value-minded buyers as it tries to attract younger, less
conventional consumers with offerings like men's boxers and boxer
briefs and women's thongs and bikini briefs. For instance, the
waistbands of some kinds of boxer briefs are emblazoned with the
initials ``FTL'' in place of ``Fruit of the Loom'' or the familiar
fruit emblem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was in the brand itself,'' said William Mulligan
Jr., client services director at Warwick Baker, because consumers
who were asked to talk about Fruit of the Loom in research sessions
used words like ``approachable, sexy, wholesome, friendly,
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   So while a television commercial for men's apparel features
buff, shirtless 20-somethings, they are smiling and clean-cut
rather than sullen and sprouting stubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``In keeping with the broad appeal of the brand,'' said John
Wendler, senior vice president for marketing at Fruit of the Loom
in Bowling Green, Ky., the models are intended to be
``all-American, regular guys who want to wear fashionable
products,'' rather than ``chiseled, edgy, European-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising is graphically representative of the new
stylishness of our product lines,'' Wendler said. ``It captures all
the positives about the brand while reinterpreting it and
re-presenting it as up to trend, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign places emphasis on what executives at Fruit of the
Loom and Warwick Baker refer to as the brand's ``fruitness,'' which
O'Neill described as an ``essential playfulness and friskiness,
capturing the fit and fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the commercial shows vignettes with tongue-in-cheek
titles: ``Peeling Fruit,'' for a tot removing his T-shirt; ``Wild
Fruit,'' for a man romping with his dog in a field. And print ads
for women's apparel carry such headlines as ``Instead of Serving
Fruit, Why Not Let Fruit Serve You?'' and ``You're Not the First
Woman in the World to be Tempted by Fruit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fruit of the Loom previously tried to modify attitudes about its
products with a humorous campaign by offices of the Leo Burnett
Co., which was centered on clotheslines displaying colorful
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign was very successful and really got noticed,''
Wendler said, ``but it was a little bit limited'' because ``it
relied on a very strong visual device.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Every body loves Fruit' gives us the flexibility to advertise
our broad range of products,'' he added, ``and portrays the
products in a more stylish manner than `Clotheslines' did.''
Burnett resigned the account rather than take part in a review that
began in October.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercials will run during television programs like
``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The X-Files'' and the National Basketball
Association and National Hockey League championship finals. Print
ads will appear in such magazines as Essence, Glamour, Good
Housekeeping, Mademoiselle, Parents, People, TV Guide and Vogue. As
for the outdoor ads, Wendler said, ``we are considering
high-visibility locations like Times Square in addition to general
outdoor around the country, to make a statement about what the
brand is all about today.''
</P>
<P>
   Was any thought given to reviving the ``Fruit Guys,'' the actors
who once brought to life the fruit in the brand's emblem?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for long,'' O'Neill answered, laughing. Though ``they did
a wonderful job'' demonstrating fruitness, he said, it was ``in a
different time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, one Fruit Guy would probably demand a raise: F. Murray
Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for ``Amadeus.''

AN EXPERIENCED PIOLINE OUTLASTS RUSSIAN QUALIFIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Giddy as a man who had just won the lottery, or at the
very least won his first career Grand Slam event at the doddering
age of 28, Cedric Pioline kissed his racquet, his wristband, and
almost kissed Moscow's Marat Safin, the towering neophyte he had
outwitted and outlasted in a five-set test Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With 15,000 fans in delirium and the 18-year-old Safin in a
tailspin, Pioline completed his mission, which was to fight his way
into his second quarterfinal here after a decade spent trying to
distinguish himself on his native clay at Roland Garros. Covering
the court like a madman, and returning Safin's thundering serve as
if he had been programmed to decipher it, Pioline prevailed 7-5,
4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4 and remained the last hope of France at
this French Open.
</P>
<P>
   The 3:18 struggle turned into a triumph of experience over raw
ambition: Pioline, father of two and veteran of 31 Grand Slam
events, including two finals, remained focused from beginning to
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience got me through, and the people,'' said Pioline, who
admitted his ``legs and mind'' were just about gone by the time the
6-foot-4-inch Safin shanked a backhand return on the Frenchman's
second match point.
</P>
<P>
   Safin, appearing in his first Grand Slam event after making his
Davis Cup debut alongside Yevgeny Kafelnikov two months ago in a
losing effort in Atlanta, lost his concentration in the fourth set
and couldn't retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No concentration on important points,'' said Safin, who left
Russia when he was 14 to train year-round in Spain, sponsored by a
Swiss bank he never bothered to learn the name of.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just send the money,'' said Safin, who is now bankrolling
himself. He earned more here in a week than he did in all of 1997,
and planned to tackle Wimbledon next. ``Never stepped on grass
before,'' said Safin, who added that he planned to take an armload
of racquets ``to break.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin didn't murder his racquet Monday, but his petulance was
costly against Pioline, whose tunnel vision seemed to improve in
inverse proportion to the teen-ager's loss of concentration, which
yielded 72 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pioline nailed a backhand return to the corner at break
point to take a 5-4 lead in the fourth set, Safin was transformed
from a hot young dog to a hangdog, and when he double faulted at
break point to give the veteran a 2-1 edge in the final set,
Pioline took care not to squander the gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't tired, but when you lose the concentration, then the
people, the racquets, everything is bad,'' said Safin.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only Russian teen-ager to fade away Monday. When
last seen Sunday night, Anna Kournikova was swabbing daintily at
the tears in her eyes on the gloomy center court. Chief umpire
Bruno Rebeuh, head of the French Open's officiating staff, had not
only denied her request to halt her fourth-round match against Jana
Novotna because she couldn't see the ball in the dark, but also
out-and-out refused her plea for a bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   Too mature to throw a scene, 16-year-old Kournikova played on
until allowed to quit with Novotna ahead 4-2 in the third set, but
she resented the treatment she received. ``You know, I couldn't beg
him in front of 20,000 people and the camera to go to the
bathroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kournikova, resilient as any teen-ager, put her problems
behind her, slept ``like a baby,'' and marched back into battle
Monday afternoon to try to solve the deficit against the
third-seeded Novotna, a player who had beaten her in all three
previous meetings. But 14 minutes later, off went Kournikova,
bounced from contention after her netted backhand on the second
match point gave the 29-year-old Novotna a 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-3
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played great tennis, didn't make any unforced errors,''
said Kournikova, whose go-for-broke baselining and anxious
net-rushing produced 54 unforced errors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But all was not lost. Only a few hours after absorbing the
defeat and chastising tournament officials for their boorish
behavior with a few well-chosen barbs, there was Kournikova,
chatting and posing in the stands with Ronaldo, Brazil's World Cup
poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   They made a pleasant couple: the blonde goddess of women's
tennis, which lately seems as anxious to have its teen-age stars
become celebrities as win Grand Slams, and the undisputed Brazilian
god of soccer, a player last year's French champion, Gustavo
Kuerten, insisted was worthy of genuflection.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kuerten was dethroned here in the second round by Safin,
his female counterpart, 10th-seeded Iva Majoli of Croatia, kept her
title defense intact by claiming the third set of her held-over
match with Spain's Conchita Martinez. Majoli's 7-6 (7-1), 6-7
(3-7), 6-3 victory sent her into the quarterfinals against
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport. Unlike Kournikova, Majoli spent a
sleepless night fretting over her unresolved match: ``I couldn't
sleep until the morning; my body was just like so going crazy,''
said Majoli.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the controversy that surrounded Kournikova's
match, Majoli and Martinez were unanimous in requesting a stoppage.
Neither wanted to start a third set, and why Kournikova and Novotna
had been encouraged to do so was a mystery to Majoli, who also felt
Rebeuh was out of line to deny the loser's restroom request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all the details, but I think that was a stupid
thing; they should have let her go,'' said the 20-year-old Majoli,
who hasn't won a tournament since surprising Martina Hingis here in
last year's final. In that match, Hingis received an official OK to
take a strategic bathroom break in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   While defending Kournikova and Hingis' tactics as fully
acceptable within the rules, Majoli did take a swipe at the court
and locker room tactics of Hingis' quarterfinal opponent,
eighth-seeded Venus Williams, and her younger sister, Serena, who
faltered in the fourth-round on Sunday against Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario. Sanchez Vicario may have won that match, but she left it
fuming at Williams' brash behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little bit different; they have this attitude like
`we're the best', and I'm sure it's going to change in a year or so
when they grow up and realize they don't have to be mean,'' said
Majoli. ``But they look at you like you're nobody and they're the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, the Spanish contingent, which arrived at the
Open with a record 19 male contenders, was whittled down to three
Monday. Fourteenth-seeded Alex Corretja joined Carlos Moya and
Felix Mantilla in the quarterfinals by defeating Jason Stoltenberg
6-4, 6-4, 6-3. But the unseeded Francisco Clavet was beaten 7-5,
6-3, 6-1 by Belgium's Filip Dewulf, a 1997 semifinalist, and
16th-seeded Alberto Berasetegui, a runner-up to Sergi Bruguera in
1994, was upended by Morocco's 45th-ranked Hicham Arazi 6-2, 6-4,
3-6, 6-3. Arazi reached the quarterfinals last year by defeating
this year's favorite, Marcelo Rios.

AS BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, D'AMATO RAKES IN THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The amendment was brief, so it attracted scant notice
when Sen. Alfonse D'Amato helped tuck it into a bill he was
shepherding through the Senate as chairman of the Banking
Committee. But the provision, which weakened a consumer protection
statute governing mortgages, was decidedly important to one
company.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato agreed to support the provision in late 1995 after
lobbying by MBNA Corp., one of the nation's biggest issuers of
credit cards. MBNA is also one of the senator's biggest
benefactors, having channeled more than $500,000 in recent years to
campaign committees that he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, D'Amato has been a tireless fund-raiser,
a politician who works the phones with a barker's gusto. But since
taking over the Banking Committee in 1995, he has made his previous
fund-raising seem almost pedestrian, harvesting millions of dollars
from individuals and companies in the financial industry that, like
MBNA, have a stake in legislation that as chairman he can control
with a penstroke.
</P>
<P>
   The money has not only filled D'Amato's Senate campaign account.
It has also enriched the New York Republican State Committee,
strengthening the senator's formidable political network and
reinforcing his status as the state's dominant Republican.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing unusual or illegal about members of Congress
reeling in contributions from interests they oversee. D'Amato,
though, has far exceeded the fund-raising of any other senator
through his positions as chairman of the Banking Committee, which
oversees much of the financial industry, and as a member of the
Finance Committee, which governs tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In MBNA's case, D'Amato has unsuccessfully supported the
company's efforts to revamp the consumer protection statute, which
in most instances bars mortgage providers from paying fees to get
referrals. MBNA says the statute is hindering its expansion in the
mortgage business, while consumer groups say lifting the ban would
drive up the cost of buying a home.
</P>
<P>
   But MBNA is not the only financial behemoth that has given
heavily to D'Amato. Others _ including Travelers Group; Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co.; Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., and Beneficial Corp. _ have
also directed the kind of large sums to D'Amato's campaign
committees that were once the sole province of the national
parties. Some have held private fund-raisers for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``That facilitated entre to the senator,'' said Dave Williams,
chairman of Alliance Capital Management, referring to contributions
to D'Amato's committees.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance, a money management firm in New York City, held a
fund-raiser for the senator last year as he was successfully
sponsoring a proposal providing for a tax break that the firm
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   With the money from Wall Street and other financial companies
fattening his Senate campaign account, D'Amato has raised more than
$17 million _ far more than any Senate candidate this year _ as he
tries to overcome a strong Democratic challenge and win a fourth
term. He has nearly $11 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The only other congressional candidate in the nation who has
even come close is a Democrat who wants his job, Rep. Charles
Schumer of New York. Schumer serves on the House Banking Committee
and has also benefited from Wall Street's largesse. He has raised
more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato faced ethics inquiries over his ties to donors earlier
in his career, but no serious wrongdoing was found. He has not come
under official scrutiny since he became chairman of the panel _
known as the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs _
which covers a broad swath of the nation's economy, from banking
and securities regulations to export controls to urban mass
transit.
</P>
<P>
   But some campaign finance experts say D'Amato has a pattern of
seeking money from companies with interest in Banking Committee
business, knowing donors are unlikely to ignore the requests of a
powerful legislator. They contend that D'Amato has used the
Republican State Committee to accept big donations from the
financial industry because the committee's accounts are subject to
little regulation.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato declined to be interviewed about his fund raising. His
aides said he had become the biggest fund-raiser in Congress
because donors were pleased by his stewardship of the Banking
Committee and his overall record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator is recognized as the most effective legislative
voice in New York state because he gets things done for the
people,'' said Lisette McSoud Mondello, a spokeswoman for D'Amato.
``Clearly, the people who contribute to Sen. D'Amato support the
principles of the senator, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, D'Amato has been in a prime position to collect
donations since the the financial industry has been undergoing
rapid changes, with some companies seeking the overhaul of
decades-old regulations, and others lobbying to keep them in place.
</P>
<P>
   For example, D'Amato recently scheduled hearings on long-stalled
legislation that would do away with Depression-era regulations that
have stymied many mergers between banks, securities firms and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The senator called for the hearings after meeting with three
prominent Wall Street executives, including Sanford Weill, chairman
of Travelers Group, which would have great difficulty completing
its huge merger with Citicorp if such legislation is not approved.
Travelers and its subsidiaries have given more than $375,000 to
committees controlled by D'Amato in recent years, including
$190,000 to the New York Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Sen. D'Amato has capitalized on his
very powerful position to raise money from very wealthy sources,''
said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington. ``The bottom line is that Al D'Amato is in
the catbird seat when it comes to fund raising. The special
interests who care about legislation that comes before his
committee are usually the ones with the most giving power.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has also received large contributions from donors with
interest in legislation before the Finance Committee, which
oversees most tax and health-care policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he successfully pushed a proposal through the Finance
Committee that granted a tax break to a group of limited
partnerships. D'Amato's campaign committees have received more than
$200,000 from donors connected to the limited partnerships, records
show.
</P>
<P>
   One of those firms, Alliance Capital Management, raised about
$40,000 for the senator, both through a fundraiser and donations
from the firm's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the firm's chairman, has contributed $63,000 to the
Republican State Committee in the last two years, including $13,000
as he was lobbying D'Amato on the tax break. Alliance's parent,
Equitable Cos., gave $6,000 to the state party at the time of the
lobbying, and another $25,000 later in 1997, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a connection between the donations and the
legislation, Ms. Mondello, D'Amato's spokewoman, said, ``That's
just nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. D'Amato is always fighting for New Yorkers and New York
companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is D'Amato's position on the Banking Committee, though, that
is perhaps his most potent lure as a fund-raiser. Most of the
Senate bills of interest to MBNA, for example, go before the
Banking Committee, according to lobbying records.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, D'Amato's Senate campaign has received
more than $220,000 from MBNA's political action committee, its
executives and the executives' family members, according to
disclosure records. The donations from the executives and their
families came after MBNA ran a fund-raising drive for D'Amato,
sending memos throughout the company asking for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   MBNA, which is based in Wilmington, Del., has given $170,000 to
the New York Republican State Committee. The company and its PAC
gave $127,500 to the National Republican senatorial Committee when
D'Amato was its chairman in 1995 and 1996. MBNA's donations to this
committee dropped sharply after another senator became its chairman
in 1997, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the company gave another $5,000 to a state political
action committee controlled by the senator.
</P>
<P>
   David Spartin, an MBNA vice chairman, said ``there is no
connection between any campaign contributions and any piece of
legislation. We support good government.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship goes beyond Senate business. Last year, D'Amato
attended a ceremony at Columbia University honoring the company's
chairman, Alfred Lerner, where the senator made remarks praising
Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage law that MBNA has sought to revise generally bans
mortgage providers from paying fees to real estate agents for
referring business to them.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said at a hearing last year that the law has
``restricted the growth of the new marketing systems for mortgage
products.'' He said scaling back the law could lower the cost of
mortages ``and help make the dream of home ownership available to
more Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups fear that if mortgage companies are allowed to
pay fees for referrals, it could lead to customers being steered to
more expensive mortage products. MBNA wants an amendment to the law
that would allow it to pay fees to so-called affinity groups _ such
as alumni associations _ for referrals. MBNA has specialized in
issuing credit cards through affinity groups, and it wants to use
those relations to expand its mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
   MBNA first obtained the support of two Republicans on the
Banking Committee who were sponsoring a bill to scale back some
banking regulations. But the key backing came from D'Amato, who was
a co-sponsor of the bill and as chairman can control amendments to
it. Also lobbying for the measure was another major credit card
company, Household International, which has given more than
$100,000 to D'Amato's committees.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, the provision came under attack from consumer
groups, Democratic senators and the White House. Other mortgage
providers joined them, saying that while the statute needed to be
revamped, the amendment was biased toward credit card companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several lobbyists and Senate staff members who worked on the
legislation recalled that D'Amato fought fiercely for the
provision. ``Sen. D'Amato was really the force behind it,'' said
one lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with opposition from the White House, D'Amato and the
other Republican senators dropped the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato's people really held out for a long time'' in the
negotiations, said another person who worked on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mondello denied that D'Amato was a staunch backer of the
provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supported it, but never fought for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A new version of the provision is in a bill that is now before
the Banking Committee and is being co-sponsored by D'Amato.

TRAVELERS GROUP BUYS STAKE IN JAPAN'S NIKKO  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Travelers Group and the Nikko Securities Co.
formally announced an agreement on Monday that will give the Wall
Street powerhouse a 25 percent stake in Japan's third-largest
securities brokerage firm for $1.6 billion, a deal that immediately
raised questions about how quickly the Japanese financial industry
would consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Travelers-Nikko alliance, which had been expected since
reports of it first appeared here on Friday, came as Japan is
undergoing a broad-based financial restructuring aimed at making
its markets as flexible as those in New York and London by 2001.
Japanese and foreign companies are exploring possible combinations
that will help them better compete in this new arena, and in
markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tie-up between Japanese financial institutions and foreign
institutions will accelerate,'' said Yukiko Ohara, a bank analyst
with SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. ``Japanese financial institutions need
a good product. They have a very strong client base, but they will
lose clients if they have no tie-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also raised concern among competitors and clients of
the two companies. For instance, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
until Monday the largest shareholder in Nikko with 3.1 percent, had
envisioned forging its own Nikko alliance. That is no longer a
possibility, and a spokesman said on Monday that Bank of Tokyo
would have to revise its strategy toward the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   Nikko has been losing money and is considered poorly prepared to
face the challenges of financial deregulation in Japan on its own.
But the partnership with Travelers, the parent of Salomon Smith
Barney, will marry a savvy U.S. financial-services conglomerate to
a formidable distribution network in a potentially lucrative
Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   For Travelers, which has agreed to merge with Citicorp in a
record $70 billion transaction, the deal with Nikko helps round out
its vision of becoming the world's leading diversified financial
company, one that will some day be a household name in all major
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more
productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world,''
said Sanford Weill, the chairman of Travelers, at a joint news
conference here on Monday with Masashi Kaneko, Nikko Securities'
president.
</P>
<P>
   Kaneko said the world is witnessing ``the global consolidation
of the financial industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The partners said that in January they would establish Nikko
Salomon Smith Barney Ltd., a $1 billion joint venture that will
trade securities, advise on mergers and acquisitions, underwrite
stocks and bonds, and produce economic research. Travelers will
become Nikko's largest shareholder and take the first seat by a
foreign company on Nikko's board.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Travelers will purchase 9.5 percent of Nikko's
common stock for 70 billion yen _ about $507 million _ and a
further 15.5 percent ownership interest in the form of convertible
bonds, for 150 billion yen, or about $1.1 billion. Nikko will spend
between $72 million and $360 million buying up Travelers shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raises the stakes for both foreign and domestic
companies operating in Japan. Some may begin to feel edged out of a
changing financial playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of potential brides, or marriage partners, drops
down by one and there aren't that many with the size of
distribution network that Nikko has,'' said James Fiorillo, a
financial analyst at ING Barings in Japan. ``The effect of all this
is that domestic firms are scrambling to react. Foreign firms are
scrambling. And the number of potential partners is starting to
fall dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has as many as 200 brokerage houses, most of them small or
medium-sized firms that have been comfortable under such regulatory
practices as fixed commissions. Many are expected to face enormous
difficulties competing in a less-regulated marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Kaneko said on Monday that Nikko would be expanding its branch
network, building small offices in many places. He also said the
bank would cut costs by disposing of physical assets and reducing
fringe benefits and entertainment costs.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs will result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Travelers is taking only 49 percent ownership in the
new joint venture, Nikko, which gets the rest, runs the risk of
domination by its foreign partner. Many ailing Japanese companies
face the same risk as they strike alliances and partnerships with
overseas firms primarily seeking a ready-made list of clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nikko will run the risk of losing weight because the company
will move its most promising areas of business, like investment
banking business, to the new joint venture,'' said Yushiro Ikuyo, a
financial analyst at Commerz Securities Japan, who formerly worked
at Smith Barney here. ``Nikko may end up becoming a marketing
representative for Travelers' financial products.''

RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET FALLS MORE THAN 10 PERCENT; BANKS' RATINGS
LOWERED  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Despite President Clinton's effort to bring about an
end to Russia's financial crisis, the outlook continued to darken
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock market fell by more than 10 percent, and there
were signs of strain among banks and in Russia's young futures
market.
</P>
<P>
   The major test, however, will come on Wednesday when the
government tries to sell eight billion rubles worth of treasury
bills. Analysts fear that the government will find it difficult to
find buyers, further unnerving legions of jittery investors.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what Washington had hoped for when Clinton said on
Sunday that the United States was ready to support additional
financial aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that it expected
to disburse $670 million in assistance this month. And the
statement by Clinton was intended to underscore American support
for an international effort that would go well beyond that, if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement contained no figures or details about how
and when the additional assistance might be organized. But the
theory was the Clinton administration could could soothe investors
simply by publicizing Washington's willingness to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good statement,'' said Yegor Gaidar, the former
prime minister who has been advising Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko. ``It is exactly what the markets now need to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday the markets appeared to turn a deaf ear. Investors
said the slide reflected a number of factors, among them the
vagueness of Clinton's pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Central Bank has about $14.5 billion in reserves, about
$10 billion of which is in cash reserves that can be readily spent
to prop up the ruble. Some Western bankers say Russia needs to have
an international line of credit for an additional $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of good words about potential actions,''
a European investment banker said. ``But the fact is this market
has been hurt so badly that words alone may not accomplish
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, investors remained worried about the durability of
Russian financial system, which is being rocked by the turmoil on
the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's banks have lost huge sums in the stock market and are
short of cash. One leading bank, Tokobank, has already been place
in receivership by the Central Bank, as bank officials and
creditors try to negotiate a restructuring of its debt.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the banks are being squeezed by the Central
Bank's decision to hike interest rates to 150 percent, a move that
was taken to discourage currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent the market is less worried about the solvency
of the government than about the solvency of the banking system,''
said Tom Adshead, co-director of research at United Financial
Group, based in Moscow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday, Russian officials did their best to project an image of
quiet competence. Kiriyenko summoned foreign bankers to a meeting,
where he promised to win parliamentary support for tax reform and
lower corporate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let us know that he understood the situation was not just
due to external factors,'' said a banker who attended the meeting.
``He reiterated that there are internal actions that have to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   To further mollify investors, Russian officials say the Central
Bank has been gradually moving to expand its reserve. Sergei
Aleksashenko, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said the
bank bought $400 million of foreign currency last week.
</P>
<P>
   American officials praised the Russian government's efforts and
stressed that they were consulting with industrialized nations in
the Group of Seven about how to help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the need for industrialized nations to cooperate in
developing an aid package for Russia, Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, speaking in Vienna, warned Monday that the
economic distress in Russia could spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's problem has the potential to become in turn Central
Europe's and the world's,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the somewhat distant prospect of additional help failed
to boost Russia's financial markets. Brokers here said the trading
on the stock exchange was minimal, because of a lack of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's futures market suspended trading after some
participants failed to fulfill their obligations. The exchange rate
for the ruble slightly worsened, slipping 0.34 points to 6.172 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Potyomkin, a senior Central Bank official, said the
government was counting on several sources to raise desperately
needed revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Loans from international financial institutions like the I.M.F.
and foreign governments, he said, were ``crucial.'' Another source
of funds is the auction of state property.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko signaled Monday night that he was pressing ahead with
a new auction to sell the state's Rosneft oil company. The starting
price will be $1.6 billion. That is about $500 million less than
the government had hoped for in last week's auction, which was
canceled for lack of bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Russian officials are negotiating with foreign
banks, which have been lining up to offer financing. Russian
officials, however, are apprehensive about the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard there are offers from five or six banks,'' a
European banker said. ``Most banks are of the view that Russia will
eventually overcome this crisis of confidence by the investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Wednesday's sale of treasury bills was emerging as an
important test.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to raise about 8 billion rubles ($1.3
billion) through Wednesday's sale. But that is an expensive way to
finance the budget deficit. Because the interest rates the
government is offering are so high, some bills will be mature in
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has never before sold treasury securities
for such a short period. By doing so, the Kremlin is trying to buy
time and line up lower-cost sources of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some investment bankers, say the government may not be
able to sell all the bills. It would then have to dip into its
reserves to buy some of its own securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Wednesday auction goes smoothly, we will have passed
the most dangerous point,'' Gaidar said.

INDIA HIKES MILITARY, RESEARCH OUTLAYS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Declaring that there can be ``no compromise
on defense preparedness'' in the wake of the nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan, the government of Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced Monday that it has approved large
budget increases for the country's armed forces, as well as for
nuclear research and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   In their first budget, the Hindu nationalist leaders who head
the country's coalition government revealed that military outlays
will go up by 14 percent, part of which will pay wage increases for
India's 1.6 million troops. The budget increase is among the
largest ever made by India in peacetime, and will push total
military outlays to the equivalent of $12.4 billion, about 19
percent of total government outlays of $64.3 billion. Indian
economists estimate the total annual output of the Indian economy
at about $265 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The military increases were dwarfed by increases of 68 percent
for the Atomic Energy Commission, in charge of civilian and
military nuclear programs, and 62 percent for the Department of
Space, which helps develop rockets that India has used to launch
space satellites as well as military variants the Vajpayee
government has said will be equipped with nuclear warheads.
Together, the outlays on nuclear and missile research will amount
to $665 million, up $262 million from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yashwant Sinha, the finance minister, also announced large
increases in spending on education, health, family welfare and
development programs for women and children, the core of India's
efforts to relieve the dire poverty and illiteracy that afflict
more than 350 million of its 980 million people. But even with an
increase of 35 percent, the total outlay for these programs, about
$2.6 billion, was only fractionally more than the budget for
military hardware, and about 20 percent of the overall defense
outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indians were surprised that the budget appeared to have
made no allowance for the economic sanctions the United States has
imposed on India, as well as Pakistan, in the wake of the nuclear
tests. Sinha, who appeared to have made his plans on the basis of
the tax revenues, investment flows and growth rates that were
forecast before the nuclear blasts, predicted a doubling of foreign
investment within two years, encouraged by new steps he announced
to ease bureaucratic obstacles to new projects, and to sell off
large chunks of some of the best-known state-controlled
enterprises. One of these will be Indian Airlines, the country's
troubled domestic air carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Sinha said he was confident the sanctions would not ``have any
significant impact on our economic development.'' In any case, he
said later, Indian officials calculate it will be 12 to 18 months
before the sanctions begin to cut significantly into the flow of
loans, investment, trade and aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the finance minister appeared anxious to counter some of the
harshest criticism the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 have prompted
in India. While opinion polls continue to show approval ratings of
80 percent for the tests, newspaper editorials, speeches by
opposition leaders and street protests have offered a different
view _ that the Vajpayee government has betrayed the hopes of
millions of India's ill-nourished, illiterate and disease-prone
citizens by committing the country to the vast costs of a nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinha, 60, a former civil servant and diplomat who only recently
joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party that
came to power 10 weeks ago at the head of a 14-party coalition,
told Parliament that in drafting the budget he had used a moral
standard set by Mohandas K. Gandhi, India's independence leader.
``I have recalled to myself the face of the poorest and weakest man
I have seen and made sure that this budget is of use to him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since India's nuclear tests, senior officials in the Vajpayee
government have said the country will mount nuclear warheads on a
range of missiles that have been test-fired in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats said Monday that the budget increases,
while steep, did not necessarily mean that India intended to
proceed immediately with missile deployments, a step some Indian
military analysts have said will cost at least $1 billion a year.
Sinha told reporters that once the government had take a firm
decision on ``weaponization,'' he would return to Parliament for
more money on top of the defense increases in the budget. The
diplomats said that the new outlays could be intended for
stepped-up research on warheads and missiles, and for new missile
tests that Indian scientists have already said are pending, with
actual operational deployment still months or years away.

`THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY': LIFE OF A CHILD, MINUTE BY
DETAILED MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his delightfully quirky first novel, ``The Mezzanine''
(1988), Nicholson Baker hinted that his love of detail and
obsession with minutiae stemmed from his vivid, tactile memories of
childhood: ``Will the time ever come,'' he wondered, ``when I am
not so completely dependent on thoughts I first had in childhood to
furnish the feedstock for my comparisons and analogies and sense of
the parallel rhythms of microhistory? Will I reach a point where
there will be a good chance, I mean more than 50-50 chance, that
any random idea popping back into the foreground of my
consciousness will be an idea that first came to me when I was an
adult, rather than one I had repeatedly as a child?''
</P>
<P>
   Given Baker's superawareness of his childhood, it's not
surprising that his latest novel, ``The Everlasting Story of
Nory,'' should take the form of a 9-year-old's story of ``the
absolute best year of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Baker focuses his novel on ``little snibbets of the
day.'' His first two novels took adult minutiae and extrapolated
them into entire books: ``The Mezzanine'' chronicled a man's lunch
hour in which he buys a new pair of shoelaces, a cookie and a small
container of milk; ``Room Temperature'' described a young father
giving his infant daughter a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nory'' deals with similarly momentous issues in the life of a
fourth-grader, like the pros and cons of admitting that you like
Barbie dolls, the difficulty of getting the right amount of
toothpaste on your toothbrush and the problems of lending someone
your pencil box at school.
</P>
<P>
   The results of trying to write an entire book about the ``dozens
and hundreds of little tiny things'' that happen to a 9-year-old
are decidedly mixed. Although the book once again showcases Baker's
gift for microscopically detailed observation, its heroine is so
young, so naked of emotional history that her daily routines don't
trigger the sort of engaging philosophical musings and
stream-of-consciousness reminiscences that fleshed out the grown-up
hero's day in ``The Mezzanine.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the reader is left with a thin, highly predictable
narrative about a schoolgirl's banal _ and uneventful _ life:
getting up, getting dressed, going to school, making friends,
squabbling with friends, going on outings with parents, going to
sleep, having dreams and nightmares, getting up the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are moments of funny, unnerving verisimilitude that
recapture exactly what it felt like to be 9, these moments are
sandwiched between pages and pages of stultifying talk about
matters like orthodontics and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the character Nory often seems like a
deliberate effort on Baker's part to create an antithesis to Arno
Strine, the obnoxious hero of his 1994 novel ``The Fermata'': Where
Arno was hypocritical, Nory is sincere; where Arno was selfish,
Nory is selfless; where Arno was manipulative and self-deluding,
Nory is innocent and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these black-and-white personality types makes for a
terribly complicated _ or interesting _ character, and in this
case, Nory's willful niceness can become irritating and cloying.
She is constantly talking about the golden rule and the fairness of
this or that. She worries about ladybugs' eating aphids and
mongooses' eating snakes. She is the one girl at school to stick up
for the school pariah, and the one girl to tell the teachers about
the school bullies.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps Nory from becoming a complete goody-goody is her keen
and unrelenting sense of logic. Nory wonders why so many cathedrals
are designed in the shape of a crucifix, why ``they have to
concentrate on the awful way he died.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On hearing the myth of Achilles, she wonders why his mother held
him by the heels to dip him in the River Styx, why she hadn't
climbed in the river herself and gently cradled him in the water.
On hearing the old homily about ``the straw that broke the camel's
back,'' she wonders why the camel didn't fold its knees and sit
down in the sand before its back gave out.
</P>
<P>
   In such passages, Baker demonstrates an innate understanding of
the clarity and common sense that bright children so often possess,
and he uses this instinctive knowledge to imbue Nory's story with a
sprightly, eccentric humor.
</P>
<P>
   Other passages in the novel, however, have the labored,
self-conscious smell of a grown-up trying too hard to impersonate a
child. When Nory is hit by some bird droppings, she exclaims: ``A
disgusting bird took its leisure on me!'' And when she sees a
bank's corporate sponsorship logo at the local cathedral, she
worries that it will make people think about cash machines, instead
of the Virgin Mary's love for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Nory's stories _ and she turns out to be an inveterate
storyteller who's constantly regaling her stuffed animals with
tales _ also reverberate with suspiciously grown-up ideas: that
children are obsessed with Grimm Brother-esque violence and terror;
that children are conscious of the therapeutic rewards of art (of
making order out of chaos, happy endings out of sad ones).
</P>
<P>
   Nory prattles on about the morals of stories, and concocts her
own rules for storytelling like ``You really need something to fail
in a story, because then when it fails it has to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of very adult advice that Baker, himself, should have
listened to in writing this plotless and all too often listless
novel.

COMMENTARY: BRAINLESS IN GAZA  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was something so completely, utterly and ridiculously over
the top about House Speaker Newt Gingrich's trip to Israel last
week that the trip actually becomes a useful object lesson. It is
rare that you see such an Olympic-quality, full-body pander for
Jewish votes and campaign donations _ without any regard for U.S.
interests or regional stability. This trip was to pandering what a
triple lutz is to ice skating.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the context of Gingrich's Israel trip: Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has presented Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu with a fair-minded plan for satisfying Israel's security
needs and the Palestinians' territorial requests, and to move the
process into final-status talks. Though the U.S. plan protects
Israel's security needs, it does not satisfy every fantasy of every
extremist in Bibi's Cabinet. Therefore, Netanyahu has to choose: Go
with the United States and Palestinians, and advance the process
but lose part of his coalition, or hold his whole coalition and
lose the process.
</P>
<P>
   This is a hard choice for him. Bibi does not want to be blamed
for reigniting the conflict. It would be Bosnia on the Jordan. But
he is obviously reluctant to confront far-right opponents of the
plan, like Ariel Sharon. (Why he won't take on Sharon, I don't
know. I'd bet on Bibi in that debate.) So Netanyahu keeps delaying
and trying to squeeze even more out of the Americans and
Palestinians, hoping for a deal that would be so overwhelmingly in
Israel's favor that Sharon's complaints would be neutralized. But
this would make the deal impossible for Palestinians to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton team has the courage to tell it like it is, and
keep the pressure on Netanyahu, he will eventually accept the U.S.
plan. It is too much in Israel's and his own long-term interest.
But he will avoid choosing as long as he can.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Newt do? First he denounces Albright as an
``agent'' for the Palestinians. Nice. Then, while in Israel, he
signals Netanyahu that if he decides to go with his hard-liners and
reject the U.S. plan _ no problem: Newt will make sure Bibi suffers
no penalty in Washington. Newt's message to Bibi was clear: If the
process collapses, I'll blame Bill Clinton, not you. I will
sacrifice the efficacy of American diplomacy for the short-term
needs of Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be more cynical? Gingrich also planned to lay the
cornerstone for moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, from Tel
Aviv. When the White House warned him this could trigger an
explosion, he backed off, but he did declare Jerusalem ``the united
and eternal capital of Israel'' _ in contravention of U.S. policy
that Jerusalem's final status should be negotiated by the parties.
I hope Jerusalem stays Israel's eternal capital too, but to rub
this in the face of Palestinians when the United States is trying
to persuade them to accept other compromises is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's pathetic performance was typical of this moment,
when the illusion is widespread that the peace process is just
about domestic U.S. politics, and who can mobilize Congress and the
Jews the best.
</P>
<P>
   But believe it or not, there is still a Middle East. Out there,
pressure is mounting to bring Iraq back into the Arab fold. Saudi
Arabia is trying to organize an Arab conference that would probably
freeze Israel-Arab relations as long as the peace process is
frozen. The Hamas leader Sheik Yassin has just completed a
triumphant money-raising tour of Arab capitals as part of his goal
to wipe out Yasser Arafat and then Israel. And Jordan is terrified
that Netanyahu is going to reject the U.S. plan and make it
impossible for Jordan to sustain its relationship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this sort of pro-Israel, muscle beach party before,
where everyone thinks that the only reality is U.S.-Israel politics
and that everyone else is a paper tiger. It was 15 years ago, when
on May 17, 1983, the Reagan team and Israel's Likud government
crammed down the throats of the Lebanese an unbalanced, totally
pro-Israel plan for the withdrawal of most, but not all, Israeli
troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But the May 17 agreement was never implemented. The U.S. Marine
compound in Beirut was blown up five months after it was signed.
And both the Marines and Israel had to pull out of central Lebanon
unilaterally, at great cost and leaving an enormous mess.

 &HT;    Former major leaguer Burroughs knows son destined for greatness
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His son was not even four, but Jeff Burroughs knew
there was something special about him. He knew when Sean could
barely handle a fork and spoon but could pick up a bat, his little
elbow cocked in perfect position, and whack one ball after another
off a tee. He knew when Sean was not even toilet-trained, but could
stand 20 feet away and throw a baseball right into daddy's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Like the father of Tiger Woods, Jeff Burroughs, a former Braves
player, knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was so natural, even back then,'' Jeff said from his home
in Long Beach, Calif. ``He picked things up so easily. I guess you
can say it was like he was born with a bat in his crib.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's really no surprise; it's all in the genes. The
older Burroughs, 48, once was one of the major leagues' best power
hitters. He won the American League MVP for the Texas Rangers in
1974 and then played in Atlanta in 1977-80.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his son is expected to be an early first-round pick in
the amateur baseball draft, some 29 years after Jeff was the first
overall choice, taken by the Washington Senators before they moved
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the same life all over again,'' Jeff said. ``We're
real excited around here, especially because Sean has really moved
up the ladder. I don't think anybody thought a year ago that he
would be drafted in the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's Jeff who has made sure Sean has gotten to this point.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from baseball in 1985, after hitting 240 home
runs in 16 major-league seasons with five different clubs, he
didn't go to coach in the minor leagues like so many other
ex-ballplayers do. After making $300,000 in his last year in the
majors, he had an adequate nest egg, so he began to coach Sean, who
was seven.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Jeff and Sean were together in the Little
League World Series. They won two titles, and during those days,
Jeff said, ``I became more known for being Sean's father instead of
him being known as my son. ... Let's face it, it took me 20 years
to finally make it to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Sean was a 12-year-old throwing a 75-mph fastball
and hitting 350-foot homers. He routinely was walked intentionally.
The experience fostered a close relationship between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always given me pointers and told me things,'' Sean said.
``I relished it when he did. I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Little League, others kids started to catch up with
Sean. The same thing happened to Marietta's Marc Pisciotta, a
Little League phenom who struggled during his high school and
college years. But Pisciotta persevered and made it to the majors,
where he is a middle reliever for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the success in Little League really put a lot of pressure
on Sean to do well,'' Jeff said. ``But I think this year he really
blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wilson High in Long Beach, the same place where Jeff went to
school, Sean hit .507 with five homers and 29 RBIs. He no longer
pitches but plays a strong third base. Baseball America rates Sean
as the best pure high school hitter in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Snyder, the Braves' director of scouting and player
personnel, has seen the younger Burroughs play. ``He really handles
himself well defensively,'' Snyder said. ``He plays the game like a
polished kid that has been around the professional scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences in father and son. Jeff hit
right-handed, while Sean swings from the left side, making him even
more coveted by the pros. Sean, a 6-foot-2, 200-pounder, also is
much leaner than his father was at the same age. He is a better
athlete, too, after playing soccer to enhance his agility and
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sean appears to be assured a top-10 spot, with the San Diego
Padres showing interest with the No. 9 pick. But even if Sean falls
a few places, Jeff and he will become only the second father-son
team to be taken in the first round; the first were Tom and Ben
Grieve. And Sean's signing bonus could be around $2 million, which
would be almost as much as his father made his entire career. Jeff
received an $80,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also the scholarship Sean signed with Southern Cal.
If he can't work out a deal with the team that selects him, the
younger Burroughs might decide to go to college and try the draft
again after his junior year.

 &HT;    Delta may buy stake in its Brazilian partner
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines may buy a minority stake in Brazilian
partner Transbrasil, which needs fresh capital amid fare wars that
followed deregulation of the country's airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Transbrasil official told Blooomberg News the carrier is
negotiating to sell up to 20 percent of its voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get fresh investment and technology, while Delta would
get a partner in Brazil,'' said Jorge Honorio, a Transbrasil
spokesman in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta, which earlier this year bought a 35 percent
stake in AeroPeru, declined comment on any negotiations. But a
spokesman acknowledged a continued relationship with Transbrasil is
important for Delta's year-old service to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership with Transbrasil and the Brazil service have
been very successful,'' said spokesman Bill Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Under their current relationship, which doesn't include any
investment by Delta, the two carriers sell seats on each other's
flights. That means Delta can book passengers not just between
Atlanta and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two cities where its
jets fly, but also to Transbrasil's destinations within Brazil.
Transbrasil, likewise, can book passengers on Delta's U.S. flights.
Delta earlier had a similar deal with Varig, a larger Brazilian
carrier, but Varig called off the partnership last year.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing pacts with in-country carriers is a key to Delta's
Latin expansion plans, as well as those of other U.S. carriers.
Equity purchases by U.S. carriers reflect the value they put on the
deals. For instance, AeroPeru also needed capital and was able to
make itself the object of a bidding war between Delta and
Continental Airlines. Delta starts Peru service this summer. Delta
also has a partnership with Aeropostal of Venezuela, where it
started service in April, but that deal does not include any
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has numerous code-share deals with carriers in Europe, but
its only financial investment is a 5 percent equity stake in
Swissair.

 &HT;    Can Jordan prevail again?
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is it possible to win a game before it even starts, to
catapult a team to the NBA Finals on the force of sheer will and
mental influence? Could Michael Jordan be that good?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. It's too simple to say the Chicago Bulls begin their
quest for a second three-peat Wednesday in Salt Lake City against
the Utah Jazz as much because of Jordan's words and determination
as his skill. But it is indisputable that his team follows his
lead, and he has not abused such responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to keep it together,'' Jordan said. ``Sometimes to
score, but also sometimes to encourage and sometimes to push.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Indiana Pacers won Game 6 of the Eastern Conference
finals at Market Square Arena on Friday, the feeling permeated that
the Bulls were ripe for the picking. The champions, who prided
themselves on their ability to close out teams on the brink, did
not deliver the deciding blow. The series, thought to be another
Chicago short-order formality, was tied at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   So in the postgame press conference, Jordan issued an
uncharacteristic public assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win Game 7,'' he said. ``I don't make promises,
(even) to my wife, but we will win Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Jordan make such a departure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped on it so quickly so my players wouldn't let that
thinking seep into their minds,'' Jordan said. ``I put it out
there. Game 7 was a do-or-die game. There were going to be a lot of
questions about whether we were vulnerable or not. I wanted them
all to come into the game believing we would win. That's why I
jumped on it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   His thinking seemed to affect his team. ``I think Michael said
what we all needed to hear,'' guard Steve Kerr said. ``If he's
saying we're going to win, it gives us all confidence. We needed to
feel that way going into Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime of Sunday's 88-83 victory, Jordan tore into his
team, demanding that players ignore the officials and ``shut up and
play'' because their concentration was wavering. They did as Jordan
demanded. Meanwhile, M.J.'s shooting eye was blurry (9-for-25
shooting), but his focus was centered. His teammates, particularly
Toni Kukoc (21 points) were significant. In an exhausting effort,
Jordan pulled down nine rebounds, had eight assists and shut down
Reggie Miller in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's the best in the league, probably the best
player ever,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ``When I played, if
the shot wasn't there, I did other things to help the team. It's
the same with Michael. He picked it up in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's on to Utah, which many believe will end the Bulls'
run. The fear factor Chicago once brought into a championship
series no longer exists. But they are 5-0 in championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the swagger gone? Probably,'' Jordan admitted. ``Maybe
we've become a little cocky, with a swagger. But that's just human
nature. Nobody's taken what we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going for (the title) the third time, it's not
uncommon to lose focus, to fight against yourself to excel. There
are so many expectations people have, it's harder to live up to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the people of Utah saw Jordan in the playoffs _ in
last year's Game 5 of the finals _ he was ill with stomach flu. He
scored 37 in a critical Chicago victory. That's will.
</P>
<P>
   Is one more title left in Jordan's bottomless well?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``We're fighting an uphill battle, but we
haven't lost our confidence. ... (In Utah), I won't stay in Park
City (like last year, where he got sick). I won't have any pizza. I
want to be ready. Physically, we have to take care of our bodies.
We're tired, but our hearts are not. If people want to believe
we're beatable, fine. But we still have to play the games.''

 &HT;    Former Bulls coach remembers Jordan's early days in NBA
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tongue-wagging, Michael Jordan who goes after his sixth, and
perhaps last NBA title this week, first surfaced the third day of
the Chicago Bulls' training camp in 1984. Kevin Loughery, then head
coach, remembers the moment like it was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was we gave him the ball in a drill, one on one,
against the whole team, and he immediately started going through
guys, killing 'em,'' Loughery recalls. ``We knew he was a great
athlete, but we didn't know he had all those skills. We knew we had
a terrific prospect, but really, we didn't know what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls knew this much about Jordan, who would become the
league's scoring champion 10 times: ``He was a better shooter than
given credit for,'' Loughery said. ``He worked all day at it. But
then he started going one on one, scoring all kinds of different
ways -- in the post, jumping over people, outside. I looked at Rod
Thorn, and he looked at me, and we knew there was something very
special here.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jordan nears the end of his basketball career, maybe one
series away from retirement, Loughery recalls how it all started,
how greatness dazzled like a super nova in a dingy gym one October
day in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Boom: ``That day in camp when we knew we really had a special
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take that long to understand the wealth of Jordan's
abilities? ``He played with Dean (Smith) in a passing game (at
North Carolina), then with Bobby Knight in the Olympics. Same
style, so we didn't know he could handle it as well as does. Once
we did the drills, we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, now the NBA's operations chief, was general manager
of the Bulls. Jordan is the only holdover from his era, the only
player who predates incumbent general manager, Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Loughery recalls that, if he and Thorn had gotten their
preference, the Bulls would have taken Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1984
draft, but he went to Houston with the first pick. Portland already
had Clyde Drexler and Jim Paxson, so the Blazers selected Sam
Bowie, a center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there were two franchise guys in the draft, and we got
one of them,'' Loughery said from his North Atlanta home last week.
``The thing is, we drafted Michael knowing he was a great athlete,
even if we really didn't know he would be this great.''
</P>
<P>
   There were others who thought they knew. Philadelphia had picks
No. 5, 10 and 22 in that draft. They offered the Bulls the first
two (Charles Barkley and Leon Wood) plus Andrew Toney for pick No.
3. The Bulls said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who was offered, we wouldn't have taken it,''
Loughery said. ``We were convinced. There was no doubt in our
minds. We just felt that strongly about it. But no matter what you
see in talent, you can't know the total spirit until you have him.
His will to win surpasses everyone we've ever seen. That's what
separates guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Loughery compares Jordan's will to win with Bill Russell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill played 13 years, won 11 championships,'' Loughery said
``The other two years he was hurt. When he walked into locker room
it changed. He took over. That's how it was with Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really on his teammates, as much a leader as I've ever
seen. He gets his teammates motivated and pumped up. In any room,
he's the leader. He showed that immediately as a rookie. Before we
got out of training camp, he was the man. You don't see that. I
don't care what kind of talent you have, you don't see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. J. didn't have that. He was a great talent, but he didn't
take over like that. No one else. Jerry Sloan (coach of the Utah
Jazz) had Michael's drive to win, but he didn't have his offensive
talent. Some guys could approximate his talent, but they didn't
have his drive to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Loughery, coach of the Hawks from 1981-83, can appreciate
Jordan's talents at least once more, when he works the NBA Finals
for ESPN radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's treat for me,'' he said. ``A great treat.''

BUSH BELIEVES ATTORNEY SHOULD TELL HIS STORY IN GROWING TOBACCO
DISPUTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If Houston attorney Joe Jamail has information
that Attorney General Dan Morales improperly solicited millions of
dollars in the tobacco case, he should be allowed to tell his story
under oath, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the governor's communications director, said Bush
isn't involved in the effort to question Jamail. That dispute pits
Morales against seven legislators and their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``Joe Jamail has made it clear he wants to be
deposed ... If that's the case, we see no harm in letting the facts
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate court challenges, the governor and the seven
lawmakers are trying to block $2.3 billion in legal fees awarded to
five other private attorneys who helped Morales obtain the $15.3
billion tobacco settlement. They believe the fees are excessive.
</P>
<P>
   According to a document the legislators filed in federal court
last week, Morales solicited $1 million from each of several
lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The money was ``purportedly for the purpose of defending General
Morales against possible attacks from the tobacco companies,'' the
document said. It didn't specify what types of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, which Morales denies, was based on information
provided by Jamail, who was interviewed by Morales for the tobacco
case but was not hired.
</P>
<P>
   The document was filed with U.S. District Judge David Folsom of
Texarkana to support the legislators' efforts to question Jamail
about his discussions with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is trying to block Jamail's deposition, but Folsom
hasn't ruled on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail, best known for representing Pennzoil in a 1987 case that
produced a $3 billion settlement and forced Texaco into bankruptcy,
has declined to publicly discuss his meetings with the attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to tell what I know under oath. Perhaps Mr.
Morales ought to get under oath and tell what he knows,'' he said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Umphrey of Beaumont, one of the lawyers hired by Morales
when the tobacco lawsuit was filed in 1996, attended one meeting in
which money for Morales was discussed, the court document said.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey has declined to comment, but a spokesman for him and the
other outside lawyers, said the claim is ``wholly unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales spokesman Ward Tisdale said the attorney general opposes
the effort to question Jamail because the legislators aren't
parties to the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale said the only money Morales asked the lawyers to provide
was for lawsuit expenses. Each of the five lawyers hired for the
suit agreed to risk $2 million of their own money in return for a
15 percent contingency agreement.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was settled in January, the five lawyers
estimated they actually spent $40 million during their two years
working on the case. Cigarette companies have reimbursed them for
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Morales nor the outside lawyers have publicly accounted
for how most of the $40 million was spent, despite a formal demand
submitted by Bush to the attorney general's office three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale said Morales didn't require the lawyers to detail most
of their expenses because they were working under a contingency
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The only expense reports Morales said he received from the
outside lawyers totaled $1.7 million for 1996, the year the lawsuit
was filed. The attorney general quit requiring regular expense
reports after that.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Morales filed court documents showing that the
private attorneys were at one point willing to consider a
``substantial'' reduction in their fees. Sources close to the case
have said the attorneys recently agreed to take $800 million to
$1.5 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction was to be mediated by two U.S. 5th Circuit Appeals
Court judges, but the governor ``refused to participate in the
mediation,'' Morales wrote in a letter filed with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, has said there was never a
serious offer to mediate and no guarantee that part of the fees
wouldn't come out of the state's share of the settlement.

ROCK RADIO: IF IN DOUBT, WEAR IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I love the song ``I Got You,'' by Split Enz.
</P>
<P>
   Tuneful, catchy, biting lyrics _ I've thought it a classic since
it was released in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, I'm afraid I'm going to get sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   How, you may ask, is it possible to become tired of a song in
1998 that came out
</P>
<P>
   18 years before?
</P>
<P>
   Because I live in Phoenix, Arizona, the Valley of the Sun and
the home of retread rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no wide-eyed naif. I know that mainstream radio isn't where
I'm likely to discover new rock songs. The days of adventuro us,
college-radio-style free-form programming, when you could hear a
Let's Active song, followed by a Throbbing Gristle tune, topped off
with a Mission of Burma ditty (``That's When I Reach for My
Revolver,'' preferably), are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Bu t I heard ``I Got You'' five times in one week not long ago.
You couldn't hear it that often when it was popular. Hearing it so
many times alerted me to a question that's long troubled me:
</P>
<P>
   Isn't anyone else sick of hearing the same old songs?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some Valley stations play ``alternative'' and ``new'' rock.
But more often than not, it's something that has been featured in a
movie soundtrack or is already in heavy rotation on MTV. And when
they do latch onto something new, they play
</P>
<P>
   it to death.
</P>
<P>
   Or haven't you heard ``Sex and Candy'' enough by now? Good luck
hearing anything else on the Marcy Playground CD until it's
released as a single.
</P>
<P>
   So radio is no longer a useful tool for rock exploration. That's
OK. That's why used-CD stores exist. It's incumbent upon the
explorer to expend a little legwork when looking for adventure,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But what are we to make of flipping through the radio dial while
driving and hearing Bob Seger warble ``Against the Wind' ' on three
stations at the same time? Coincidence? Bad luck? Alien invasion?
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to blame this on the limited adventurousness of
the Rogaine set, the baby boomers who refuse to listen to any
music, no matter how interesting or impo rtant, that's made by
anyone who either (1) didn't appear at the original Woodstock (2)
hasn't entered rehab at least once or (3) falls into the
electronic/rap/industrial/ambient/other category (that's just so
much noise, they'll complain, much as
</P>
<P>
   their parents did when they heard Jimi Hendrix songs blasting
from their bedroom record players).
</P>
<P>
   But is that really the answer? Some geezers still write good
music, after all. Last year, Bob Dylan released what critics hailed
as his best album since before his son was teething, much less
leading the Wallflowers. But where could you hear it? At the homes
of people who bought the CD, I guess. Otherwise, tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classic'' rock rambles on, spewing out a steady diet of old
Seger, Bad Company, Journey and the like. Sure, you may hear ``Born
to
</P>
<P>
   Run'' several times a week, but you won't hear anything from
``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' Bruce Springsteen's last _ and
well-received _ CD.
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, money plays a big part in all this. As in,
making it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a market like Phoenix, which is over-radioed anyway . . .
the market is very competitive,'' said Shaun Holly, programming
director at KGLQ (FM 96.9), a ``classic hits'' station.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radio station that really wants to win has to play
everything that's familiar and nothing that's unfamiliar. As a
result, you kind of narrow the margins of what you're going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   And to answer my earlier question, no, apparently you aren't sic
k of hearing the same old songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to run the risk and say, `Man, how many times are
you going to play that Bob Seger song?' '' Holly asked. ``And my
answer to that is, `As many times as people want to hear that Bob
Seger song .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. On second thought, forget what I said about ``I Got You.''
Terrible song. No reason to play this one on the radio again.
Please don't request it.
</P>

CHILL OUT: FREON FOR OLDER CARS IS PLENTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Summer's almost here, and once again drivers of
</P>
<P>
   older cars are wondering whether there will be any Freon left to
recharge their air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, say Valley air-conditioning experts and mechanics.
The refrigerant is not only readily available but it's actually
cheaper than it was last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is down and supplies are plentiful,'' said Ward
Atkinson, a Scottsdale air-conditioning specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the outlook seemed grim: production of the
refrigerant R-12, known as Freon, would ce ase in 1995, forcing
motorists everywhere to endure an expensive conversion of their
automobile air-conditioners to use a new generation of refrigerant.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the world supply of Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon
banned because of its suspe cted role in depletion of the Earth's
protective ozone layer, would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Production of Freon is banned, all right, but instead of
supplies evaporating, the refrigerant is readily available and
should stay t hat way for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson credited the stockpiling of the chemical by automakers,
dealers and mechanics; an aggressive recycling program; and reduced
usage of R-12 as older cars are taken off the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things have r esulted in an adequate supply,''
Atkinson said. ``Recycling cut usage tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1993, automakers began converting new cars from R-12
to R-134a, a new breed of refrigerant without the environmental
hazard. By 1995, the entire new car and truck fleet was using
R-134a.
</P>
<P>
   But with hundreds of thousands of cars still using R-12, it
seemed that mechanics would reap a bonanza from retrofits to
R-134a. R-12 continues to be available, however, and drivers of
R-12 equipped cars
</P>
<P>
   are being urged to sit tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strongest recommendation is if it's an R-12 car, continue
to use R-12,'' said Atkinson, who worked with the federal
government in drawing up rules for banning R-12 production.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only time an yone should convert to the newer
refrigerant is if the AC system needs a big repair, such as a
compressor failure.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe mechanic and radio personality Mark Salem said he expects
R-12 supplies to last beyond the life span of most R-12 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have access to R-12 for at least the next four years,''
Salem said, noting that Freon use by his shop has been tapering off
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that right now there's a glut of 12. If the
summer is short, and we have onl y three months of servicing
air-conditioners instead of four, the bottom could fall out of
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, hoarding and speculation caused the wholesale price
of R-12 to spike to more than $600 for a 30-pound tank. The gas was
so valu able that smuggling from Canada, Mexico and overseas was
becoming a significant issue.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the price is just more than $400 a tank wholesale,
and about $40 a pound retail, with a typical AC repair using about
3 pounds. About half of the
</P>
<P>
   retail cost is federal tax, levied to discourage hoarding and to
encourage conversions to 134a, which now costs about $10 a pound
retail.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Margraf, executive director of the Service Station Dealers
of Arizona, said her members are findin g it easy to get R-12.
</P>
<P>
   She urged that motorists steer away from the so-called drop-in
refrigerants that have been formulated to take the place of R-12.
The effectiveness is questionable in many of them, and they can't
be mixed with Freon or 13 4a.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do have car furnished with one of these types
refrigerants, basically your car is married to that shop,'' she
said. ``Other shops can't service the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said automakers and dealers stockpiled R-12 because of
fear s that the supply would dry up before they could service cars
and trucks under warranty. Now that the warranties are up on most
of these vehicles, the R-12 is becoming available.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of conversions also has fallen, Salem said, as the indu
stry develops parts and supplies that can be installed cheaply. If
a car does have a big repair, such as a seized compressor, then it
can be converted to 134a, which should add only about $100 to the
total bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't convert unless you have to,'' Salem said, ``because
it's not worth it and because they're sitting on a huge stockpile
of R-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``When should you retrofit? The answer has always been and
continues to be, when you have a major system failure.'' &QL;

RULEMAKERS APPROVE CHANGE UNPOPULAR WITH BANKS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The nation's accounting rulemakers said Monday that they had given
final approval to a new rule that will force companies to record
the value of derivatives in their financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The move was immediately criticized by the banking industry and
other groups, who have complained so loudly in Washington about the
proposed rule in recent months that a bill has been introduced to
weaken the power of the private rule-making body, known as the
Financial Accounting Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Jenkins, the chairman of the accounting board, said that
the new rule was needed to help protect investors in cases where
companies may be investing heavily in derivatives that could result
in huge losses. He added that the intense criticism had made it
even more important for the board to act.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the accounting board decided to weaken
another proposed rule on the accounting of employee stock options
after companies complained to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the board had backed down on derivatives, I think it would
have made it very difficult for the board to be an effective
standard setter in the future,'' Jenkins said. ``It is crucial that
we have independent standard setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven members of the accounting board voted unanimously to
approve the new rule during balloting that concluded late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives are complicated financial contracts between two or
more parties where the contract's value is tied to an underlying
asset or pre-existing index. Companies use derivatives such as
swaps and futures contracts to reduce the risk they face from
fluctuating foreign currencies or interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule will require companies to record the market value
of the derivatives on their balance sheets and to include the gains
or losses on those contracts in income. Most companies must start
using the rule in January 2000 _ a month that company executives
are already worried about because of the potential havoc that the
millenium date could have on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and other companies said that the accounting rule was not
practical. They said that companies already provided enough
information on derivatives in notes that must be included with
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the federal Reserve,
sided with the banks and urged the accounting board to refrain from
dramatic rules changes. Greenspan warned that the new rule could
keep companies from using derivatives and could ``constrain prudent
risk management practices.''
</P>
<P>
   But at times, companies have created more risk for themselves by
entering the derivative contracts. For example, Procter &AMP; Gamble
lost tens of millions of dollars in 1994 on derivative contracts
that were tied to interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are some who have been trying to force
the FASB to not issue this standard, preventing valuable
information from reaching investors,'' Jenkins said. ``We must
avoid placing the interests of any particular group over the
consumers' interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All publicly held companies must follow the rules of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, a privately financed group
based in Norwalk, Conn. The Securities and Exchange Commission can
sanction any company that does not abide by the board's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill introduced by Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., any
accounting rule proposed by the accounting board would have to be
approved by federal regulators at the SEC. The bill by Baker would
also make it easier for companies to challenge the new accounting
rules in court.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., has introduced another bill that
would exempt banks from using the new derivatives rule unless
banking regulators give their approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, a group that includes banks and other companies, said
the new rule was ``a flawed product adopted in a process that
ignored widespread dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins said that the board had considered the comments by
the banks and other companies during more than 140 meetings it had
on the proposed rule. In response to the comments, the board
delayed the rule's effective date by two years and agreed that
companies' meeting certain requirements will not have to include
the changes in a derivative's value in income.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board was created in 1972 as a private sector
body, Jenkins said, to try to keep politics and the ``self-serving
objectives of special interest groups'' out of the rulemaking
process.
</P>
<P>
   Many investor groups, government officials and companies have
urged Congress not to change the process of setting the nation's
accounting rules, which are widely considered to be the strongest
in the world.

PHILADELPHIA TRANSIT UNION GOES ON STRIKE OVER RULES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After three months of fruitless negotiations, the
city's largest transit union went on strike Monday, shutting down a
nexus of buses, trolleys and subways that serves up to 435,000
people a day.
</P>
<P>
   Because negotiations had been going on since March, the city was
not caught unawares. The municipal government and many employers
had contingency plans in place for their workers that included
private buses, extra cars on the regional railroads that continue
to operate and free parking throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   For those who live in the suburbs, the strike meant somewhat
heavier rush-hour traffic, and Mayor Edward Rendell predicted that
downtown businesses could suffer. But the largest burden seemed to
fall on working-class people with no cars who rely on public
transportation to reach school and work.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for a 3-year labor agreement that had proceeded
intermittently broke off after a brief session on Sunday with
management and union leaders agreeing only that vast differences
remained in their bargaining positions.
</P>
<P>
   Certain that no breakthrough was possible, Steven Brookens,
president of the Transport Workers Union 234, appeared at a morning
news conference to announce that his 5,400 members would walk off
their jobs as drivers and maintenance workers at noon. They did,
and three hours later several hundred strikers staged a noisy
demonstration at City Hall and briefly blocked traffic in front of
management headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Brookens said. ``We tried the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   John Leary Jr., general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, spoke to reporters as the strike began.
``We hoped it would not have gotten to this point,'' he said.
``It's a crying shame. This is senseless. It's needless. Our riders
deserve much better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphians are accustomed to disputes between transit unions
and the transportation authority, commonly known as SEPTA. This was
the fifth work stoppage in 21 years, the second in three years;
there was a two-week shutdown of the system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But a strike was hardly welcome at a time when Philadelphia is
charging ahead with efforts to market itself as a reborn urban
center, rich in tourist attractions, vibrant night life and
world-class cultural sites. And the city had become one of a
half-dozen contenders for the Republican national convention in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It was just too bad for Rendell, a Democrat, that the
Republicans' site-selection committee picked Monday to start a
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are particularly opposed to proposed changes in
workplace rules, including liberal use of part-time workers. They
claim management is insisting on the changes as a wedge to destroy
the union.
</P>
<P>
   But management officials, clinging to a stance they have held
since negotiations began, said Monday that the offer they made on
Saturday, which replicates a deal that the city's other transit
union overwhelmingly accepted and includes a 9 percent pay raise
over three years, was the best the striking union could expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a package that represents a wonderful economic
deal,'' said David Cohen, SEPTA's chief labor strategist and former
chief of staff to Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said in an interview that he had urged union leaders to
accept what he called ``an outstanding offer'' from SEPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he said, ``is that anything other than this
deal would require a raise in fares, which are already the highest
in the nation. That would mean a decline in service. Then we would
lose ridership, and that would cost the union jobs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rendell said he was especially disturbed that the union would
choose the Republicans' first event, a visit to Independence Mall,
for a demonstration. Philadelphia has not been host to a national
political convention in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and contingency plans aside, the start of the strike
caused an array of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford Eads, a security guard at Temple University who usually
takes a bus, hitched a ride home with a neighbor but got there an
hour later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For Tempris Smiley, a sixth-grader who takes a bus and subway
each way to school, the strike means forgoing the final two weeks
of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will cause me to fail,'' she said, although Rendell said
he expected schools to make allowances for absence or tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   Even striking drivers expressed uncertainty over a work stoppage
that some union members said could last months. At the Midvale
District depot, where drivers exchanged their empty buses for
picket signs, Bernie Grant, 30, a bus driver for five years,
watched the scene unfold with mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   All around him, his colleagues were barking out their protest
chants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might look like they're having a good time,'' he said.
``But you've got to stand up for what you believe in and be strong.
Nobody wants to be out here, and I may be smiling on the outside,
but inside I'm hurting.''

 &HT;    Lockheed eager for contract as Air Force upgrades C-5 jets
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin is vying for a multibillion-dollar
project to upgrade the military's C-5 heavy transport jets, a
contract that could mean continued stability for Lockheed and its
10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, speaking Monday at a Cobb
County Chamber of Commerce breakfast, said Lockheed is seeking two
government contracts to modernize the C-5's electronics and
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to complete the modernization of 126 C-5
jets in two phases. The first phase would replace the plane's
20-year-old electronic, navigation and communication systems. That
contract, worth $400 million to $500 million, is scheduled to be
awarded in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed spokesman Ray Crockett said the company's main
competitor is Raytheon of Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase would replace the C-5 engines at an estimated
cost of $4 billion to $5 billion. Bids are not out yet for the
second phase, which is to start in 2002, said Bill Arndt, Lockheed
program manager for C-5 modernization.
</P>
<P>
   While the two contracts could mean significant business for
Lockheed, they probably won't require additional employees,
Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Many who are working on the C-130J cargo plane would be nearing
the end of their production roles and could move to the C-5
project.
</P>
<P>
   The C-5, the military's largest cargo jet, is flown all over the
world every day, said Jim Grant, Lockheed director of airlift
marketing. It can carry six Apache helicopters or two M1 battle
tanks, each weighing 135,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The C-5 is six stories high and as long as a football field.
Despite its size, it can fly nonstop for 2,500 miles at jet speed.
In 1989, C-5 jets delivered 2 million pounds of cleanup gear to
those working on the oil spill in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In the Persian Gulf War, they carried nearly half a million
passengers, 15 mobile hospitals and more than 200 tons of mail each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed officials note that they built the C-5 and have the
knowledge to upgrade its systems. The electronics would be
Honeywell systems and the engines would be General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics and engines already are used on commericial
airlines, Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed builds the C-130J cargo plane and the new F-22 Stealth
fighter jet. Crockett said both projects represent a larger
percentage of the defense contractor's business than the C-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are the builder and want to continue to be the company
that takes care of the C-5,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The C-5 could last well into the next century, according to the
Air Force. But reliability, maintenance and operating costs could
ground the plane if changes aren't made to update the engines and
electronics, the Air Force said.
</P>
<P>
   It is much cheaper to replace engines and communications systems
than to replace cargo jets, Crockett said. Most of the planes,
though 25 to 30 years old, still have a significant life span.
</P>
<P>
   New engines would reduce the cost per flying hour by up to
one-third, and the cost of operating the engine would be one-tenth
of the current cost, Lockheed officials said.

CLINTON DROPS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday dropped the claims of
executive privilege he had invoked in the Lewinsky investigation,
moving to reduce the prospect of a quick Supreme Court review in
the highly charged constitutional clash between the White House and
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the president continued to press claims of a lawyer-client
privilege to sharply limit the questioning of Bruce Lindsey, one of
Clinton's closest confidantes. And the Justice Department filed its
intention Monday to appeal a lower-court ruling that ordered Secret
Service agents to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuver over executive privilege, approved by Clinton
at a meeting Monday morning with his lawyers, was an attempt by the
White House to narrow its appeal so as to rob the Supreme Court of
an opportunity for a fast review, as independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has sought. If the tactic works, it could prolong the legal
wrangling between the president and the independent counsel for
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there were fresh signs Monday that even if Starr
ultimately succeeds in defeating the attorney-client claims, he
would be unlikely to gain any incriminating evidence against the
president from Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote in the White House brief filed Monday with the
Supreme Court, administration lawyers said that Lindsey, a close
friend of the president's for three decades, had already told the
grand jury that he ``had no information that anyone had committed
perjury or obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey and many other senior and junior Clinton aides have been
called before the grand jury that is examining whether the
president or anyone else illegally sought to coverup Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had argued in March that a broad array of
questions asked of Lindsey and another presidential aide, Sidney
Blumenthal, could not be answered because they intruded on the
fundamental right of the president to get confidential advice from
his aides, a principle enshrined in the law by the courts as
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot overstate the intolerable threat that an unduly
constrictive reading of the privilege poses to the president's
ability to get frank and candid advice from his advisors,'' the
president's lawyers said in court papers at the time. ``President
Eisenhower underscored the crucial role the privilege plays in
promoting effective governance, going so far as to remark that, if
confidential presidential communications were `subject to
investigation by anybody,' it could `wreck the government.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House on Monday quickly dispensed with a
discussion of executive privilege in its motion to the Supreme
Court, saying only that the claim is no longer a controversy
because a federal judge, while ordering the aides to testify, had
confirmed that the president was entitled to such a privilege in
some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The White House already had filed a notice that it intended to
appeal the federal judge's decision, which said Starr's need for
the testimony of Blumenthal and Lindsey outweighed the privileges.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr petitioned the Supreme Court last week for an
expedited review.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blumenthal must now answer the questions he had
initially refused to answer about his conversations with the
president, Hillary Rodham Clinton and others, the White House's
move makes a speedy resolution of the other privilege claims,
already considered a longshot, even less likely.
</P>
<P>
   By removing the executive privilege claims, the White House
eliminated the constitutional questions that provided the most
attractive issues for a Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a vote of five justices to grant Starr's motion
for an expedited appeal, and four justices to decide whether to
hear the case at all.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Acting Monday under a Supreme Court deadline, administration
lawyers told the justices that there was no pressing need to
quickly consider the independent counsel's petition.
</P>
<P>
   The Court has traditionally bypassed the appeals court, the
White House brief said, in ``cases presenting the most profound and
compelling circumstances.'' Generally, those have been ``cases of
overwhelming national emergency, such as in times of war; and cases
where the courts below are in substantial disarray on highly
important federal questions, and there has been development and
disagreement among courts of appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rare instances when the Court had accepted cases for
expedited review include the 1947 seizure of the nation's coal
mines following labor disturbances; the 1952 seizure of steel mills
during the Korean War; and the 1981 resolution of the case of
Iranian assets seized by the United States to meet a diplomatic
deadline in a deal that freed American hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the independent counsel's office would not comment.
In a speech Monday before a North Carolina group, Starr made some
thinly veiled criticisms of the White House's extensive use of
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Inveighing against litigants who ``try to concoct new
privileges,'' he said that the courts have properly concluded that
government lawyers cannot cloak their conversations in
lawyer-client privilege in the face of criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to expand an existing privilege, to apply it in a
new or unusual area, then the place to go is Congress, not the
courts,'' Starr told a gathering of the Mecklenberg County Bar
Association in Charlotte, N.C. ``The courts cannot be in the
business of creating new privileges from whole cloth. And lawyers
ought to tell their clients that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's comments also appeared to be aimed at the recent effort
by the administration to block the testimony of three officials of
the Secret Service under a new kind of privilege the administration
has claimed should prevent them from testifying about Clinton.
Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled last month that no such
privilege exists, but the Justice Department filed its intent to
appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But although the administration on Monday dropped the executive
privilege appeal, the White House signalled in its brief that it
might raise new claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House continues to have reservations that the
procedures the district court followed and intends to follow as
witnesses appear before the grand jury may inadequately protect the
confidentiality of presidential communications,'' the lawyers
wrote. ``The White House will continue, however, to work with the
district court to ensure that adequate safeguards are employed.''

GOVERNING COALITION VICTORIOUS IN MONTENEGRIN ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro
celebrated his governing coalition's sweeping victory in crucial
parliamentary elections on Monday, ensuring his domination of a
government that will defy integration with Serbia. The victory is
considered certain to widen the schism between Djukanovic and the
government in Belgrade led by President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The elections for the 78-seat parliament were seen by many as a
referendum on whether Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up the
present Yugoslavia, should stay in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Momir Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party,
financed and backed by Milosevic, means that Belgrade will now have
to use other means, perhaps a state of emergency, to keep
Montenegro from drifting toward secession, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   With 94 percent of the vote in Sunday's elections counted, the
Montenegrin Election Commission said the coalition led by
Djukanovic had taken 49.5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic's Socialists won 36.07 percent, and the Liberal
Alliance, which openly calls for secession, won 6 percent, with the
balance split between smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   The governing coalition is expected to get about 40 seats in
Parliament, with about 30 for Bulatovic's Socialists. Djukanovic is
also expected to receive support from the Liberals and ethnic
Albanian legislators to give him an unassailable majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,''
Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters outside Government House,
adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not our final victory. Our final victory will be when
democracy wins throughout Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that Milosevic was preparing to orchestrate
the street protests and rioting that took place in Podgorica, the
Montenegrin capital, after the inauguration in January of
Djukanovic as president. Djukanovic narrowly defeated Bulatovic in
the presidential vote held last fall, driving him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic, however, said on Monday that his party was not
satisfied with the ``mechanisms of electoral control.''
</P>
<P>
   The state-run news media in Belgrade have repeatedly warned that
Djukanovic's coalition was planning to commit fraud and darkly
hinted that such vote rigging would be resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said the battle between Djukanovic and
Milosevic, who is currently preoccupied with trying to stamp out a
separatist rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, was far from over. They said tactics like Belgrade's
decision not to pay pensions to those living in Montenegro, a
refusal to include Djukanovic in the federal government and the
sealing of the borders with neighboring Croatia to thwart trade,
would continue and perhaps be stepped up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bulatovic, in a move that Montenegrin lawmakers dismissed as
illegal, was chosen by Milosevic last month to be the federal prime
minister. He is expected to use his office to continue to stymie
efforts by Djukanovic to sever links with Belgrade and attract
badly needed foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian and Montenegrin Parliaments send an equal number of
legislators to the upper house of the federal Parliament, although
Montenegro has only 650,000 people to Serbia's 10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic will now be able to appoint the deputies from
Montenegro, further complicating Milosevic's hold on power.
Milosevic's governing Socialists, however, have a substantial
majority in the lower house. The two federal bodies elected and can
remove Milosevic from his post as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conflict isn't over,'' a European diplomat said. ``It may
have just begun.''

 &HT;    Baptists to consider new denominational statement
 &HT;    (Attn: National, religion editors)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern Baptists, meeting in the land of the Latter-day Saints,
will be asked to adopt a new denominational statement on marriage,
children and the family.
</P>
<P>
   If approved at the annual meeting in Salt Lake City June 11-13,
the statement will be added to the Baptist Faith and Message, a
35-year-old document stating what Southern Baptists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which limits sexual expression to marriage
between a man and a woman and encourages wives to be submissive to
their husbands, was drafted by a seven-member committee that
included the wives of two Baptist seminary presidents. One of them,
Dorothy Patterson, wife of Southeastern Seminary President Paige
Patterson, is likely to be the first lady of the convention since
her husband is expected to be elected its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased at this time, when the family is under such
an assault and attack from every quarter, that Southern Baptists
have decided to go back to their biblical roots, determine what God
says about the family, and include that in their statement to the
word . . .'' she told Associated Baptist Press, an independent news
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband acknowledged in an interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution that the statement makes clear the
convention's stance against homosexuality. ``In fact, in the
definition of marriage given in the first sentence _ one man, one
woman for life _ is probably the most significant thing in the
statement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pattersons, who both have doctorates, have worked out the
biblical relationship in their own home, Paige Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Submission is that which the Bible plainly asks of a wife,''
he said. ``If she elects to marry, then she is electing to be in
submission to her husband. Obviously this does not mean she is to
submit if her husband asks her to violate the law of God. If he
comes home from work, gives her a gun and asks her to shoot the
children, obviously she's not supposed to do that. It's an attitude
word more than anything. It's an understanding that God has
assigned ultimate spiritual responsibility in the home to the man
and given him a wife to assist him in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Patterson ``could have run any corporation in America,''
her husband said. ``She's very gifted and very capable. I'd have to
say that being in submission to her husband does not come naturally
to Dorothy at all. One reason I love her and respect her is that
she holds this conviction. Even though it's not a natural thing to
do for her, she has always in the spirit of the scripture,
submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The other woman on the committee is Mary Moiler, wife of
Southern Baptist Seminary President Albert Moiler, a former editor
of Georgia's Baptist newspaper, The Christian Index. She is a
mother who does not work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the statement is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement forgot Jesus and made June Cleaver a biblical
model for motherhood,'' said Robert Parium, executive director of
the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Parium also told Associated Baptist Press that Jesus spoke
``against the self-centered family'' and for the ``outwardly
focused family.''
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the proposal to the Southern Baptist Convention
next month, the committee will also present a commentary that
``will be a useful tool for those outside our faith who seek to
comprehend Baptist beliefs,'' said committee Chairman Anthony
Jordan, executive director of the Baptist General Convention of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was appointed last year by Southern Baptist
Convention President Tom Elliff.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Three years ago, Daira Hodges was a 14-year-old
ninth-grader and honor student who lived with her family in a
middle-class suburb. ``I thought everything was a utopia,'' she
said recently, ``I mean, to me, the next-best place to be besides
home was school.''
</P>
<P>
   After May 9, 1995, she would never see her world that way again.
</P>
<P>
   Just after lunch that day, a former boyfriend of hers, also 14,
dragged Ms. Hodges into a vacant classroom of their academically
renowned junior high school and choked her until she passed out. He
then stabbed her 21 times, left her for dead and went to take an
algebra test.
</P>
<P>
   But she regained consciousness more than an hour after the
attack. Despite the bleeding and weakness, she managed to make her
way into the hall, where a classmate saw her. She spent a month in
the hospital, including two weeks in an intensive-care unit, before
she was able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hodges did more than survive. On Wednesday, she will
graduate from East High School as the valedictorian of her class.
This fall, she will begin working toward a premed degree at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville. She wants to be a gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   She is a joyful, poised and confident 17-year-old, but she is
not unaffected by her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this happened,'' said Ms. Hodges, ``if I cried, it was
because something happened to a dog. Maybe I was in a fantasy
world. But this opened my eyes. Now I know violence is out there
and it always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt a connection to the victims of the recent school
shootings in nearby Jonesboro, Ark., Pearl, Miss., and West
Paducah, Ky., and to the one last month in Springfield, Ore. ``I
know what their families will go through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodges had to recover from a punctured liver, and she had
her gall bladder removed. She had so many stab wounds on her neck
that she could not speak for a while. And scars remain all over her
body. ``I didn't want to see myself in a mirror for a long time,''
she said, ``I remember thinking, `I'm not cute anymore.''' She
hopes to get plastic surgery someday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodges' mother, Jacquelyne Hodges, 38, a toxicology lab
assistant, said, ``That summer right after it happened, there was
no way my baby was going anywhere alone. I was paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodges and her family credit open lines of family
communication and their deep religious faith with guiding them
through the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, I saw that I couldn't always be there to
protect Daira,'' Mrs. Hodges said. ``I'm still apprehensive, but at
the same time I realize that she can't go through life hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the attack, Ms. Hodges attended a summer academic
program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a private school in Connecticut.
This spring, she was honored by the Children's Defense Fund as part
of their Beat The Odds program.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, worried that her daughter would never trust men, has
been glad to see Daira dating again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Hodges' former boyfriend came from a two-parent home in the
same middle-class section of Memphis as she did. He had been a Boy
Scout, an honor student, a junior minister at his church and a
football player who worked on the school newspaper and sang in the
school choir. She had known him since fourth grade. They broke up
two weeks before the stabbing, and she thought they had remained
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Woods, an assistant district attorney in the Memphis
Juvenile Division, who first prosecuted Ms. Hodges' case said, ``He
was the first to fit the profile of a new breed of juvenile
defendant we are seeing more often now, who are smarter than usual
and have a lot going for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager claimed he was set up by a gang member but in
December 1995, a jury convicted him of attempted second-degree
murder. Because he was a juvenile when he committed the attack, he
can remain in state custody only until he is 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, state law did not allow juveniles to be tried as
adults on attempted-murder charges. That loophole has been closed,
but the old law still applies to him. Now he is 17, and in a
step-down program where he is being allowed to work part-time at a
grocery store in Memphis. He hopes to go to college one day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodges' father, Daryl Hodges, 40, manager of a franchiser of
50 McDonald's in Memphis, said: ``The system was disappointing.
Minors get exceptions and they take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her triumphs, Ms. Hodges is troubled that what happened
to her might have marked the start of a new era of brutal school
violence. ``In my case, it was a young black man who did this, so
people didn't pay as much attention. Then white people started
doing it. Now I think people are seeing that it can happen
anywhere.''

U.S. OFFICIAL SCOLDS JAPAN ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, China)  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Chiding Japan for not addressing its economic
problems more adroitly and voicing strong support for the
International Monetary Fund, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers warned Monday that problems in Russia and China had the
potential to spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to banking executives at the International Monetary
Conference here, Summers said the health and direction of the
Japanese economy were important factors in the recovery of
Southeast Asia and scolded Japan and its banks for not acting more
boldly to help revive the nation's sagging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy has deteriorated in recent months, he said,
particularly in the banking sector, with an estimated $600 billion
to $1 trillion in bad loans on its books. Summers lauded Japan's
attempts to stimulate its economy, but asked the country and the
banks to do more and to do it faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going forward it will be important to ensure that future
fiscal policies are consistent with long-lasting domestic
demand-led growth,'' Summers said. ``But it will also be vital to
address in a more determined manner the financial sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers was at odds with Japanese bankers, who said sufficient
steps had been taken to resolve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much pessimism about the international
competitiveness of Japanese banks,'' said Toru Hashimoto, chairman
of Fuji Bank Ltd. ``Many major banks have taken bold steps to
improve their financial health by writing off, directly or
indirectly, enormous amounts of nonperforming loans at the end of
March this year. Profit levels are now expected to recover
steadily, and I believe they will regain their competitiveness
within the next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that the IMF was an indispensable tool for helping
to resolve international financial instability of the sort that has
recently threatened to swamp countries like Indonesia and Russia.
In particular, he said that Russia is under ``serious strain,''
warning that ``Russia's trouble in turn has the potential to become
central Europe's, and the world's.''
</P>
<P>
   Markets on Russia's periphery have been buffeted as the rouble
and the Russian stock market have fallen in recent weeks. In
Poland, for example, the all-share Warsaw Stock Index fell 4.1
percent Monday, continuing a sharp drop under way for the last
couple weeks, sparked largely by Russia's financial problems. In
Tallinn, the stock market fell 15.78 percent last week, echoing
similar declines elsewhere in the Baltics and eastern and central
Euope.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's internal economic problems, as well as the
plight of its neighbors in Asia, have put pressure on the yuan. But
he said that it is crucial that China continue to act as a
``firebreak gainst the possibility of another cycle of competitive
devaluation in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   In no uncertain terms, Summers said that continued funding of
the IMF was crucial and that the White House would do everything in
its power to make sure the agency's role as a lender of last resort
was not undermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to support the IMF at this point in time is like canceling
one's life insurance policy when one has already gotten sick,''
Summers said. ``It's not a risk we should take. And let me be
clear: It's not a risk this administration plans to take.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Summers also called for greater disclosure by banks about their
exposure to derivatives, newfangled financial products which derive
their value from the performance of underlying assets such as
stocks, bonds or currencies. He said that it was difficult to get
satisfactory information on U.S. banks' derivatives positions last
winter when the Asian economic crisis appeared to be spinning out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Summers advocated continued international support for emerging
markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, but cautioned
that lending must occur in an environment where every country has
established rigorous accounting procedures, greater oversight of
borrowers and easy access to financial information.

AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS TO ACQUIRE MONSANTO FOR $34.4 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceuticals
industry, American Home Products Corp. announced on Monday that it
would acquire Monsanto Co., the herbicides giant, for $34.4 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be the nation's top seller of
prescription drugs and a world leader in insecticides and other
agricultural products. The company's name brands also include such
household names as Advil painkiller, Centrum vitamins and Nutra
Sweet sugar substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The deal surprised Wall Street, which had long expected American
Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., to sell its agricultural
business instead of expand it. Yet, by merging with Monsanto,
American Home Products will be able to double its research spending
to $3 billion annually, add several new drugs to its pipeline and
bolster its position in genomics research, a process which uses
genes to develop drug compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking recently and it made sense to put our
companies together,'' said John Stafford, the chairman of American
Home Products. ``We will have a new company with global presence
that can deliver the new (Monsanto drug) products to the market.
We'll be number three or four in the world when it comes to
pharmaceuticals, up from number six.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted coolly to the deal. Shares of American Home
Products crept up 93.75 cents, to $49.50, while Monsanto fell 87.5
cents, to $54.50. Several factors may explain the muted response.
Officials from American Home Products said the acquisition would
dilute the company's earnings by 15 percent the first year and a
lesser amount after that.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies described the deal as a merger of
equals, American Home Products is in effect purchasing Monsanto.
Under the terms, American Home Products will swap 1.15 of its
shares for each Monsanto share and will control 65 percent of the
new company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Home Products appears to be taking control of
Monsanto,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with
Southeast Research Partners. ``But the new board will be divided up
evenly between the two companies. It will be interesting to see how
well the two companies integrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition may have averted a crisis at both companies.
Analysts noted that the deal, which would create a combined company
with $96 billion in market capitalization and $23 billion in sales,
would help American Home Products cover its legal liabilities over
its diet drugs, Redux and Pondimin, one half of the combination
known as fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products recalled the drugs last September at the
request of the Food and Drug Administration, after studies showed
the pills could cause heart damage. A flood of lawsuits from the 6
million people who used the drugs quickly followed, and analysts
now estimate American Home Product's liabilities could be as high
as $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's problems were not quite so dire. The St. Louis-based
company had recently spun off its chemical division to concentrate
on agricultural products and biotechnology. Yet, it had little
chance of fully marketing its wares without merging with a company
like American Home Products, a firm twice its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the new company will be stronger,''
said Dr. Daniel Vasella, president and chairman of the executive
committee of Novartis AG in Basel, Switzerland. ``Strategy is
nothing unless you can implement it properly but I believe they
will succeed in combining the cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts appear to be more confident that the two companies'
portfolios will meld better than than boardrooms. American Home
Products and Monsanto are two of the world's largest sellers of
agricultural products, including Roundup, the world's most popular
herbicide, and namebrand insecticides like Counter and Fastac.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, however, both companies are well anchored
in pharmaceutical and consumer products. Monsanto sells Nutra
Sweet, a popular sugar substitute, as well as Ambien, a leading
treatment for insomnia, marketed through Searle, its pharmaceutical
division.
</P>
<P>
   As with any pharmaceutical acquisition, this one will produce a
deep pipeline. Monsanto has five drugs that should enter final
stage of trials this year, while American Home Products could
launch several top selling drugs within the next several years,
including Embrel, a joint venture with Immunex for rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the deal, both companies were outpaced by their
competitors on research and development spending. American Home
Products spent $1.5 billion on research and development last year,
while Pfizer spent $2 billion and Merck $1.683 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the acquisition is completed, American Home Products and
Monsanto will spend $3 billion annually on research _ $2 billion on
pharmaceuticals and $1 billion on agriculture. The company also
expects to save $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion annually in cost
savings within three years of the deal's closing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the deal also raises some hard questions. The two companies
have different cultures that may clash. For example, the combined
company has yet to be named and the two chief executives, Stafford
at American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro at Monsanto, will run
the company as joint chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be a further ingredient to a corporate turf
battle, the company's top four jobs are divided equally between the
two companies. Robert Blount, a senior executive vice president at
American Home Products, will be the new company's chief financial
officer. Robert Essner, American Home Products executive vice
president, will head the pharmaceuticals business. Monsanto Vice
Chairman Richard U. De Schutter will run the consumer health care
and nutrition division and Hendrik Verfaillie, Monsanto president,
will run the agricultural and animal health businesses.

INVESTORS DESERT TECHNOLOGY STOCKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors seeking to avoid the turmoil in Asian and
Russian financial markets bought blue-chip stocks and Treasury
bonds Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But technology issues _ led by Intel _ fell, pushing the Nasdaq
composite index down almost 2 percent to its lowest level in almost
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The buying supported prices of electric utilities, beverage,
food and household products companies, as well as retailers. Shares
of Consolidated Edison, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Procter &AMP; Gamble,
Sears, Roebuck and Wal-Mart Stores rose as investors placed bets
that the profits of those companies would be shielded from Asia's
economic and political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other companies that stand to benefit from Asia also
increased. Travelers Group's stock closed higher on news the
financial services company will buy a 25 percent stake in the Nikko
Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage firm. Travelers
closed at 63, up 1}.
</P>
<P>
   And Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing gained 1{, to 94[, as
some analysts focused on recent comments by management that
earnings would continue to grow in 1998 despite weakness in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, prices fell 3.6 percent in Hong Kong and 2.2 percent
in Tokyo. Shares also fell in London, while several other European
markets were closed for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, stocks, bonds and its currency, the ruble, fell,
continuing last week's downward trend. Those markets declined on
news that the International Monetary Fund will not make new loans
to Russia. The loans would enable Russia to repay its maturing
government debt and shore up the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The unsettledness in global markets was a boon for the dollar.
The American currency rose to almost 140 yen, its highest level
against the Japanese currency in seven years. Further bolstering
the dollar was weakening demand for gold, especially from India,
which pushed the price of gold to its lowest level in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets are acting like a major magnet to attract foreign
investors,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Group, who attributed some of the early gains among the
well-known, large-capitalization issues to foreign buying.
</P>
<P>
   A strong dollar increases the return on dollar-denominated
investments, such as stocks and bonds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early in the day, stocks also gained strength from a modest
decline in a key indicator of manufacturing strength. The National
Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index fell to 51.4
in May from 52.9 in April, its second consecutive decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.42 points, to 8,922.37.
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was little changed, up 0.16
point, to 1,090.98.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Dow and the S&AMP;P traded higher throughout the
morning, their gains began to evaporate during the afternoon as
investors started to lose heart because of the continued weakness
among technology issues, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, a key barometer of technology shares, closed at
1,746.82, down 32.05 points.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign market activity will continue to be a focus of domestic
investors until second-quarter earnings reports come out in July,
said Robert Basel, head of listed trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, agreed, saying, ``I think for most Americans, what they
see happening abroad, makes them want to stay red, white and
blue.'' As a result, retailers, utilities, consumer staples and
health care stocks will continue to do well in the near term as
long as the dollar remains strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While major stock indexes have slipped from record highs in
recent weeks, the blue-chip buying has some analysts worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a value player and I don't see much value here,''
cautioned Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co.
``We're still close to being overvalued.''

HOUSTON POET WINS MACARTHUR GENIUS GRANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAUDIA FELDMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In April, when transplanted Houston poet Edward Hirsch
won a prestigious award from the American Academy of Arts and
Letters, an aunt in Chicago wondered aloud, ``When are you going to
win a prize the family has heard of?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer came when the MacArthur Foundation, famous for
awarding genius grants to individuals of all ages and backgrounds
who do outstanding and creative work, released the names of 29 new
honorees. The MacArthur Foundation has spent $166 million on its
genius grants since the program's inception in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, also a professor in the creative writing program at the
University of Houston, was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in my family is wildly excited,'' Hirsch laughed
Monday. ``They've heard of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch got the news late last week but had to keep it secret
until the awards were announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned, I'm still stunned, I don't know what to
think,'' Hirsch said. As he stood in his Houston study, he held a
portable telephone that wouldn't stop ringing.
</P>
<P>
   With every ring, his black poodle, Rocky, barked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone, the dog ... '' Hirsch muttered.
</P>
<P>
   He will receive a total of $295,000, divided into gradually
increasing payments during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The money will allow him more time to write, he said, but he
won't relinquish his teaching job, which he also loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blessing of this grant is I'll have more opportunities to
do my work. It's a liberating thing. I can do fewer extraneous
things to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   At present Hirsch teaches one semester a year at UH, writes a
column for the American Poetry Review, serves as poetry editor for
the literary magazine, DoubleTake, and tries to concentrate on his
own poetry. At 48, he has five books of poems. His latest is ``On
Love'' (Knopf, $22).
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, he says, he has a poem he's working on in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages, he goes to a fast-food restaurant such as
Burger King or McDonald's to work, because his study is too quiet.
Or it's too noisy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he says, he likes to be surrounded by people, regular
working people going about their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then he comes back to his study and his electric typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   The computer age apparently has passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get too carried away by his unusual writing habits, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper stories tend to focus on the eccentricities of my
process and not on the results themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got the award because of my fierce commitment and
devotion to poetry and to keeping it alive in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because of the tremendous success of mass media. But
I think people have a large spiritual hunger. They don't know where
to go to satisfy that hunger. Poetry offers spiritual sustenance.''
</P>
<P>
   When poet Philip Levine got word of Hirsch's prize Monday, he
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were giving the award, he'd be my first choice,'' said
Levine, now living in Fresno, Calif. ``He's enormously deserving, a
brilliant man, and very serious in terms of his commitment to
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, himself an American treasure, says Hirsch writes slowly.
``The more time he can get to write, the more poetry we can get
from him. In terms of his gift, there's no limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine also has watched Hirsch teach. ``He's so skillful and
honest and tactful and gentle, yet there's no B.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Conarroe, director of the Guggenheim Foundation in New
York, echoed Levine's congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exemplary artist _ I can't think of anyone more
deserving,'' Conarroe said. ``He writes poetry that is accessible
without being simple. His work can be appreciated by a wide
audience and not just a charmed circle of 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, he has a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch started writing poetry in high school, but it wasn't
until he attended Grinnell College in Iowa that he realized that it
would be his life.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Grinnell in 1972 and earned his Ph.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1978. From there he moved to New York
to teach, then moved to Detroit to teach, and came to Houston,
again to teach, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he married Janet Landay, whose excitement about
the MacArthur prize is only surpassed by the happiness of their
son, Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch can't forget the day Gabriel turned to him and said,
``We're poets, aren't we, Dad?''

SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT URGES CLOSER TIES WITH NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In an effort to ease half a century of
enmities on the Korean Peninsula, President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea called on Monday for the United States and other Western
countries to end sanctions against North Korea and to show greater
flexibility in dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said that when he makes a state visit to Washington next
week, which will include an address to a joint session of Congress,
he will urge the United States to give up its economic sanctions
against North Korea. He will suggest, instead, a policy of
increasing political ``engagement'' and growing economic ties as
the best way to moderate the behavior of North Korea, the world's
last Stalinist state.
</P>
<P>
   While Western policies are not expected to change overnight, the
pressures for a policy of greater engagement with the North have
already been building, and Kim's arguments are sure to carry
enormous weight in Washington and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview Monday in Blue House, the presidential
mansion, Kim emphasized that he had no illusions about the North,
which even in recent years has sent armed infiltrators into South
Korea and continues to aim a vast array of artillery at Seoul. But
he also suggested that it is time to try a new approach to reduce
the tensions and the risk of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be desirable for the United States to ease its
economic sanctions on North Korea,'' Kim said. ``I think this would
be more effective in efforts to get North Korea to open up and
liberalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who took office in February, has made conciliatory
statements about North Korea in the past, including suggestions for
economic and cultural contacts between the two Koreas and proposals
for an inter-Korean summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's comments were his strongest call for change in the
West's approach to North Korea. Indeed, as recently as Friday, he
had given a Korean newspaper the standard response about U.S.
sanctions _ that whether they should be lifted must depend on
``progress in inter-Korean relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point Monday, Kim made clear that he preferred
that the United States lift sanctions, not just amend them, and
that it do so without setting conditions. Moreover, he urged that
this be done as part of a broad transformation of Western policy
toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see improvement in relations between Japan and
North Korea and in fact between the rest of the Western world and
North Korea,'' Kim said. ``I believe these improved relations will
lead to changes in North Korea and to North Korea opening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's nine-day visit to the United States beginning on Saturday
will not focus only on relations with North Korea but also on a
broad array of economic, cultural and political issues, such as
efforts to reassure U.S. investors about South Korea's business
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will also be a nostalgic homecoming for a one-time
dissident who was twice exiled in the United States, who learned
English from an American Peace Corps volunteer and who credits U.S.
pressure with saving his life when Korean dictators sought to kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few problems of international relations have been so
intractable over the last half-century as the continuing cold war
on the Korean Peninsula _ President Clinton has called the jagged
``demilitarized zone'' between the two Koreas ``the scariest place
on earth'' _ and Kim said that one key purpose of his visit to the
United States is ``to win a more flexible stance in our two
countries' dealings with North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Kim made the same argument about North Korea on
Monday that the Clinton administration has made about China _ that
the best way to tame it is not to isolate it and punish it with
sanctions but rather to build economic and diplomatic ties that
draw it out onto the international playing field.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the United States has made some half-hearted
efforts toward engagement, and it has lifted some sanctions. But
each time one crucial brake on the process has been vociferous
warnings from Seoul that Washington must not get too friendly with
its enemy in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim from the start has staked out a policy very different from
that of his predecessors. The previous president, Kim Young Sam,
nursed a resentment of the North that dated at least from the
murder of his mother by suspected North Korean infiltrators in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung was himself arrested and targeted for execution by
North Korean officials, in the 1950s. But in contrast to past
presidents he has emphasized that South Korea's fundamental
approach should not be to squeeze North Korea into submission but
rather to build trust and economic links.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, economic cooperation was greatly restricted,''
Kim said. ``We wish to lift all the restrictions so that
cooperation can take place in a free atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see a great activation of economic cooperation,''
he added. ``This benefits not only the North Korean economy but our
economy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has not responded
to Kim's conciliatory remarks in recent months, or to his
suggestions for an inter-Korean summit. Kim Dae Jung admitted
Monday that he was a bit ``disappointed'' by the lack of response
from North Korea. Asked whether he still thought a summit meeting
might be held this year, he grinned and said, ``Only a
fortuneteller can answer that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, he quickly added, ``It is at least possible to be more
hopeful than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's call for an end to sanctions appeared to be a deliberate
effort to advance the discussion about North Korea policy in the
West, for he repeated it and elaborated on it several times. But he
also made clear that he did not expect any immediate results.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we stick to this tolerance on our part, with such a
flexible approach, then perhaps not in the near term but in the
long run we'll be able to see changes in North Korea's attitude,''
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any progress in relations between the West and North
Korea is likely to be gradual. Many U.S. officials perceive North
Korea as a dinosaur _ and a malevolent one at that. And companies
are not exactly jostling one another for the right to invest in one
of the world's last communist countries, particularly one that
refuses entry to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. government has been torn in recent years about
what to do with North Korea. Particularly since 1994, when the
United States and North Korea agreed to improve ties as part of a
pact to end the North's suspected nuclear weapons program, some
U.S. officials _ most notably James Laney, a former U.S. ambassador
to South Korea _ have argued for a policy of greater engagement
with the North.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping some sanctions, the United States has contributed
emergency food aid to the North and has expressed its readiness to
exchange liaison offices whenever the North wants.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's ideas carry special force because he is not only his
country's president but an emerging leader for Asia as a whole, a
longtime campaigner for democracy who for decades has written
widely about international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Korean officials and Western diplomats said that they did not
expect Kim's visit to the United States to result in any landmark
new agreements, but rather to affirm an already strong relationship
and to give Kim a chance to try to rebuild international confidence
in the tattered Korean economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for him and for us to publicly show
support for his efforts to bring Korea out of this morass, to
solidify the security relationship and to commend Kim Dae Jung for
embracing democracy and making the tough choices to repair the
economy,'' said Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. ambassador to Seoul.

SILVER GOES SOUTH ON WARREN BUFFETT
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the most heralded investment bets of the last
year _ Warren Buffett's purchase of almost 130 million ounces of
silver _ now appears to be a money loser.
</P>
<P>
   The price of silver in the last week has dropped close to $5 an
ounce, bringing it significantly below the average price of
Buffett's silver purchases. By one calculation, he now has a paper
loss of at least $14.1 million, a 2.1 percent decline in the value
of his entire silver investment. In the 1997 annual report for
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., his investment vehicle, he said he had a
profit of $97.4 million on his silver investment as of the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   For Buffett, these losses are no more significant in his
portfolio than his bridge losses. But they have been far more
painful for the investors who like to follow Buffett wherever he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his silver investment after the close of the
markets on Feb. 3, the price of silver on the Comex division of the
New York Mercantile Exchange had already soared to $6.615 an ounce,
53 percent higher than it was on July 25, when Buffett began
accumulating the metal. The price quickly shot as high as $7.40 an
ounce in intraday trading on Feb. 5. Then the hangover began to set
in.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 17, the closing price of silver had fallen below $7 an
ounce; it then bounced around between $6.50 an ounce and $6 an
ounce until the beginning of May. Since then the price has gone
only south, closing Monday at $5.055 an ounce, down 3 cents. On
Friday and Monday, the price fell below $5 an ounce in intraday
trading.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who bought a 5,000-ounce silver contract at the
lowest intraday price on Feb. 4, the day after the Buffett
announcement, paid $33,550. At Monday's closing price, that
contract was worth $25,275, a drop of 24.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have gone along with him are feeling reasonably
bruised by the experience,'' said Dinsa Mehta, the managing
director for global commodities at Chase Manhattan Bank. ``They
don't have his staying power, and they don't have his portfolio
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Buffett has actually lost any money. The
calculations of the current value of his investment do not assume
he has sold any silver or lent any of it out to traders or others
who needed silver.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors that he sold silver, but he has refused
to comment on that. He did say at his company's annual meeting in
the beginning of May that he had lent silver, which would bring in
a little income. He said that it was only a `small'' amount but
gave no figures.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These calculations also do not include Buffett's cost of storage
for the silver he bought.
</P>
<P>
   The current value of the Buffett holdings are based on the
Berkshire Hathaway annual report for 1997. At the time he announced
the silver purchase, Buffett said its total value amounted to less
than 2 percent of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   He bought control of 111.2 million ounces of silver in 1997. The
value at the end of the year was $665.87 million based on the Dec.
31 closing price. Subtracting a profit of $97.4 million, leaves
$568.47 million as the cost of his investment, or an average of
$5.112 an ounce. At Monday's closing price of $5.055 an ounce, the
loss is $6.35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 18.5 million ounces of silver he bought by Jan.
12, 1998, is not known. But Buffett has said his last purchase was
on Jan. 12, when the price was $5.475, the lowest price of the
year. Assuming he bought all 18.5 million ounces at this price, his
loss on this silver is now $7.77 million. If he bought some of the
18.5 million ounces earlier in 1998, his loss would be larger. At
the average price from Jan. 2 to Jan. 12, his loss is $14.43
million.
</P>
<P>
   This means his paper loss ranges from $14.1 million to $28.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   More heartening for investors who are facing losses at the
moment, Buffett seemed to reaffirm his confidence in the outlook
for silver at the annual meeting, as he repeated his reason for
buying it: ``We thought that the figures on production and demand
were such that it would require a higher price to establish
equilibrium.'' But Buffett is not the type to tip off what he is
doing in advance.

ECONOMIC BOOM ROBS CALIFORNIA ELECTION OF BIG ISSUE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most striking thing about the primary election
campaigns here, from the candidates' debate to the deluge of
30-second television commercials and the speeches on the stump, was
that the topic that dominated California politics for years rarely
surfaced: the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While Californians are savoring economic good times, the
adjustment has been troublesome for many politicians who are
struggling for something to talk about in the absence of
ready-made, bread-and-butter issues that touch the lives of voters.
The challenge for candidates, here and around the country, is to
adjust to an electorate that has been remarkably transformed _ and
become unusually sedate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome in this state's primary on Tuesday, the
campaign here offers the first big snapshot of how candidates
everywhere are trying to navigate the politics of prosperity. With
pocketbook appeals largely off the table, the issue of education _
which was entirely neglected four years ago _ came to the fore, not
only in a ballot initiative that would essentially eliminate
bilingual education, but also in a broader debate over how to
improve California's public schools. Other close-to-home issues are
also bubbling, like growth management and cutting the state's
vehicle licensing tax. And the void is also being filled by
personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world of difference in terms of voter attitudes this
year,'' said Mark Baldassare, senior fellow at the Public Policy
Institute of California. In the San Francisco area, for instance,
Baldassare said his polling shows that voters are ``most
satisfied'' with their jobs and ``most negative about traffic.''
But aggravating as it can be, traffic is hardly weighty enough to
drive the elections in the most populous state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With California's economy soaring _ and a state surplus
projected at $4.4 billion _ the one time politicians sounded
exercised about the subject was when they groused that unemployment
was so low that there was a shortage of workers to collect
signatures to put initiatives on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting with an electorate here that isn't that
interested in politics,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican political
analyst in San Francisco. ``But when things are going so well, it's
even harder to get them to engage. We have a candidate for attorney
general who, out of desperation, declared that one of her top
priorities if elected is dealing with road rage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that candidates did not try to campaign on the
economy. But somehow, sparring over how best to spend a surplus, or
how to grapple with worker shortages, did not make for as
compelling a debate as campaigns past that featured bleak
commercials of closed factory gates and long unemployment lines.
</P>
<P>
   This is mostly good news for incumbents because challengers have
had a particular problem in coming up with persuasive arguments to
elect fresh leadership at a time when things are going so well. But
even for incumbents, the lack of economic turbulence has led them
searching for other, equally powerful messages to connect with
voters. And many have found themselves dwelling more on the
prosperous present rather than making a vigorous case for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 30 years, we passed a balanced budget
with a heart,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat seeking
re-election, at a luncheon in San Francisco. ``We invested in the
new economy _ in high-tech and biotech. We've created 1 million,
three-hundred thousand, new good-paying jobs in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Building up to her case for re-election, Boxer declared:
``America is back. California is back. And guess what? I want to go
back to the Senate to make sure that America and California are the
shining stars of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last major elections here, voters despaired about their
lives and their jobs. Four years ago, it seemed, every other word
out of the contenders' mouths was the economy and jobs (more
accurately, joblessness). Everywhere she went, Kathleen Brown, the
unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor in 1994, who
challenged the incumbent, Gov. Pete Wilson, vowed, ``One million
new jobs for California.''The Democrats relentlessly mocked ``Pete
Wilson's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 1.4 million jobs have been created in California.
Now, according to polling by the Public Policy Institute of
California, 6 out of 10 voters in this state think the economy is
in excellent or good shape, and many say their own finances have
improved, and expect them to improve even more next year. The
economic turnabout helps explain why Wilson's two-term tenure has
barely been mentioned by Democrats during this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians, including Wilson, say voters now have the
luxury of thinking about the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of prosperity, people can be concerned with other
issues _ as now they are about education _ and rightly so,'' said
Wilson, a Republican who in his re-election campaign four years ago
devoted much of his time to staving off attacks about his
stewardship of the economy. ``When the economy is not good people
have that deep concern about their own economic well-being and the
incumbents can almost do no right.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the converse is true,'' Wilson continued. ``When it is
performing well and producing not just jobs but prosperity, their
confidence returns as consumers and they are inclined to be highly
tolerant of the incumbents. You saw that with Bush's defeat in '92
and with Clinton's re-election in '96. So one guy paid the penalty
for a bad economy as an incumbent and the other guy enjoyed the
benefits of a good one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because there is no longer a premium on candidates with economic
know-how, the unflagging economy has posed a particular problem for
two wealthy candidates here who have presented themselves as
outsiders from the business world: Alfred Checchi, the former
co-chairman of Northwest Airlines who is seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, and Darrell Issa, a car alarm
entrepreneur who is seeking the Republican nomination to take on
senator Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But by a margin of 59 percent to 24 percent, Baldassare
explained, prospective voters are more inclined to favor candidates
with experience in elective office. It is a far cry from the
presidential campaigns of Ross Perot, whose allure, besides
bankrolling his own campaign, was his ability to appeal to voters
as a no-nonsense business executive. It is also a far cry from the
general, anti-incumbent mood that roiled the politics of 1992 and
1994, and produced an aversion to the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything but the weather seems to be going well,'' said
Steven A. Merksamer, a lawyer in Sacramento who is active in
Republican politics. ``That's not to say we can't do better. But
people are afraid of serious change by untested people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned about the growing power of leftist rebels
in Colombia, the Clinton administration is expanding its support
for government forces fighting in the hemisphere's longest-running
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the aid is aimed at stanching the flow of
illegal drugs from Colombia, and will target the insurgents only
where they protect the production of heroin and cocaine. The
officials say they have no intention of getting mired in Colombia's
internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But government documents and interviews with dozens of officials
here indicate that the separation Washington has tried to make
between those two campaigns _ one against drug trafficking, the
other against the guerrillas _ is increasingly breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say more U.S. training and equipment are going to
shore up basic deficiencies in the tactics, mobility and firepower
of the Colombian military, rather than for operations directed at
the drug trade. Faced with a string of rebel victories, including a
devastating ambush of Colombian troops in March, U.S. generals have
embarked on an ambitious effort to help reorganize the Colombian
army.
</P>
<P>
   According to senior U.S. officials, the Clinton administration
has also been considering options that officials said include
additional military training, provision of more sophisticated
helicopters and materiel, and creation of a high-tech intelligence
center that would be run by U.S. officials on Colombian soil.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of U.S. involvement in Colombia are still largely set
by the constraints on military, intelligence and foreign-aid
spending in the aftermath of the Cold War. Compared with the
billions of dollars poured into Central America during the 1980s,
the hundred million or so that the United States now spends
annually on Colombia remains relatively modest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet administration officials have begun to describe Colombia as
another grave strategic risk. If the rebels and the drug
traffickers bond more closely, the officials warn, both could
become greater threats to the region. Colombia's troubles could
spill across its borders toward the Venezuelan oil fields, the
United States' chief source of imported petroleum, or into Panama,
home to the vital Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's stability, they contend, is a responsibility from
which the United States cannot run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-night stand,'' said the commander of U.S.
military forces in Latin America and the Caribbean, Gen. Charles
Wilhelm. ``This is a marriage for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such admonitions come at an especially delicate political moment
in Colombia, where a new president will be chosen in a run-off
election on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington's concerns about the country have risen over
the last year, Colombian leaders were cutting their military
spending and suggesting a new willingness to negotiate with the
insurgents. Business groups are pressing for peace talks with the
rebels, and last month thousands of Colombians rallied against the
violence. Both the candidates who emerged from the first round of
presidential elections on Sunday have said they would make new
efforts to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The evolving U.S. policy is also the subject of a growing
debate, one almost as sharp in the administration as outside it.
</P>
<P>
   At one end are officials who cannot consider the Colombia plans
without seeing Central American ghosts. They point to cases in
which more than a dozen Colombian army units given anti-drug
training by the United States were later linked to serious
human-rights violations in the fight against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end are officials who believe that even the most
ambitious policy proposals are inadequate, and that whatever the
final administration plan, political sensitivities will ensure that
it falls well short of Colombia's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid to use the `I' word,'' said an official who is
influential in the Colombia policy's design. ``We should be able to
say with a straight face, and without feeling like we have to go to
confession, that there is an insurgency problem in Colombia that
threatens the stability of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   More quietly, other voices in the government are challenging
important arguments at the source of Washington's alarm.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, administration officials have argued that a boom
in the cultivation of coca in southern Colombia has brought the
guerrillas a dangerous windfall. They say the rebels, by in effect
renting their forces to protect those who grow coca and refine
cocaine, have been able to pay for new recruits, better weapons and
more aggressive strikes against the government.
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence officials have said that there is scant
evidence of a major change in the insurgents' relationship with the
traffickers, and that the impact of Colombia's coca boom on the
availability of drugs in the United States is probably not great.

   Glenn practices for emergencies in NASA training program
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Montgomery
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronaut-trainee John Glenn joined the rest of his
space crew Monday in a half-day training session on emergency
evacuations from the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, Ohio's senior senator and NASA's senior space man,
practiced repelling down the sides of a shuttle mockup in a drill
designed to hone crew coordination in the event of an emergency
after a successful landing. The crew members had done these same
exercises individually, but Monday was the first time they worked
together. ``It's a little different every time you do it,'' Glenn,
76, said during the three evacuation drills.
</P>
<P>
   For the training, each astronaut wore a bright orange flight
suit similar to the ones they'll wear during the 9-day mission
scheduled to begin October 29. The suit weighs about 100 pounds and
includes an array of survival essentials from a built-in life raft
with dye pack to 2 liters of drinking water, a flare kit, radio and
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice,'' trainer Sharon Jones told the crew when they'd
finished the drill that involved exiting through an escape hatch at
the top of the craft. The hatch is directly above the flight and
mid decks, where crew members sit during takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   But Flight Commander Curt Brown, who has flown four space
shuttle missions and has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space, gently
admonished his crew to step lively next time. ``Today was training,
and everybody did great,'' Brown said, but added, ``We could speed
it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn did his chores, his wife, Annie, roamed about with a
camera happily taking snapshots of the crew. Ever enthusiastic,
Glenn pulled at the fingers of his pressure-suit glove before he
put it on to fashion a thumb's-up sign to Annie, who grinned and
took the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn returned to Washington Monday afternoon, having spent all
of last week here in astronaut training. He said he's planning to
fly to Arizona later this week to attend a funeral for former Sen.
Barry Goldwater, who died last week at 89. ``We want to go,'' Glenn
said, speaking also for his wife. ``(Goldwater) and I worked pretty
closely for a while on the Armed Services Committee.''

 WASHINGTON: not great.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Background
</P>
<P>
   From 1990, Aid Rose to Highest in Region
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War and the waning of civil conflicts
elsewhere, Colombia has emerged as the largest recipient of U.S.
military assistance in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The aid began to rise in 1990, with the Bush administration's
``Andean strategy,'' a five-year, $2.2 billion plan to try to stop
the cocaine plague at its source.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials believed that with global security threats
shifting after the Soviet Union's demise, soldiers and intelligence
agents could find a worthy new adversary in the bosses of
Colombia's cocaine trade. And as such efforts gathered momentum in
the early 1990s, they focused largely on the bosses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding U.S. role also coincided with a turn in the
region's oldest guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1990, several guerrilla groups agreed finally to lay
down their arms. Some 7,000 more, mostly of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (known by its initials in Spanish as the FARC)
and the National Liberation Army, rejected the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Gaviria, then Colombia's president, attacked the holdouts
as ``deranged fanatics who have not read in the newspapers the
sorry story of the end of communist totalitarianism.'' Confident
that history was on his side, he doubled military spending and
increased the size and authority of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas and their supporters also came under new assault
by right-wing paramilitary forces that often worked with government
troops. In many cases, drug traffickers have also armed the
paramilitaries against the insurgents; victims of the squads have
included thousands of peasants and unionists, and hundreds of the
rebels who gave up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the remaining insurgents had dug in militarily
and begun shoring up their finances. They stepped up ransom
kidnappings, extortion and the protection of coca fields, jungle
laboratories and clandestine airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration of some guerrilla fronts with the drug trade
became the central plank of government propaganda campaigns against
them. It also began to emerge as a justification for the difficulty
that officials had in keeping U.S. aid from going to Colombian
units that fought mainly against the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're guarding drugs, they're moving drugs, they're growing
drugs,'' the White House drug-policy director, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, said in 1996, adding that he was ``uneasy'' with U.S.
efforts to restrict Colombia's use of advanced UH-60 Blackhawk
helicopters that it was then buying from the United States.
``They're a narco-guerrilla force, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1994, Congress required the Clinton administration
to verify that U.S. military aid would go only to troops that
``primarily'' carried out anti-drug operations. In March 1996, the
administration reacted to evidence that President Ernesto Samper
had taken money from Cali traffickers, by cutting off almost all
U.S. aid to Colombia except what was designated to fight drugs, a
step known as decertification.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to many officials, the Pentagon quietly
distinguished itself by finding creative ways around the
restrictions. ``We refused to disengage,'' said a Defense official
who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, U.S. anti-drug aid granted to the Colombian military
and police rose from $28.8 million in 1995 to at least $95.9
million in 1997, according to State Department figures. Military
sales to Colombia jumped from $21.9 million to $75 million over the
same period, largely on the Colombian army's purchase of the six
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the early stages of the civil war in El Salvador, when
whole battalions were flown to U.S. bases for training, the
Pentagon's efforts to overhaul Colombian forces have been conducted
mainly in Colombia by small teams of special-forces trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials describe the curriculum as heavy doses
of anti-drug tactics with some counterterrorism, hostage rescue and
medical training thrown in. But military officials familiar with
the programs said they concentrate less on weak links in the
cocaine trade than on shortcomings of the Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   One instance of the vague definition of ``counter drug''
preparation are the courses that U.S. Army trainers, drawn largely
from the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, N.C., often lead
in the Pentagon's Joint Combined Exchange Training, or J-Cet
program.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Colombian units, Defense Department officials said,
the teams teach skills as basic as marksmanship and jungle
maneuvers. At the end of a course, the trainers will typically plan
a ``graduation'' attack on the guerrillas and then wait at their
base while the students carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Another program, Joint Planning Assistance and Training, often
involves the preparation of psychological operations against
guerrillas and drug traffickers. Still other teams analyze military
intelligence information to help the Colombian army to plan its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials do not deny that many of the Colombian units they
train go back into battle against the rebels. The Colombian army
has no forces dedicated entirely to fighting drugs, and the use of
U.S.-trained troops is left up to Colombian commanders.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, both the General Accounting Office and the Defense
Department had found that the light-infantry skills taught in
anti-drug training were easily adapted to fighting the rebels. When
the U.S. Embassy in Bogota reviewed the matter in 1994, officials
said they discovered that anti-drug aid had gone to seven Colombian
brigades and seven battalions that had been implicated in abuses or
linked to right-wing paramilitary groups that had killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions subsequently imposed by Congress sought to cut off
aid to any Colombian units involved in human-rights violations. But
some U.S.-trained forces have continued to be accused of abuses,
and Colombian prosecutors are investigating reports that a massacre
of suspected rebel sympathizers last year around the southern
village of Mapiripan was carried out by a paramilitary squad flown
into the nearby military air field at San Jose de Guaviare, the
staging base for U.S.-supported anti-drug operations in the region.

   Guerrillas
</P>
<P>
   Rebels and Traffickers in a `Coca Republic'
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say there is no sure way to keep the
anti-drug battle from running into the guerrillas, given what has
taken place over the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an aggressive government campaign against coca
cultivation and transportation in neighboring Peru, the officials
say, the traffickers have joined some major rebel fronts to create
a virtual coca republic. Peasants who support the insurgents are
planting more coca, FARC units are protecting more drug crops and
labs, and government authority has eroded across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials including Wilhelm, the commander in chief of
the U.S. Southern Command, said drug profits and other income are
financing the guerrillas' purchase of more and perhaps more
sophisticated communications equipment and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said there was now some guerrilla
activity in perhaps 700 of the country's 1,071 municipalities. And
they estimate the insurgents' strength at as many as 18,000
combatants _ 10,000 or 11,000 in the FARC, 7,000 in the National
Liberation Army _ up from as few as 8,000 fighters six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is intensifying,'' Wilhelm said in an interview.
``We are seeing, basically, an undermining of governance at the
grass-roots level. In a sense, I see a nation divided.''
</P>
<P>
   More vivid than the CIA's estimates of rising coca cultivation,
however, have been U.S. intelligence reports on the decrepitude of
the Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a force of 400 to 600 FARC guerrillas crushed an army
unit near the southern village of Billar, killing 67 soldiers and
capturing about 30 more, according to Pentagon figures. Officials
said it was probably the most serious defeat of government forces
since the guerrillas took up arms in the mid-1960s, but only one of
a series of battles they have lost in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   And military analysts said the Colombian army was probably
weaker than it looked. As many as half of its 121,000 soldiers are
deployed to protect cities, oil pipelines and other fixed targets.
A classified Defense Intelligence Agency assessment first reported
by The Washington Post speculated that if current trends continued
unchanged, the armed forces could be defeated within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans cast the situation in even direr
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening possibilities of a narco-state just three
hours by plane from Miami can no longer be dismissed,'' Rep.
Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, said at a recent hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded insistently by Gilman and a small group of other
powerful Republican lawmakers, the administration recently
announced what the acting State Department anti-narcotics chief,
Rand Beers, called ``an ambitious new strategy to attack narcotics
trafficking in Colombia on all fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Beers, who helped draft the Andean strategy 10 years ago, said
the State Department would start by adding at least $21 million to
its anti-drug aid program to Colombia this year. In part, the money
is to finance an expanded campaign to eradicate drug crops and
destroy laboratories in the southern Colombian departments of
Putumayo and Caqueta.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rebels have such a strong presence in the region,
officials say, those efforts will require greater army help. But
while U.S. officials have often announced such collaboration in the
past, it has consistently foundered on the rivalry that has long
existed between the two services.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have already begun to work with the Colombian air
force to intercept drug flights, and will provide night-vision
equipment for its planes. Colombian military officials have also
said they would like to buy armored attack MH-1 Cobra helicopters,
and a Defense Department official predicted that the Pentagon would
support such a request.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm, the Southern Command chief, insisted that the United
States was not sending the sort of advisers that it once stationed
with military units in countries like El Salvador and Vietnam. But
he also made it plain that he himself has become a crucial adviser
to the Colombian high command.
</P>
<P>
   After the Colombian military commander, Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett,
presented his own strategy plan in January, Wilhelm and his aides
began picking it apart, highlighting a number of problems. Wilhelm
has since worked with Colombian commanders on a sweeping overhaul
of the armed forces, and ordered a ``comprehensive'' review of U.S.
training.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a small group of Southern Command analysts have
embarked on a side-by-side comparison of Colombia's experience with
that of Peru, where leftist guerrillas protected coca growers for
years.
</P>
<P>
   With the waiver of Colombia's decertification penalties this
spring, administration officials said their basic question was not
whether they would increase aid to Colombian forces, but how and by
how much.

 WASHINGTON: how much.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Policy
</P>
<P>
   Will U.S. Be Drawn Into War on Rebels?
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have played down fears that the United
States is being drawn deeper into Colombia's guerrilla war. The
Pentagon recently said it would tighten safeguards meant to keep
aid from going to forces involved in human-rights abuses, and
promised new scrutiny of the ``joint combined exchange training''
in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed in August, Colombian military units
can receive U.S. support only after their rosters have been
screened to determine that they do not harbor troops known to have
violated human rights with impunity. Officials said only two
battalions of the Colombian army have qualified so far, and both of
those have had to be assembled from other forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another key condition cited by U.S. Embassy officials is that
U.S. aid can only be used in a designated region of Colombia where
the ties between drug producers and the guerrillas are held to be
so close that any rebel unit could be fairly considered the
traffickers' ally.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that the definition of the zone was broad:
``the box,'' as it was described by U.S. diplomats, encompassed
almost the southern half of the country. Yet officials said the
area was not big enough for the Pentagon, which has quietly refused
to acknowledge its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of geography, the use of the resources, I'm
personally not aware of any restrictions,'' Wilhelm said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, administration policies on Colombia have received
nothing like the scrutiny given U.S. policies for Central America
in the 1980s, and aid conditions have often been only loosely
applied.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Colombian military was required to pledge in
writing that it would use the six Blackhawk helicopters it bought
in 1996 largely for anti-drug operations with the national police.
But U.S. officials said they knew of no such operations since the
helicopters arrived in early 1997. The administration has since
been fighting congressional demands that it give three more
Blackhawks directly to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy analysts question the new alarm about Colombia
because they say the drug threat itself is overblown. The quality
of Colombian-grown coca is so low, they argue, that it cannot
offset the declines in cultivation in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts also raise questions about the
rebel-trafficker alliance that has been at the core of
policy-makers' concern.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report by intelligence and law-enforcement
agencies, the rebels' ties to the drug trade are extensive. But a
declassified summary of the report says that while guerrilla fronts
sell protection ``in virtually all departments where traffickers
operate,'' only a few rebel fronts ``probably are involved more
directly in localized, small-scale drug cultivation and
processing.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was a consensus among the U.S. intelligence
agencies that the insurgents' role in the drug trade had not grown
or changed substantially since the report was issued.
</P>
<P>
   A FARC spokesman who uses the alias Leonardo Garcia contended
that the rebels did not protect coca fields to make money so much
as to defend peasants with whom they are allied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is simply to label us as delinquents, to reject us as
people with a political struggle,'' the spokesman said in an
interview in New York. ``It's a way to legitimize a military
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the evolving U.S. policy has
focused less on the close relationship that Colombian traffickers
have with many right-wing paramilitary groups. The problem of such
apparent partisanship, critics of the policy argue, is that it may
get in the way of the settlement that U.S. officials say they would
like to help bring about.
</P>
<P>
   After the kidnappings of several U.S. citizens by the
guerrillas, Washington refused to deal with the insurgents at all.
And while the rebels recently announced their willingness to
negotiate with a new president, they have also threatened to attack
U.S. military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Colombian history has demonstrated that it is easier to
talk peace than to produce it, political pressure for an end to the
war clearly has grown. ``We're talking about land reform, about
dealing with oil policy, about constitutional reforms,'' said the
head of the government's peace commission, Daniel Garcia Pena.
``Today, people understand that these social and political
questions the guerrillas raised have to be put on the table.''

MILOSEVIC MOVES TO WIPE OUT KOSOVO REBELS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
has started a sweeping campaign to wipe out a separatist rebel
movement in the Serbian province in Kosovo, senior NATO officials
and Western diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign involves several thousand heavily armed special
police officers and soldiers backed by artillery batteries. It has
escalated swiftly over the last three days and seems set to
extinguish the faint hope of a negotiated settlement between Serbs
and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population. If the conflict spilled
across the border, as many now fear, it could draw the region into
a war. Neighboring Albania is sympathetic to the separatist
struggle in Kosovo, as is a restive ethnic Albanian minority in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is watching the evolving situation in Kosovo with
increasing concern as the conflict there has intensified,'' said
Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is supreme commander of NATO
forces in Europe, in an interview at NATO headquarters in Belgium
on Friday. He added: ``There are increasing reports of the use of
artillery and heavy weapons by the Serbs. We have heard reports of
these weapons being used along the border and in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government said Monday that about 1,000 ethnic
Albanians, some wounded, had fled into Albania from Kosovo since
Sunday. The Serbian police confirmed Monday that they were engaged
in heavy combat and had ``liquidated several dozen terrorists'' in
the central Drenica region. Phone lines and roads to the areas
under attack are cut, but reports are filtering out of numerous
dead, not only ethnic Albanians but also Serbian civilians, police
officers and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's decision to unleash his troops on the ethnic
Albanian rebels undermines an American diplomatic effort to bring
the two sides together. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, had
secured Milosevic's agreement to begin direct talks with the
Albanian leadership, and had as a result decided that sanctions on
Belgrade should be suspended. The about-face on the sanctions has
angered many European allies, since Washington originally pushed
Europeans to adopt them.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been unable to seal off the mountainous and
desolate border with Albania. Over the last few weeks he has
watched weapons, supplies and mercenaries _ many of them veterans
of the Bosnian conflict and others _ flood into Kosovo to build up
the Kosovo Liberation Army, senior Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel force is fighting for a separate state in a province
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. It already
controls as much as 40 percent of the province and has been engaged
in daily hit-and-run clashes with the police and the military in
the last three months. More than 200 people have been killed since
March, including three Yugoslav soldiers gunned down at the Morina
border post near northern Albania on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police have prevented reporters and outside
observers from reaching the fighting. Those fleeing the area,
however, report constant automatic fire and the crash of artillery
rounds. Many villages are burning, especially those near the
Albanian border, witnesses said in telephone interviews Monday. The
ferocity of the combat appears to be greater than the bloody sweep
in March by Serbian special police units that left 80 ethnic
Albanians, half of them women and children, dead. It was this
attempt to wipe out the rebels that triggered the current open
revolt in the province and swelled the ranks of the guerrilla
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very clear pattern of activity emerging,'' said a
Western official who follows the conflict. He described the Serbs'
thinking this way: ``The Serbs are putting the army on the border
and clearing the zone. You have to have an eight to ten kilometer
wide stretch where no neutral people live, anyone there is an
enemy. You have to get them out of those villages, otherwise they
can help the Albanians smuggle. At the same time the Kosovo
Liberation Army is trying to build, fortify and equip its base
areas for training and using its force.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most of the fighting has been in the words of a
senior NATO official, ``a distraction, a skirmishing line.'' This
official said that the rebels kept up desultory fire on checkpoints
and road blocks to ``intimidate the Serbs and keep them from
focusing directly on the base areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting now, however, is different with elite special
police and military units moving to wipe out rebel enclaves along
the border with Albania and in the central Drenica region,
according to witnesses in Pristina reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that NATO, worried about the impact on neighboring
states, was carrying out ``detailed studies of possible preventive
deployment'' and ``was preparing exercises for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials conceded that it could take up to 20,000
soldiers to police the border with Albania and doubted that it
would be possible to find the support necessary to deploy such a
large contingent. Without such a force many fear that the Serbs
will cross into the lawless region in northeastern Albania in
pursuit of the rebels, perhaps drawing Albania into the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government, which agreed last month to hold talks
with the ethnic Albanians in order to stave off sanctions, said it
would meet for a second time with the Kosovo Albanian leaders on
June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and top advisers met
President Clinton in Washington on Friday and said they were
promised that Kosovo would not become another Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But few observers see dialogue as a way out.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR DURAN, IT'S A GARDEN OF MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 100 fights and 27 years ago, Roberto Duran
arrived in New York, a 20-year-old Panamanian lightweight with a
25-0 record and the sneering snarl of a Caribbean pirate in an old
Errol Flynn movie. All he needed to fit the part was a bandanna
around his head and a knife between his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   And in his Madison Square Garden debut on Sept. 13, 1971, all he
needed to dispose of Benny Huertas was 70 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream for me to fight here,'' he said Monday with a
soft smile that soon turned into that old sneer. ``But when I
walked around the city, nobody knew who I was. I told myself, `The
next time I come here, they're going to know me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next time, he arrived as the challenger for the world
lightweight title, then held by Ken Buchanan of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing Buchanan eating a piece of bread with butter
and drinking a Coke,'' Duran recalled through Juan Rolon, his
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked him why he hadn't looked at films of my fights and
he said, `Duran's too slow for me.' I started laughing inside. I
knew I was too tough for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Too tough and too rough. He doubled up Buchanan with a low blow,
took the title in the 13th round and everybody in boxing knew who
Roberto Duran was. They still do &UR; , &LR;  and they always will.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be 47 years old in two weeks, but Saturday night he will
go up the steps into the Garden ring again, this time with a 102-13
record, with 69 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth Garden bout, he will try to dislodge the World
Boxing Association middleweight title from William Joppy before
Evander Holyfield defends his heavyweight title against Henry
Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk a lot about Joppy, I want to show you,''
he said, sitting near the Garden ring in the exposition hall where
he and other boxers will train this week. ``But you can't imagine
the emotion I feel about being in the Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   On the peak of his cap were the weight classes he has won titles
at: 135, 147, 154 and 160. Some boxing people think that, at 135
pounds, he was the best lightweight ever. As a welterweight and
middleweight, he has never had quite the same punch.
</P>
<P>
   But of his seven Garden fights, he lost only one, a 10-round
nontitle decision in 1972 to Esteban de Jesus, whom he knocked out
twice in rematches.
</P>
<P>
   He also outpointed Adolfo Viruet and knocked out Monroe Brooks
in 1978, outpointed Carlos Palomino in 1979 and stopped Davey Moore
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a lot of people in my country didn't think I would beat
Moore,'' he said, ``but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, some of those same people had scrawled
``Duran, Traitor'' on walls in Panama City after he had turned to
the referee, muttered ``no mas'' and walked away from Sugar Ray
Leonard in the seventh round in the Louisiana Superdome. To him,
Leonard had been clowning and taunting, not fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But in winning the WBA junior-middleweight title from Moore and
the World Boxing Council middleweight title from Iran Barkley in
1989, Duran was an idol again in Panama, where he once punched out
a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's town, Guarare, every year they have a feast,'' he
recalled. ``I went there with $150, a lot of money for me then. My
whole family was drinking whisky &UR; , &LR;  and now I was down to about
$30. Then this guy said, `I'll bet you a bottle of whisky and $50
you can't knock out that horse over there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the horse and I thought, `The horse has no jaw;
where am I going to hit him?' But my uncle, Socrates Garcia, told
me: `Hit him behind the ear. If you hit him there, he will go
down.' I said, `Somebody hold the money,' then I walked over and
hit the horse behind the ear and the horse went down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tore a hole in my hand, nothing broken, but it was
bleeding,'' he said, holding out his right hand and pointing to the
knuckle area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle wanted me to go to the hospital to bandage my right
hand, but I had so many drinks in me, I didn't feel the pain. I
stayed at the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But the horse isn't why Roberto Duran is known as Manos de
Piedras, meaning hands of stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a picture once with two rocks in my hands,'' he said.
``That's how that started.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hands aren't what they used to be, but they will be
throwing punches in the Garden again.

CLINTON DROPS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIM, PUSHES FOR
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deciding against a Watergate-style fight over
executive privilege, President Clinton notified the Supreme Court
on Monday that close friend and trusted adviser Bruce Lindsey's
status as a lawyer should protect their conversations about an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorneys notified the Supreme Court late Monday
that he is dropping his executive privilege claim and that there is
no longer any reason for the court to act quickly in the dispute
over Lindsey's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision not to fight over executive privilege and to
instead push for a Court of Appeals review of the remaining issue
of attorney-client privilege could delay independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigation of whether the president obstructed
justice by urging a cover-up of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,''
White House counsel Charles Ruff told reporters. ``That's what
courts generally do. This is not steel seizure, this is not Iranian
hostages, this is not U.S. vs. Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr welcomed Clinton's decision not to appeal the executive
privilege ruling handed down last month by Chief U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome any movement in the direction of our getting more
information sooner rather than later,'' Starr said after a speech
to a lawyers' group in Charlotte, N.C. ``We're not getting the
information. We're not getting the facts. I'd love to see it move
forward as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had invoked executive privilege in an effort to shield
Lindsey and adviser Sydney Blumenthal from having to reveal their
conversations with the president or first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton to a grand jury being used by Starr to investigate charges
of witness tampering or perjury involving the president's alleged
sexual misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt change in tactics by the White House clears the way
for Starr to immediately bring Blumenthal back to the grand jury to
talk about the sources of derogatory information about Starr and
his deputies, which they assert hampered their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court agrees with the White House not to review
the attorney-client question until the Court of Appeals rules, then
Lindsey's testimony _ if the courts eventually rule that he must
cooperate with Starr _ could be delayed at least until fall.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson last month ruled that although the president had a
right to exercise executive privilege, that claim was outweighed by
the need for information from Lindsey and Blumenthal in Starr's
criminal investigation. The judge also ruled that Starr's need for
information was greater than the White House claim of
attorney-client privilege involving testimony from Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, the White House notified Johnson and the Court of
Appeals that an appeal was being considered, a process that
normally could delay the outcome. Last week, Starr asked the
Supreme Court to take the case and issue a ruling before the
justices' summer recess, which usually starts at the end of June.
Starr's motion focused on Clinton's assertion of executive
privilege and drew parallels to the case 24 years ago that led to
President Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded Monday by dropping the executive
privilege assertion and arguing that ``we are not in the throes of
a national emergency ... (and) the fate of the nation will not hang
in the balance'' if the dispute were first settled by the appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff acknowledged that the gambit could delay the case. ``There
will undoubtedly be folks out there who suggest ... `Oh, this must
be some scheme to delay,''' Ruff said. ``That's just nonsense.'' He
added, ``When we say we are fighting for an important principle ...
I really mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with reporters, Ruff also denied that dropping
the executive privilege claim was done to avoid further comparisons
to Nixon's use of that argument to keep the White House tapes out
of the hands of Watergate prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if we were worried about those echoes, we wouldn't
have even started this,'' Ruff said of Clinton's initial claim of
executive privilege. ``Whatever black cloud of history others are
casting over this, it hasn't affected us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ruff's deputies filed the documents with the Supreme Court,
the Justice Department filed a notice that it would appeal another
ruling by Johnson that would require the Secret Service agents who
guard the president to tell Starr's grand jury what they know about
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Secret Service had sought a new
``protective function'' privilege that would shield Secret Service
officers from having to disclose what they observe while protecting
the president. Secret Service Director Lewis Merletti has said he
wants to appeal the case to the Supreme Court if necessary, warning
that requiring agents to testify could lead to a presidential
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   In her May 22 ruling, Johnson rejected the argument that
presidents would put dangerous distance between themselves and
their Secret Service detail if agents had to testify about a
president's private life.

SOUTH AFRICAN TRIAL HEARS THE QUESTIONS BOTHA WON'T ANSWER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE, South Africa _ Over and over Monday, the prosecution in
the contempt trial of former President P.W. Botha used its first
witness to lay out the questions that remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly did the man who governed South Africa during its
most brutal period of repression mean when he approved, as
documents indicate, the elimination, neutralization and permanent
removal from society of anti-apartheid activists?
</P>
<P>
   If he did not mean murder and torture, was anything done to make
sure that there was no misunderstanding? When, as one witness has
testified, concern was raised that such behavior had become
widespread, was any action taken?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the witnesses who have said that they bombed a
church building or crossed South Africa's borders to murder
political opponents under direct orders from him?
</P>
<P>
   As the trial of Botha continued Monday after a six-week recess,
the prosecution tried to make clear that the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission investigating atrocities of the past had
good reason to want answers from the 82-year-old former president,
who is facing charges of contempt for refusing to appear before the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces a jail sentence of up to two years and a
fine.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes frail-looking Botha, sitting in a specially padded
seat because of hip replacement surgery, has remained defiant,
calling the Truth Commission a circus and a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his inner circle have maintained that the atrocities
committed by the security forces were the work of rogue elements.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the foot soldiers have said that they were following
orders from on high. They describe a world in which they received
medals for machine-gunning huts full of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Truth Commission officials have maintained that they need
Botha's testimony if they are to accomplish their task of
investigating and writing a report on the country's brutal history.
But the decision to take Botha to trial has caused bitterness among
whites, many of whom believe the commission is simply trying to
humiliate members of the former government.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony Monday, Paul van Zyl, the executive
secretary of the commission, laid out documents and testimony that
appeared to link Botha to a number of illegal acts. In one
document, from 1979, van Zyl said, the State Security Council, an
elite circle of security chiefs and Cabinet ministers, discussed
plans for top-secret operations against anti-apartheid activists
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zyl testified that the investigative unit of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission had received information on cross-border
operations where a range of people were killed, using parcel bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were clearly illegal,'' he said. ``What the TRC would
want to know, in fact, is whether the State Security Council did or
did not authorize such operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha's lawyers said in the past that Botha planned a defense
based on the notion that he had had a private agreement with the
head of the commission, Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, that he did not
have to testify. But Monday they made clear that they also intended
to attack the subpoena on the narrowest procedural grounds. Much of
the cross-examination of van Zyl was over issues such as whether a
quorum was present when a decision was made to call Botha.

INDONESIA, IN DRAMA'S GRIP, WARILY AWAITS FINALE
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By SETH MYDANS  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Suddenly, after decades of repression,
Indonesia feels like a country without rules _ and that, for many
people here, is as frightening as it is exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   Political prisoners are being freed. The once tightly controlled
press has slipped its leash. Students are holding sit-ins in
provincial government buildings. People are speaking their minds.
</P>
<P>
   These things were almost unheard of under President Suharto, who
stepped down nearly two weeks ago after running Indonesia for 32
years as if it were his kingdom. Already since his departure, a new
Indonesia is in the making, but its shape is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in flux,'' said Goenawan Mohamad, the editor of
the magazine Tempo, which was shut down by the government in 1994
but now plans to reopen. ``Things can change tomorrow in a
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This could be a short breath of freedom after the
emperor is deposed.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, new political parties are being formed nearly every
day. The aggressive military has returned to its barracks and is
publicly investigating its own wrongdoings. And the attorney
general has announced that he will investigate some of the immense
wealth the former president amassed through businesses and charity
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little rejoicing here. It was not simply personal
ambition that led Suharto to clamp down so hard for so long; it was
a fear, shared by many in this country of 210 million people, of
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to fill the place left by Suharto is only
beginning, and unpredictable forces _ the military, popular and
religious movements, new political parties and opposition leaders _
are testing their strength. Throughout the last week, rumors of
coups and of conflicts within the military have swept through the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, the economy of the world's
fourth-most-populous nation is collapsing at an accelerating rate.
Indonesia has entered a period of epochal change at a time when its
people are becoming poorer, hungrier and more angry.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfaction from the economic crisis was the prime engine
behind Suharto's ouster, leading to riots and weeks of student
protests. Pulling the country out of that economic tailspin has
been left to his successor, B.J. Habibie. But social unrest in the
coming months could again send the country into turmoil. One
response to unrest could be reimposition of strongman rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of repression are still lurking.'' Mohamad said.
``When you live with people with guns, you have to have
institutions to defend you, and we don't have that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Successive generations of potential leaders were quashed by
Suharto's autocracy. Now the many sectors he suppressed have begun
to emerge and marshal their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Labor activists, leftist ideologues, Muslim supremacists,
democratic reformers, human rights campaigners, regional separatist
movements, those still loyal to Sukarno, the president ousted in
1967, and ambitious men and women who were forced in the past to
pledge allegiance to Suharto have all been unleashed to pursue
their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have 1,000 alternatives,'' said Wimar Witoelar, a
political commentator. ``Everyone is confused. Everyone knows that
the status quo is not going to last very long. So everyone is
grabbing for what they can get. It's a classic power vacuum and you
have all kinds of whirlpools swirling around. It's very, very
dangerous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the dangers is a resurgence of ethnic and religious
conflict in this nation of 13,000 islands, hundreds of ethnic
groups and a history of conflict between the overwhelming majority
of Muslims and minority groups of Christians and ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Chinese merchants remain afraid to reopen their
shops after three days of rioting last month that damaged thousands
of buildings and cost at least 500 lives in Jakarta alone. Smaller
outbreaks of rioting and looting have erupted elsewhere in the
country since.
</P>
<P>
   As dark fears and conspiracy theories stalk the capital, some
even whisper that Suharto, who remains in Jakarta with his powerful
family, may be acting as a ``puppeteer'' behind the scenes. ``Be on
alert because that factor could lead to a rift during the
transition period,'' warned Marie Muhammad, who was Suharto's last
finance minister, last week.
</P>
<P>
   If the country's new openness and its struggle for political
power degenerate into turmoil, and if its people slip further into
poverty, many Indonesians might welcome a seizure of power by the
military, the one institution that is seen by most people as
organized and efficient. The military formed the base of Suharto's
rule and remains the most potent power behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the night-long shadow-puppet plays called wayang that form
the heart of Javanese culture, the final battle comes at dawn, and
people are warning that the sun has not yet risen here.
</P>
<P>
   H. Roeslan Abdulgani, one of the wise old men of Indonesian
politics, described this moment of confusion, uncertainty and
infighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Javanese wayang language, the spectators say the
following,'' he wrote this week in a widely published newspaper
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a wayang play without a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puppeteer is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musicians and singers are busy fighting over the offered
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onlookers are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pray the dawn may soon come.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Abdulgani, a former foreign minister who is now
in his 80s, said the second round of the battle for the country's
future was only beginning. He said that the first round was won by
the pro-reform forces _ the students and the pro-democracy
idealists _ but that they had yet to consolidate their victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the moment of retreat for the status-quo forces,'' he
said. ``The commanders of the army of the king are still there, and
today they are shouting, `Pro-reform!' But be careful. When will it
end, the second round?''

BILL STRIKING RELIGIOUS OPPRESSION SEEN AS HURTING U.S.
ENTERPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Religious conservatives won a victory in Congress
last month, and Republicans on Capitol Hill were only too glad to
give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   By a wide margin, the House passed a bill to punish religious
persecution abroad with economic retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But by quieting the rumblings on its right wing, the GOP upset
another important friend _ corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The division over the religious persecution bill reflects
continuing friction in the GOP's base.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders are unhappy that the party's social and
religious agenda has in several cases trumped its traditional
business concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of American companies are kind of scratching their heads
about this `pro-business Republican Congress,' '' said Willard
Workman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who deals
with international business concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Owens, a spokesman for the Christian Coalition, dismissed
business' concerns about the bill as ``much ado about nothing from
an economic and trade perspective.'' He said they reflected ``a
callousness on the part of some in the business community to be
quite willing to place the profit-making above all else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard O'Leary, who is chairman of the board of H
Enterprises, a Minneapolis company involved in machinery and
construction, and who also sits on the chamber's international and
economic policy committees, said, ``We now have the social agenda
of the month driving our policies that affect international trade
and our standing internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom From Religious Persecution Act is just the latest in
a string of actions that business leaders argue damage their
interests. The actions have caused them to wonder who their friends
on Capitol Hill really are.
</P>
<P>
   On several key issues _ all supported by a Democratic White
House _ business has been thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, bolstered by religious conservatives,
blocked the administration's push for permanent Most Favored Nation
trade status for China. They also stymied a request for $3.5
billion for the International Monetary Fund by pairing it with a
debate over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically,'' Workman said, ``I was speaking to a group of
American businessmen from Europe and said our biggest allies in the
House on IMF were Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also couldn't pass fast-track, the measure to
give the president streamlined negotiating authority on trade,
although religious conservatives weren't a factor and the Democrats
offered Clinton little help.
</P>
<P>
   But to business, that's beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every one of those Republican representatives was as
pro-business as they like to maintain when they go home to talk to
the local chamber of commerce, you wouldn't have needed a single
Democratic vote to pass it,'' said Charles S. Mack, president of
the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, which advises
about 1,000 business PACs about which candidates are good
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is troubling is we've seen a disturbing number of
issues, not all of them trade, in which actions have not matched
the rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders like Mack and others hint that Republicans
could pay a price in this year's congressional elections if they
continue to ignore them or take them for granted. Mack noted that
his group gave about $120,000 in campaign contributions in 1996 and
would donate $200,000 or more this year. But those numbers are
pocket change compared with the group's potential clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of that in the '96 campaign was that just a hair
under $10 million went to candidates we endorsed from corporations
and associated PACs with whom we have a relationship,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   In its starkest terms, the religious persecution bill became a
debate between morality and commerce. The measure would impose
economic sanctions on foreign governments that abuse human rights
and practice religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ban non-humanitarian aid, oppose loans from
development banks such as the IMF and deny visas to foreign
officials and others identified as persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing this bill will say to the world that the United States
will no longer remain silent while people of faith are being
tortured,'' Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican and the bill's
sponsor, said during the debate. ``Passing the bill will shatter
the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   It also symbolized one of the legislative fronts where religious
conservatives, an influential political voice, hope the Republican
leadership will act more aggressively. Some religious leaders have
even threatened to sit out the fall congressional campaign unless
they get satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   That got the GOP's attention. The party has only a slim majority
in the House, and polls lately show Democrats gaining strength.
After meeting recently with religious conservatives, the Republican
leadership emerged newly committed to pushing parts of their
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The religious persecution bill enjoyed widespread bipartisan
support and passed 375-41. Democrats have traditionally backed
human rights-related legislation in foreign policy. Backers also
included faith-based conservative groups, such as the Christian
Coalition, as well as mainline church organizations such as the
Catholic Bishop's Conference, B'nai B'rith and the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will try to pass a modified bill that attempts to
mollify some of the opponents, who, besides business, include the
White House and the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders said having to choose between morality and
trade, as supporters portrayed the debate, was a ``false choice.''
What about diplomacy, they said, or some kind of multination
effort?
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also contend that the ``one size fits all'' terms of
the bill, which treats all potential violating nations the same,
could hamstring foreign policy. And they said the impetus for the
bill did not come from overseas, but from domestic groups seeking
to make a political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not getting calls from our people in China and Egypt
and Indonesia saying, `Please, have Congress pass this,' '' said
the Rev. Oliver Thomas, special counsel for religious and civil
liberties for the National Council of Churches. ``A lot of mission
people fear that if suddenly we declare all these people to be
persecutors, it will seriously impair their ability to do overseas
mission work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the midterm congressional elections on the horizon,
political issues are often defined by money and support. It's
likely that the Christian Coalition, for example, will identify the
religious persecution issue as a key vote in the 45 million voter
guides it expects to distribute the Sunday before the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based conservatives who are politically active also reach
voters through religious radio shows that reach as many as 5
million listeners a day.
</P>
<P>
   Business, said former Republican Rep. Robert Walker, now a
lobbyist, needs to recognize the changing political landscape,
particularly within the Republican Party.

   (Kansas City, Mo.: vision of many issues. He is a person of
intellect who outworks most people in his chosen field.'')
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Hayes is tied to the office. He is in
his executive office in downtown Topeka about half the time. He
also gives speeches, attends industry gatherings and serves on a
variety of boards. He is chairman of Rockhurst College's board of
trustees and the board of the Menninger Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Menninger, chief executive of the Menninger Foundation in
Topeka, said Hayes was very efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen where he is,'' Menninger said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, a native of Kansas City, grew up in Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   At Rockhurst College, he majored in English and edited the
school newspaper. Hayes said that he was destined for law school
but that a couple of auto wrecks while he was working as a night
watchman left him financially strapped. He scrapped plans for law
and joined Southwestern Bell in 1959, when it was part of a
national monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes made it to the presidency of the phone company, but was
disappointed when he didn't get the chairman's job at the company's
parent Southwestern Bell Corp., now SBC Communications. The job
went to Texan Edward Whitacre Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Zane E. Barnes, Whitacre's predecessor, said of Hayes, ``He is a
pretty astute businessman, and he is a very good personality.''
</P>
<P>
   While Southwestern Bell president, Hayes kept his distance from
the news media, something he later attributed to the company's
regimented corporate culture. After he arrived at Western in 1989,
a seemingly more relaxed Hayes bantered privately with reporters
about big deals in the works _ without ever disclosing details
before public announcements were carefully orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Successful utility executives inevitably become perceived as
``very important individuals,'' said Keith Bailey, chairman of the
Williams Cos., which has transported gas for Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been involved in the kind of company _ I don't know if
`deified' is the right word _ that tends to push their corporate
leadership on to pedestals,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Western and the Williams Cos. have clashed over
business matters, Bailey is high on Hayes. The two men have
attended KU basketball games together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can Rock Chalk with the best of them,'' Bailey said of
Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Haines has witnessed a sensitive side of Hayes. Haines,
president of El Paso Electric Co., was an executive at Kansas Gas
when it was acquired by Western.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls a hectic Sunday, after Western announced its deal to
acquire Kansas Gas. Hayes noticed some customer service workers at
the Wichita utility and introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very little thing,'' Haines said. ``I dare say, most
people in the situation Hayes was in wouldn't have thought to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Haines worked for Hayes as Western's chief operating officer
before moving to El Paso. Like other former Hayes proteges, he
considers Hayes a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for him for four years,'' Haines said. ``The concern
he had for taking care of customers is the most significant
business lesson I learned from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said that as he ends his business career, he is still
interested in making a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the same things most Americans are
concerned about,'' he said. ``Americans are concerned about the
fabric of society, the direction we're going in education.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does not share the view that overpaid, spoiled sports
stars are a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many positive role models in sports,'' he said.
``We forget Ty Cobb wasn't such a positive role model. So many
people in sports get involved in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is Hayes' ambition. In years to come, he and his
wife, Gene, want to spend more time with their family, children
Michele, John, Bryan and Joe _ all University of Kansas graduates _
as well as get away to be with family in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes isn't ready to be enshrined in some corporate hall of
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay involved,'' he said.

NASA PREPARES FOR SHUTTLE LAUNCH AS RUSSIANS FIX MIR'S STEERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With some difficulty, the Russians
regained steering control of their drifting Mir space station
Monday, satisfying NASA that it was safe to proceed with a final
U.S. shuttle visit.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery and a six-member crew were to blast off
from the Kennedy Space Center at 6:09 p.m., EDT, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle program managers planned to monitor the Russian repair
effort through the night but did not slow efforts to dispatch
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. astronaut Andy Thomas, who boarded Mir in late January,
waited eagerly for the arrival of his ride back to Earth on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Monday, Mir cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai
Budarin and their flight control team in suburban Moscow managed to
restart the station's steering system after two days of slow but
uncontrolled drift. The system constantly steers Mir so that its
power generating solar arrays gather the sunlight required to
generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's experts acknowledged that the underlying cause of the
steering problem had not been pinpointed, though it seemed to
reside in the primary sensor that measures Mir's turning motions.
Those rates are then transmitted to the guidance computer so that
it can command the station's turbinelike gyrodynes to move the
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Russians believed the difficulty was in the
system's software, then the guidance computer itself. The computer
was replaced by the Mir crew Sunday but balked at accepting
information from the rate sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, the station crew switched the computer to a backup
motion sensor and succeeded in folding in the station's steering
jets. The Russians planned to wean the station from the jets to the
gyrodynes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 24 hours to watch the attitude control
system. That will be adequate to have confidence in it,'' said
Frank Culbertson, who manages NASA's cooperative human spaceflight
program with the Russians. ``We would not rush into this. We will
launch when both the Mir and shuttle are ready and safe to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is basically under control, there is no reason
to delay,'' said Boris Sotnikov, the Russian manager for the
cooperative program. ``Rest assured, if there was any risk at all,
we would definitely decide to stop the launch and wait until the
situation was stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of steering control is the first for the station since
early January. In 1997, the station was rocked by a succession of
major difficulties. Those included a collision, flash fire and
breakdowns of its life support systems, as well as the faltering of
guidance systems blamed on aging computer components.
</P>
<P>
   The recent incident has been mild in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Without steering control, Mir is technically in a tumble and in
jeopardy of losing its ability to generate electrical power.
Fortunately, the tumble rate was small, about one revolution every
60 hours. The station remained drenched in sunlight, and there was
little power loss to the Mir's life support systems.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal, however, forced the cancellation of the brief news
conference NASA had planned with Thomas on the eve of the shuttle
launching.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Monday's developments bolstered his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope I can find my boarding pass,'' Thomas joked as he
spoke with NASA colleagues at the Russian ground control facility.
``I hope it's around here somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, he had expressed some anxiety over how Mir's
difficulties would influence shuttle launch plans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is the seventh and final U.S. astronaut assigned to live
and work on the orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew will deliver 3,300 pounds of food, water and
other supplies to the Russians. The shuttle astronauts plan to
return to Earth with more than a ton of U.S. research equipment and
worn out Russian gear.

WHY A UTILITY CHAIRMAN SEEKS OWNERSHIP OF A BASEBALL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN ROSENBERG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- John E. Hayes Jr., known in the utility
world as a consummate deal maker, now wants to add the Kansas City
Royals to Western Resources' bulging trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes admits that Western, which pitches electric current and
burglary systems, may be out in left field when it comes to sports.
</P>
<P>
   When a skeptical stockholder recently asked Hayes why the
company should own a sports team, ``a rich man's toy,'' Hayes asked
for his trust.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, Western's chairman, pointed out, ``We have a tendency to
move the envelope and do things that are not traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is ``untraditional'' John Hayes? And what drove him to
team up Western Resources with sports impresario Lamar Hunt in
bidding for the Royals?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is complex, much like the silver-haired, amiable yet
sometimes combative Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has no intention of becoming a George Steinbrenner on the
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he said with a chuckle, his net worth is a ``few
zeros less'' than that of the Yankees' owner.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hayes likes sports _ he is a University of Kansas
basketball fan _ he has been to just one or two Royals games since
the beginning of last season.
</P>
<P>
   His take: Someone had to step forward and make a credible offer
to keep the Royals in Kansas City, or the region's prestige _ and
economy _ would be harmed, and utilities like Western don't like to
serve communities in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may have prodded Western to acquire a stake in the
Royals:
</P>
<P>
   -- Western Resources is in the closing innings of its two-year
campaign to acquire Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co., which will need
the blessing of state regulators in Jefferson City and Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is considered a master in the regulatory arena by other
corporate executives and past regulators. Winning political good
will by saving the Royals for Kansas City may help Western on the
regulatory front.
</P>
<P>
   -- Western seeks a new identity as it rapidly moves away from
its origins as a regulated energy monopoly to a company selling
security and other services. It plans to spin off its electric
operations, along with KCP&AMP;L's, into a new company called Westar
Energy, to be based in Kansas City. Western and Westar will need
more visibility as competition arrives in their business.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, utilities are paying to slap their names on
sports stadiums. Western is quiet about how it plans to exploit its
association with the Royals _ and whether a Westar Field will be
the future home of the Royals. But count on this: Western intends
to make money from its association with the Royals in a variety of
ways.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hayes, 60, is trying to prepare for a ``soft landing'' as he
enters the twilight of his career. He will give up the chairmanship
of Western early next year, turning the job over to president David
C. Wittig. Hayes will move on to head up Westar.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes will remain at Westar ``until it's off the ground,'' and
he plans to remain involved with Western's investment in the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes declined to discuss his plans for the team while the bids
for its ownership are evaluated. Hunt Sports Group, a Hunt family
trust, would be managing partner and would operate the team, while
a Western Resources subsidiary also would be half owner.
</P>
<P>
   Other publicly identified bidders for the Royals include E.
Miles Prentice, a New York lawyer, and a group headed by George and
Bobby Brett.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked closely with Hayes through the years
describe him as a visionary and a tenacious adversary who is
self-confident and sensitive to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a major league business executive,'' said William
Steinmeier, former chairman of the Missouri Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Budig, president of baseball's American League, said,
``John Hayes is one of enormous ability and unique sensitivity.''
Budig was on Western's board when it hired Hayes in 1989, but Budig
recently relinquished the board seat to avoid an appearance of a
conflict of interest on Royals matters.
</P>
<P>
   Budig recalled Hayes' commitment to excellence. When Western
Resources, like other utilities, had problems sending out accurate
bills to customers in the winter of 1996-1997, Hayes was cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was emotional on the billing issue,'' Budig said. ``He
wanted to safeguard the credibility of the company. One never had
to wonder about John's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because he is an executive who knows his own mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a person who believes in himself,'' Budig said. ``He is
often tenacious in representing his agenda. ... We believed in him.
We clearly adopted his vision of many issues. He is a person of
intellect who outworks most people in his chosen field.''

JETS LOSE ANOTHER MEMBER OF '96 OFFENSE ATTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets lost another key component of the
high-profile influx of offense they made two years ago when they
released right tackle David Williams on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, plagued with recurrent back problems that continually
interrupted his Jets career, was about to retire, and will most
likely do so. But the release evoked memories of the Jets' failed
1996 attempt to buy an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was one of four highly touted free agents the Jets
picked up for $57 million in long-term contracts in 1996: he joined
quarterback Neil O'Donnell, left tackle Jumbo Elliott and wide
receiver Jeff Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were widely applauded for these bold moves in their
attempt to come back from their 1995 record of 3-13. But each of
the four was injured at some point during the year and the club
wound up with a franchise-worst record of 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets turned themselves around anyway, improving to 9-7 last
year in Bill Parcells' first season as the coach, but with less
help from Williams. Now, only Elliott is assured of a starter's
role on the Jets next season. Graham was traded last draft day,
while O'Donnell remains unwavering in his demand that he receive
his full 1998 salary of $4.2 million. The club wants to cut that in
half, and so his status remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams gone, Jason Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick from
Cincinnati, a school that rarely produces offensive linemen for the
pros, now becomes a candidate at right tackle. He is 6 feet 7
inches tall and 310 pounds, and if he can make the lineup, it will
give the Jets a pair of bookend tackles of spectacular size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a bit of a logjam at right tackle,'' Parcells said
Monday as the week of rookie camp began. In addition to Fabini,
there is the veteran Siupeli Malamala, who was once the club's
starter at the position, as well as the rookie Eric Bateman of
Brigham Young and Deron Thorp of Nevada, who spent last season
playing for the Barcelona Dragons of the NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Fabini, whose time in the 40-yard run is slow but whose
movements off the snap are quick, the shift to the right side
should not be a problem. He played left tackle in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm right-handed,'' he said. ``And anyway, I've been
playing football since the fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells wants a player like Fabini to make it for two obvious
reasons: He could have a long run with the team, and he is cheaper
to sign. The Jets are only now getting some freedom from the salary
cap that has hung over them since the four-player signing of 1996.
Parcells has a few million dollars and would like even more for
what he calls ``fudge money,'' emergency funds. The club saves
about $300,000 toward this year's cap in releasing Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini doesn't understand all the economics. After all, he got
his degree in business only last December. Then he went to work for
a money manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't make it in football,'' he said, ``I had my
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on draft day, when he wasn't taken in the first three
rounds, he was close to throwing something. Then Parcells called
him and told him he was a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was neat to be drafted,'' he said, ``but now I've got to do
some things.'' &QL;
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dorian Boose, the Jets' top draft pick, was a close friend and
Washington State teammate of Eric Bender, the Raiders' second-round
draft pick who was found dead Saturday at a business associate's
home in Marietta, Ga. Boose and Bender were roommates, both played
defensive line and both often talked of making it in the NFL. ``We
all knew he had a problem with epilepsy,'' Boose said, ``but he
hadn't had an episode in three-and-a-half years. The last time I
saw him was at graduation, when we congratulated each other and
gave each other a hug.'' The two used to roughhouse in hotel rooms
the morning of games, Boose recalled. ``We'd tackle each other, but
once we heard the bed crack, we'd stop.'' Boose said his wife,
Brenda, was to speak at a memorial service for Bender.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will not be looking at David Meggett, Parcells said,
despite the fact that Meggett was one of his favorite players.
``I'm only interested in him as a person,'' Parcells said. Meggett
was cut last week by the Patriots. He has not recovered from a
broken foot and faces a trial on sexual assault charges.

SUSPECTED AIDE TO GOTTI TO BE INDICTED TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the next phase of the government's crackdown on
the Gambino crime family's hierarchy, a suspected top aide to the
gang's imprisoned boss, John J. Gotti, will be indicted Tuesday on
federal racketeering charges, defense lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said John D'Amico, who has been delegated by Gotti
to help run the Gambino family while he is in prison, would be
charged on gambling and loan sharking counts. The investigators,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said D'Amico would be
added as a co-defendant in a case involving Gotti's son, John A.
Gotti, who was indicted in January on extensive fraud and extortion
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment and possible conviction of D'Amico, investigators
said, would further weaken the Gambino gang, which has been
displaced by the Genovese crime family as the nation's largest and
most powerful Mafia faction. Both groups use the New York City area
as their main base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico's lawyer, James DiPietro, said in an interview Monday
that an indictment against his client might be unsealed Tuesday in
U.S. District Court in White Plains, where the case against John A.
Gotti, known as Junior, and a dozen other co-defendants is pending.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro said that based on what he described as ``unofficial
reports,'' he believed that D'Amico's arrest was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that D'Amico is ready on a moment's notice
to surrender,'' he said. ``There is no reason to surround his house
at 6 in the morning.'' The lawyer added that he was trying to
negotiate the terms of D'Amico's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, 63, has unlisted telephone numbers at his home in
Hillsdale, N.J., and at an apartment on the Upper East Side in
Manhattan and could not be reached Monday for comment. D'Amico,
according to FBI agents and his lawyer, lists his occupation as a
salesman in Manhattan for a bottled water company.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan, which is handling the case, declined to comment on the
reported charges against D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators have identified D'Amico as one
of three capos or captains in the Gambino family who were appointed
in 1992 by the elder Gotti to administer the gang and safeguard the
financial interests of his relatives while he is imprisoned. The
other committee members, investigators said, were Gotti's brother,
Peter, 58, and Nicholas Corozzo, 58, another high-ranking capo.
</P>
<P>
   But the conviction and imprisonment last year of Corozzo and the
indictment this year of Gotti's son, who is being held without
bail, catapulted D'Amico into a position of prime importance in the
Mafia family's operations, the authorities said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   J. Bruce Mouw, the former head of the FBI's Gambino squad, said
in a recent interview that D'Amico and Peter Gotti had been running
the family although the younger Gotti, 34, had the title of acting
boss bestowed on him by his father. Other federal agents and state
investigators said John J. Gotti, 57, who is serving a life
sentence without parole in the federal prison in Marion, Ill.,
would have to rely even more on his brother, Peter, to maintain
control of the family.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico has been arrested in New York City five times since the
age of 18 on gambling charges that usually resulted in fines
without jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Before John Gotti took control of the Gambino family in 1986,
D'Amico was viewed by federal agents as a low-level Gambino
soldier. Soon after becoming the family's chief, Gotti promoted
D'Amico to head a crew, according to Mouw, and they became frequent
companions at nightspots and race tracks.

McCAIN, TOBACCO TITANS FACE-OFF OVER SMOKING BILL 
 
(filed in ``a'' and ``w'' categories) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain is accustomed to uphill
battles.
</P>
<P>
   As a young fighter pilot downed over North Vietnam, he survived
more than five years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-term senator, the Arizona Republican overcame a media
pounding regarding his association with corrupt savings and loan
mogul Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, he defied his own party's leadership to
champion an overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Now the unpredictable politician who has been toying with
running for president in 2000 has taken on another daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief sponsor of mammoth anti-smoking legislation, McCain
has been waging a war with the nation's tobacco titans.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has made the former two-pack-a-day smoker the
darling of the public health community and ally of the Clinton
administration, which wants to take a more aggressive role in
cracking down on teen-age smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also stirred up hard-core conservative voters in
McCain's party who are deeply suspicious of the steep tobacco price
increases and new federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies and smokers' groups have flooded McCain's
home state with ads contending that the legislation is a big
government tax scheme that would result in a black market for
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has resumed debate on the issue after a weeklong
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around his home state last week, McCain got a whiff of
how the bill was playing, particularly among conservative voters
who could be key to any GOP presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have been a supporter of yours, but I do have to
disagree on the tobacco thing. I hate to see any kind of tax
increase,'' said Brian, a caller to a local talk radio show where
McCain was fielding questions one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't people who choose to smoke have rights, too?'' asked a
veteran at a meeting of McCain supporters preparing for his
re-election effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   The senator refused to budge from his support of the
anti-smoking measure.
</P>
<P>
   He countered that the tobacco company executives have no
credibility and have repeatedly lied to Congress. But he conceded
that the industry's ads were resonating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I resent the tobacco companies doing this to me? Well, they
are making me famous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A smoker for three decades, the 61-year old lawmaker quit 18
years ago, explaining, ``It was killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former military man said he doesn't blame the tobacco
companies for addicting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Navy, all the fighter pilots smoked,''
McCain said. ``It was part of the routine. Cigarette dangling out
of the side of your mouth, standing in the ready room, flight suit
unzipped to the navel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a result of the military experience, McCain said he
intended to make sure the tobacco legislation included funds to
help veterans suffering from smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made it clear he would rather be talking about
something else, preferably campaign finance or foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will not decide whether to run for president until
after the November election, but predicted that potential primary
opponents would use the tobacco bill against him.
</P>
<P>
   And he appears to be laying some of the groundwork for a
presidential bid. On Monday he spoke to the Republican Womens Club
in New Hampshire, the site of the first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's constituents view his work with Democrats on
such issues as tobacco and campaign finance reform as evidence that
he might have broader public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to be elected (president) he needs to look across
party lines. I like it that he considers other people's ideas,''
said Rodney Short, a 24-year-old University of Arizona student.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has always been somewhat of a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Timberg's ``The Nightingale's Song,''
McCain, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, only reluctantly
agreed to attend the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 he graduated in the bottom fifth of his class at
Annapolis, Md., where Timberg says he became ``the unofficial trail
boss for a lusty band of carousers and partygoers known as the Bad
Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot down over North Vietnam in 1967, he was imprisoned in the
notorious ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first marriage fell apart in the late 1970s, McCain
married the daughter of a prominent Arizona beer distributor. He
moved to the state in 1981 and won a Phoenix-area House seat the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   An admirer of President Reagan, the rookie congressman
nevertheless opposed the decision to send Marines to Lebanon in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   When the state's conservative legend, Sen. Barry Goldwater,
decided to retire, McCain immediately sought the seat. Although he
handily won in 1986, McCain was soon engulfed in an ethics scandal
for allegedly urging federal regulators to bail out Keating's
failed savings and loan institution.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Republican in the so-called ``Keating Five,'' McCain
eventually received a ``mild rebuke'' from the Senate, but he
fought back to retain his seat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years McCain has honed a reputation as a thoughtful
and independent spokesman on foreign and military policy. Although
critical of many of the Clinton administration foreign policy
moves, he backed the president's decision to re-establish relations
with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He has clashed with members of his own party over pork barrel
spending, attacking a recent transportation bill he claimed was
larded with wasteful highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has a reputation for a quick temper, McCain also
wins over audiences with his outspokenness and irreverent humor.
</P>
<P>
   Prefacing remarks about foreign policy, he told a GOP women's
group, ``I travel quite a bit around the world, usually at your
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   He joked about being jealous that his teen-age daughter had more
pictures on her wall of the pretty boy star of the movie
``Titanic,'' Leonardo DiCaprio, than of her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I detest that androgynous wimp,'' he quipped. &QL;

POLISH WRESTLER DENIED STAY OF DEPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB PETRIE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Former world-class wrestler Roman Wroclawski find s
himself pinned to the bureaucratic mat _ with little chance of a
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, Wroclawski's stay of deportation to Poland was
denied Monday by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a U.S immigration judge agrees to hear Wroclawski's case,
he and his family will be shipped out of the country on June 15 to
Poland, where he is accused of treason and political enemies await.
</P>
<P>
   ``No explanation was given,'' said Marshall Whitehead, a Phoenix
lawyer representing Wroclawski, a 1982 world Greco-Roman champion
who trains wrestlers in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cold and there was no effort to try to show some
compassion,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   Wroclawski, who has been critical of his homeland
</P>
<P>
   in a book, was ordered deported in absentia in March after
failing to show for a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government sent a letter to Wroclawski's former
lawyer, former Arizona Gov. Raul Castro, notifying him of the
hearing, the
</P>
<P>
   letter was lost after Castro signed for it.
</P>
<P>
   Wroclawski, 42, entered the country on a one-year visitor's
visa, which expired in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the ruling, Wroclawski's children, Michalina, 16,
and Roman, 9, began sobbing at
</P>
<P>
   the INS office in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really emotional meeting and especially emotional for
my kids,'' Wroclawski said through an interpreter. ``For four
years, they have Americanized themselves and they felt really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Pa trick Contreras, an INS official who made the decision,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ahr, an INS spokesman, said he could not comment
specifically on Wroclawski's case, but said Judge Dean LeVay,
should he agree to open the case, would be fair and impartial
toward the wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome is not guaranteed,'' Ahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Should LeVay decide to rehear the case, a decision expected
later this week, Wroclawski's family would be allowed to stay in
the country. If he doesn't, Wroclawski could appeal to the federal
courts, but would still be deported June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he leaves the country, we'd have a very difficult time
appealing these things,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   Each family member would be able to leave with 60
</P>
<P>
   pounds of baggage. The rest would be shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, double warrants seeking Wroclawski's arrest await. He
is accused of treason for writing the book, as well as defrauding a
Polish company of about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wroclawski , who first sought asylum in 1996, said he is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead says his client, who has an offer to help coach
Olympic wrestlers in Colorado Springs, deserves another chance in
court. Wroclawski's first hearing, in mid-1997, was suspended w hen
the judge and INS officials said they wanted to read the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's helped the American wrestling scene and our (the
government's) thinking is to turn around in a cold-hearted approach
and throw him out of the country without his day i n court.''  &QL;

DATA GENERAL LAYS OFF 400 WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price wars that staggered the computer industry took another
swipe at Data General Corp. The company Monday laid off 400 workers
_ 150 in Massachusetts _ and said it would take a $125 million
charge as it abandons the manufacturing of low-end server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices have dropped so fast,'' said Data General's chief
executive, Ronald Skates, adding, ``we're just not going to be in a
position to design these products for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Skates said, Westborough-based Data General will focus
solely on producing high-end server and data storage systems, which
bring in fatter profit margins than do low-end models.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Data General, once among the hardware industry's
hottest companies, has slashed its work force from 18,000 to 5,100
as the industry has shifted to meet the rising popularity of
personal computers. Until recently, there was reason to believe
that the bloodletting at Data General was over and a turnaround had
begun. Prior to last quarter, it had reported 10 straight quarterly
profits, and booming sales of servers and data storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, prices for low-end servers have softened. Servers
are used to store or transfer information among PCs in a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in the last six to nine months is a lot of
pricing pressure, because demand has certainly fallen off,'' said
Peter Lieu, an industry analyst at Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc. in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lieu said that Dell Computer Corp. is one of the few firms able
to grow market share and revenues, further squeezing weaker players
like Data General.
</P>
<P>
   Skates said that Data General will continue to offer a full
range of Aviion servers running the Unix and Microsoft Windows NT
operating systems. But lower-cost Aviion machines will be
manufactured for Data General by other companies. Skates declined
to say which firms would provide the machines, though he ruled out
the possibility that Compaq Computer Corp. would be among them.
Compaq is in the midst of acquiring Maynard-based Digital Equipment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Data General said it will also abandon its Thiin Line Internet
server products. These are low-cost Web server computers designed
for use by small businesses. According to Skates, the company found
that relatively few customers wanted the small, cheap servers,
while customers with major Internet sites preferred the high-end
machines.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the restructuring, Data General will transfer
about 100 employees to its Clariion data storage business unit.
Skates said that there was no room in the company for another 400
employees who designed and built the Thiin Line and low-end Aviion
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts will leave Data General with about 4,700 employees,
including 1,650 in Massachusetts. Skates lamented the layoffs,
saying that they would cost the company many talented engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we hated to do,'' he said, ``but we had no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Data General declined 5/8 Monday in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at 14 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Data General in April reported a $4.5 million loss in its second
fiscal quarter, ending March 31 _ its first in 2 1/2 years. But
Skates says that loss was unrelated to the layoffs. ``If we had
made a lot of money in the last quarter, we'd have taken this same
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skates blamed the loss on delays in bringing out a new line of
Clariion data storage devices. The new systems use a system called
Fibre Channel, which allows fast transfers of data between
computers and disk storage systems. Skates said that the full line
of products is now available.
</P>
<P>
   Skates said that although Aviion sales have continued to grow,
the company couldn't find a way to make money on the low-end Aviion
servers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report issued Monday by International Data Corp.
in Framingham, overall unit sales of servers dropped 11 percent
both in the United States and worldwide during the first quarter of
1998. Because of lower sales and lower prices, there was a 17
percent decline in revenue from US server sales, and a worldwide
decline of 15 percent.

McCAIN, TOBACCO TITANS FACE-OFF OVER SMOKING BILL 
 
(filed in ``a'' and ``w'' categories) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain is accustomed to uphill
battles.
</P>
<P>
   As a young fighter pilot downed over North Vietnam, he survived
more than five years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-term senator, the Arizona Republican overcame a media
pounding regarding his association with corrupt savings and loan
mogul Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, he defied his own party's leadership to
champion an overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Now the unpredictable politician who has been toying with
running for president in 2000 has taken on another daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief sponsor of mammoth anti-smoking legislation, McCain
has been waging a war with the nation's tobacco titans.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has made the former two-pack-a-day smoker the
darling of the public health community and ally of the Clinton
administration, which wants to take a more aggressive role in
cracking down on teen-age smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also stirred up hard-core conservative voters in
McCain's party who are deeply suspicious of the steep tobacco price
increases and new federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies and smokers' groups have flooded McCain's
home state with ads contending that the legislation is a big
government tax scheme that would result in a black market for
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has resumed debate on the issue after a weeklong
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around his home state last week, McCain got a whiff of
how the bill was playing, particularly among conservative voters
who could be key to any GOP presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have been a supporter of yours, but I do have to
disagree on the tobacco thing. I hate to see any kind of tax
increase,'' said Brian, a caller to a local talk radio show where
McCain was fielding questions one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't people who choose to smoke have rights, too?'' asked a
veteran at a meeting of McCain supporters preparing for his
re-election effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   The senator refused to budge from his support of the
anti-smoking measure.
</P>
<P>
   He countered that the tobacco company executives have no
credibility and have repeatedly lied to Congress. But he conceded
that the industry's ads were resonating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I resent the tobacco companies doing this to me? Well, they
are making me famous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A smoker for three decades, the 61-year old lawmaker quit 18
years ago, explaining, ``It was killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former military man said he doesn't blame the tobacco
companies for addicting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Navy, all the fighter pilots smoked,''
McCain said. ``It was part of the routine. Cigarette dangling out
of the side of your mouth, standing in the ready room, flight suit
unzipped to the navel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a result of the military experience, McCain said he
intended to make sure the tobacco legislation included funds to
help veterans suffering from smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made it clear he would rather be talking about
something else, preferably campaign finance or foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will not decide whether to run for president until
after the November election, but predicted that potential primary
opponents would use the tobacco bill against him.
</P>
<P>
   And he appears to be laying some of the groundwork for a
presidential bid. On Monday he spoke to the Republican Womens Club
in New Hampshire, the site of the first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's constituents view his work with Democrats on
such issues as tobacco and campaign finance reform as evidence that
he might have broader public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to be elected (president) he needs to look across
party lines. I like it that he considers other people's ideas,''
said Rodney Short, a 24-year-old University of Arizona student.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has always been somewhat of a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Timberg's ``The Nightingale's Song,''
McCain, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, only reluctantly
agreed to attend the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 he graduated in the bottom fifth of his class at
Annapolis, Md., where Timberg says he became ``the unofficial trail
boss for a lusty band of carousers and partygoers known as the Bad
Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot down over North Vietnam in 1967, he was imprisoned in the
notorious ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first marriage fell apart in the late 1970s, McCain
married the daughter of a prominent Arizona beer distributor. He
moved to the state in 1981 and won a Phoenix-area House seat the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   An admirer of President Reagan, the rookie congressman
nevertheless opposed the decision to send Marines to Lebanon in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   When the state's conservative legend, Sen. Barry Goldwater,
decided to retire, McCain immediately sought the seat. Although he

AUTO MAKERS PLAN SAFETY REDESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ The mismatch in collisions between cars and
light trucks is causing as many as 2,000 extra deaths a year on
U.S. roads, but the nation's automakers have quietly notified
regulators that they will redesign their vehicles to improve
safety, the United States' top traffic safety regulator said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Dr. Ricardo Martinez, administrator of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the growing
popularity of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks,
all of which are classified by the government as light trucks, was
adding to the death toll. But Detroit's Big Three, and many foreign
automakers as well, have told regulators in recent months that they
plan design changes in cars and light trucks alike to address the
problem, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   While sport utility vehicles in particular remain a small
percentage of the vehicles on the road, sales are growing so
quickly that steps must be taken now to prevent serious safety
problems in the future, Martinez said. Although some auto
executives have publicly questioned whether a problem exists, he
said, the industry had begun working quickly to create better
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are minor modifications, some are larger modifications
that will take place down the road,'' Martinez said, refusing to
provide details. He added that the design changes were aimed at
improving safety, rather than addressing shifting tastes among
vehicle buyers as some auto executives have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also disagreed with recent assertions by some auto
industry lobbyists that government crash tests had found little
evidence of a safety problem that light trucks inflict on cars. But
he declined to elaborate, saying test data would be released on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez spoke at the opening of the International Technical
Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles, a gathering every
two years of the world's top safety regulators and researchers. The
Canadian government is acting as host for this year's conference,
in this factory town across the Detroit River from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry officials at the conference declined to discuss
what they would do to improve safety. But managers for General
Motors and Ford have said in recent interviews that they will
redesign the suspensions on their sport utility vehicles so that
these trucks ride closer down to the wheels, reducing the
likelihood that in collisions they will override the bumpers and
other safety systems of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez offered no details on his calculation that the
car-truck mismatch was costing 2,000 lives a year. But his aides
said later that the safety agency had arrived at the number by
calculating the number of deaths that would be avoided if all light
trucks now on the road were replaced with cars.

   Glenn practices for emergencies in NASA training program
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Corrects spelling in second graph to rappelling)
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Montgomery
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronaut-trainee John Glenn joined the rest of his
space crew Monday in a half-day training session on emergency
evacuations from the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, Ohio's senior senator and NASA's senior space man,
practiced rappelling down the sides of a shuttle mockup in a drill
designed to hone crew coordination in the event of an emergency
after a successful landing. The crew members had done these same
exercises individually, but Monday was the first time they worked
together. ``It's a little different every time you do it,'' Glenn,
76, said during the three evacuation drills.
</P>
<P>
   For the training, each astronaut wore a bright orange flight
suit similar to the ones they'll wear during the 9-day mission
scheduled to begin October 29. The suit weighs about 100 pounds and
includes an array of survival essentials from a built-in life raft
with dye pack to 2 liters of drinking water, a flare kit, radio and
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice,'' trainer Sharon Jones told the crew when they'd
finished the drill that involved exiting through an escape hatch at
the top of the craft. The hatch is directly above the flight and
mid decks, where crew members sit during takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   But Flight Commander Curt Brown, who has flown four space
shuttle missions and has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space, gently
admonished his crew to step lively next time. ``Today was training,
and everybody did great,'' Brown said, but added, ``We could speed
it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn did his chores, his wife, Annie, roamed about with a
camera happily taking snapshots of the crew. Ever enthusiastic,
Glenn pulled at the fingers of his pressure-suit glove before he
put it on to fashion a thumb's-up sign to Annie, who grinned and
took the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn returned to Washington Monday afternoon, having spent all
of last week here in astronaut training. He said he's planning to
fly to Arizona later this week to attend a funeral for former Sen.
Barry Goldwater, who died last week at 89. ``We want to go,'' Glenn
said, speaking also for his wife. ``(Goldwater) and I worked pretty
closely for a while on the Armed Services Committee.

SOUTH DAKOTANS STILL STUNNED IN AFTERMATH OF TORNADO

   SPENCER, S.D. _ There's no explaining the things fate chooses to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   The mutilated green shell that used to be the house of
86-year-old Marlys Muters was ankle deep in broken glass and
mangled furniture on Monday, but just outside lay one of those
musical Mother's Day cards and it was playing ``Be it ever so
humble, there's no place like home.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-story house of Ward and Gloria Satterlee, the minister
and organist at the Nazarene Church, is now an eviscerated mound of
splinters and shreds, but somehow sticking out untouched from the
pile was a white sheaf of church music, a piece called
``Alleluja!''
</P>
<P>
   And though almost everything in Lucille Mone's house came
crashing down around her, sitting serenely on the wall is a framed
puzzle of a cool, green Irish countryside and a clock that is still
telling time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mone, a sprightly 89-year-old woman who springs around on a
wooden cane, was hoping Monday to salvage one more thing: her
husband James' false teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a cup in the bathroom, and he was in bed and the
storm blew him out of bed so bad, he couldn't find the floor and
that's when he got hurt,'' said Mrs. Mone, whose husband, 95, was
still in the hospital with a broken shoulder and broken ribs.
``They were Omaha teeth. You can't get them in South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a ferocious tornado steamrolled the tiny hamlet
of Spencer, people here were setting their minds on the simple
things. They almost had to. So much had been destroyed _ every
business and all but a dozen or so houses _ that the 320 people
living here did not know where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-mph twister carved a southeastern slash across South
Dakota's corn-wheat-and-soybean territory Saturday night, but it
hit hardest in Spencer, virtually destroying this mile-square
community.
</P>
<P>
   It struck so hard and fast that it fizzled the town's
electricity before the tornado warning siren could sound.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were killed and 150 others, half the population, were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were all older people, for they are the people who
remain in the pin-dot places of the Great Plains, the places the
Interstate ignores and the cities carry on without. The youngest
was Ron Selken, a 62-year-old retired concrete laborer. Two of the
women died in a home for the elderly on Main Street, the only paved
road in town. A 93-year-old widow, Mildred Pugh, was crushed under
the library's bookmobile trailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Gloria Satterlee, 71, was yanked to her death as she and her
husband were hurrying from the kitchen into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had her by the hand,'' her husband, Ward, 74, said Monday,
watching as relatives combed through the rubble of his house and
came up with an old Bible. ``She said, `Just a minute, I want to
get the dog.' I let go of her hand and that's the last I seen of
her. I was pinned with some kitchen floor on top of me. I called to
her about 10 or 20 times and never got an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Satterlee's face was a torment of purple abrasions _ he was
released from the hospital Monday morning after being treated for
the cuts on his face, a gash in his side and a burn from the hail
that pounded him while the tornado kept him trapped.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton named Spencer a federal disaster
area and offered the community the full range of disaster-relief
services, from temporary housing to rebuilding roads to small
business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency said
there was no way to estimate how much damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' said Richard Weiland, the regional director of
the emergency agency. ``What can you count? It's all gone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standing on a cement slab that marked the remains of a shattered
house, Gov. Bill Janklow insisted Monday that the town would be
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen it when the pioneers got here,'' the
governor said. ``We built a town here. We'll build another town.
Will everybody live here? No. But a year from today we're going to
have a town.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive the point home further, Janklow said: ``Look, how'd you
like to be in Berlin after the war? But Spencer's going to have
what Spencer had before.''
</P>
<P>
   But residents here are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's nothing to come back to _ just my grave in the
cemetery,'' said Mrs. Mones, who was born in Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose this will wipe it out,'' said Cal Muters, 53, Mrs.
Muters' son, as he searched for family photographs in his mother's
house, which was so devastated she could not yet bring herself to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mayor of Spencer, Rocky Kirby, who also owns the grain
elevator, was skeptical about rebuilding. ``These little towns out
here in South Dakota are on their way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, what Spencer had has been diminishing over the years.
Built about 120 years ago in the grassland about 50 miles west of
Sioux Falls, Spencer has seen its population dwindle by half over
the last few decades as young people grew up and moved away. The
year before last, the school was closed because there were not
enough children for classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be 22 businesses downtown,'' said Everett
McDaniel, who was born here 68 years ago. ``Now there's just the
bank, the post office, the grain elevator, Spencer Automotive, and
the antique store.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that was what there was before Saturday. Now, the silos
at Spencer Grain Co. are crushed like soda cans. The 120-foot blue
water tower is twisted into ruins, sharp spiky strips of metal,
with the name Spencer visible through the wreckage upside down. All
five churches in town were flattened. The library, fire department
and post office are tortured piles of brick and wood.
</P>
<P>
   And all that remains of the Security State Bank branch is the
steel vault, sticking up like a pyramid in a desert. People here
said that the twister was so furious that a blank check from the
bank was found in Laverne, Minn., 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to tell where one house ends and another
begins,'' said Jane Kingsbury, who was searching a pile of rubble
that, as near as she could tell, contained all that was left of her
daughter's house that used to stand across the street.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the electric company began what will be a two-week
process of hooking up the town's electricity. Emergency Management
crews uprooted the shredded remains of trees and bulldozed away
walls and ceilings and doors.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, about 80 members of the National Guard have been
deployed to secure the area and prevent looting. And each family
was assigned a cadre of prison inmates to help them sift through
their belongings. The governor deployed 100 inmates from the
Springfield State Penitentiary here because, he said, ``I think
it's beneficial to have inmates see human suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gray rain gave way to a simmering sun Monday, Mabel
Allen, 86, who has lived here since she was in third grade, was
sitting on a folding chair outside what had been her home, the
senior citizen apartments, as her daughter and grandson brought her
fragments of her life that they found blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it lasted forever,'' Ms. Allen said, recalling
how she cowered under a staircase when the winds hit. ``I don't
know how long it was. We prayed and screamed is what we did. And
then everything was gone.''

GOLDWATER FUNERAL GATE-CRASHERS FROM HELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - If the Rev. Fred Phelps is correct _ and by God he
believes he is _ then former Sen. Barry Goldwater is now a resident
of hell. Along with Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono, Princess Diana and,
possibly, Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   In order to reinforce this belief, Rev. Phelps is sending a
squad
</P>
<P>
   of holy warriors to picket Goldwater's funeral Wednesday. They
plan to carry signs reading ``Barry in hell'' and worse.
</P>
<P>
   This is necessary, the reverend told me Monday, because
Goldwater was ``a supporter of Sodomites.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained , ``When you want to say it's OK to be gay, then
you're saying God is a liar and the Bible is not a reliable guide.
You're saying it's OK to sin, because if the Bible is wrong on that
weighty matter, then it's not reliable on any matter.''
</P>
<P>
   R ev. Phelps is reliable, however.
</P>
<P>
   You can rely on him and his parading zealots from Westboro
Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., to have something to say, to stage
some protest, to try to get on TV, after the death of any person
with a big name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preaching the gospel for 50 years,'' Rev. Phelps
said. ``I'm telling you, looking at the Bible, I have a profound
feeling of distress that it's too late for everyone in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's correct.
</P>
<P>
   At least, it's
</P>
<P>
   too late for us to ignore Rev. Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   He's already been featured on local talk radio. Already been in
the local papers. Soon, his sign-carrying zombies will turn up on
local TV.
</P>
<P>
   We live in the land of fruits and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Show th e media a fruit, and we go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Phelps is a Carmen Miranda, with a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   After Sinatra died, the reverend sent out a press release that
read in part, ``This whoremongering son of an abortionist became
Chairman of the Board of the entertainment industry for half a
century. He must now atone for his sins.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Bono is in hell, Phelps says, for not condemning his gay
daughter, Chastity.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of Princess Diana, Westboro Baptist Church
issued a s tatement reading, ``God Almighty has again manifested
His hot displeasure against the prevailing depravity of these last
days by dramatically snuffing out the hedonistic life of a leading
international symbol of immoral, god-defying decadence.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked the reverend, ``Is there any prominent person in the
United States who isn't going to hell?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I tell you, I get very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps is very fond of Zimbabwe, though, and its President
Robert Mugabe .
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Mugabe,'' he says. ``Of all the leaders of the
modern states, he is the only one taking the proper position on the
homosexual menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, the Westboro Baptist Church flies the flag of
Zimbabwe above the f lag of the United States. The American flag is
flown upside down.
</P>
<P>
   For Memorial Day, the church issued a statement titled, ``They
all died in vain for a filthy Sodomite nation led by perverts and
whores.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Phelps' parishioners
</P>
<P>
   are known to picket the funerals of AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they'll travel to Goldwater's service, he said, ``is
because this nation needs to be preached to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its leaders need to be preached to. And the best place to
preach to the m is at their miserable funerals where they're
gathered around lying about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   You can read all about Phelps' church on his Web site (I swear
I'm not making this up): www.godhatesfags.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many offerings available i s a transcript of a
pamphlet titled (Really, I'm not kidding) ``Mother Teresa in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   If Phelps is right, if hell _ the ultimate hot spot _ is filling
up with the unholy likes of Goldwater and Sinatra and Princess Di
and Mother Teresa, th ere's only one thing left I'd like to know.

SPRINT IN PLAN TO ENTER LOCAL PHONE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp., the No. 3 long-distance telephone carrier, plans
to announce Tuesday its long-awaited strategy for competing in
local communications markets, executives close to the company said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is based on an ambitious plan to deliver high-speed
access to cyberspace, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement comes after Sprint has spent the last two
years essentially sitting on the sidelines in terms of competing in
new local telephone markets. The company seems to have spent that
time devising some new tactics for use in the continuing battle
between long-distance and local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Sprint said the company was hoping to
cooperate with the five Bell local telephone companies rather than
attack them head-on. That cooperation could take the form of
Sprint's agreeing to buy capacity on advanced local data networks
that many of the Bells are planning to build.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., which offers phone service for much of the
area from Virginia to Maine, and SBC Communications Inc. appear to
be the Bells that are negotiating most seriously with Sprint, a
person close to Sprint said.
</P>
<P>
   As they await permission from regulators to sell long-distance
service within their traditional local telephone regions, Bell
Atlantic and SBC each have already signed contracts with Sprint to
buy wholesale capacity on Sprint's national fiber optic network.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, Sprint and SBC, which includes Southwestern Bell
and Pacific Bell and which has agreed to acquire Ameritech Corp.,
declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Tuesday, code-named Operation Fast Break,
Sprint intends to unveil what it calls an ``integrated on-demand
network.'' Sprint plans to say that consumers can use a single
connection to the new network for multiple phone lines, access to
the Internet and other advanced data services and video
conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to begin offering the new service to large
business customers later this year and make it generally available
to business clients around the middle of next year. Sprint plans to
begin offering the service to residential consumers in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint plans to offer the service both in areas where the
company already offers local phone service as well as in new
regions.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Sprint said the company had spent about $2
billion the last five years developing the new network. Among the
companies that have tried the new system is Hallmark Cards Inc.,
the greeting card giant based in Kansas City, Mo. Sprint is based
in Westwood, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint plans to announce that it has formed three strategic
alliances in connection with the new system. Cisco Systems Inc.,
the maker of data networking equipment, will provide high-speed
communications equipment that uses an advanced sort of technology
known as asynchronous transfer mode.
</P>
<P>
   Bellcore, the former research venture of the regional Bell
companies, will provide the main software for the venture. Bellcore
is now a unit of Science Applications International Corp., a
private company based in San Diego that is best known for its work
in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's main partner in retail distribution will be Tandy
Corp.'s chain of Radio Shack electronics stores. Sprint already
uses Radio Shack to help promote Sprint's wireless telephone
service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was meant to unleash broad
competitive forces in local and long-distance communications
markets. But while consumers can choose from among hundreds of
long-distance carriers, most Americans only have one choice of
local phone company: the same provider they had before 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many telecommunications experts expected the three largest
long-distance companies _ AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and
Sprint _ to invade local phone markets quickly. But that has not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   MCI had an aggressive plan to build local networks and compete
against the Bells, but after losses began to mount last year MCI
pulled back. In fact, unexpectedly large losses in its local
operation led to perhaps the most traumatic event in MCI's
corporate history: its grudging renegotiation of its deal to be
acquired by British Telecommunications PLC last year and an
unsolicited $37 billion takeover offer from Worldcom Inc., which
was accepted and which is awaiting approval from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is expected to say Tuesday that it has already spent most
of the money required to build the new network. That could lead to
tough questions about how many residential consumers the company
really wants to serve.

   &UR; NETWORK _ &LR;  Monica Frei, head of a Bay Area nanny placement
service, had all the people skills she needed to spot a good
housekeeper, nanny or personal assistant. But until recently she
was almost too petrified even to touch a computer.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her
to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town
and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed. By themselves, the firm's
computers weren't any friendlier than before, but networked
together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to
ignore. By Jonathan Marshall

<P>
   &UR; NETWORK SIDE _ &LR;  If computers could speak, they'd beg to be
networked whenever two or more inhabit the same office.

<P>
   Networks can pay huge dividends by letting employees swap files,

   The CrossPoint VirtualPBX is just that. It lets small firms
whose employees frequently work from home or on the road look to
the rest of the world like a big office with a $100,000 phone

MERGER GIVES MONSANTO CHIEF BIG WINDFALL PROFIT
</HEADLINE>
  (With AHP-MONSANTO)  
(sw) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Stafford, chief executive of American Home
Products, and Robert Shapiro, his counterpart at Monsanto,
emphasized on Monday that the $34.4 billion stock-for-stock deal
they had just constructed was a merger of equals. But as is almost
always the case in life, one player in this high-stakes game is
more equal than the other.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, the men say they will be co-chief executives
with equal footing. But thanks to Shapiro's unusual executive
compensation plan, the deal will put him several rungs above
Stafford on the windfall profit ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Not that either executive is going to the poorhouse anytime
soon. After all, Stafford was paid $6.4 million last year in total
compensation; Shapiro pulled in $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the real payday comes when stock options held by the
executives are exercised. Because the deal is a merger of equals
and not an acquisition of one company by another, compensation
experts say it is a near certainty that any options held by the
chiefs will automatically be exercisable when the merger is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for several ironies. Although Stafford of the
American Home Products Corp. runs the bigger and more profitable of
the two companies, Monsanto's man will bag the bigger stock option
windfall if the combination goes through. According to figures
compiled by Jim Dalton at Compensation Resource Group in Pasadena,
Calif., Shapiro will reap nearly $73.6 million in stock option
gains from the deal; Stafford's stock option gain will be $48.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the companies stack up: Monsanto generated revenues
of $7.5 billion last year; American Home's sales were $14.2
billion. American Home's profit margins have been consistently
superior to Monsanto's _ operating margins were 25.6 percent versus
22.2 for Monsanto last year. American Home earned 50 percent more
than Monsanto last year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another irony to this deal. In executive
compensation circles, Shapiro has been celebrated as a man who
holds his managers' feet _ as well as his own _ to the fire,
pegging a portion of everybody's pay to the performance of
Monsanto's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, for instance, Monsanto put in place a
so-called premium option program for its top executives. Under the
1997 plan, premium options could be exercised only after the stock
price had risen 50 percent from its $50 price at the time the plan
was announced. That meant the executives could not cash in those
options until the stock hit $75. The options also had to be held
for a minimum of one year.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive, Shapiro stood a very good chance of winning
big on his premium options, which accounted for the lion's share of
his option position. But unlike other corporate chiefs who win
regardless of whether their shareholders do, Shapiro put his
compensation at risk to a bad performance by his stock. For this,
he won kudos from those critical of astronomical pay packages for
corporate leaders. After all, Shapiro was to win big only if
shareholders did, too.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Upon completion, the deal announced on Monday
with American Home Products, which is based in Madison, N.J., will
eliminate the risk that Shapiro had in his options plans. And
Monsanto's stock did not have to get close to $75 for him to get
his reward.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, were not
as lucky; it fell 87.5 cents, to $54.50, on Monday's news. American
Home gained 93.75 cents, to $49.25. There will be no premium paid
to either company's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's shares had crept higher since January on rumors that
it would be acquired; in January, the stock was around $39. Wall
Street has also cheered the company's shift from a politically
incorrect chemical company to a eco-trendy bioscience concern. It
trades at almost 50 times next year's earnings estimates, nearly
double American Home's multiple of 26.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eric Marquardt, managing director of the
Compensation Resource Group's Chicago office, the merger might not
trigger the option gains had Shapiro held a more traditional option
program. That is because the Monsanto plan was based specifically
on characteristics of the company's stock _ volatility, for example
_ that will be moot when combined with another company like
American Home.
</P>
<P>
   One question on everyone's lips on Monday was how will Shapiro
and Stafford manage as co-chief executives?
</P>
<P>
   The men could not be more different in management styles.
American Home is staid and conservative and said to be run by
lawyers and accountants; Monsanto is almost new age. Its divisions
are run by teams, not individuals. And it recently eliminated all
its executives' offices, putting high-ranking officials in cubicles
alongside staff members. Offices of the former executives are now
plant-filled meeting rooms with names like Spring, Renaissance and
other appropriately ``green'' names.
</P>
<P>
   One clue to how the executives will coexist may be found in the
way they resolve the great difference in their pay. While American
Home has a traditional executive pay program that focuses on cash
compensation and plain-vanilla options, Monsanto's packages allow
for more ownership and more bells and whistles. ``One of the
toughest challenges will be getting these approaches to meld,''
Marquardt said. ``But the resolution of these things is usually to
raise the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   By raising the bar, Marquardt means that Shapiro's salary and
bonus _ $1.76 million last year _ will probably be brought in line
with Stafford's more generous level of $2.5 million. Total cash
compensation for the chief executives of the combined company would
be $5 million. Stock options would be additional.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty rich stuff. Especially when compared with the $2.6
million paid to Raymond Gilmartin, chief executive of Merck. If
Marquardt is right, this exceedingly well-run drug industry giant,
about 15 percent larger than the combined American Home-Monsanto,
could very well have a chief who costs half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about shareholder value. &QL;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Networking for Profits  
   
 By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Monica Frei, head of a Bay Area nanny placement service, had all
the people skills she needed to spot a good housekeeper, nanny or
personal assistant. But until recently she was almost too petrified
even to touch a computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her
to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town
and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed. By themselves, the firm's
computers weren't any friendlier than before, but networked
together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The network has made ``a huge, huge difference to our
business,'' Frei enthused, noting that employees now share files
and communicate far more effectively between offices. ``Our
efficiency and thoroughness have increased dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses all over America are discovering similar
benefits from letting their computers communicate together.
</P>
<P>
   A computer network lets employees swap files with the push of a
button instead of walking from room to room with floppy disks. It
lets them share a high-speed printer instead of wasting desk space
and money putting printers by every workstation. And it permits
everyone in the office to share Internet access without the expense
of multiple dial-up lines and accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Networks also let offices centralize files on one hard disk,so
safety backups become easy and routine rather than onerous and
infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   The message hasn't sunk in everywhere. Eighty percent of
America's 7 million small businesses (those with formal offices and
fewer than 100 employees) have computers, but only about a quarter
have a computer network, according to International Data Corp., a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many more would take the plunge if they listened to Frei. Until
last year, her employees had computers but mostly relied on paper
files. If a client came to the Larkspur office seeking a nanny
whose file was in San Francisco, the offices wound up faxing piles
of paperwork back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   And when new references came in on a prospective housekeeper or
nanny, or a placement worker got important leads on new clients,
word didn't always get out to employees in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   With much apprehension about cost and complexity, Frei finally
gave the green light to the installation of a computer network last
year. Now all 25 staffers in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Larkspur
can call up files and communicate with each other instantly by
interoffice data links.
</P>
<P>
   When one employee updates a nanny's file, the new information is
instantly available on a central computer, called a server, to
everyone in the company. E-mail messages now pass important tips to
the entire staff without delay. And the offices can now communicate
via the Internet more readily with clients in the technology
industry, for whom e-mail is second nature.
</P>
<P>
   Employees can also work from home or on the road by dialing into
the office network to retrieve files from the server. ``I'm
expecting my first baby in September, and I'm excited to know it's
possible to work from home,'' Frei said.
</P>
<P>
   Between the three offices, the network hardware and installation
cost about $12,000, including a new server. Frei said it ``has
already paid for itself ten-fold in the amount of time we save and
the things we don't miss by communicating efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiniest offices can benefit from networks. Based in San
Rafael, the U.S. subsidiary of Novacart, an Italian maker of baking
molds, linked together its two computers at the beginning of the
year and has already reaped big rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Miglia, head of the office, said his desk used to be covered
with paper jottings about possible customer leads and where to send
samples. When he did use his computer to produce a document, he had
to detach the printer from his assistant Sarah Eitel's computer, a
messy process. ``It was a disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hired a consultant to network the computers together.
Printing is now automatic. He and Eitel share files instantly, so
they can keep track of customer inquiries on a single computer
database. ``Now if Joe's bakery calls up, I know if they already
talked to her,'' Miglia said.
</P>
<P>
   The database also reminds him when to follow up sample shipments
with sales calls to customers, a process that used to be haphazard
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our productivity is way up,'' Miglia said. ``I tell Sarah
almost once a week, God, this system is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks become even more essential as a business grows. Tom
Pelton discovered that last year as he added employees to
Micro-Metric, a San Jose firm that makes precise measurement
equipment for makers of hard disks and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   When Pelton worked out of a garage and handled sales and
accounting himself, he didn't need a network. But, recently, he
hired a bookkeeper, office manager, purchasing agent and three
programmers who need to work on common files. The only practical
solution was to put files on a central server and share them over
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton hired T&AMP;R Communications in Milpitas to install the
network last year for under $15,000, including three computers, an
uninterruptible power supply and other equipment and support. Today
he can't imagine living without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time you aren't aware that it's there,'' Pelton
said. ``But without it, I'd have a mutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pelton installed the network, he soon discovered another
big advantage: the ease of backing up files off a single server
rather than many separate computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, each person was responsible for his own
backups,'' Pelton said. ``If I didn't back up or my secretary
didn't or a programmer didn't, we were in a hurtin' way. Now every
night we have a tape drive that sucks everything up off the server.
A month ago the hard drive on my computer crashed completely. At
first, I was blown away. Then I realized everything I care about is
backed up on the network (server).''
</P>
<P>
   To install networks without costly interruptions to their
business, many small firms rely on consultants. Owners should pick
consultants with care, relying on personal recommendations from
satisfied customers, said Michael Boorstein, a Marin-based network
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many consultants are hanging out shingles these days with no
experience,'' he said. ``They hooked up two computers at home and
found it was easy, then get out into the real world and find
bazillions of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants typically charge anywhere from $80 to $125 an hour.
But jobs often take only a few hours. Boorstein got a network of 12
Pentium computers up and running at Spirit Rock meditation center
in Marin in just four hours. (The center already had network wiring
in place.)
</P>
<P>
   Relatively simple networks of that size can often be installed
by computer-savvy business owners or employees without the help of
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not rocket science anymore,'' said Jim Novack,
a Larkspur-based computer consultant. ``It's almost as simple as
plugging your telephone into a socket.''

EDITORIAL: PRIMARY LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers who take perverse pride in complaining about the
state's dreadful political process must be humbled by Tuesday's
California primary. Gov. George Pataki's $12 million campaign chest
looks like bus fare compared with the money that has already been
spent there, just on the race for a gubernatorial nomination. The
three Democratic contenders together have forked over about $60
million. In company like this, even Sen. Alfonse D'Amato could end
up looking impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   California is supposed to be the promised land for rich
candidates with nothing on their resumes except TV ad buys. But
lately the old political fixtures have begun to look more
attractive, and polls showed voters poised for a flight to the
familiar. Al Checchi, the businessman who invested an estimated $40
million in the governor's race, found the going harder than he
expected. Californians began paying more attention to Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Sacramento veteran who boasted he was ``the best-trained
governor-in-waiting'' ever. Five years ago that might have sounded
depressing. But economic boom times tend to change people's
perspective on continuity.
</P>
<P>
   By last weekend, California's much-discussed ``virtual''
campaign of soulless TV commercials had returned to the retail
politics of sidewalk press conferences and handshaking. The
multimillionaire Checchi orated like a populist assemblyman, and
the sedate Davis told a church group that his wife had led him back
to God.
</P>
<P>
   While it makes for rather dull politics, predictability can
produce good outcomes. For instance, voters' aversion to the
dramatic gesture showed up earlier this spring in Nebraska to good
effect. Rep. John Christensen, the favorite in a Republican
gubernatorial primary, frightened the public with his divisive
rhetoric about homosexuals and nudity on public-access TV. The
voters fled into the camp of Mayor Mike Johans of Lincoln, who is
as button-down as Christensen is hot-button, and won their hearts
just by sounding sensible.
</P>
<P>
   Special-interest groups seem to have lost their knack for
swaying elections with a barrage of TV and radio ads. In
Pennsylvania, term-limit advocates poured money into an attempt to
unseat the House education chairman, Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania.
The Republican voters responded by giving Goodling a 2-to-1 victory
over his opponent. Either the campaign finance scandals have turned
the public off to these sorts of appeals, or listeners have simply
gone deaf. Jaded couch potatoes can just as easily click past a
political commercial as they can ads for automobiles and diet cola.

MILLER ACCEPTS HEFTY PAY CUT IN NEW PACT WITH GIANTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The contract impasse between the Giants
and linebacker Corey Miller will end Tuesday when Miller signs a
restructured deal that calls for a substantial pay cut from the
$1.5 million he was scheduled to make next season.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to trim their payroll, the Giants had considered
releasing Miller, who has started 71 games for the team at
linebacker, including 14 games last season. Miller's value dropped
this winter when the Giants re-signed linebacker Marcus Buckley.
Coach Jim Fassel and his assistant coaches think Buckley can be the
starter at Miller's strongside linebacking position.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, however, is inexperienced as an every-down player, and
the Giants had hoped to keep Miller, who is one of the more senior
players on the team. Until this weekend, Miller had spurned the
team's attempts to cut his salary by $600,000 or more. But with the
Giants scanning the waiver wire this week for quality veterans cast
aside by other teams in payroll purges, Miller's position with the
Giants grew more tenuous. The two sides came to a contract
agreement _ laden with incentives and with a base salary below $1
million _ late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the workout of veteran and rookie players Monday at Giants
Stadium, Fassel said he expected the team would soon have an
announcement on Miller's status. Miller, 29, was not at Monday's
workout, but Fassel said Miller was expected to attend a team
workout on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions for the last several months on a
possible restructuring,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi
said. ``Hopefully, it can get consummated very quickly when he
arrives Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any player, the Giants could still cut Miller before the
season begins and not have to pay his base salary. More likely,
Miller will join Buckley in a hybrid form of a strongside
linebacker, with Miller playing more often in obvious run
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had 23 tackles in 14 games last season. He was a
sixth-round draft choice of the Giants in 1991. He became a regular
at linebacker in 1993 after two seasons of backing up Lawrence
Taylor and Carl Banks.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   High-Tech Systems Easy to Set Up  
   
 By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
If computers could speak, they'd beg to be networked whenever two
or more inhabit the same office.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Networks can pay huge dividends by letting employees swap files,
share printers and hop onto the Internet at will. But they used to
require expensive consultants, exotic hardware and complicated
software, making them something to avoid whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Improved technology has slashed the cost and complexity of
networks. Today, even an amateur can set up a network for a few
hundred dollars and a few hours' time.
</P>
<P>
   On the hardware side, a network requires two or more computers,
each with a network interface card inside. It needs a central box
called a ``hub'' to which the computers all connect. And it needs
cables to link the network cards to the hub. &LR;   &LR; Computer catalogs
and stores are full of such devices these days.
</P>
<P>
   For software, a simple network needs only Windows 95 on every
PC. Earlier versions of Windows and DOS won't work without
additional software. (The Macintosh operating system works fine for
networking Macs.)
</P>
<P>
   For shared Internet use, add a ``router,'' a device which
connects the network hub with the Internet connection, such as a
regular phone line or higher speed, digital ISDN line. The router
lets several people surf the Web at the same time and protects the
network against unauthorized sabotage by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   An efficient network also centralizes files on one computer,
called a ``server,'' a sort of file lending library. Employees can
call up client records, accounting information, old correspondence
and other files off the server. Files can then be backed up daily
in one simple operation.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that none of this equipment costs much.
</P>
<P>
   The server, which is optional, is the most expensive item. A
fancy server, with huge amounts of disk storage, a backup tape
drive and a redundant power supply, can cost as much as $4,000. But
an ordinary Pentium computer &UR;  &LR; is perfectly adequate and costs only
$1,000, putting it well within the price range of most small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If you are outfitting a new office with computers, buy them with
network interface cards already installed. Otherwise, you have to
open up the computer case, push the card into an empty slot, and
hope that Windows recognizes the card properly. It doesn't take a
Ph.D. to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Buy so-called ``10/100'' cards, capable of operating at 100
megabits per second as well as the usual network speed of 10 Mbps,
just in case you ever need the extra performance. Such cards
typically cost $40 to $70 each.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need one or more hubs to connect all your computers.
Make sure the hubs have a few more ``ports'' than you have
computers, to make room for growth. For example, if you have five
computers, buy an eight-port hub. That will give you the capacity
to connect three more computers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-port hub from a top brand, such as 3Com or Intel,
should retail for about $76; cheaper but still capable hubs from
Netgear, NDC or D-Link sell for as little as $59.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have good reputations. Netgear's product
line, however, recently won an ``Editor's Choice'' award from PC
Magazine for ``the best combination of extensive offerings, low
pricing, ease of use, and excellent technical support.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need cables to connect the network cards to the
hub. Ask for so-called ``category 5'' wiring with RJ-45 connectors.
Such cables don't cost much and come in a variety of lengths.
</P>
<P>
   If you have only a handful of computers, you can save time
buying a simple networking kit from a company such as Netgear or
3Com's OfficeConnect division. The boxes have everything you need
to get started, including cables, cards, a hub and simple
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If your employees are power users, sending big graphics files
over the network, consider buying a faster hub, called a 100Base-T
hub. These operate at 100 megabits per second, 10 times as fast as
usual. Catalogs sell them for $215 to $350 for an eight-port hub.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet access, many small businesses choose ISDN
connections for speedy Web browsing along with two phone lines for
voice conversations. ISDN routers, which let users share the same
ISDN line for Internet access, now cost under $500 and often come
with a small hub built in.
</P>
<P>
   If your network grows beyond 15 or 20 computers (even fewer, if
you get powerful network accounting packages or other heavy-duty
applications), you may need to consider a more complex
``client-server'' network with a powerful network operating system
such as Windows NT or Novell's Netware.
</P>
<P>
   Such operating systems are more robust than Windows 95, so your
network will be less prone to crash. And they come with many
powerful features, such as the ability to give users access to
certain files but not others.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is, client-server networks aren't for novices. To
set one up and maintain it, ask around for a consultant who comes
with good references.
</P>
<P>
   Before you rush out and hire a consultant, however, learn the
basics from one of several excellent primers, such as ``Networking
for Dummies'' by Doug Lowe (IDG Books) or ``Absolute Beginner's
Guide to Networking'' by Mark Gibbs and Todd Brown (Sams).
</P>
<P>
   Also, check out 3Com's informative Web site (http:/
/www.3com.com/smallbusiness /basics/calculator/index.html), which
includes information on how to obtain a free ``network benefits
calculator'' to help you estimate the potential productivity gains
of a network.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Virtual Phone System for Businesses Sounds Like the Real Deal  
   
 By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In this era of virtual companies, it was just a matter of time
before someone invented a virtual phone system.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The CrossPoint VirtualPBX is just that. It lets small firms
whose employees frequently work from home or on the road look to
the rest of the world like a big office with a $100,000 phone
system. And the best part is, there's no up-front investment.
</P>
<P>
   The service is offered by Advanced Queuing Systems in San
Francisco ( &LR; www.aqsys.com &LR; ). AQS put all the fancy telephone-switch
intelligence in its computer network, freeing customers from having
to pay for and install a complex phone system in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Each customer gets a toll-free 800 or 888 number for incoming
calls. When a caller dials an employee extension, the call is
routed to any of several numbers specified by the employee, such as
a home number, branch office, cell phone, pager or a client site.
Custom music or messages play while the caller waits for the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The system also comes with voice mail, call screening,
dial-by-name directories and a fancy feature called automated call
distribution, or ACD, usually found only in high-end systems. ACD
routes calls to the next available person in a queue _ for example,
for incoming sales or technical support calls.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pay for the system by the minute. Incoming or outgoing
calls within the Bay Area cost 10 cents a minute, within the rest
of California 11 cents a minute and outside the state 16 cents a
minute. There also is a small annual maintenance fee that varies
with the size of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stephen Lange, co-founder of AQS, said one customer using the
service is an insurance company with offices in San Francisco,
Hayward, San Jose and Oakland. Previously, the company needed phone
switches in each office, and expensive T1 lines connecting them at
a cost of thousands of dollars a month. But with the virtual PBX,
callers can be transferred seamlessly to agents in any office.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Human Function and Work in Boulder, Colo., uses
the CrossPoint VirtualPBX to link with a dozen or so professors at
the University of Colorado who conduct joint research with the
center on work-management issues. As new associates join the
center, extensions can be quickly added and forwarded to university
offices or other locations without callers ever knowing.
</P>
<P>
   The center began using the service in February and already finds
it indispensable, said the center's director, Robert Levin. Levin
also likes the fact that he is not buying equipment that will
rapidly become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go buy a (phone system) now, I'm stuck with what I just
invested in,'' Levin said. ``But AQS is continually improving the
service, and I'm not paying for the upgrades.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent review, Computer Telephony magazine gave the AQS
service high marks, calling it ``very robust,'' ``very cool'' and
``great for startup companies with employees at multiple locations
or no dedicated office.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Luhmann, the magazine's editor, said he liked the service
so much that he subscribed to it for use at his San Francisco
office.
</P>
<P>
   AQS also markets the service to companies that want a
contingency plan in case their phone system ever fails.
</P>
<P>
   Companies back up their computers, why not their phones? This
unique product, called the CrossPoint PBXParachute, looks to the
outside world exactly like a firm's existing phone system. But in
case of emergency, it forwards all incoming calls to backup
locations, such as home phones, cell phones or satellite offices.

BULLS SEEK THEIR BIGGEST WIN ON THE ROAD
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Bulls will leave the plane and take their first
giant steps of this finals appearance with the trepidation of an
astronaut. There will be excitement, but uncertainty as they plant
themselves on the Delta Center floor in Salt Lake City for Game 1
Wednesday in a land that might as well be another planet this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz has changed, from the climate of its confidence to
the topography of its mind-set. This is not the same Jazz team that
was at first awestruck before stretching Chicago to six games in
last year's National Basketball Association finals. And this is not
the same swaggering Bulls team that typically enters the finals
with all the advantages of the upper crust. They still have Michael
Jordan, but the Jazz holds the home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This has to be unsettling for a Bulls team that was humbled in
surviving a seven-game Eastern Conference final against the Pacers,
an experience that left the defending champions looking as worn as
dust rags. Perhaps there was only one thing that saved the Bulls'
dynasty from extinction Sunday night: home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This most coveted intangible may be the difference between a
sixth title for the Bulls and the dismantling of a gilded
franchise. The Jazz will have the Delta Center and all of its
inspirational decibels on its side for Games 1 and 2. Simply turn
back the calendar a day, listen to the blunt voice of Scottie
Pippen, and understand exactly how vulnerable the Bulls may be
without their home court to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana gave us all we could handle,'' Pippen said moments
after the Bulls grabbed Game 7 from the Pacers at the United Center
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls failed to win a game at Market Square Arena, a place
that has the same feel and hometown flavor as Utah's Delta Center.
In tight towns like these, there is intense loyalty. Usually,
somewhere in a crowd, there is a pocket of respectful cheers for
Jordan. Not so in Indianapolis, not so in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   A home crowd can feed its team, lift it up when it's down. Just
look at how Reggie Miller sprang alive on his sprained ankle with a
little support from his Hoosier friends.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the Bulls lose this valuable asset for the finals? In
the past, the Bulls have been so above the rest of the league that
the other teams looked like ants. They were not above the Jazz in
the regular season. The Jazz and Bulls had identical records
(62-20). But the Jazz won the tie breaker and secured home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs because they swept the Bulls this
season, the only team to do so.
</P>
<P>
   To find the last time the Bulls did not have the home-court
advantage for a final, go back to 1993. That was the year Charles
Barkley and the Phoenix Suns tested them, but a spry Jordan swooped
down to capture the title.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan might be too tired to swoop these days. On two days'
rest, the Bulls will travel and play against the most-rested team
in the history of the league finals. The Jazz will have been
waiting for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are curious to find out how we'll recover,'' Coach Phil
Jackson said. ``Utah runs a great fast break. If we're fatigued,
we'll get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   So extra naps are on the Bulls' schedule. And no junk food. Last
year, a sour slice of pizza left Jordan as green as a surgeon's
gown, although he was able to work his magic at the Delta Center
and suck the life out of the Jazz in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz players say they are mentally stronger now and less
prone to bow down while Jordan whips up a victory. But the Jazz has
to be wary, as well. Home court is only an advantage if you keep
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago can steal one of those first two games,'' Indiana
Coach Larry Bird said. ``I was in a situation once where I had
eight days off. There's no way you can stay in game shape by
sitting around. Chicago could go out there and get one early.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be against the odds, though. The Jazz will likely be
more stoked than stale when Game 1 begins, ready to seize upon the
punch-drunk champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired, but out heart isn't tired,'' Jordan said. ``For a
team that's trying to win for the third time in a row, it's not
uncommon to fight yourself. That's the battle we face now. There
are so many expectations people have for us, and you try to live up
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Bulls can rise above their weariness, if they can
take a game at the Delta Center and swipe the home-court advantage
from the Jazz, this could go down as the greatest achievement of
their supreme era. This would be the ultimate challenge. That's all
Jordan and the Bulls have ever needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting an uphill battle, but we haven't lost our
confidence. Believe me,'' Jordan said. ``No one has ever taken
anything from us. If you look at our record, we've never lost in
the finals.'' &QL;

SHARP CONTRASTS EMERGE IN TWO NEW JERSEY RACES
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's primary elections on Tuesday have
hardly roused much excitement among the voters _ the state expects
a minimal turnout _ but the contestants in the two congressional
races that have attracted the most attention at least give voters a
choice in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fifth District, taking in most of Bergen County and the
state's northern suburbs, Rep. Marge Roukema, the state's senior
member of Congress, is not expected to have too much trouble
surviving a challenge from Assemblyman Scott Garrett, 38, in the
district's Republican contest. Yet Garrett's ardent positions
against abortion and in favor of gun owners' rights are issues that
draw voters on primary days. Ms. Roukema, 68, with 18 years in
Congress, styles herself as a fiscal conservative but is more of a
centrist on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in the Fifth District will run against Mike
Schneider, a former television newsman, who is unopposed for the
Democratic nomination. Besides most of Bergen County, the Fifth
District takes in parts of Passaic and Sussex counties, Garrett's
base.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 12th District, covering the emerging suburbs of
central New Jersey from Princeton in Mercer County up into
Hunterdon County, Rush Holt, a physicist and university
administrator, is the Democratic party favorite, with his name on
the party line on the ballot. He is running against the personal
fortune and aggressive campaign style of Carl Mayer, a former
Princeton Township Council member. The winner will face the
Republican incumbent, Rep. Michael Pappas, who is in his first term
and deemed beatable by the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 49, is emphasizing what he calls ``kitchen table''
concerns like the quality of education and the health of Social
Security. Mayer has loaned more than $600,000 to his campaign and
is running as a maverick outsider championing causes like cutting
electric rates and closing corporate tax loopholes. Those were the
kinds of issues Mayer, 39, cut his teeth on as a young volunteer
for Ralph Nader, and Nader showed his support in a campaign
appearance last month.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the congressional races, there are numerous local and
municipal primary contests. The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8
p.m. in the state's 4,000 polling places. Of New Jersey's 4.5
million registered voters, 25 percent are registered Democrats and
19 percent are registered Republicans, but any unaffiliated voter
may register in either party at the polls on Tuesday and vote in
that party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Britt, director of the Division of Elections, said the state
expected a turnout of just 12 percent.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Cash-Poor Nonprofits Turning to High Tech  
   
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Mission District YMCA in San Francisco is clearly part of the
cyber-savvy 1990s, with eight networked Pentium computers, several
pagers and cell phones, access to a 24-hour tech-support line, and
three Palm Pilots for its top managers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oakland branch of the NAACP, meanwhile, seems to be stuck
somewhere in the late 1980s, with one secondhand computer which
doesn't have e-mail and sometimes simply refuses to open files.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a fairy godmother or godfather out there who can
help us with technology, please tell us,'' pleaded Velma Chavis, a
volunteer and secretary for the Oakland group.
</P>
<P>
   For years, most California nonprofits have had more in common
with the Oakland NAACP than the Mission Y _ cash-strapped, relying
on antiquated, donated computers and unsure whether or how to spend
precious resources on technology.
</P>
<P>
   But that is slowly changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in nonprofits are becoming willing to ask the harder
questions and do longer-range thinking about technology,'' said
Daniel Ben-Horin, executive director of CompuMentor, a San
Francisco group that helps nonprofits take advantage of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the cusp of a turnaround where in the next two or
three years, we'll see nonprofits up there using technology like
everyone else,'' said Florence Green, executive director of the
1,800-member California Association of Nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   California's 45,000 nonprofits, with combined revenues of $60
billion, include a wide range of groups _ everything from giant
health care organizations like Kaiser Permanente to tiny
neighborhood associations.
</P>
<P>
   The state's smaller nonprofits share many technology dilemmas
with small for-profit businesses. When cash flow barely covers the
rent, how can anyone afford to invest in computers?
</P>
<P>
   But experts say small nonprofits also face their own unique set
of technology challenges:
</P>
<P>
   _Foundations traditionally have been reluctant to fund general
operating costs, including computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Standard software often doesn't address the needs of
nonprofits, such as keeping separate accounts for money that comes
in from dozens of different funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   _Nonprofits tend to attract employees who have little technical
background and sometimes may even be technophobes.
</P>
<P>
   _Nonprofits constantly must weigh technology spending against
programs that literally can be a life-or-death matter for clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian Women's Shelter in San Francisco, for instance, has a
fairly inefficient computer system. Its four computers aren't
networked, so staff members carry data from one to another on
floppy disks. And when battered women call the shelter's crisis
line, employees take notes by hand in paper file folders. Someone
retypes that information each quarter into a database to produce
reports for donors.
</P>
<P>
   But officials _ who turn away about half the women seeking
shelter because the facility only has 16 beds _ understandably
don't see computer upgrades as their top budget priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weigh creating a computer database against providing
food, shelter and language services to our clients, our priority
will be for basic needs,'' said Beckie Masaki, director of the
Asian Women's Shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For many small nonprofits, the first question about technology
is: Buy or beg?
</P>
<P>
   Many nonprofits initially entered the computer era by scrounging
for donated secondhand computers and for volunteers to set them up.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious advantage to such an approach is cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach also has big drawbacks: The volunteer who sets
up a database today may be gone in a month, when the program may
crash or need updating. As secondhand computers get older, there's
less software and support available for them. And systems pieced
together from diverse, incompatible parts don't work very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a group will have a dentist on their board who
says, `I know a great programmer,''' said Jan Masaoka, executive
director of the Support Center for Nonprofit Management in San
Francisco. ``The group hires him, since they don't want to cross a
board member. But then it turns out the guy who's a great
programmer for dentists' offices doesn't know anything about
nonprofits.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to such glitches, more nonprofits today are deciding
to invest money in technology systematically.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are even starting to budget money for computer
support and training _ an area that nonprofits traditionally have
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Horin of CompuMentor estimates that nonprofits spend just 5
percent of their technology budget on support and training, far
less than the average of 30 percent at for-profit firms.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are expected to just ``pick up'' the software skills
they need. And network support is commonly left to an untrained
office manager, secretary or whoever shows the slightest interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up with far too many organizations that have the
equipment they need but no capability of using it beyond the first
or low-second gears,'' Ben-Horin said. ``That means a tremendous
productivity loss and tremendous frustration, with people sitting
there every day staring at a computer that isn't doing what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Horin urges nonprofits to shift some of their limited
computer budgets away from hardware and into tech support. ``I'm
talking about an informed choice to stay, perhaps, a bit behind the
cutting edge while reserving funds for planning, training and
support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups, like the San Francisco YMCA, are already making
such informed choices. The Y appointed a task force that spent a
year developing a technology plan. It ended up converting all its
branches to PCs on a network, with a centralized tech-support
department.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, like the Oakland NAACP, are just starting down the
path of technology planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're debating whether we need to go out and invest
in a new computer or wait 'till a fairy godmother comes by and
says, `Here's a Pentium''' said Chavis. ``We're trying to get away
from handouts because there comes a time when that doesn't work
anymore.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   How to Avoid Problems Related to Year 2000  
   
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
There's been a lot of fuss lately about the Year 2000 computer
problem and its potentially devastating effect on big business. But
the glitch could easily trip up small businesses as well _
something most of their proprietors don't seem to realize.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from a shortcut used by computer
programmers in the 1960s and '70s to store only the last two digits
of a year _ ``74'' instead of ``1974,'' for example. It could cause
computers to read January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, which in turn
could bollix accounting, payroll, tax and customer billing records,
inventories and supplier relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a very serious issue,'' said Dan Hill,
director of the Small Business Administration's office of
technology in Washington, D.C. ``Every small business should
address it.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of organizations _ including the SBA,
Microsoft, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a host of
technology-service providers _ that are eager to help. But
businesses must make the first move, by seeking that help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank found that 82 percent
of all small businesses are ``at risk'' for Year 2000-related
problems, yet fewer than a third are taking the matter seriously
enough to act.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses believe the problem can't affect them if
their computers are relatively new and they recently bought
programs off the shelf from established vendors such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that most modern hardware and software come free of
Year 2000 (Y2K) problems. But even these computer systems can
become contaminated, Hill warns, ``if you've modified your software
_ for example by bringing in a file you had before that was not
Y2K-compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 can even derail businesses that don't have computers.
Your cash register may malfunction because its embedded chips won't
recognize the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have no Year 2000 problems of your own, your
business could come to a halt because your suppliers haven't solved
their own problems. A dry-cleaning establishment may find itself
unable to get cleaning solution from a supplier that has shut down
to debug its inventory controls.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an auto-parts distributor, and you've told your
computer that ABC Garage must pay its bill by February 2000, the
computer might conclude that the payment is a century overdue, and
grind out a nasty letter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise every small business to thoroughly assess its
potential exposure to Year 2000 glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've ensured that you are Year 2000-compliant, that fact
can be a selling point among customers. If you guarantee them
hassle-free service into the next century, ``it could make you more
competitive than your rival down the street,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some small businesses have in-house technical staffs that can
cope with Year 2000 problems. But most will have to go to outside
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of useful written material that will help you
determine whether your business might be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has prepared a booklet
entitled ``Are You Ready to Do Business in the Year 2000?'' It
offers a thorough analysis of Year 2000 problems from the small
business viewpoint, discusses remedies and includes a list of 10
Web sites where you can find more details.
</P>
<P>
   The bank prefers that you read that document on its own Web site
at  &LR; www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc,  &LR; because its supply of booklets
is limited and so is its staff time. But if you don't have Web
access try calling (415) 974-2861.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA includes a wealth of useful Year 2000 advice on its Web
site at  &LR; www.sba.gov &LR; . It also provides hotlinks to other expert
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses may discover that the vendor that
installed their computer system has gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Web site will help you pick another firm to lead you
through the Year 2000 maze. The company has compiled a database of
230,000 nationwide _ searchable by ZIP code. Go to
 &LR; www.microsoft.com/ &LR;   &LR; smallbiz,  &LR; and click on ``Find a Technology
Consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Burton, Microsoft's director of small-business programs,
said the list has been thoroughly vetted by his company's staffers.
``We telephoned each one, and made sure they were all interested in
doing this work,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 25 that Microsoft lists within 32 miles of The
Chronicle's building is All Systems Go, of Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are auditing all 250 of our customers for Year 2000,'' said
Renee Courington, the company's president. It costs $1,000 to
$2,000 ``to have every system looked at, every piece of software
analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a computer system is hopelessly outdated, All
Systems suggests buying a new one. More often it recommends hiring
independent programmers to ``make patches.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boeing Co., now the nation's second largest
defense contractor, has vaulted into first place in a defense
industry category that really matters in Washington, D.C.: campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that
Boeing has given more than $1 million to federal campaigns over the
past 17 months, more than any other defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions come at a time when a vastly expanded Boeing _
the company now employs 237,500 people _ faces a myriad of concerns
in Congress, ranging from defense spending to international trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday, Boeing bought three full-page, color ads in Roll
Call, a newspaper widely read in D.C. political circles. One
promoted its role as prime contractor of the international space
station, another touted the alleged successes of acquisition reform
at the Pentagon, and a centerfold pushed the F-22 fighter jet as
``bad news for bullies everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Boeing will join the annual battle to promote normal
trade relations with China _ a country that remains a huge
potential market for commercial aircraft, but that is enmeshed in
bitter controversy in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The annual June debate, always contentious, is complicated this
year by controversies over satellite launches, campaign
contributions and rising nuclear tension in Asia. President Clinton
will make a strong case for renewing trade ties with China, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing campaign spending by Boeing brings increasing
scrutiny for the Seattle-based company. Two reports released Monday
questioned the company's motivations for making large campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Center for Responsive Politics pointed out
that Boeing gave $30,000 to the National Republican Senatorial
Committee and $25,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee on April 30, the same day that the Senate voted to
enlarge NATO to include Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The report argued that the contributions were part of defense
industry campaign to win NATO enlargement so the companies could
sell more military equipment to those countries.
</P>
<P>
   That contention was rejected by Boeing spokesman Douglas
Kennett, who said the company contributed to the two Senate
campaign committees at the end of April because that's when the
committees were holding fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actively support events held by both parties, and that
money was for contribution and attendance at events,'' Kennett
said. ``To try to link that to a specific vote is preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennett said the company did ``actively support NATO
enlargement,'' but ``for all the right reasons,'' which he said
included a peaceful Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Another report, by the Center for Public Integrity, argued that
the nation's aviation interests, including Boeing, have been laxly
regulated because they have given more than $43.8 million to
congressional campaigns since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Integrity's executive director, Charles
Lewis, was chosen Monday for a prestigious ``genius grant'' from
the MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of the aviation industry to fix identified safety
problems, with the tacit consent of Congress, is easily the most
striking discovery of our investigation,'' Lewis said. ``People
have died or been maimed for life because of this inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   That contention was rejected by both Boeing and the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally false,'' said FAA spokesman Hank Price. ``The
link they're making, I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman John Dern said ``the safety of the commercial
transport industry is excellent, and the FAA, as the primary
regulatory body, has a lot to be proud of in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officially has been the second largest defense contractor
since March, when the Pentagon announced that the company had
received $9.6 million in prime military contract work for fiscal
1997. The company had ranked eighth prior to acquiring McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The largest defense contractor is Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign contributions from Boeing, and, prior to the
merger, from McDonnell Douglas, have come in several forms. Since
the start of 1997, the companies have given $534,000 directly to
political campaigns and $349,000 to political parties. Company
employees have given another $121,000 to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   About 63 percent of Boeing's federal contributions this campaign
cycle have gone to Republicans, who control both houses of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, defense contractors have given $2,448,214 to federal
campaigns during the current campaign cycle. About 64 percent of
that money has gone to Republicans.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   From Accounting to Faxing, Software Can Do It All for You  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Personal computers can't run your small business for you. But they
can make it a heck of a lot easier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the right software, you can accomplish just about any task,
from managing your finances to designing a company newsletter to
creating a Web site. It can save you time and money and put you in
control of your business in a way never before possible.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a rundown of software that benefits almost any
small business, along with examples of the most popular programs
available. In each case, the price given is for one copy of the
program designed for a computer running Windows 95, and, in some
cases, Windows NT. Many of the programs also are available for the
Macintosh. If you need more than one copy of a program, check with
the manufacturer. Many companies offer a discount on multiple
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Office Suites
</P>
<P>
   No matter what kind of business you run, you are going to need a
good word processor, a spreadsheet program for crunching numbers
and probably a database for tracking customers and /or inventory.
Fortunately, you can get all these together in what's known as an
office suite.
</P>
<P>
   The top-selling suite, not surprisingly, is Microsoft Office. It
comes in a Professional Edition and a Small Business Edition. The
Professional Edition includes Word and Excel, the most popular word
processor and spreadsheet, as well as Access, a powerful database,
and Outlook, a personal information manager. The suite goes for
$530.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Edition, priced at $470, lacks the database
but includes the Microsoft Publisher desktop publishing program and
Expedia Streets, a program that locates addresses and puts them on
a map.
</P>
<P>
   Other choices are SmartSuite from Lotus and WordPerfect 8 Suite
Professional from Corel. SmartSuite includes a word processor,
spreadsheet, database and personal information manager, and lists
for $400. Corel's suite, which doesn't have a database, costs $302.
</P>
<P>
   You can mix components from different suites, but there is
little point to this. For one thing, it will cost you a lot more to
get individual programs than you will pay for a complete suite
(Microsoft Access lists for $300 when bought separately.) And
programs from one company are not designed for tight integration
with those from another.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop Publishing
</P>
<P>
   No software can save your business as much time and money as a
desktop publishing program. You can design your own newsletters,
brochures, business cards and fliers. In many cases, the materials
you can produce on a good office printer will rival the results you
would get from an outside print shop.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Publisher, mentioned earlier, which sells for under
$100 by itself, is easily the best publishing program in its class.
And for all but the most ambitious jobs, it is every bit as good as
high-end programs used by professional publishers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to produce highly sophisticated material, such as a
book, guide or manual, consider purchasing one of the big boys _
Adobe PageMaker ($550) or QuarkXPress (about $600). Each can handle
full-color publications of any length. But bear in mind that they
are pretty complicated programs, and are not nearly as easy to use
as Publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting
</P>
<P>
   Why hire an accountant when you can get accounting software that
will do the same thing for a lot less money? Two of the best
programs are QuickBooks from Intuit ($100) and Peachtree Accounting
from Peachtree Software ($120). Either can handle payrolls,
invoices, time sheets, accounts payable and receivable _ in short,
most accounting tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The programs do all the math for you, and even let you analyze
your financial picture. And the numbers they generate can be put
into popular tax programs, saving you lots of time come next April.
</P>
<P>
   QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting have ready-to-use forms for
most financial procedures. But you might also consider a
specialized forms program such as Formtool Express from IMSI ($40).
It offers 250 forms that you can customize for your own business.
Another program, OmniForm from Caere ($146), lets you use a scanner
to turn paper forms into electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Faxing
</P>
<P>
   Almost every business these days conducts a lot of its
communications via the fax machine. With fax software, you can use
your PC to send and receive faxes. This can be a time-saver,
especially if your fax machine is constantly busy.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked fax software for some time has been WinFax from
Symantec, which sells for $90. It's easy to use and gives you all
kinds of options for cover pages. You can set it to automatically
answer the phone and receive incoming faxes.
</P>
<P>
   Virus Fighters
</P>
<P>
   What could be worse than your business grinding to a halt
because a virus has laid your computer low? While the chance of
contracting a virus is slim, it never hurts to protect yourself
with a program that can detect all the latest computer bugs and
electronically squash them. Either Norton Anti-Virus or McAfee
VirusScan will do the job. Both of these $45 programs can be set to
scan your system for viruses each time you turn on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a Web Site
</P>
<P>
   More and more small businesses are climbing onto the Internet,
which is becoming a great way to reach potential customers. To
market your business on the Internet, you'll have to create a Web
site. You can have this done professionally, but you can also
create one yourself using the latest Web-authoring tools. Three
easy-to-learn and use programs are Microsoft FrontPage 98
($139.95), Adobe PageMill ($99) and Claris Home Page ($99.95).
</P>
<P>
   Shareware
</P>
<P>
   In addition to software available in retail stores, consider
downloading some first-rate shareware programs to round out your
arsenal. WinZip, from Nico Mak Computing, makes it a snap to
compress and decompress files. Compressed files take up less
storage space, and take less time to send as e-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for anyone who deals with graphics is Paint Shop Pro
from Jasc Software. At $99, it is not the cheapest piece of
shareware, but it is one of the best. You can convert graphics from
one format to another, resize them and adjust their color.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs are available for downloading through
 &LR; www.hotfiles.com &LR;  or  &LR; www.shareware.com. &LR;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Locating Loans to Grow a Company  
   
 By Laura Castaneda  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Small businesses, especially women- and minority-owned firms, are
booming. But finding the money to start and grow a new company,
however, can be a struggle for any entrepreneur.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people typically start their own businesses by borrowing
from family and friends, using their savings and credit cards, or
by taking a home equity or 401(k) loan.
</P>
<P>
   But other financing options are available, including loan
guarantees, traditional bank loans, micro-enterprise loans,
business incubators, angel investors and venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these programs target specific groups of entrepreneurs,
such as women, gays, African Americans, Asians or Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who you are, preparation is the key. You need to know
how to find these programs. And you must have a clean credit record
and a solid business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Take Johnicon George. The 29-year-old opened African Heritage
Books &AMP; Gifts in San Francisco's Bayview Hunter's Point
neighborhood almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was already selling books from home via mail and the Internet
when he sought help from a couple neighborhood nonprofit groups
that assist small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These groups helped George put together a business plan, which
helped him qualify for two loans totaling $20,000 from
Fairfield-based Westamerica Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken me a lot longer to open a store without
the loans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You can start getting help by checking with the Small Business
Administration, a chamber of commerce, or other small business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations can tell you how and where to get training.
They can also point you to local nonprofits or banks that earmark
funds for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a review of your main financing options:
</P>
<P>
   _ SBA Loan Guarantees
</P>
<P>
   The SBA is the best place to start for any would-be
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA's Service Corp of Retired Business Executives (SCORE),
with 65 locations in the Bay Area, offer one-day workshops on how
to start and manage a business.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA's Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) are usually
located in community colleges and provide free consulting and
training to existing small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA's prequalification program helps entrepreneurs
prequalify for loans by linking them with local nonprofits that
help them develop business plans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Most importantly, the SBA is a guarantor of small business
loans, which means the agency will guarantee up to 80 percent of
small business loans of up to $750,000 by banks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The SBA also has special angel investor and venture capital
programs, some of which target women and minorities. (For more
information, see below.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Bank Loans, Credit Lines
</P>
<P>
   Many banks offer small business loans, some of which
specifically target women and minorities. You need a good credit
record and a solid business plan to qualify for a traditional loan.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, bank loans are difficult to get. To qualify for a
loan at Wells Fargo, your business needs to be at least three years
old and profitable, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks also use credit scoring, a computer model that relies
heavily on a credit history analysis. Critics believe banks should
give more weight to outside community support that small
businesses, especially minorities, get from nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   But one bank, Westamerica, does not use credit scoring in its
California Business Loan Program. Its average loan is about $6,000
per person.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for a Westamerica loan, the business must be in a
low- to moderate-income neighborhood. You need to have a low- to
moderate-income, or the business must serve a community need, such
as providing child care.
</P>
<P>
   More banks and credit card companies are also offering credit
lines to small businesses. Unlike loans, which give you money up
front, a credit line lets you draw money as you need it.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one caveat: Credit lines should never be used to pay
for long-term business needs, such as equipment. Instead, they
should be used to solve short-term cash flow shortages, such as
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   _ Micro-enterprise Loans
</P>
<P>
   Micro-enterprise loans are available for businesses with five
employees or less, many of which are created by entrepreneurs as a
way to provide jobs for themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 micro-enterprise loan programs in
California. Loans range from $500 to $25,000, with the average
about $5,000. Many programs target women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   To find a local micro-enterprise program near you, contact your
city offices, a chamber of commerce, the SBA or a local SBDC. You
can also contact the Association for Enterprise Opportunity in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Incubators
</P>
<P>
   Business incubators sometimes have loan programs. But more often
than not, they provide start-up businesses with low-cost office
space, support services and business training.
</P>
<P>
   To get accepted into a business incubator, you generally need
some experience, a bookkeeping/ accounting system, a reasonable
credit history and a willingness to take advantage of the
incubator's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50 business incubators in California, many of
which target women and minorities. To locate one near you, contact
the Pacific Business Incubation Network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Angel Investors
</P>
<P>
   The SBA's ACE-Net, or Angel Capital Electronic Network, helps
high net worth individuals find small businesses to invest in.
</P>
<P>
   The upper limit is $5 million, but most small businesses that
get funding through ACE-Net receive about $1 million. Both start-up
and growing businesses are eligible to apply.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to find angel investors on your own, but you
may want to start by contacting the Bay Area Regional Technology
Alliance to join ACE-Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ Venture Capital
</P>
<P>
   Traditional venture capital is difficult to get because VC firms
are looking for companies that can grow really big, really fast.
Unless you own a high-tech company, this usually excludes small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to research venture capital firms, look for two
books in the library: ``Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources''
and ``Galante's Complete Venture Capital and Private Equity
Directory.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBA also runs the Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC)
program, where small venture capital firms provide a combination of
their own money and SBA-guaranteed funds to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The average amount of money awarded through the SBIC is
$600,000. The SBIC program also has a special program, Small
Specialized Business Investment Companies, or SSBIC, that targets
women and minorities.

   Managers Shuffled at Two Agencies
</P>
<P>
   Two agencies have reorganized top management.
</P>
<P>
   At Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago, part of Havas Advertising, Gary
Epstein, 37, managing partner and new business development
director, was promoted to president. Mary Baglivo, 40, who was
president, was named chief executive. Ms. Baglivo succeeds Ralph
Rydholm, who stepped down in March and is now a consultant to the
agency. Bob Welke continues as chairman and chief creative officer.
Epstein will still oversee new business activities for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   And at DDB Needham Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group in New York,
Ken Kaess, 43, president for U.S. operations, was named to the
additional new position of president for Canada. Darryl Lindberg,
45, president for South America, adds responsibilities in Mexico
and Central America and becomes president for Latin America. And
the agency's European operations were restructured into smaller
divisions for regions like Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   West Wayne Names Chief Creative Officer
</P>
<P>
   West Wayne Inc. in Atlanta has named Luke Sullivan to oversee
its creative output as chief creative officer. Sullivan, 43, a
copywriter at Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis for almost a decade,
assumes responsibilities from Martin Macdonald, vice chairman and
executive creative director, who left in February.
</P>
<P>
   Market Research Sees Revenue Gain
</P>
<P>
   Research marketing revenue rose last year, according to the 25th
annual Honomichl Report to be published next week by the American
Marketing Association. It states that the 50 largest market
research agencies had total revenue in 1997 of $5.5 billion, up 9
percent from 1996. That increase compared with a gain of 7.1
percent in 1996 from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked the top three market research companies as the A.C.
Nielsen Corp. in Stamford, Conn., which had total research revenue
of $1.39 billion, up 2.4 percent from $1.36 billion in 1996;
Cognizant Corp. in Westport, Conn., at $1.33 billion, up 8.6
percent from $1.22 billion, and Information Resources in Chicago,
at $456 million, up 12.3 percent from $405 million.

 How 3 Retailers Fared on the Web   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It seemed like a bad omen for small businesses when Saks Fifth
Avenue gave up on electronic commerce earlier this year. After all,
if a sophisticated retailer like Saks couldn't make money on the
Web, how could more modest merchants?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Blue, a San Francisco men's clothier, provides a more
optimistic model for cyber retailers: While its total online sales
have been relatively small, the site has sold more upscale apparel
in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saks will come back when they realize they made a mistake,''
says Billy Bragman, owner of Billy Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Blue is just one of 700,000 small businesses with some
type of Web presence and one of 70,000 with secure ordering
capability, according to International Data Corp. Thousands more
small companies, defined as those with fewer than 100 employees,
are signing on each month.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of these sites are profitable. As with
large retailers, it is possible for a small business to sink
hundreds or thousands of dollars into a Web site and see little or
no return. For many of the early entrants, profits aren't even
expected until significantly more consumers are spending
considerably more money on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The three Bay Area merchants profiled below have each
established a presence on the Web with some degree of success.
</P>
<P>
   _Billy Blue ( &LR; www.billyblue.com &LR; ) has sold $7,000 worth of Web
merchandise in the last two months, including four horsehide coats
for $695 each and numerous packages of underwear. (By contrast,
Saks sold less than $3,000 of merchandise in a year and a half.)
</P>
<P>
   Billyblue.com has attracted a surprising amount of global
business, including an order for a coat from Belarus (part of the
former Soviet Union) and one for 20 pairs of boxers from Panama.
Bragman made the mistake of promising the Belarus customer free air
shipping before finding out the cost: $190.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all part of the learning process, and that will give
Billyblue.com an edge over Web latecomers, Bragman hopes.
``Ultimately there's so much earning potential that even if I lose
a couple of grand now (on mistakes), it's worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Billyblue.com, which offers 120 items, has gone through three
redesigns since a simple home page launch in 1995 on the Virtual
Village &UR;  &LR; ``shopping mall,'' a Web site that hosts a lot of retail
sites. Bragman estimates costs of the most recent redo, in March,
at $5,000, which includes graphic design, a $1,200 digital camera
and various service fees. The two earlier, simpler versions cost a
total of $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman expects Web volume eventually to top sales at his Geary
Street boutique, which he opened in 1986. But the biggest bonanza
to date came from attracting Netscape founder Marc Andreesen, who
became Billy Blue's best customer after first checking out the
online store.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which is updated with new products each month, is also
an effective advertisement for some existing Billy Blue customers,
who visit Billyblue.com occasionally and come into the store when
they see something they want.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman hopes to place ads for the site on Silicon Valley
corporate intranets, although so far he hasn't found anyone willing
to sell him space.

   ``The first mistake you can make as a retailer is not being on
the Web,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   _Frederick Douglass Designs  &LR; (www.citycom.com/fddesigns/) &LR; , an
African American greeting card company in Berkeley, has also found
an international clientele on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1983 by siblings Margot and Joseph
Dashiell, sells cards through a catalog and about 35 department and
specialty stores in the United States, including a headquarters
showroom on Folger Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a year on the Web, the company has
generated about $10,000 in online sales, including orders from
Brazil, the Netherlands and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the global orders come from U.S. military personnel
stationed overseas, but many others are from people of African
descent living in Europe and South America, said Margot Dashiell.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Douglass Designs has hired part-time help to sift
through hundreds of e-mails received each week that include both
orders and requests for catalogs. By next month, the company hopes
to have secure transaction capability on the site, which should
streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we've done far outweighs the costs we've put into
it,'' said Dashiell. An added benefit are the thousands of new
names and addresses generated for the company's catalog mailing
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dashiells started the site after being approached by
CityOnline, their Emeryville-based Internet service provider, to
work together on an online store. Although they had never even
surfed the Web before, ``We understood this was the kind of real
estate this was too good to pass up,'' said Dashiell.
</P>
<P>
   Startup costs totaled $800 and the company pays a $100 quarterly
service fee for the site.
</P>
<P>
   _Tara Thralls Designs ( &LR; www.tiedyes.com &LR; ) has tapped into the
massive Grateful Dead Web culture with its tie-dyed T-shirts,
spiral-rainbow mousepads and other hippie paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   The site has helped even out the seasonal ebb and flow of the
Point Reyes Station-based business, a small cabin on Highway 1 that
relies heavily on summer and weekend beach traffic.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Web sales can account for 20 percent of the
company's total revenues, said Tara Thralls, who owns the business
and runs it with her two daughters, Star and Patty.
</P>
<P>
   Tiedyes.com has also allowed Thralls to mine the wallets of
Deadheads as far away as Egypt, Australia, Malaysia and Finland.
Since launching the site in 1995, her single largest sale has been
a $5,000 order from a Japanese hippie.
</P>
<P>
   Thralls, who designed and maintains the vividly colored site
herself, has spent about $500 on software and photos, plus an $80
start-up fee and $30 monthly fees to her Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site has paid for itself 10 times over,'' Thralls said.
Sales have slowly picked up since Thralls redesigned the site a
year and a half ago, turning it from a simple home page with two
photos into an extensive site with dozens of pages and hundreds of
links to related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Thralls credits much of Tiedyes.com's success to its
self-explanatory domain name, which makes it easy for Web surfers
to find. ``Tiedye.com'' and ``Tiedyed.com'' were already taken when
she applied for a name three years ago. ``When I saw `Tiedyes.com'
was free, I got chills,'' she said. ``I knew how big the Internet
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thralls relies on Web search engines and word of mouth to
generate traffic to the site. She has registered Tiedyes.com, as
well as common misspellings of the word ``tie dye,'' with major
search engines. She said she plans to register other search words
such as ``hippie'' and ``counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
   When she can afford it, Thralls said, she would like to add the
capacity to handle secure credit card orders and run banner ads on
other sites.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   How Firms Can Keep Pace With Technology  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
When I ran a typesetting business in the 1980s, one of my worries
was figuring out what technology to buy to keep pace with the
changes in the industry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best advice I ever got on that score literally walked in my
front door one day, when a trio of local inventors showed me an
interface that plugged a PC into our typesetting machine.
</P>
<P>
   For a trivial cost, their invention more than doubled the amount
of text our machines could pump out.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that little gadget, our mom-and-pop shop was able to
compete with big type shops nationwide for book and newsletter
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Because most firms can't count on having dream technologies walk
up and grab their lapels, I'd like to suggest some strategies for
small businesses to figure out how to make their operations more
tech-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Stay Accessible: &LR;  Technology and computers are not synonymous.
Many small firms _ especially one-person or home-based businesses _
can get their best payback by investing in phones.
</P>
<P>
   When customers call, they want you now. Answering services,
pagers and cell phones are just the start. Maybe you need a service
that forwards calls from your ``headquarters'' to a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The faster you can handle queries, the happier your customers
will be. And that has to be the first order of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; FREE expert advice: &LR;  If you can't afford to hire a
management-consulting firm, you can still get free advice from
business school students who one day will become high-priced
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Every fall and spring, the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business sends graduate students out to
help businesses with every problem imaginable. Program director
Stephanie Tibbetts said these grad student interns can help small
firms modernize or revamp the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   For details, see her Web site:  &LR; http:/ &LR; 
 &LR; /haas.berkeley.edu/lester/bsg.html &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   California State University at Hayward and San Francisco State
University both offer similar programs. At CSU Hayward, contact Ron
Feldman through e-mail at  &LR; BIZAMERICA &LR; aol.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rich McCline does the matchmaking at S.F. State. He's reachable
by phone at (415) 338-7886 or e-mail at  &LR; rmccline &LR; sfsu.edu. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the cheap-but-not-quite-free category is the Corporation for
Manufacturing Excellence in Fremont. It can help you completely
overhaul your widget-making operations. Call AnnMarie Winslow at
(510) 249-1480 for information.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Your tax dollars at work &LR; : The Small Business Administration
funds six Small Business Development Centers around the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Elza Minor runs the Sunnyvale office at (408) 736-0680). ``We
have consultants who can help with every sort of problem,'' he
said. ``And you can't beat the price _ it's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor's counterpart in Concord is Maurice Williams at (510)
646-5377. The Oakland office, at (510) 893-4114, is run by Faheem
Hameed. Tim Sprinkles is in charge in San Francisco at (415)
561-1890.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pratt runs the Solano office at (707) 864-3382, and
Charles Eason manages Napa's small-business help center at (707)
253-3210.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Trade publications help: &LR;  There is one form of advice that
 &LR; can  &LR; walk in your door. Every trade has its trade publications.
They vary in quality, but all try to show you how technology is
being employed in your line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Attend trade shows and conventions. Having been a business
owner, I know it's easy to say you're too busy or that they're too
expensive. But these trips are probably the best investments you
can make in the future of your business.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, don't they usually hold trade shows in great locales _
where your expenses are iron-clad deductions?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan had just enough energy left on Sunday night to
forklift the Chicago Bulls into yet another National Basketball
Association final. That seemed fitting, since it is hard to imagine
a final without Jordan. It is even harder to imagine rooting
against him in his twilight years, but the seditious thought occurs
that there may actually be more people pulling for his opponents,
the Utah Jazz, an admirable and workmanlike team that lost to the
Bulls in the final round last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have Jordan and the great Scottie Pippen, himself no
spring chicken, and each has five championship rings. The Jazz also
come equipped with a couple of elderly all-stars, Karl ``The
Mailman'' Malone and John Stockton, but unlike Michael and Scottie,
these two have never won a championship. In terms of public
sentiment, Stockton and Malone are thus in much the same position
as John Elway was in January. The Denver quarterback, nearing the
end of an otherwise brilliant career, had never won a Super Bowl.
When he finally prevailed against a favored Green Bay team, there
was a universal feeling that justice had been served.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, this should be an interesting series to
watch, not least because the four future Hall of Famers who will
give the series its emotional content are also disciplined
playmakers of the old school. Jordan, 35, is unquestionably the
greatest player of all time. Pippen, the babe of the bunch at 32,
is superb at both ends of the court. Malone, 34, is still the
game's premier power forward, and Stockton, 35, defines what an
unselfish, slick-passing point guard ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   All four were members of the original Dream Team in 1992, the
first U.S. Olympic squad composed largely of professional players,
which won the gold medal in Barcelona with an average victory
margin of 44 points a game. They are older now, and in a few years
will all be gone. It is nice to have a chance to catch their magic
one more time.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You know you are on new economic terrain when the White House
decides to rush out a pronouncement on Russia on a Sunday, not
because of some impending Russian government action but in hopes of
influencing financial markets to be more inclined to lend money to
the Moscow government.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's efforts to jawbone Russian markets were, at
least initially, no more successful than previous presidents'
efforts to talk up U.S. financial markets in times of crisis.
Panicked investors are not inclined to be reassured by vague
promises of support, such as the White House offered when it said
the United States would back ``additional conditional financial
support from the international financial institutions, as
necessary, to promote stability and structural reform in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important word in Clinton's statement was
``conditional,'' and it points us toward the real game that is
being played here. The president is supporting the current
international policy of delaying a large bailout until there is
evidence of real reform. In plain language, the United States and
the International Monetary Fund want Russia's government to prove
that it can collect revenues even before the badly needed reform of
the tax code makes its way through the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure in the opposition direction _ that is, for a bailout
now _ is coming from the big investors who regret going into Russia
and have driven down the Russian stock and government bond markets.
It is a dangerous and expensive game, but in the absence of a major
collapse, Clinton is right to press for internal reform as a
prerequisite for aid.
</P>
<P>
   All that makes it important for Boris Fyodorov, the country's
new tax czar, to step up collections. That means Russia will have
to operate like a modern state in wringing taxes from the clearly
profitable but politically protected enterprises that have managed
to ignore the tax laws. At the same time he must persuade people
across Russia that the system is being administered fairly. That
will not be easy, particularly given the corruption in the tax
service that Fyodorov spoke of on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful sign for the Russian government on Monday came
in reports that it was talking to a group of foreign financial
institutions, including some from the United States, about an
interim loan. That could help to restore confidence, particularly
if it is clear the money is being provided without any promises of
a bailout from international agencies.

   ``Has everybody got their floors?'' I asked.

   After a moment's silence, a young female voice from the rear
said, ``His or her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg your pardon?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His or her. It's `Has everybody got his or her floors?' Your
pronouns don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And shouldn't it be `his or her floor,' not `floors'?'' a
young man piped up. ``Each of us gets off at only one floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And wouldn't it be better to say `Does everybody have?' rather
than `Has everybody got?''' a third voice chimed in.

   Daniele Di Piazza was walking along upper Park Avenue with her
son, Fabrizio, and his puppy named Squid, who as her name suggests
is as black as ink. A little girl, about 10, beautifully dressed,
accompanied by her father and walking toward them, spotted Squid
and began to jump up and down with excitement.

   Kathleen Dillon heard this one from her eye doctor: An Italian
friend of his was visiting after a long absence from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner, he talked about how impressed he was with the
cleanliness of the city and the quality-of-life campaign. However,
he said he was surprised that the campaign seemed to condone what
appeared to be a burgeoning of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   How had he come to that conclusion? his host asked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he said, everywhere he went there were groups of
well-dressed women idling in doorways smoking.

<P>
   Chalk up one surprising result of the city's anti-smoking

   The woman waiting to board the bus was obviously irritated at
the number of people using the entrance door to get off. As the

indignantly: ``I'm not a tourist,'' he said.

   A former patient told us that although she had moved away years

issues relating to her health.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, she said, she called my father to ask his
advice on a course of treatment that had been recommended by her
regular physician. After hearing my father's views, she asked,
``Dr. Goldin, shouldn't I get a second opinion?''

   Needing a tennis partner, I checked out the clubhouse bulletin
board where the players list themselves only by their first names.
I rang up ``Anita,'' giving her only my first name and, because she
had a young-sounding voice and I didn't want her to be aghast on
seeing my gray hair, added my age. That was OK, Anita said, and
she, too, offered her age.
</P>
<P>
   When she gave me her last name, I mentioned that was the same
name as the college I attended. She had attended it too, she said,
and after a brief pause, asked my last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you, Sara,'' she exclaimed. She gave her name.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that not only had we gone to the same college, but
we had both been part of the college theater group.

   The recent ``Take Your Daughters to Work Day'' reminded James B.
Fishman, a lawyer, of the day some years ago when he took his

most of the day coloring, making photocopies and snacking. For an
hour, she sat with the receptionist.

   &UR; LIPS ARE THE RAGE THESE DAYS &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; By DIANE WHITE &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``My lips are disappearing,'' a friend says, looking in the
mirror. They don't look any different, to me at least. Maybe she
thinks they're disappearing because she's comparing them to
fashion's latest word on lips, i.e., bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   I switched on the TV the other day just in time to hear a makeup
consultant say, ``lips are all over the place this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I tuned in late, I'm not exactly sure what he meant by
this. But lips are everywhere these days, or maybe it just seems
that way because they're so much bigger than they used to be, so
they take up more space. Thumbing through fashion magazines, one
can see page after page of models with huge, puffy, pouting lips.
Sometimes it looks all right, if the lips are in proportion to the
rest of the face. But in some cases the lips dominate every other
feature, so that's all you see _ lips. Many of these models owe
their luscious lip lines to collagen injections. The acting
profession, too, is full of women whose lips, like certain other
portions of their anatomies, appear suspiciously enhanced. Collagen
or not? Calista Flockhart? Maybe. Michelle Pfeiffer? I wouldn't be
surprised. Kirstie Alley? Definitely. Cher? Can there be any doubt?
Even Kathie Lee appears to have stopped talking long enough to let
a cosmetic surgeon plump up her lips. It only takes a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Collagen injections are increasingly popular, according to
statistics compiled by the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery.
But collagen is not forever, which must cause a certain amount of
rejoicing in cosmetic surgery circles. It wears off as it's
absorbed by the body, so the procedure has to be redone
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its plastic-sounding name, collagen is a natural
substance, derived from the skin of cows, so physicians say it's
safe, unless the patient has an allergy to it. The only real danger
would seem to be getting carried away and ending up with the lip
equivalent of a DD-cup.
</P>
<P>
   Looking sexy is, of course, what big lips are all about. ``Thin
lips (or chicken lips) are no longer considered appealing,'' writes
Helen Bransford in ``Welcome to Your Facelift: What to Expect
Before, During and After Cosmetic Surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news _ at least I think it's good news _ is that
there's an even more natural cure than collagen for chicken lips.
Bransford writes: ``Your own fat may be harvested from another
location (like your butt) to protect you from an allergic reaction,
then transplanted into your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the concept of fat harvesting. It sounds so much more
wholesome than liposuction, as if they were going to store it in a
silo or something, in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For those who long for luscious lips yet hesitate to have
cosmetic surgery, help is at hand. The June issue of the SelfCare
catalog, one of my favorite publications, has the Lip Enhancer, a
transparent acrylic vacuum tube. According to the blurb, for only
$40 plus shipping and handling, it ``makes lips attractively fuller
without the expense, pain or risk of collagen injections! Simply
place the mouthpiece around your lips and pull on the cylinder. The
gentle vacuum creates a lovely fullness ... the effect is quite
rejuvenating!''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you go at it too strenuously. ``It is important to be
patient and to follow directions carefully,'' the ad copy warns.
``In the beginning, you may experience slight bruising or reddening
on or around your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure it's worth the risk. But could you get the same effect
by sticking your lips in a vacuum cleaner hose and turning the
thing on full blast? I'm just asking.

``want to raid the surplus.'' Others of us would prefer a six-month

   Investigators want samples of Monica Lewinsky's handwriting,
it's reported. Are they interested in her penmanship or her

GOLDMAN, SACHS NEARS DECISIVE TALKS ON GOING PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The partners of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. are deep in
discussion about how best to structure their storied firm and
whether to open it to public ownership, Jon Corzine, Goldman's
senior partner, told employees Monday morning, executives at the
Wall Street firm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consideration of this complex issue will quickly be coming to
a head'' and ``will be considered by the full partnership,''
Corzine said in a broadcast to employees that was taped, according
to several Goldman executives who heard the tape and relayed what
he had said. ``The guiding principles in this discussion,'' Corzine
continued, are ``what's in the long-term best interests of Goldman,
its mission and its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   While proposals for taking Goldman, Sachs public have come up
several times in years past, the recent rapid pace of change in the
financial-services industry _ in particular, the planned $70
billion combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group, and the rapid
expansion of Goldman's chief competitors, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _ make the current discussion at Goldman
more urgent. Its competitors are able to use their stock to expand
rapidly into new areas of business and into other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to expand has prompted discussion within Goldman,
Sachs over selling the firm's shares, perhaps even linked with a
partnership with another big financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   At Goldman, a firm whose employees are considered the most
disciplined and the most loyal on Wall Street, there is increasing
anxiety about the partnership's ability to hold its own with just
$6.3 billion in capital when its main competitors count their
capital in the tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, disagreements between senior and junior partners
have often derailed proposals for going public. In general,
Goldman's more senior partners, with their much larger shares in
the firm, have tended to favor going public, but the junior
partners _ who have yet to acquire substantial stakes _ are less
willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   But some junior partners and managing directors reached in
recent days say that there is now a stronger chance of a sale of
shares, perhaps as a first step toward a merger or a significant
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to prospects for an initial public offering, a junior
partner, who declined to be identified by name. said, ``An IPO is
not interesting except as a step toward a merger or significant
acquisition. And ``if there is a sale of stock,'' he added, ``it is
likely to involve a minority of the firm, widely expected to be 15
percent or less.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, Goldman's 190 partners gather in Rye Brook, N.Y., in
Westchester County, for their annual meeting, where they will
review an extensive internal report on the firm's current and
proposed financial structure now being prepared by a small internal
team led by Christopher Flowers, a partner who advises financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The time is right to consider these issues now, Corzine told
employees Monday, precisely because the firm is doing so well,
without ``the anxieties of business or leadership stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Goldman made more than $3 billion in profit before
taxes, a record. In this year's first quarter, which ended on Feb.
28, Goldman made $1.02 billion before taxes. As members of a
partnership, Goldman partners settle their taxes individually.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Colleagues say Corzine favors finding a strong consensus on
whether the firm should remain a private partnership of sell itself
in a public offering. Without such a consensus, it is unlikely that
the question of whether to go public would be put to a vote of the
partners, several of the firm's executives said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has in past votes been one of the partners who has
supported the efforts to take Goldman public. But he believes that
without a consensus, the issue should not be put to a vote of the
190 partners at the June meeting, his colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be shocked if we were asked to vote up or down on one
plan for the future at the meeting,'' the junior partner said
Monday. ``But I do think that by June 13 we will know either that
there is the consensus for moving forward in some strategic
direction, or whether people want to leave things as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders who appear to be leaning toward some kind of
stock sale are Henry Paulson Jr., Corzine's co-chairman and
co-chief executive; Roy Zuckerberg, Goldman's longest-serving
partner, who has one of the largest shares in the firm; and Robert
Hurst, a vice chairman, who runs the investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   But there are key leaders who question such a move, asking
whether altering the firm's structure would damage it just as it is
achieving such success. John Thain, the finance director, and John
Thornton, the star of Goldman's European business, who is often
mentioned as a potential future leader of the firm, are in this
group, Goldman executives say.

AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS TO ACQUIRE MONSANTO FOR $34.4 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lead graf to change wording) (sw) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceuticals
industry, American Home Products Corp. announced on Monday that it
would acquire Monsanto Co. for $34.4 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be the nation's top seller of
prescription drugs and a world leader in insecticides and other
agricultural products. The company's name brands also include such
household names as Advil painkiller, Centrum vitamins and Nutra
Sweet sugar substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The deal surprised Wall Street, which had long expected American
Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., to sell its agricultural
business instead of expand it. Yet, by merging with Monsanto,
American Home Products will be able to double its research spending
to $3 billion annually, add several new drugs to its pipeline and
bolster its position in genomics research, a process which uses
genes to develop drug compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking recently and it made sense to put our
companies together,'' said John Stafford, the chairman of American
Home Products. ``We will have a new company with global presence
that can deliver the new (Monsanto drug) products to the market.
We'll be number three or four in the world when it comes to
pharmaceuticals, up from number six.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted coolly to the deal. Shares of American Home
Products crept up 93.75 cents, to $49.50, while Monsanto fell 87.5
cents, to $54.50. Several factors may explain the muted response.
Officials from American Home Products said the acquisition would
dilute the company's earnings by 15 percent the first year and a
lesser amount after that.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies described the deal as a merger of
equals, American Home Products is in effect purchasing Monsanto.
Under the terms, American Home Products will swap 1.15 of its
shares for each Monsanto share and will control 65 percent of the
new company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Home Products appears to be taking control of
Monsanto,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with
Southeast Research Partners. ``But the new board will be divided up
evenly between the two companies. It will be interesting to see how
well the two companies integrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition may have averted a crisis at both companies.
Analysts noted that the deal, which would create a combined company
with $96 billion in market capitalization and $23 billion in sales,
would help American Home Products cover its legal liabilities over
its diet drugs, Redux and Pondimin, one half of the combination
known as fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products recalled the drugs last September at the
request of the Food and Drug Administration, after studies showed
the pills could cause heart damage. A flood of lawsuits from the 6
million people who used the drugs quickly followed, and analysts
now estimate American Home Product's liabilities could be as high
as $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's problems were not quite so dire. The St. Louis-based
company had recently spun off its chemical division to concentrate
on agricultural products and biotechnology. Yet, it had little
chance of fully marketing its wares without merging with a company
like American Home Products, a firm twice its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the new company will be stronger,''
said Dr. Daniel Vasella, president and chairman of the executive
committee of Novartis AG in Basel, Switzerland. ``Strategy is
nothing unless you can implement it properly but I believe they
will succeed in combining the cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts appear to be more confident that the two companies'
portfolios will meld better than than boardrooms. American Home
Products and Monsanto are two of the world's largest sellers of
agricultural products, including Roundup, the world's most popular
herbicide, and namebrand insecticides like Counter and Fastac.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, however, both companies are well anchored
in pharmaceutical and consumer products. Monsanto sells Nutra
Sweet, a popular sugar substitute, as well as Ambien, a leading
treatment for insomnia, marketed through Searle, its pharmaceutical
division.
</P>
<P>
   As with any pharmaceutical acquisition, this one will produce a
deep pipeline. Monsanto has five drugs that should enter final
stage of trials this year, while American Home Products could
launch several top selling drugs within the next several years,
including Embrel, a joint venture with Immunex for rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the deal, both companies were outpaced by their
competitors on research and development spending. American Home
Products spent $1.5 billion on research and development last year,
while Pfizer spent $2 billion and Merck $1.683 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the acquisition is completed, American Home Products and
Monsanto will spend $3 billion annually on research _ $2 billion on
pharmaceuticals and $1 billion on agriculture. The company also
expects to save $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion annually in cost
savings within three years of the deal's closing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the deal also raises some hard questions. The two companies
have different cultures that may clash. For example, the combined
company has yet to be named and the two chief executives, Stafford
at American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro at Monsanto, will run
the company as joint chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be a further ingredient to a corporate turf
battle, the company's top four jobs are divided equally between the
two companies. Robert Blount, a senior executive vice president at
American Home Products, will be the new company's chief financial
officer. Robert Essner, American Home Products executive vice
president, will head the pharmaceuticals business. Monsanto Vice
Chairman Richard U. De Schutter will run the consumer health care
and nutrition division and Hendrik Verfaillie, Monsanto president,
will run the agricultural and animal health businesses.

ERNEST BLOCH, 77, CORPORATE FINANCE EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernest Bloch, an authority on corporate finance who
taught at New York University and wrote widely on economic and
financial affairs, died on May 15 in Tisch Hospital at NYU Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch, a former resident of lower Manhattan, was 77 and lived at
Heritage Hills in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver and kidney failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch wrote a classic work in his field, ``Inside Investment
Banking,'' in 1986 (Irwin). He retired from NYU in 1991 but
continued to teach there part time until four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baden-Baden, Germany, he went to France to get an
education when the Nazis came to power in 1933. He emigrated to the
United States in 1939 and was a staff sergeant in the 10th Armored
Division, interrogating German prisoners of war as Gen. George
Patton's 3rd Army fought its way across France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from City College in 1947 and received a master's
degree at Columbia University in 1949. He received his Ph.D. at the
New School for Social Research in 1962 while working as a research
economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Bloch joined
the NYU faculty that year to teach corporate finance, monetary
policy and money and banking.
</P>
<P>
   The author of many articles on those subjects, he was named the
Charles Gerstenberg professor of finance at the Graduate School of
Business Administration in 1966 and became chairman of the finance
department in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch was a consultant to many private corporations and the Bank
of Japan, and organized an NYU program to train investment banking
executives for Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Leading investment bankers visited his classes as guest
lecturers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch is survived by his wife of 52 years, Amy Weiss Bloch, of
Heritage Hills, and a son, Geoffrey, of Manhattan.

EDITORIAL: A WHITE HOUSE LEGAL DODGE
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   The latest maneuvering by the White House to avoid accelerated
Supreme Court review of its flimsy privilege claims should not
deter the justices from grabbing the case. This is an instance
where the court, in its constitutional role, should see the need to
intervene in the interest of orderly government and the rule of
law. The nation needs a definitive resolution of the issues that
have been raised by the White House to impede the investigation by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to delay the Supreme Court from entering the fray
and to avoid being linked in history with Richard Nixon's Watergate
strategy, President Clinton has dropped his reliance on claims of
executive privilege to protect two aides from testifying about
issues being probed by Starr. But he will continue to impede
Starr's investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky by
pursuing attorney-client privilege as a reason to challenge,
through normal judicial review, some of Starr's efforts to question
Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Supreme Court on Monday, White House
lawyers argued that Clinton's use of the attorney-client privilege
raised no pressing constitutional issues and therefore did not
require the extraordinary step of expedited review. But a
president's refusal to cooperate with a prosecutor's reasonable
requests for information in a legitimate criminal inquiry is itself
a matter of constitutional importance, regardless of the excuses
used to justify the stonewalling.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's remaining claim of attorney-client privilege
is really little more than another executive privilege claim in
disguise, given that the lawyer he is trying to shield is foremost
a political and policy adviser. U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson acknowledged as much when she rejected Clinton's
attorney-client privilege claim regarding Lindsey, applying
essentially the same reasoning that she did in turning down the
claims of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Although Judge Johnson reached the right conclusions, the
Supreme Court could usefully resolve differences between her
reasoning and that used by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a
year ago in rebuffing a similar White House claim that Hillary
Clinton's conversations with government lawyers about personal
Whitewater matters fell under attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the case quickly, the court could cut through the
barrage of privilege claims that have dragged out the investigation
and thus clogged the functioning of the government. Starr's brief
asking for expedited Supreme Court review called the case ``of high
moment,'' and underscored the nation's interest in having it
resolved quickly. Despite the clever White House legal tactics, it
still is.

``GENIUS GRANTS'' GO TO INTERNET INVENTOR, 28 OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four Massachusetts residents _ including the inventor of the
Internet's World Wide Web _ were among the 29 winners of
prestigious ``genius grants'' from the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropy announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Fellowship grants, which range from $220,000 to
$375,000 each, are like the Publishers' Clearinghouse Sweepstakes
for the very smart, given to unsuspecting intellectuals who have
not applied for the money and rarely know they are under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Internet pioneer Timothy Berners-Lee of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Brandeis University religion professor
Bernadette Brooten, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, economist
Nancy Folbre, and Karl Sims of Genetic Arts Inc. in Cambridge
received surprise phone calls last week telling them they had won a
fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a quest for the most extraordinary among us,''
said Daniel Socolow, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.
``People are doing the good things they are doing anyway. This is a
statement to them that, `Congratulations, you're doing a good job.
Keep it up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based philanthropy, with assets of about $4 billion,
uses ``talent scouts'' to find prospective grant recipients in
fields ranging from painting to law to biochemistry. Since the
unusual program began in 1991, the foundation has given away $166
million to fellows, which they can spend as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Only California and New York had more MacArthur Fellows than
Massachusetts this year, foundation officials said, and more than
50 of the 531 past and present grant winners now live in
Massachusetts. ``It's a rich resource up there in the Northeast.
You've got a lot of brainy people,'' said MacArthur spokesman Ted
Hearne.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee, 43 and principal research scientist at MIT's
Laboratory for Computer Science, helped transform the Internet from
a tool for computer experts to the world's most powerful new
information medium. He developed the uniform resource locator
system that allows Internet users to search for documents, and he
set up the first web server to post information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brooten, 47, author of the book ``Love Between Women,'' uses
Biblical texts and other ancient documents to contest church
teaching against homosexuality. Though Biblical-era writing
inveighs against homosexuality, she argues that the texts use
hateful terms and ideas that shouldn't guide the modern church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to persuade the Christian churches to rechannel their
energies away from opposing lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals and
toward preventing the sexual abuse of children and adults,'' said
Brooten.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Folbre, 45, of Montague said she expected to be rejected
for an unrelated grant application when MacArthur Foundation
president Adele Simmons told her she would receive $280,000 over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a hard time talking about it. She had a hard time even
telling me about it'' because she was so surprised, said Folbre's
husband, Bob Dworak, who likened the call from Simmons to a visit
from Ed McMahon of the Publishers' Clearinghouse contest.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur officials said they were impressed with Folbre's
research into the work role of family members and the scarcity of
``caring labor'' to raise children, care for elders, and fill other
non-market jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Sims, 36, of Cambridge won for his work in using computers
to simulate evolution and solve genetic problems. Sims developed
models that show how creatures evolve over time in response to
their environment _ for instance, from a single-cell creature to a
swimming fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sims runs Arts Images, a company that provides software for
special effects in motion pictures. The makers of ``Titanic'' used
Sims' software, which, among other things, can blank out the
background for superimposing images.

LABOR POURS MILLIONS INTO EFFORT TO DEFEAT INITIATIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Facing a roomful of union firefighters,
Mark Bucher admitted he had not expected a warm welcome, and he did
not get one.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single person applauded his introduction. The applause
after his remarks was civil at best. Then a firefighter stood to
rebut Bucher and won a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the authors of the ``paycheck protection'' initiative,
which would require unions to get permission from each member
before spending that member's dues on politics, Bucher has become
an enemy of organized labor throughout California. Opponents claim
the measure's backers want to silence working people and tilt
campaign financing in conservatives' favor.
</P>
<P>
   At first, voters seemed not to care. Only a few months ago,
polls showed strong support among even union households. But that
was before labor poured millions of dollars into its ``Vote No''
campaign and staged a comeback that has surprised even some union
activists.
</P>
<P>
   As voters prepare to go to the polls Tuesday, Proposition 226,
as the measure is formally known, is the one clear toss-up on a
ballot that includes the governorship and an initiative to end
bilingual education. The latest numbers from the San
Francisco-based Field Poll show 47 percent of all voters opposing
Prop 226 and 45 percent supporting it. Voters who are in unions or
who live with union members now oppose it 2 1/2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's woken up all working people, woken up a sleeping giant,''
said Michael Murray, a Los Angeles firefighter and vice president
of his union local. ``People are listening to labor again.''
</P>
<P>
   Union and political leaders will be listening to what
Californians say in the election, too. Both sides say the outcome
could cause a chain reaction in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's opponents say passage would sideline unions
politically and cut deep into Democratic coffers overall, since the
bulk of union campaign contributions go to Democrats. Unions in
California also spent heavily _ and unsuccessfully _ to defeat
ballot measures ending affirmative action and limiting illegal
immigrants' access to services. President Clinton has come out
against Prop 226, as have the three Democratic candidates for
governor in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporations and the people who represent corporations
will have total control if this passes,'' said Joe Chacon, a state
employee who was working the phones for labor over the weekend.
``If unions have no role in the political process, a lot of people
who aren't for the worker will get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, Republican Governor Pete Wilson among them, say
unions have no right to spend members' money on political causes
that members may not endorse, and that requiring a member's
approval each year would restore fairness to the process. Bucher
scoffs at labor's stand, saying Prop 226 would in fact give voice
to union members who disagree with union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should be coerced under pressure of losing his job to
give money to a cause he doesn't believe in,'' Bucher said, adding
that ``labor was 4-1 in favor of us at the start. Their support is
still significant, but it certainly isn't what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   That, political observers say, is in large part due to the $20
million labor has poured into defeating the measure. The money has
gone toward TV ads featuring union members, phone banks run by
union members and direct mail sent by union members. Hundreds of
union members have also gone door-to-door to talk to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, as Bucher noted, is that unions are both outspending
business interests and spending union members' money to defeat a
measure intended to give them say in how their union dues are
spent. The ``Vote Yes on 226'' campaign has spent about $3 million
making its pitch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `No' side has hit chords that resonate with voters: that
this will steal the voice of working people,'' said Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University.
``That is powerful rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, union members and union leaders speak of their
fears that Prop 226 would lead to privatization of Medicare and
Medicaid. They also worry that the disparity between what business
and labor spend on politics would become even greater if union
members could easily withhold the political portion of their dues.
</P>
<P>
   According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in
Washington, D.C., 93 percent of the $58 million labor contributed
nationwide during the 1995-96 election cycle went to Democrats.
Business spent $653 million, with 60 percent of it going to
Republicans. Those totals have led to a slogan of sorts among Prop
226 opponents: Business outspends labor 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure is misleading, since the business total includes
contributions by trade groups such as the American Medical
Association and by individuals who may have donated money for
ideological rather than economic reasons. Glenn Ellmers, director
of research at the nonpartisan Claremont Institute, said a more
realistic ratio would be one the Federal Election Commission
reached using only corporate PAC and union PAC expenditures. That
study showed business outspending labor by about 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Prop 226 would ``wipe unions off the planet,'' said
Andrea Adlemanof the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. ``It
would have the effect of shutting us up.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kim Jacobsma, who teaches American government to high
school students, sees it, his union wants to silence him. Unhappy
with union spending on non-union issues, he became what is known as
an ``agency fee payer'' in the California Teachers Association,
meaning that he pays union dues, minus the 30 percent normally used
for politics, but has far fewer rights than a union member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union talks about being a democratic organization, but
it's pretty much a dictatorship of a few,'' he said. ``They're
spending members' money doing things they have no business being
involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Tuesday's outcome, it is certain to be challenged
in court. Still, Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, the frontrunner
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said Prop 226 has
promoted the greatest mobilization of labor since California
considered right-to-work legislation in 1958.

THE BET: STRATEGY AS INTRICATE AS A DOUBLE HELIX
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AHP-MONSANTO, AHP-DEAL) 
 (sw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ask Hendrik Verfaillie, president of the Monsanto Co.,
about the benefits likely to emerge from the announcement on Monday
of Monsanto's proposed merger with the American Home Products
Corp., and he turns the clock back four years.
</P>
<P>
   That was when executives in the agricultural chemicals
operations of Monsanto and the American Cyanamid Co. talked about
co-developing crops capable of surviving sprays of their competing
herbicides but could not agree on how to split costs and profits of
such an arrangement. The talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the acquisition by American Home Products of
Cyanamid's agribusiness last year, such roadblocks will not exist
if the deal announced on Monday is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most exciting part for me,'' said Verfaillie, who
will head the combined agricultural operations of the merged
company from St. Louis, where Monsanto is based.
</P>
<P>
   New products that can attract premium prices from farmers, the
faster development of drugs using biotechnology, crops designed to
yield healthier food _ these are among the visions driving the
Monsanto-American Home Products merger.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them all, as Verfaillie's anecdote highlights, is the
realization that even big businesses such as Monsanto are having a
hard time keeping up with the opportunities and challenges erupting
from biotechnology research around the world as scientists unlock
the secrets of genes _ the basic building blocks of all life. The
breakthroughs could lead not only to huge new markets,
environmental benefits and more plentiful food around the world,
but also, if mismanaged, to ecological disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has been among the world leaders in the race to create
``life science'' companies, enterprises driven by the assumption
that food, drugs and a wide variety of industrial and energy
products in the next century will be based on understanding how
genes are structured and how they perform their functions.
</P>
<P>
   It began investing heavily in research two decades ago, built
the broadest commercial portfolio of genetically engineered
agricultural products and continuously searched for alliances that
would help it extend the fast-developing science not just through
the food chain but into its pharmaceutical business. Not seeing how
its traditional chemical businesses could fit in, Monsanto
unsentimentally spun them off into Solutia Inc., now an independent
public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsanto has to be given an A-plus-plus for execution of the
biotech vision,'' said Sano Shimoda, who follows biotechnology's
impact on agriculture for Bioscience Securities in Orinda, Calif.
``They've recognized that you can't study things to death.''
</P>
<P>
   But each new investment _ the most recent was a decision last
month to spend $4.1 billion for full control of two leading seed
companies, the DeKalb Genetics Corp. and the Delta and Pine Land
Co. _ has eaten into Monsanto's near-term earnings outlook and
raised anew the questions of how Monsanto could compete with
deep-pocketed giants like E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Novartis A.G.
of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Monsanto's stock price has been defying the
laws of gravity,'' Shimoda said. ``The earnings have been getting
worse and worse as they continued investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Robert Shapiro, Monsanto's chairman and chief
executive, had repeatedly conceded that G.D. Searle, Monsanto's
pharmaceutical arm, was too small to execute the pharmaceutical end
of the biotechnology vision on its own. Researchers have been
doubling the amount of information about genes and how they operate
every 18 to 24 months, an expansion far too rapid for Monsanto to
exploit on its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Shapiro was more willing to sell Monsanto than to
step back from his vision of where science was driving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows investors how we are going to be able to turn the
pipeline into earnings,'' Shapiro said in a joint interview with
John Stafford, with whom he will be co-chief executive of the
company, as yet unnamed, that will be created by the merger with
American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal made sense from a research point of view.
The resulting company's $3 billion budget will be major league by
any standard. With two-thirds of it concentrated on drugs, that
spending is focused on the area where Wall Street sees more
short-term promise than in agriculture. And American Home's
biotechnology resources, including the ownership of the Genetics
Institute, are strongest exactly where Monsanto has been weakest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts who have followed Monsanto wondered why the
company had not found a higher-profile partner than American Home.
Shapiro had certainly made it clear to every potential buyer that
he was open to suggestions. But other life sciences leaders seem to
have decided that Monsanto is no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not by chance that this was the deal announced,'' Dr.
Daniel Vasella, president of Novartis, said, declining an
invitation to express any interest Novartis might have in topping
American Home's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some farm groups, concerned with public acceptance of
genetically altered crops and other products of biotechnology, said
that merging Monsanto's expertise with American Home's experience
marketing over-the-counter products like Advil and Chapstick might
be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always concerned about further consolidation of
suppliers, but, if anything, it's a positive that Monsanto is
aligning with a consumer-oriented company,'' said Mace Thornton, a
spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents
more than four million farmers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some analysts questioned whether the merged
company might be seen as less focused than Novartis and the
alliance of DuPont and Pioneer HiBred International, the largest
seed company. They also questioned Monsanto's agreeing to sell
itself while it is busy completing its recent seed company
acquisitions and starting a joint venture to create and market
agricultural products with Cargill Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing surprised me,'' said Bonnie Wittenburg, who follows
agribusiness for George K. Baum &AMP; Company in Minneapolis.
``Monsanto could lose some good people.''

MILTON HINDUS, 81, SCHOLAR OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor Milton Hindus, a scholar of American and European
literature and the last of Brandeis University's original faculty,
died on Thursday when he collapsed outside the main entrance to the
campus in Waltham, Mass. He was 81 and lived in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus suffered a heart attack after leaving Goldfarb Library,
where he had continued to work since retiring from teaching in
1981, Brandeis reported.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Hindus was teaching at the University of
Chicago when he was recruited as one of Brandeis' 13 original
faculty members when the university opened in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He devoted much of his time in recent years to the work of
Charles Reznikoff, a Brooklyn-born poet and editor (1894-1976).
Hindus wrote ``Charles Reznikoff: Man and Poet'' (1984), and
``Charles Reznikoff: A Critical Essay'' (1977), and was working on
``The Collected Letters of Charles Reznikoff'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Celine: The Crippled Giant'' (1950), a critical
biography of the French writer Louis Ferdinand Celine, which was
reissued as a paperback in 1997. He also wrote ``The Proustian
Vision'' (1954), ``A Reader's Guide to Marcel Proust'' (1962), and
``F. Scott Fitzgerald: An Introduction and Interpretation'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``Leaves of Grass: One Hundred Years
Later'' (1955), which remains in print and earned him the Walt
Whitman Prize of the Poetry Society of America. He also edited
``Walt Whitman'' for the Critical Heritage Series (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Also among his 16 books were ``The Jewish East Side: 1881-1924''
(1995), and ``A World at Twilight: A Portrait of East European
Jewry on the Eve of the Holocaust'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in 1936 from City College, where he earned a master
of arts degree in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1946,
he did postgraduate work at Columbia University and lectured at
Hunter College and the New School for Social Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus is survived by his wife of 55 years, Eva Tenenbaum
Hindus, and a daughter, Myra Hindus, of Jamaica Plain, Mass.

 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bob Costas pursued NBC's original plan, he would be
completing his eighth season of National Basketball Association
play-by-play. But he chose to be host of the studio show for seven
years, deferring to Marv Albert to call games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Costas is wrapping up his first season of play-by-play in
18 years, and he confesses to preferring calling games to being the
studio host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry about the way it happened,'' he said Monday from St.
Louis, referring to Albert's legal woes. ``But it's much more fun
doing play-by-play. You feel so much more a part of the league and
the games, and it involves more. It's more like an orchestra; there
are more elements to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   On being hermetically sealed in NBC's New York studio, Costas
said, ``I missed sitting and talking to sports people, to people in
the lobby, in the coffee shop, picking up tidbits, being at the
shoot-arounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The NBA studio wasn't the challenge this is. It was
important, but it didn't have as many variations to it and
possibilities of surprise as the games have. I'd gotten so used to
doing the studio, and I was such a fan of Marv's, that I never
thought of doing games.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas' transition from the studio to the game has not been
easy. He had to shake off years of rust _ he last called games
regularly for the Bulls on WGN-TV in 1980 _ and tutor the rookie
analyst Isiah Thomas. The late-season hiring of Doug Collins made
everyone's job easier.
</P>
<P>
   And just when Costas was truly getting into a groove, narrating
the excitement of the Indiana-Chicago series, a leap by Dennis
Rodman onto the broadcasting table nearly turned Costas into a
former broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he kept going, pile-driving into me, I could have been
hurt, but I bounced off him,'' he said. ``For two seconds, I
wondered, `Am I hurt?' I did an inventory of my parts. Some people
thought he did it on purpose, but if he has that much body control,
he ought to join Ringling Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas' style is different from Albert's. He offers no trademark
phrases or exclamations. The timbre of his voice is different,
presenting no staccato accompaniment to the action. Once Costas was
comfortable, he offered a more conventional game call, combined
with touches of his humor and the tangible results of his
preparation. His style is to be complete, not idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   Costas usually excels when he sums up a game or an event. With
8.9 seconds left Sunday in Game 7 of the Indiana-Chicago series,
and Chicago up 87-83, he said: ``If the Pacers go here, they have
not gone quietly. It appears the Bulls will survive the Pacers. But
what Michael Jordan termed `a bump in the road' was anything but.
It was a mountain to climb, and they barely reached the summit, if
in fact they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he quickly noted the Pacers' profound shortfall of
offensive rebounds as a reason for the loss, but explained that
part of the Bulls' huge lead in the category was due to the Pacers'
good shooting. That point is often lost in statistic-babble: if you
shoot well, you don't get many offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   What also stood out was Costas' broadcast-ending comment that
credited Indiana for taking the Bulls to the limit. ``What they
did,'' he said, ``was for Mel Daniels and the late Roger Brown,
Freddie Lewis, Bob Netolicky and George McGinnis'' _ former Pacers,
two of whom played for the American Basketball Association and the
NBA _ ``with a brown ball or a red-white-and-blue ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In post-game interviews Sunday, Jim Gray's interview with
Indiana Coach Larry Bird, and Toni Kukoc's chat with Costas,
Collins and Thomas, both featured questions that focused on the
game. Yet not one of Ahmad ``I Just Spoke to Michael Jordan''
Rashad's questions to Jordan showed he had watched the game or had
taken notes. When will NBC realize that no matter how close Rashad
is to Jordan, he is doing a disservice to viewers by not asking
pertinent questions of Jordan (or anyone else) in the short time
available in the post-game frenzy?
</P>
<P>
   UECKER'S NBC FAREWELL: Bob Uecker will not return to call NBC's
baseball schedule _ all postseason except for alternating All-Star
Games with Fox _ alongside Costas and Joe Morgan. He needs surgery
on his ailing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a neurosurgeon, and he told me it's deterioration
from my playing, or my sitting, days,'' he said. ``It's not life
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, the NBC Sports president, said, ``If it's
neurosurgery for Uecker, it's not life threatening.'' Ebersol said
he tried for three months to persuade Uecker, 63, to return, but
Uecker doubts he will. He's content with being the radio voice of
the Milwaukee Brewers. Said Uecker, the sometime actor, ``I'll just
kick back and wait for my Oscar to come in from `Major League 3.'''
</P>
<P>
   RATINGS ROOUNDUP: Game 7 of the Bulls-Pacers series generated an
enormous 20.8 overnight Nielsen rating, and could become the
highest-rated nonfinals game ever. The Indiana market rated a
whopping 50.2, with Chicago at a 43.8. ... Fox's Detroit-Dallas
National Hockey League telecast Sunday produced a 2.5 overnight
rating, up from a 1.6 last week, but down from a 3.1 on the
comparable Sunday last year. Still, a 2.5 was Fox's best hockey
rating this season since a 3.1 for the All-Star Game. ... Fox's
first major-league baseball telecasts of the season _ including the
Red Sox-Yankees game Saturday _ chimed in with a national 3.1
rating, up from 3.0 a year ago.

MARY GRENANDER, PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH AND EXPERT ON BIERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of
English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce,
known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her
sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Grenander, known as M.E. Grenander, taught at the
State University of New York at Albany from 1948 until she retired
in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English. She was a
former president of the New York American Studies Association.
</P>
<P>
   Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to
Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared over more than two decades.
Analyzing ironic horror stories he wrote, she once said: ``The
actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to
be harmless and reacting accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ``Poems of
Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal
American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ``a provocative volume''
that ``should spark further interest in Bierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants
from institutions including the National Endowment for the
Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the
Rockefeller Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000
to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James
Corbett, a professor of physics at the same university, who died in
1994. Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations
said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ``through
long-term investments in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and
master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English, from the
University of Chicago, in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce. She married
Professor Corbett in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sisters, Charlotte White, of Puyallup,
Wash., and Karen Hanley, of Miami, Fla.

COMMENTARY: A SOLDIER OF CHRIST ON THE MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When visited Monday in his corner office at the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, William Donohue was
not burning books. He was not chopping up reels of film into
celluloid guitar picks. He was not tossing videocassettes into the
trash can.
</P>
<P>
   That is because he is not a censor, no matter what some may say,
Donohue said. All he does as president of the Catholic League, he
said, is raise warning flags whenever he believes someone has gone
over the top in ridiculing Christian dogma or the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   He just happens to be a particularly vigorous flag waver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in moral suasion,'' Donohue said at his normal
decibel level, which is high. ``I believe in whipping up public
sentiment to isolate the offender. I believe in putting on a lot of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly has tried to do that in his latest crusade: to get
the Manhattan Theater Club to cancel Terrence McNally's new play,
``Corpus Christi,'' which was planned for the fall. A recent draft
shows that it is about a Jesus-like figure who has sex with his
apostles and is crucified as ``king of the queers.''
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder if the Catholic League was offended? Of course,
it protested.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody went much further and threatened to bomb the theater
club, which caved in and dropped the play, until it came to its
senses on how to deal with would-be terrorists. It canceled its
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, it got no argument from Donohue. If the police
find ``the lunatic'' behind the bomb threat, ``they should put him
in prison for a very long time,'' he said at the league's offices
at First Avenue and East 56th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not shake his conviction that ``Corpus Christi'' is
an ``immoral'' play unworthy of being performed and that the
Manhattan Theater Club is not entitled to its federal, state and
local government subsidies. It is one thing for a fully private
group to produce such a work, he said, but ``nobody has a right to
the public purse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's wrong to take public monies to promote my religion,
then it's wrong to take public monies to bash my religion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That goes to the heart of what Donohue has been about in the
five years he has led the Catholic League, whose symbol is a sword
and shield. He is convinced that ``anti-Catholicism is the last
respectable bias'' among those who view themselves as models of
enlightenment. Utter a word remotely offensive to Jews, blacks,
women or gays? Heaven forbid. Yet some of those same people do not
blink before mocking the Church or Jesus or Catholic sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Donohue said, ``a play called `Shylock and Sambo,'
about gay Jewish slave masters who sodomize their obsequious black
slaves.'' You would not even have to protest a work like that, he
said. Its offensiveness to certain groups would be obvious. No
theater troupe would produce it in the first place, not in this
city anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Catholics, he asked, deserve the same consideration?
Instead, his league has tracked one example after another of
artists and writers depicting priests as pedophiles, nuns as
sex-crazed witches and the pope as a man having sex with
prostitutes. Let's not even get into images of Jesus on a cross of
penises or Mary in a G-string.
</P>
<P>
   For protesting such outrages, and aggressively, Donohue has
received death threats of his own. At a minimum, he is branded in
some circles as an enemy of free expression. Even among largely
sympathetic Catholics, there are those who wish he would soften his
style.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue replies that Catholics are the aggrieved ones,
especially ``Catholics like myself who openly proclaim the virtues
of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the McNally play, he said: ``A lot of people in the
gay and the artistic community hate with a passion the Catholic
Church, and they don't want to admit to bigotry. Bigotry is
something in their mind which the Archie Bunkers of this world
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   If this play turns out not to be offensive, ``I'll be the first
guy to say I was wrong,'' Donohue said. He paused before adding:
``But I would be very, very surprised if in fact I'm going to have
to make such a statement. No, I think this is an in-your-face,
stick-it-to-Catholics play. They know exactly what they're doing.
And they wouldn't do it to any other segment of society.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, avoiding a showdown in the
Supreme Court, sidestepped a fight Monday over executive privilege
to prevent two White House aides from testifying in independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation of the Monica S. Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White House lawyers will prolong their battle with
Starr by pursuing Clinton's claim that his conversations with
deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey are shielded from Starr's inquiry
by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House move, laid out in a Supreme Court motion, was
seen as having stymied Starr's request last week that the justices
make a rare, urgent ruling in the dispute over testimony by
presidential aides.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the executive privilege appeal, White House lawyers
said there was no reason for the Supreme Court to act before its
upcoming summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the nation will not hang in the balance,'' the
White House asserted in its Supreme Court motion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest White House strategy was seen as possibly sparing
Clinton the embarrassment of oral arguments before the Supreme
Court that might prompt comparisons between him and President
Richard M. Nixon's effort not to disclose Watergate tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, apparently anticipating the White House move, indirectly
criticized Clinton's lawyers in a speech to a county bar
association in Charlotte, N.C. He said defense lawyers ``have a
duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied under oath about his
relationship with Lewinsky or obstructed justice by trying to cover
up an alleged affair. Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied having
a relationship under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good lawyer ... must urge the client against steps that are
likely to impede the quest for truth,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff offered what he described
as a ``polite'' version of his reaction to Starr's criticism. ``I'm
surprised that a lawyer of Mr. Starr's distinction would suggest
that because one of his colleagues in the bar disagrees with him on
law, principle, and process, it means the colleague is somehow
engaged in an act of obstruction,'' Ruff said. ``I'm sure he would
understand that lawyers of good heart and good will disagree, and
simply because he says something is a matter of law does not make
it so.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has until this evening to respond to the White House
motion. The Supreme Court could announce by Thursday whether it
will hear the case and bypass the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   On a related front, the Justice Department filed notice that it
will appeal a federal judge's ruling last month that requires
Secret Service agents to testify about what they might know of
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official refused to comment on the matter
because the case is under seal. But with the appeal, department
lawyers will pursue their argument that a president's life could be
in jeopardy if he distances himself from agents out of fear they
might tell a grand jury what they see and hear on the job. US
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson recently rejected that
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuverings Monday stemmed from several recent
decisions by Johnson, including her ruling that Lindsey and
presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal must answer questions before
the grand jury. They had refused, citing Clinton's claim of
executive privilege and attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, by abandoning the executive privilege claim,
effectively yielded to Johnson's decision that Blumenthal testify.
A former journalist, Blumenthal is more a political adviser to
Clinton than a legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Starr continued to express frustration about his standoff
with Clinton and his legal team. In his speech, he argued that
courts already have concluded that government lawyers paid by
taxpayers do not have special privileges in criminal cases
involving public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said, ``Litigants often try, as they're entitled to do, to
concoct new privileges by contending that their relationship is
just as important as attorney-client relationship or the spousal
relationship or the priest-penitent relationship. But the problem
is, they're arguing in the wrong forum ... Congress is the proper
forum for new federal privileges to be recognized in federal grand
jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff countered that federal courts in Washington have
consistently upheld the president's right to invoke attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied that the latest strategy was aimed at frustrating
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will undoubtedly be folks out there who will suggest
there must be some great scheme to delay,'' Ruff said. ``That's
just nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Clinton's lawyers tried to block Starr's
request for an urgent ruling on attorney-client privilege by
arguing the Supreme Court has issued such decisions only in cases
of special national interest, such as Watergate, President Dwight
D. Eisenhower's seizure of the nation's steel mills during the
Korean War, and the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,''
Ruff said in a news briefing. ``This is not steel seizure, this is
not Iranian hostages, this is not US v. Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in making its stand on the attorney-client
privilege, was seen as choosing to defend a principle more
palatable to mainstream Americans than executive privilege, which
is available only to the president and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the White House asked the Supreme Court to shield
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton from having to hand over notes of
her conversations with presidential lawyers to Starr. The high
court, in a one-line order, refused to hear the White House claim
of secrecy because of attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several analysts said the White House had clearly made a
political calculation in retreating from the executive privilege
question, which the Supreme Court last weighed in the Watergate
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently their first concern was trying to get out from
under executive privilege,'' said John Q. Barrett, a criminal law
professor at St. John's University School of Law and former
associate counsel to the Iran-Contra special prosecutor, Lawrence
E. Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the prospect of losing a Supreme Court decision
over executive privilege, in the summer's heat, and with its
attendant parallels to Watergate, ``was not in the president's best
interest. It just has too much of a Nixon echo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 against Nixon,
ordering him to surrender the Watergate tapes and precipitating his
resignation in August. Independent counsel Leon Jaworski had asked
the court the previous May for an expedited ruling in his executive
privilege battle with Nixon over the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said concerns
about comparisons to Watergate did not affect Monday's decision
regarding executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion was a good one,'' he said about the White House
decision, ``and the law is the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff added: ``Whatever black cloud of history others may be
casting over this exercise, it hasn't affected us.''

Korean War, and the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,''
Ruff said in a news briefing. ``This is not steel seizure, this is
not Iranian hostages, this is not US v. Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in making its stand on the attorney-client
privilege, was seen as choosing to defend a principle more
palatable to mainstream Americans than executive privilege, which
is available only to the president and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the White House asked the Supreme Court to shield
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton from having to hand over notes of
her conversations with presidential lawyers to Starr. The high
court, in a one-line order, refused to hear the White House claim
of secrecy because of attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several analysts said the White House had clearly made a
political calculation in retreating from the executive privilege
question, which the Supreme Court last weighed in the Watergate
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently their first concern was trying to get out from
under executive privilege,'' said John Q. Barrett, a criminal law
professor at St. John's University School of Law and former
associate counsel to the Iran-Contra special prosecutor, Lawrence
E. Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the prospect of losing a Supreme Court decision
over executive privilege, in the summer's heat, and with its
attendant parallels to Watergate, ``was not in the president's best
interest. It just has too much of a Nixon echo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 against Nixon,
ordering him to surrender the Watergate tapes and precipitating his
resignation in August. Independent counsel Leon Jaworski had asked
the court the previous May for an expedited ruling in his executive
privilege battle with Nixon over the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said concerns
about comparisons to Watergate did not affect Monday's decision
regarding executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion was a good one,'' he said about the White House
decision, ``and the law is the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff added: ``Whatever black cloud of history others may be
casting over this exercise, it hasn't affected us.''

LOOKING PAST FRANCE TO PROJECT 2010 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Fla.)   (ja)  
 By JACK BELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation,
caused a bit of a stir last week when he said he did not expect the
United States national team to advance past the first round of the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg's comments came during a news conference to announce
the ambitious Player Development Opportunity as part of the
federation's Project 2010.
</P>
<P>
   That's 2010, as in the year the United States would (hopes to,
expects to) win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The objective, Rothenberg said, is to identify and then train
players at a younger age, providing the educational and financial
support that will get the best players to skip college (even leave
high school) to play professionally. With financial backing of more
than $50 million from Nike and the International Management Group,
the federation hopes to house up to 120 players full time in the
under-17 group, initially, at the Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Developing soccer players in the United States has always been a
bit serendipitous, and there are no guarantees of world-class
talent emerging even though millions of children are playing the
game.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, unlike the rest of the world, the best athletes in
America are far more interested in the big-money sports, like
basketball, baseball and football. Around the world, the biggest,
strongest and fastest athletes in most countries play soccer first.
Not here. Too much competition from other sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the world, soccer is to the poor and working
classes what basketball is to minority youths in this country _ a
relatively inexpensive sport that offers a chance, albeit remote,
at stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere out there we've got a 9-year-old Ronaldo, and we've
got to find him,'' Rothenberg said. That 9-year-old Ronaldo might
be out there, but he might not want to devote himself to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The players on the U.S. team going to France for the World Cup
finals are world-class soccer players, but how many have been
developed in the current system?
</P>
<P>
   World Cup
</P>
<P>
   Much was written the past couple of weeks about the
naturalization of David Regis, a Frenchman who plays in Germany,
married an American and is now going to play for the United States
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of two Brazilians. Wagner Lopes is now a
Japanese citizen and will play for Japan in France. Jose Clayton
last week was declared a citizen of Tunisia after government
officials there waived the five-year residency rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about Tunisian football,'' Clayton told
Reuters. ``But my agent said `It's like Brazil: the beach and
sun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Crisis Time I: Coach Bora Milutinovic and Nigeria. The Nigerians
were beaten by Yugoslavia, 3-0, on Friday, but more important, the
team that some people believe could do well in France will have to
play with a second-string goalie. Nigeria's starter, veteran Peter
Rufai, is hurt and is not expected to play. His replacement,
Abiodun Baruwa, looked unpolished and played poorly against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis Time II: Mexico. The perennial regional power again looks
as if it is about to fall flat in the World Cup finals. Last week,
Mexico lost 4-1 to the German Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The loss
comes on the heels of a 5-2 drubbing by Norway. One Mexican
newspaper, Reforma, called the exhibition against Wolfsburg
``pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Bartlett, a former player for the MetroStars, was named to
the South African roster for the finals. All 32 teams must submit
their final 22-man rosters for the finals to FIFA Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
   Four Los Angeles Galaxy players have scored more goals (29) than
all except one _ D.C. United _ of the other Major League Soccer
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Welton leads the league in scoring with 10 goals and six assists
for 26 points. Second on the list is Cobi Jones with 8 goals and
seven assists. Mauricio Cienfuegos has six goals and four assists
and Martin Machon has five goals and five assists. On Saturday, Los
Angeles lost its first game at home, 2-1, in the shootout to
Chicago. The Galaxy also lost for the first time in 27 games after
leading at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver on Sunday, Ross Paule scored the two fastest goals by
one player in the league's three-year history as Colorado beat
Kansas City, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Paule scored in the fifth and sixth minutes to break the record
of two goals in a two-minute span held by three players. Paule
netted the first goal from 18 yards out on a chip shot and he put
home the rebound of a shot by Jason Boyce one minute later.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' shootout victory against New England on Sunday
was the first time the MetroStars have won at Foxboro Stadium in
three attempts. It's also only the second time in team history that
the MetroStars have been over the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from the league, the number of shootouts
this season is down slightly. In 66 games so far, there have been
shootouts (12 in all) in 18.2 percent of the matches. That compares
with 33 shootouts, representing 20.6 percent of matches, in 1997
and 34 shootouts, accounting for 21.2 percent of the matches, in
1996.

   Mia Hamm will become the first member of the U.S. women's
national team to put fingers to the keyboard when her book, ``Go

(HarperCollins) is published next May in advance of the 1999
Women's World Cup in the United States. ... FIFA has voted to add
six new members: Palestine, Mongolia, Eritrea, the Turks and Caicos
islands, the United States Virgin Islands and American Samoa. ...
Diego Maradona's incredible end-to-end dash for a goal for
Argentina against England in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico was voted
the greatest goal in the sport's history by the English magazine
Four Four Two. ... The United States Under-20 national team (the
core of the next Olympic team for the 2000 Games) played Monday in
the final of the Croix Tournament in France. The Americans were the
only national team in the 12-team tournament. The United States
reached the final after a 5-0 victory over Anderlecht of Belgium.

NEW YORK'S VACCO DECLARES FOR SECOND TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Saying he has reduced crime, protected the
environment and fought consumer fraud more voraciously than his
predecessors, Dennis Vacco announced Monday that he would seek a
second term as New York state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the steps of the state Capitol with Gov. George
Pataki and other powerful Republicans, Vacco said he was the first
attorney general in decades to devote equal attention to fighting
crime and protecting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we couldn't reshape the attorney general's office to
focus on crime without walking away from the traditional consumer
and environmental responsibilities of this office,'' Vacco told
about 100 supporters and employees. ``We did it, and I am here
today to proclaim, `Mission accomplished.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three candidates have already made it onto the ballot for the
Democratic primary in September in hopes of challenging Vacco. They
are Eliot Spitzer, a former state prosecutor; G. Oliver Koppell, a
former attorney general, and state Sen. Catherine Abate. A fourth
candidate, Evan Davis, who was counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo, has
said he will petition to get on the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, 45, a former U.S. attorney in Buffalo, was little known
before he ran for attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He eked out a victory over the Democratic candidate, Karen
Burstein, largely because of the backing of U.S. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, the state's most influential Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's race is expected to be one of the most
hotly contested this year, because Vacco is widely believed to be
politically vulnerable. Several months after he was elected, he
came under heavy criticism for dismissing dozens of experienced
lawyers and replacing them with younger, inexperienced lawyers,
many of whose families had ties to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday, Vacco, who campaigned in 1994 on a
crime-fighting platform, focused on many of the issues that his
critics say he neglected during his first two years in office:
those involving consumer protection and the environment. He
described a crackdown by his office on health-care aides who abuse
nursing home residents and a new division in his office that
mediates disputes between managed-care companies and their
patients.

WOMAN CHARGED IN KILLING OF NEW YORK POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn woman accused of helping her boyfriend
kill a police officer who had gone to their apartment to arrest him
last week was indicted Monday on charges including second-degree
murder, robbery and assaulting a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Betsy Ramos, 33, first hid her boyfriend, Jose
Serrano, from the two officers as they sought to arrest him in
their basement apartment in East Flatbush last Tuesday morning,
police said. The indictment charges that when the officers found
Serrano, who was being sought for missing a court date on an old
drug charge, he and Ms. Ramos both attacked one of the officers,
Miriam Sanchez Torres, 36, and grabbed her service revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Using Torres' gun, Serrano fatally shot Officer Anthony
Mosomillo, 36, police said. Mosomillo returned fire, killing
Serrano, police said. ``Police Officer Anthony Mosomillo sacrificed
his life in the heroic and courageous performance of his duty,''
the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, said in announcing
the indictment. ``These charges, which accuse this defendant of
depraved and murderous conduct, will be prosecuted swiftly and
fairly to insure that justice is done in his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-count indictment charges Ms. Ramos with robbery
(helping take Torres' gun), second-degree murder, assaulting a
police officer, weapons possession, obstructing governmental
administration and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Ramos who let Mosomillo and Torres into the apartment
at 523 E. 34th St., where Serrano, 29, was hiding under the
floorboards of the bedroom closet, police said. ``She lied, and
told them he wasn't present,'' said a law enforcement official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The officers left the apartment but a neighbor suggested that
they look under the floor, and they returned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who is expected to be the chief witness in the case
against Ms. Ramos, gave a statement to police in which she said
that soon after they returned to the apartment, Serrano emerged
from his hiding place fighting and that Ms. Ramos soon joined the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Torres told investigators that the two knocked her to the ground
and that Serrano got her gun. At that point, Torres told
investigators, she turned to her partner and shouted: ``He's got
the gun! Shoot him!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramos' lawyer, Andrew Friedman, said that his client was a
battered woman who had once sought an order of protection against
Serrano. ``She absolutely denies ever going for the gun or getting
into a physical altercation with either police officer,'' he said.
``She was just there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her arrest, Ms. Ramos was on federal probation
until 2005 after pleading guilty to smuggling heroin into the
United States from Jamaica.

FORMER PROFESSOR SUES UNIVERSITY OVER DAMAGED CAREER
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a former Emory University business
professor who lost an appointment at the Georgia Institute of
Technology after Emory officials accused him of vandalism, has
filed a lawsuit charging Emory with trumping up charges against him
and sabotaging his career.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in
Atlanta, Sonnenfeld seeks reappointment to his tenured teaching
position and unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   An Emory spokeswoman, Nancy Seideman, said the university had
not received a copy of the lawsuit and would have no comment. But
in an exchange of letters with Sonnenfeld's lawyer earlier this
year, Emory's general counsel, Joseph Crooks, brushed off the
professor's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that your client's reputation may have been
damaged, he is the author of his own misfortune, and further
efforts of this type will only make matters worse for him,'' Crooks
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Georgia Tech said that it had lured Sonnenfeld
away from its wealthier crosstown rival to become dean of its
Dupree School of Management. Because Sonnenfeld was considered an
academic star who had won acclaim for his teaching and for the
creation of an educational institute for chief executives, his
appointment was widely seen as a coup for Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But before the state Board of Regents could approve the
$200,000-a-year appointment, Emory officials informed their Georgia
Tech counterparts that a security camera at Emory's Goizueta School
of Business had captured Sonnenfeld defacing a wall as he walked
down a hallway on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by campus police about the incident, Sonnenfeld
resigned from Emory on Dec. 1. William Chace, Emory's president,
then told Georgia Tech's president, G. Wayne Clough, about the
developments, and Georgia Tech rescinded its offer on Dec. 3,
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the videotape, which Sonnenfeld said was provided to
his lawyer by Emory officials, shows the professor zigzagging down
the hallway, apparently kicking the walls lightly as he goes.
Sonnenfeld acknowledges that his behavior appears bizarre. But he
has portrayed it as an eccentricity of a rumpled, often preoccupied
professor, and not a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be an audition for the Atlanta Ballet,'' he said
earlier this year, while watching the videotape. ``It looks so
foolish. But it's a lot better to look foolish then felonious.
People do dumb things like that. I can't invent a sensible reason
for why I'm doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seideman declined to comment on whether the university has
additional evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenfeld's lawsuit charges Emory and various university
officials with slander, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, breach of contract, deprivation of due process rights,
and tortious interference with his business dealings. It suggests
that Emory may have acted in retribution for his decision to take
the Georgia Tech job after Emory rejected him for the deanship of
its own business school.
</P>
<P>
   In the court filing, the 44-year-old professor explains that he
resigned only because Emory University Police Capt. Ray Edge had
threatened to arrest him on felony vandalism charges if he did not
leave Emory immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Since his resignation, Sonnenfeld, 44, has established, with
private financing, an institute in Atlanta for chief executives. He
also has received numerous letters of support from chief executives
he has befriended over the years, including the chief executive of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret what you've been through,'' President Clinton wrote.
``But, as my critics say, I can feel your pain.''

 &HT;    Texas, Texas A&AMP;M might lose football players to baseball draft
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M football
teams will be sweating out today's major-league baseball amateur
draft. As many as three of their prospects are expected to be taken
in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Longhorns quarterback signee Adam Dunn of New Caney is listed as
one of the top 50 prospects in the country by Baseball America. He
could sneak into the first round but is a probable second-round
selection if scouts aren't scared away by his football commitment
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Texas A&AMP;M's signees _ Beaumont West Brook quarterback
Chip Ambres and Dallas Christian outfielder Choo Freeman _ are
likely to have to turn down millions of dollars to play football
for the Aggies. Both are projected by Baseball America to be among
the top 10 players selected.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a first baseman who would be drafted as an outfielder, hit
.533 with 32 stolen bases. Ambres, the state's top quarterback
prospect, played outfield for West Brook and hit .500. Freeman, a
wide receiver in football, was an outfielder and hit .557.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor pitcher Kip Wells and Rice second baseman Bubba Crosby
are expected to be taken in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby is among the top five power hitters in the draft,
according to Baseball America. He helped Rice win the Western
Athletic Conference championship with 23 home runs and 84 runs
batted in this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, an All-Big 12 pick, posted a 13-4 record and a 3.55
earned run avearge for the Bears. He is listed as the probable No.
7 pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Texans figure to be picked within the first three
rounds of the draft today. The list includes pitcher Matt Belisle,
a Longhorns signee who had a record of 5-2 before suffering a
season-ending knee injury this spring. Outfielder Mamon Tucker is
projected to be taken in the second round. He had nine homers and a
.515 average.
</P>
<P>
   Current UT players are not expected to be taken high in the
draft. Outfielder Mark Cridland, drafted by Milwaukee last year,
signed with the Brewers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Other players from the state who might be picked are Texas A&AMP;M
outfielder Jason Tyner, pitcher Chris George and pitcher Gary
Majewski.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 pick of the draft is expected to be University of
Miami third baseman Pat Burrell, who missed 28 games with a back
injury this spring. He entered the College World Series with a .433
average, 11 homers and 35 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's, with the second pick, are expected to draft
Michigan State pitcher Mark Mulder (6-6, 3.40 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   The three-day draft ends Thursday.

URINE TEST FOR HIV WINS U.S. APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Calypte Biomedical Corp. said Monday that it
had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to
begin marketing its urine test for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
The test is the first complete urine-based diagnostic kit for HIV
that does not require confirmation by blood test.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of a urine test are greater ease of use and lower
cost for health care providers, and a safer procedure for patients.
According to the National Institutes of Health, there is no
evidence that HIV is spread through urine, thus reducing the
chances of accidental infection as a result of needle pricks or the
handling of samples.
</P>
<P>
   Like most blood tests, Calypte's urine HIV test and its
urine-based confirmation test both detect the presence of
antibodies, not the virus itself.
</P>
<P>
   Calypte itself will market the test to life insurance companies,
and will join with Seradyn, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi, to sell to
hospitals and clinics. The company must perform additional clinical
trials to obtain approval for a home-testing system that would be
sold over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Toney, an analyst with Pacific Growth, said he estimated
the market for Calypte's test to be about $300 million annually in
the United States. With an exclusive patent license from New York
University, Calypte's diagnostic kit ``will be the only test
specifically to detect HIV antibodies in urine through 2009,'' he
said.

FROM BRONX GARBAGE HEAP TO GOLF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Fla.) (ja)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bedraggled Bronx garbage heap _ heretofore a place
for dumping stolen cars and, at least once, a human body _ will
become a $22-million city-owned golf course designed by Jack
Nicklaus, city officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The course, the first new one in the city in 35 years, is
planned for an undeveloped section of Ferry Point Park, in the
shadow of the Whitestone Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its municipal ownership and landfill locale, it will aim
for a measure of exclusivity. The developers _ led by Nicklaus, one
the sport's most revered figures _ say the course and its amenities
will be of country-club caliber. The number of golfers will be
strictly limited, and the price will be almost twice the cost of a
round on the other city-owned courses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, scheduled to be formally announced today by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, could be a boon for the growing number of golfers
in the city and the region. With the sport's popularity rising,
playing on one of the city's existing public courses can often be
an ordeal, with tough competition for a tee time and near-gridlock
on the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do something special for the Big Apple,'' Nicklaus said
in a telephone interview Monday. He has created a preliminary
layout for the course based on pictures and maps of the site, but
will see the location in person for the first time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, whose company has designed 152 courses, said he did
not want to make the Ferry Point course too complicated. ``I hope
we don't make it too hard,'' he said. The development, which is
scheduled to be completed in 2001, also includes plans for a
white-tablecloth restaurant, a marina and an esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   The construction cost will be completely financed by the
developers, who, in turn, will receive a 35-year lease. In an
escalating formula, the city would get at least $1.25 million a
year beginning in 2001, rising to $3 million in the last five years
of the lease. The plan, the largest license deal ever signed by the
Parks Department, requires approval from the city's Art Commission,
which reviews all design work for public property.
</P>
<P>
   The expected price to play 18 holes will be nearly $40 on
weekends for city residents, almost double the $20.50 at other city
courses. But J. Pierre Gagne, a golf-course developer and one of
Nicklaus' partners, said that would be a bargain given the quality
of the course. He noted that many new courses open to the public
charged $65 or more while country club memberships ranged from
$30,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite an opportunity,'' he said. ``It's a tremendous
asset to the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball fields and picnic area in the western portion of Ferry
Point Park will not be affected by the golf course, which will
cover the marshy, weedy eastern part of the 414-acre expanse. Over
the years, city officials have proposed all manner of developments
for the site, from a new Yankee Stadium to a football stadium to
housing. The administration of Mayor Abraham Beame first suggested
a golf course in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The site is near the interchange of the Hutchinson River Parkway
and the Cross-Bronx and Bruckner Expressways, though there is no
subway line nearby.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little local opposition to the plan, with
widespread sentiment that anything is better than a neglected
landfill. ``People in the neighborhood are longing to see this
garbage dump become a nice thing,'' said Dart Westphal, president
of the Bronx Council of Environmental Quality, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for green space, however, are upset about
increasing concessions in parks, which they fear are leading to
rampant privatization. ``There are already plenty of golf courses
on public land,'' said David Lutz, program director of the
Neighborhood Open Spaces Coalition. ``At the same time, there are
many things the city lacks on public land,'' he added, suggesting a
campground and nature educational centers.
</P>
<P>
   Four bids were received for the site, with the runner-up group
including Arnold Palmer as a partner and designer, parks officials
said. The site was advertised twice in the last decade in golf
business magazines, but there were no serious bids.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the interest this time
around was a result of a booming local and national economy and a
ballooning interest in golf _ as well as a new spirit in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The number of rounds played on the city courses increased to
885,497 last year from 580,588 in 1982. The city's courses, all run
by concessionaires, had gross receipts of $22 million last year,
$2.6 million of which went to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of golf is already evident in the city.
The pitch-and-putt course at Flushing Meadows Corona Park is having
night lighting installed and is expanding to include mini-golf. The
Randalls Island driving range's capacity is being doubled to 180
stalls. Under a program to instruct youth, the Professional Golfers
Association is renovating Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx. The
concessionaire at the Forest Park course in Queens just spent more
than $1 million in improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ferry Point deal, the participants _ Nicklaus' Golden
Bear International, based in North Palm Beach, Fla.; Gagne
Development, of White Plains, N.Y., and the Flag Financial Corp.,
of New York City _ will spend $22 million to build the course, a
driving range, a clubhouse, the marina and restaurant and a
catering facility. They will also build the waterfront promenade,
pedestrian and bicycle paths, picnic areas and restrooms, and will
make improvements to an adjacent playground.
</P>
<P>
   Flag, the financing arm, is putting up 65 percent of the
investment. The other partners are evenly splitting the rest.
</P>
<P>
   After the 35-year lease expires, the city can negotiate a deal
with anyone or run the course itself.
</P>
<P>
   The construction cost is significantly higher than the norm for
a course, Gagne said, in part because of the difficulty of building
on a landfill. This means the sub-surface materials must be
minutely analyzed before development can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, citing his experience in building a course on top of a
toxic dump site in Montana, said soil would have to be brought in.
``It's a golf course that will be built on top and not cut in,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The architect for the clubhouse and other buildings is Butler
Rogers Baskett of New York.

UPSET NOMO CUT LOOSE BY DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wash.)  (ja)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship
with Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize
interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew
delivery, but this year had pitched terribly, grew disenchanted and
requested a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo, while the Yankees
said they might also be interested in the 29-year-old right-hander,
who was designated for assignment and removed from Los Angeles'
40-man roster. Nomo, who was 2-7 with a 5.05 earned run average
this season, was perturbed that the Dodgers had included him in
trade discussions with Seattle about Randy Johnson and asked to be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Fred
Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said. ``There is a time
frame. That being said, there is also a great demand for
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have the lowest ERA in the major leagues, could be
very involved in pursuing Nomo, who must be traded or assigned in
10 days or could be placed on unconditional waiver release in seven
days. Nomo is in the last year of a contract that pays him $2.8
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   After having his four-year major-league career take a drastic
turn, Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine
managed him in Japan, pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend,
Mike Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace, a senior
adviser for the Mets, was Nomo's coach with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something, in general terms, that you might consider
internally,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who
broached Nomo's name during a discussion about other pitchers with
a reporter before Monday night's game against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, was
flabbergasted by the Dodgers' decision and promised to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers designated him for assignment?'' he said. ``Wow!
That's very interesting. I don't know what else to say other than
that's surprising. I'm certainly going to look into it like
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo barely spoke during a news conference in Los Angeles,
saying he ``definitely needed a change of scenery, a change of
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the devastating work stoppage in 1994 canceled the World
Series, Nomo helped baseball regain attention by arriving from
Japan with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball and a wicked split-finger
pitch, both emanating from a seldom-seen corkscrew delivery. He was
13-6 with a 2.54 ERA and 236 strikeouts in 1911/3 innings in 1995
and was named the National League's rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's success was followed so fervently in Japan that thousands
watched him pitch on mammoth screens in Tokyo in early morning
hours. He became one of the most popular players on the Dodgers and
struck out 500 batters faster than any other pitcher, 4442/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was 16-11 with a 3.19 ERA in 1996 and 14-12 with a 4.25 ERA
last year. He had allowed 18 earned runs in his last 262/3 innings
and had dropped his last four decisions, causing some fans to boo
him at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think trades are inevitable in this
business,'' Yoshii said. ``Even Mike Piazza was traded. He's a
friend. It would be nice. But it's not my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza considered the prospect of the Mets' getting Nomo and
said: ``That would be weird. Can you imagine more of a zoo?''

TOUGH NEW CUNY STANDARDS ARE ATTACKED AT YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (ja)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While graduates of York College in Queens basked in
sunshine and congratulations at their commencement, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's policies took a drubbing Monday. The mayor did not
attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   What made the occasion contentious was the vote last Tuesday by
the CUNY board of trustees, at the mayor's urging, to discontinue
remedial classes at the 11 senior colleges in the system, including
York. They also voted to exclude any student who has not passed
placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is scheduled to be phased in over three years,
beginning in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Curtis Jr., a trustee who has supported the campaign to
phase out remedial courses, was drowned out by boos and catcalls
Monday morning at York, in Jamaica, as he tried to express
greetings from fellow trustees. Many graduates rose to their feet,
shaking their fists and pumping placards with slogans like,
``Education Is a Right, Not a Favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the new policy will prevent thousands of students
from entering college. Giuliani and other supporters have said that
the policy will raise academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration at York College's 28th commencement ceremony
was not wholly spontaneous. Students distributed cards urging
graduates to protest when Curtis rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan was also raised by the valedictorian,
Ingrid Amorini, in her address to the 1,001 graduates. Ms. Amorini
of East Elmhurst, Queens, a native of Argentina, began by telling
of the difficulties she encountered as a single parent who also
cared for her younger brother, who is severely retarded. She said
that after entering York College in 1993, she failed the English
writing test.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Amorini brought the graduates to their feet applauding
when she said, ``York College gave me the necessary remedial
course, which allowed me to pass the written English exam the
second time I took it. I got straight A's that first semester and
all the subsequent 148 credits. All I needed was a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Amorini invited all graduates who had taken at least one
remedial course to stand. Almost half of the students rose,
cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The new admissions plan was also criticized by the commencement
speaker, John Hope Franklin, an emeritus professor of history at
Duke University and chairman of the advisory board of One America,
President Clinton's committee on race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin began by urging the graduates ``not to feel inferior or
inadequate because you took a remedial course.'' There should be no
more stigma attached to that experience, he contended, than to an
immigrant's need for language training, or, for that matter, to a
student who wants to learn how to speak Italian. He urged the
graduates to teach as well as to take remedial courses.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin recalled that when he was a graduate student at Harvard
University, he encountered a middle-aged man who could neither read
nor write. For eight months, he said, he taught the man for one
hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I learned at Harvard,'' he said, ``was more important
and rewarding to me than teaching a grown man how to read and
write.''

FAMILY CRISIS DRAWS THE SLOANS CLOSER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The invitations surprised Bobbye Sloan. Her
husband wanted her to come into the locker room after his team, the
Utah Jazz, won the Western Conference finals. He wanted her to ride
the team bus back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 35 years of marriage to Jerry Sloan, and to basketball, she
had never felt so included, not in victory or in defeat. She
thought to herself, do I know this man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry just always believed that's not where family belongs,''
she said. ``He thought it was a distraction. Our son wanted to be a
ball boy once, and he said, `Absolutely not.' It wasn't part of his
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz appear to be exactly where they were a year ago,
preparing to face the Chicago Bulls for the National Basketball
Association championship with the same veteran lineup and the same
pick-and-roll style. But for the coach and his wife, nothing is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been since Steve Kerr hit the shot last June that
ended Utah's season. That night Bobbye turned off the television,
rolled over and realized there was a lump under her left breast.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer was diagnosed within days. Over the next few months,
Bobbye Sloan struggled through surgery and chemotherapy. Jerry
Sloan struggled, too, trying to reconcile the personal and
professional lives he had always thought should be kept separate.
</P>
<P>
   While she was fighting the illness, her husband was fighting
himself. So far, both have been successful; Bobbye's cancer is in
remission, while Jerry has paid more attention to their marriage
and to his own health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's the biggest thing to come out of this,'' Jerry
Sloan said. ``The situation she's gone through had made us more
aware of each other, a lot more. It's turned out to be more than we
ever expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sloans spoke last week as they sat on a couch in the
wood-paneled den of their home, a modest condominium tucked beneath
the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains. The room was filled with
antiques; photos of a smiling Karl Malone and boxing gloves signed
by Muhammad Ali were behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a photo of a Chicago Bulls team Sloan played on
in the early 1970's, with Chet Walker and Bob Love _ a reminder of
his side-burned past.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sloan was born in the southern Illinois town of
McLeansboro, where he retreats with Bobbye every off season and
tends to his wheat, soybeans and corn. He grew up there without his
father, who died when Sloan was 4, two years after he was injured
in a farming accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry met Bobbye at McLeansboro High School in 1957. She was the
5-foot-9-inch freshman class president. He was the 5-6 vice
president. One day as the class officers lined up for yearbook
photos, Bobbye noticed that her vice president was at eye level.
Looking down, she saw that Jerry was standing tiptoe on a water
fountain pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's first request for a date was turned down because of his
height. After they finally dated, Bobbye told her mother in
frustration, ``He didn't say two words.''
</P>
<P>
   But the runt grew to 6-5. They were engaged after high school,
and he was offered a scholarship to the University of Illinois. He
promptly dropped out and wanted to move home to start a family.
Bobbye was in nursing school at the time and was determined to
finish the three-year program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' she said. ``I'm going to do this. I worked very hard
to get here. Either you find something to do with your life, or
it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   She broke off their engagement until Jerry enrolled at the
University of Evansville. They were married his sophomore year.
Until he became a Division II all-American and was drafted by the
Baltimore Bullets, they lived on $5 a week.
</P>
<P>
   After one season with Baltimore, Sloan went on to become one of
the most menacing defenders the game has known with the Bulls. His
No. 4 jersey hangs in the United Center. He gave so much of his
body to basketball he can no longer run without one knee swelling
like a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned Dick Motta, the former Bulls coach, once said to
him, ``You need a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   As a player and later a coach, Sloan played hard, drank hard and
enjoyed the NBA life. He found it helped camouflage the anxiety
elsewhere in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan's playing career ended in 1976, and the next year he
agreed to become the coach at Evansville. But the job did not feel
right, and he reneged within days. ``He just decided, my life has
been in the NBA, that's where I belong,'' Bobbye said. He became an
assistant coach with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, in December 1977, the plane carrying the
Evansville team he would have been coaching crashed. Thirty people
died, including the team and the coaching staff. He had recruited
two of the players.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions he felt then would not surface again for 22 years.
``You change every day, but I haven't gone through something like
this since the plane crash,'' Sloan said as he sat across from
Bobbye in the den. ``It doesn't mean I would've been on the plane
for sure, but it certainly makes you more aware: what we do for a
living is really not that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Bobbye went to Chicago for the first two games of the
finals and attended the next three in Salt Lake City, as the Bulls
took a three-games-to-two lead. Then she stayed home and watched
Game 6 from her bed as Utah's bid for a title fell short. She
pulled the covers over her head with some solace: Jerry would be
home on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She felt a sharp, stinging pain shoot through her left breast.
``I was hoping it was a cyst or maybe something else, but in the
back of my mind I just kind of knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had been a registered nurse, and knew that cysts are usually
liquid while cancerous tumors are usually solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it solid?'' she asked the woman performing the ultrasound
test. The woman nodded.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Bettye underwent a modified mastectomy to remove seven
lymph nodes. After chemotheraphy treatments, she underwent breast
reconstruction surgery in early January.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery left a long scar, but made her feel whole again. ``I
don't care about the scars or anything, I just want to be around to
see my grandkids grow up,'' she said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Because the cancer was detected at the earliest stage of
development, and the disease is now in complete remission, her
chances for survival are excellent. She has devoted much of her
time over the last few months to breast-cancer education, imploring
women to have mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the biggest blessing, trying to get women to
realize all they need to do is go in for an exam'' Bobbye said.
``Along with Jerry changing, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was not informed of his wife's illness until two weeks
after she felt the lump and the cancer was diagnosed. She did not
want to worry him or other family members, confiding only in
doctors and her son, Brian.
</P>
<P>
   A former University of Indiana guard - he played on Bob Knight's
1987 national championship team - Brian had just finished medical
school and was a resident at a hospital in Indianapolis. He flew to
Salt Lake City and called family members, including his father in
McLeansboro.
</P>
<P>
   Brian had written notes to help himself coach each person on
what to say to his mother when she spoke with them. Next to the
name of his father, the eternal pessimist, he wrote: ``No long
face, no doomsday, be positive. Don't be your usual, negative
self.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettye recalled: ``Jerry called me and it was the fakiest voice
you ever heard in your life. `Hello. How are you?' I couldn't help
but laugh, because it was the worst acting anyone had ever done in
their life, especially him. But I appreciated that, because
ordinarily it would have been the woe-is-me stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime anything has ever been wrong, he's not real good about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bettye's initial surgery, while she was undergoing
chemotherapy, Jerry was living the same old NBA life: three packs
of cigarettes a day, and a few drinks at the hotel bar with some of
his coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home one night right after Christmas and had been out
drinking and smelling like the bar,'' Bobbye said. ``I said to him,
`Here I am, fighting for my life, and your snuffing yours out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holly, the Sloan's 28-year-old daughter, said: ``Mom was mad.
Before she was diagnosed, she was working out, running
half-marathons and quit smoking about 500 years ago. And she's the
one who got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sloan decided to make changes. The couple's oldest
daughter, Kathy, worked with a pharmaceutical company. To help her
father quit smoking, she recommended he begin taking Zyban, an
anti-depressant that helps people wean themselves from nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has not smoked a cigarette since February. He quit
frequenting the bars, too. He and Bobby take long walks now, three
miles in the morning and sometimes three more in the evening. They
end up at either an ice-cream shop or a Marie Callendar's for a
piece of pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We traded the bar in for the pie house,'' Bobbye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never felt better,'' Jerry added. ``It's been the most
rewarding year of my life. You don't expect things to change you at
this age. You have to be who you are. But I guess a few adjustments
now and then don't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan's team saw subtle changes, too. After a trade that would
have sent Chris Morris and Greg Foster to Orlando for Rony Seikaly
fell through, the Utah owner Larry Miller attended practice to
soothe any damaged egos.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, standing nearby, was asked if he had anything to add.
``He said, `Yeah there is,' and he started talking about Bobbye,''
Miller told The Salt Lake Tribune. ``Blew my mind. I think it blew
everyone's mind. He said, `I've learned what's important. We all
like to win basketball games, but winning games isn't as important
as your wife and your family and stuff like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bobbye Sloan was on the team bus nine days ago. It
was her first time, but she acted as if she belonged. She couldn't
wait for the give-and-take banter with John Stockton, a chronic
needler who, she had been told, had a little nickname for her.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing up the bus steps, she announced to the point guard,
``Here she is, the old ball and chain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, they told you?'' Stockton said. Karl Malone quickly
stepped into to bail out his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant you're the good luck ball and chain,'' Malone said.
``Everywhere you go, we win.''

MASON TESTS FOR LAUGHS  
 PARTYING IN PARIS  
 NEW YORK AND EAST HAMPTON

   Looking for Laughs in the Right Places
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jackie Mason was clutching a microphone and
addressing the balding gentleman in the first row, something he has
been known to do before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister, would I ever be so tasteless as to tell a Viagra joke?
Because, mister, I'm not the kind of comedian that would use that
lowlife type of material.''
</P>
<P>
   The man laughed, waiting for the inevitable skewering. He was
surrounded by an audience of comedy mavens at Catch a Rising Star
on West 28th St., where, unannounced, Mason is performing each
evening though Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Mason has appeared at a comedy club in
New York since he played Dangerfield's back in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But mister, I want to ask you a Viagra question,'' said Mason.
``Can you answer me this? What happens when a man like you takes
Viagra _ and then the girl changes her mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Mason is tuning up his next Broadway show, the fifth since 1986,
in the way he always has: trying out new material ``and seeing if
what I say stinks up the joint,'' Mason said before the show.
</P>
<P>
   For six months now he's been working on new material at clubs in
Las Vegas, Chicago and Houston, ``but there is nothing like a New
York audience for judging whether a comedian is a hero or some kind
of lowlife individual,'' he said happily.
</P>
<P>
   Paris to New York, Via Casablanca
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were some guests at a dinner given by Bill
Richardson, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, who
bragged about the trans-Atlantic commuting they had to do last
week.
</P>
<P>
   They went to Paris for a Tuesday night dinner-dance for the 70th
birthday of Ambassador Felix Rohatyn (and his son Pierre's 40th),
then back to New York on Thursday for the Richardson gathering,
which honored &UR;  &LR; Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and his wife, Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Altman, the investment banker and former deputy treasury
secretary, was seen at both parties. So was Henry Kissinger, the
former secretary of state, who celebrated his own 75th birthday on
Wednesday, the day between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Rohatyns' residence on the Faubourg St. Honore had been
decorated to look like Rick's Cafe Americain in the film
``Casablanca.'' The invitations featured a doctored photograph,
with the senior Rohatyn's head where Humphrey Bogart's was.
</P>
<P>
   Out and About, Eastern Edition
</P>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ Michael Douglas ordered a $60 tasting menu
at Pacific East, an Asian restaurant in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, Michael Castino, said the five-course, 2,000-calorie
meal included tuna tartare, lobster pancakes, Chilean sea bass and
soft-shelled crab tempura. Douglas also ordered a dessert called
the ``chocolate bomb'' and an after-dinner cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gaines, author of ``Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion
and Property in the Hamptons'' (Little, Brown), was working the
room at Nick and Toni's, also in East Hampton, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem. ``It was a light night
celebrity-wise,'' said a man who works for Nick and Toni's, and
there were not many hands to shake or backs to slap.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines did greet two chefs from Manhattan who were visiting (and
eating, not cooking): Alfred Portale of the Gotham Bar and Grill,
and Bobby Flay from Mesa and Bolo.

 CHINESE MEN INTERVIEWED IN SMUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the authorities searched for the captain of the
smuggling boat that ran aground Saturday night in New Jersey,
investigators Monday began to interview its 22 Chinese passengers
in the hope of learning who organized and profited from their
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service released little
information about the detainees Monday, other than that they came
from Fujian Province, the starting point for many of the illegal
Chinese immigrants who have made the tortuous journey to American
shores in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that investigators were still conducting separate
interviews of the 22 men, the youngest of them 18 and the oldest
45.
</P>
<P>
   The men were being held at the INS detention center in
Elizabeth, N.J., where they will appear before immigration judges
later this week and be charged with illegal entry into the United
States. At that point, usually the beginning of a long and
complicated legal battle, they may ask for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in Washington, the INS
commissioner, Doris Meissner, said the facts that were known about
the men's journey, although sketchy, fit into a pattern seen in
other immigrant-smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we would operate on the supposition that they
are connected to an organized-crime organization of some kind,''
she said, calling the Chinese-smuggling business particularly
odious because it funnels hapless immigrants into sweatshop jobs
where they are abused, exploited and overworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise played out
on a global scale,'' Mrs. Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were still searching for the captain and presumed
owner of the boat, who slipped through police hands before anyone
realized that the abandoned craft had unloaded a human cargo of
illegal immigrants. He was identified by the authorities as a
38-year-old Korean-American, Jason Choi, of Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   His 30-foot fiberglass pleasure boat, the Oops II, ran aground
at the end of Mount Street in Bay Head, one of the wealthiest towns
on the Jersey Shore, and for the first three hours, the police
treated the incident as little more than a case of a captain who
had floundered in heavy fog and purposely beached his craft.
</P>
<P>
   When he was questioned by state troopers at a phone booth near
the boat, Choi identified himself as the owner and said he had lost
his way while fishing and ran the boat up on the beach because he
was running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state police, said that the
registration documents for the boat were in order and that a check
found no outstanding warrants for Choi. Troopers even gave Choi a
ride into downtown Point Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   When reports began to come in about Chinese men wandering around
the town, the local police called the troopers again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The aborted ride in the Oops II was probably the final leg of an
arduous journey from China. Typically, smuggling rings bring Asian
immigrants across Eastern Europe or Southern Africa, then to South
America, before heading up through the Caribbean or Central America
to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The boat itself offered few clues _ some blankets, water bottles
and a few cans of the nutrient supplement Ensure, Bay Head Police
Chief William Dikun said.
</P>
<P>
   It was still unclear whether the 22 men, like so many before
them, were destined to work off much of the $25,000 to $30,000 in
smuggling fees in the sweatshops of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While many Fujian immigrants have risen to positions of
political and economic power in the Chinese-American community in
New York, the province, a hodgepodge mix of booming businesses and
impoverished rural farms, also supplies the bulk of the underpaid
and undocumented sweatshop work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty common these days to go into one sweatshop or
another,'' said Wang Lim, executive director of the Chinese Staff
and Workers Association.
</P>
<P>
   To help choke off the smuggling pipelines that bring in Asian
and other illegal immigrants, the INS has opened 13 new offices
around the world in the past three years in an effort to intercept
them before they reach the United States.

METS GAINING ON YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It won't be long before the inter-league series
between the Mets and the Yankees will be billed as a World Series
preview. Who knows? By that weekend, June 26-28, the Mets may even
be in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count them out; that's the way I look at it,'' the
Yankees' Darryl Strawberry said Monday, discussing the Mets' rapid
rise in the National League East. ``They're sitting right at the
table. Being five out in June, there's a great opportunity for the
window to open up for them to sneak past. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Having slashed Atlanta's lead from nine games to five in the
first seven games after The Trade, the Mets have not only raised
their position in the NL wild-card race, but also have some
dreamers thinking they could be good enough to overtake the
perennial champion Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It has indeed been a remarkable 10 days for the other team in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said the Yankees' David Cone, like
Strawberry a refugee from that other team. ``It's the first real
chance we've had in a long time that both teams have playoff hopes.
Both teams have a legitimate chance of getting to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry considered the possibility and pronounced it
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a treat for the whole town of New York,'' he said.
``It would be the toast of New York City for 1998, no doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza has made all of this possible. Until May 22, the
Mets were a sound though boring team, a team that could win with
pitching and defense but whose pitchers couldn't afford to give up
more than a run or two because they couldn't count on the hitters
to produce more.
</P>
<P>
   But the acquisition of Piazza transformed the Mets into a
hitting machine that amassed 54 runs and 100 hits in seven games
before Monday night's 4-3 loss in Pittsburgh to the league's most
effective starter, Jason Schmidt. The accompanying winning streak
catapulted the Mets into the Braves' rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The developments in Queens have made the team in the Bronx take
notice, although news of those developments doesn't appear to have
reached City Hall and the Yankees' self-proclaimed No. 1 fan. (What
will the mayor do if the Mets and the Yankees meet in the World
Series? He would actually have to see the Mets play.)
</P>
<P>
   Every single member of the Yankees who was asked about those
developments applauded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great move,'' General Manager Brian Cashman
said of the Piazza trade. ``It gives them the offense they need; it
gives them credibility with the fans. They stepped up to the plate
and addressed a need in a big way. I think it's good for the
baseball situation in New York overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will obviously not maintain the level of play that has
caught the attention of the Yankees and demanded the attention of
the fans and the news media, which had buried the Mets under their
blanket coverage of the Yankees' torrid start. But the Mets are a
legitimate contender. Whether it is for first place or the wild
card, that remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets haven't even played the Atlanta Braves. They won't
until the last series before the All-Star Game break. Until then,
they play teams like Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay, Montreal and Florida,
and they could inflate their won-lost record in those series. With
Piazza on the scene, that would not surprise the Yankees, who are
accustomed to having front-line players join them in the middle of
a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams in the thick of things don't ever add or do
anything,'' the Yankees' Paul O'Neill said. ``Sometimes you need a
boost. Adding a player like that obviously is going to give a team
a boost. It creates a feeling that the players and management are
on the same line as far as wanting to win. It makes everything run
a little bit smoother. You don't have management against players
and you feel like you're trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said the addition of a player like Piazza builds
confidence throughout the clubhouse. ``It's going to make the other
players push a little bit more,'' he said. ``It builds more
character in the other players. When you have a guy like that come
in, it makes other players raise their ability to play the game
because they know this guy comes to play. It just brings a whole
different feeling to know that you can win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cone himself has been Piazza twice in his career. He was traded
to the Toronto Blue Jays and to the Yankees during division races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes pressure off the other guys,'' the pitcher said of
such an addition. ``His presence in the lineup helps them
offensively, all the other hitters and in the clubhouse. The media
attention is on him. It's off Butch Huskey. It's off Dave Mlicki.
It's off all of them. It allows them to relax. It's tough to
quantify that sort of an effect, but no doubt it's very real.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone recalled the atmosphere in the Blue Jays' clubhouse after
his arrival in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt this is going to get us over the hump,'' he said.
``The rest of the pitching staff sort of felt like if they don't
win today, we'll win tomorrow. They didn't have to be the stopper.
We could all contribute. It sounds like baseball jargon a little
bit, but it's really true. His presence no doubt has given them all
an emotional lift, while at the same time taking some pressure off
of them.''

SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT URGES CLOSER TIES WITH NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Adds new 6th graf, and 2 grafs at end of story.)  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In an effort to ease half a century of
enmities on the Korean Peninsula, President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea called on Monday for the United States and other Western
countries to end sanctions against North Korea and to show greater
flexibility in dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said that when he makes a state visit to Washington next
week, which will include an address to a joint session of Congress,
he will urge the United States to give up its economic sanctions
against North Korea. He will suggest, instead, a policy of
increasing political ``engagement'' and growing economic ties as
the best way to moderate the behavior of North Korea, the world's
last Stalinist state.
</P>
<P>
   While Western policies are not expected to change overnight, the
pressures for a policy of greater engagement with the North have
already been building, and Kim's arguments are sure to carry
enormous weight in Washington and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview Monday in Blue House, the presidential
mansion, Kim emphasized that he had no illusions about the North,
which even in recent years has sent armed infiltrators into South
Korea and continues to aim a vast array of artillery at Seoul. But
he also suggested that it is time to try a new approach to reduce
the tensions and the risk of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be desirable for the United States to ease its
economic sanctions on North Korea,'' Kim said. ``I think this would
be more effective in efforts to get North Korea to open up and
liberalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, U.S. companies are
basically banned from doing any business in or with North Korea.
Some exceptions have been made, but the sanctions remain so broad
that they have even prevented American basketball teams from
signing up a 7-foot-9-inch North Korean basketball player, who
would be the tallest player on record.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who took office in February, has made conciliatory
statements about North Korea in the past, including suggestions for
economic and cultural contacts between the two Koreas and proposals
for an inter-Korean summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's comments were his strongest call for change in the
West's approach to North Korea. Indeed, as recently as Friday, he
had given a Korean newspaper the standard response about U.S.
sanctions _ that whether they should be lifted must depend on
``progress in inter-Korean relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point Monday, Kim made clear that he preferred
that the United States lift sanctions, not just amend them, and
that it do so without setting conditions. Moreover, he urged that
this be done as part of a broad transformation of Western policy
toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see improvement in relations between Japan and
North Korea and in fact between the rest of the Western world and
North Korea,'' Kim said. ``I believe these improved relations will
lead to changes in North Korea and to North Korea opening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's nine-day visit to the United States beginning on Saturday
will not focus only on relations with North Korea but also on a
broad array of economic, cultural and political issues, such as
efforts to reassure U.S. investors about South Korea's business
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will also be a nostalgic homecoming for a one-time
dissident who was twice exiled in the United States, who learned
English from an American Peace Corps volunteer and who credits U.S.
pressure with saving his life when Korean dictators sought to kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few problems of international relations have been so
intractable over the last half-century as the continuing cold war
on the Korean Peninsula _ President Clinton has called the jagged
``demilitarized zone'' between the two Koreas ``the scariest place
on earth'' _ and Kim said that one key purpose of his visit to the
United States is ``to win a more flexible stance in our two
countries' dealings with North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Kim made the same argument about North Korea on
Monday that the Clinton administration has made about China _ that
the best way to tame it is not to isolate it and punish it with
sanctions but rather to build economic and diplomatic ties that
draw it out onto the international playing field.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the United States has made some half-hearted
efforts toward engagement, and it has lifted some sanctions. But
each time one crucial brake on the process has been vociferous
warnings from Seoul that Washington must not get too friendly with
its enemy in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim from the start has staked out a policy very different from
that of his predecessors. The previous president, Kim Young Sam,
nursed a resentment of the North that dated at least from the
murder of his mother by suspected North Korean infiltrators in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung was himself arrested and targeted for execution by
North Korean officials, in the 1950s. But in contrast to past
presidents he has emphasized that South Korea's fundamental
approach should not be to squeeze North Korea into submission but
rather to build trust and economic links.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, economic cooperation was greatly restricted,''
Kim said. ``We wish to lift all the restrictions so that
cooperation can take place in a free atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see a great activation of economic cooperation,''
he added. ``This benefits not only the North Korean economy but our
economy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has not responded
to Kim's conciliatory remarks in recent months, or to his
suggestions for an inter-Korean summit. Kim Dae Jung admitted
Monday that he was a bit ``disappointed'' by the lack of response
from North Korea. Asked whether he still thought a summit meeting
might be held this year, he grinned and said, ``Only a
fortuneteller can answer that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, he quickly added, ``It is at least possible to be more
hopeful than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's call for an end to sanctions appeared to be a deliberate
effort to advance the discussion about North Korea policy in the
West, for he repeated it and elaborated on it several times. But he
also made clear that he did not expect any immediate results.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we stick to this tolerance on our part, with such a
flexible approach, then perhaps not in the near term but in the
long run we'll be able to see changes in North Korea's attitude,''
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any progress in relations between the West and North
Korea is likely to be gradual. Many U.S. officials perceive North
Korea as a dinosaur _ and a malevolent one at that. And companies
are not exactly jostling one another for the right to invest in one
of the world's last communist countries, particularly one that
refuses entry to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. government has been torn in recent years about
what to do with North Korea. Particularly since 1994, when the
United States and North Korea agreed to improve ties as part of a
pact to end the North's suspected nuclear weapons program, some
U.S. officials _ most notably James Laney, a former U.S. ambassador
to South Korea _ have argued for a policy of greater engagement
with the North.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping some sanctions, the United States has contributed
emergency food aid to the North and has expressed its readiness to
exchange liaison offices whenever the North wants.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's ideas carry special force because he is not only his
country's president but an emerging leader for Asia as a whole, a
longtime campaigner for democracy who for decades has written
widely about international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Korean officials and Western diplomats said that they did not
expect Kim's visit to the United States to result in any landmark
new agreements, but rather to affirm an already strong relationship
and to give Kim a chance to try to rebuild international confidence
in the tattered Korean economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for him and for us to publicly show
support for his efforts to bring Korea out of this morass, to
solidify the security relationship and to commend Kim Dae Jung for
embracing democracy and making the tough choices to repair the
economy,'' said Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. ambassador to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a Clinton administration official, insisting on
anonymity, said Monday evening that Kim's remarks were not a
surprise, because he had hinted at a softening in his stance in
recent remarks to South Korean journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reaction, delivered by his spokesman, Mike McCurry,
was low-key and cautious. ``We look forward to President Kim's
first visit since his election,'' McCurry said Monday, adding that
it would provide ``an opportunity to continue our close
consultations and exchange of views on how best to promote peace
and stability on the Korean Peninsula.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ If ever there was a chance for Michael Jordan to
lose in the NBA Finals, this is it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's not speculation or theory. Or even wishful thinking.
That's what at least a couple of the NBA's most knowledgeable
insiders believe as Jordan and the Chicago Bulls prepare for a
rematch against the Utah Jazz in the Finals, which begin Wednesday
at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Chicago needed only six games to dispense with the
Jazz and earn championship No. 5 in the '90s. Now, the Bulls start
working on the other hand's rings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jazz is better prepared this year to sabotage the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the favorites,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
in a mini-preview of the Finals. ``Through the 82-game season, they
proved to be the best teams on each side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think we'll see in Utah is a team that has been there
and has a great deal of experience to draw on regarding what
happened last year. I think you'll see a tougher team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the big difference is they have the home-court advantage.
So I think, psychologically, they really have to be feeling good
about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is not alone in his belief that the Jazz has an
excellent chance of knocking off the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this: For the first time since Jordan and the Bulls
started their championship run, this is the best chance anybody's
had (to beat them),'' said Denver general manager Dan Issel. ``Why?
Because the Jazz (is) playing well right now, (will) have home
court and (will) have a lot of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Jazz can't do it, let's say nobody can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has a chance to end Jordan's season on an unhappy note for
just the second time since 1990. Only when Jordan was making his
comeback from baseball in 1995 did the Bulls lose a playoff series
in which he participated, getting bumped by Orlando in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bulls seem vulnerable again, at least in the eyes of
onlookers. Anybody who saw the way Indiana played so tough against
the Bulls, forcing them to an all-or-nothing seventh game in the
Eastern Conference finals, could tell these are the waning days of
the Chicago dynasty. And with the Jazz capable of playing even
tougher defense than the Pacers did, it's logical to see why the
Bulls wouldn't be prohibitive favorites in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Jazz ready to dethrone Michael? Only the next two weeks
will tell. But Utah coach Jerry Sloan said he believes his team
certainly is better equipped this time around than it was last year
when the Jazz was making its first trip to a Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we come with the determination to play rather than
just show up,'' Sloan said. ``I think last year in the Finals, we
went in there with the determination to show up. I think that was
evident in that second game, where it looked like we were happy to
be there, and we got slaughtered on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going to play at that level, hopefully you come to
play with every bit of energy you have. Hopefully, we'll do that in
the series ahead of us, because if we don't, that team will put you
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question going into the series is how Utah's nine
days off between games will impact Karl Malone, John Stockton, Jeff
Hornacek and Co. All three of the Jazz's key players put the time
off to good use, letting some nagging injuries heal.
</P>
<P>
   But no player enjoys sitting around for more than a week before
starting a playoff series, especially when the opponent wasn't
known until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz has won 10 of its past 11 playoff games since falling
behind 2-1 to the Rockets in the first round. Utah clearly was on a
roll before this dominatius interruptus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting to get there,'' Malone said. ``We're not
there yet. But we're getting closer. I'll let you know when we get
there (and are playing our best).''
</P>
<P>
   Malone agreed with his coach that the experience gained last
season should help significantly this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year we weren't in awe of them,'' Malone said.
``It was more like we were upset more than anything, because we
knew we belonged, and we felt like we let it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is whether the Jazz can put all of its
knowledge to work in the Finals and put the pressure squarely on
the Bulls, who have never known the tight feeling that goes along
with returning home in a 2-0 hole, which they will do in this
series if Utah holds serve in the first leg of the 2-3-2 format.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if that's going to work in our favor or not,''
Sloan said. ``We've never had the home-court advantage in a
2-3-2.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike last season, the Jazz knows that if it wins the rest
of its home games, it will be champion of the world in two weeks.
But getting there won't be easy.

SUIT EXPOSES QUESTIONABLE TACTICS BY LAND CONSERVANCY GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH FALLS, N.Y. _ Karen Pardini and Michael Fink, two
middle-aged children of the back-to-the-land 1960s, had long had
their eyes on a largely untamed patch in the Shawangunk Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So when the land became available in 1986, they cobbled together
a down payment to buy 211 acres and began fixing up a tumbledown
barn. For eight years, they camped out in woods and took pleasure
in their land, sometimes hiking to a ridge at the end of their
property to savor the soaring views of the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, as Ms. Pardini walked along the road that cuts
across her property, she noticed pink and yellow ribbons put up by
a local surveyor. Someone else, she realized, coveted her property.
</P>
<P>
   It eventually turned out there was a claimant, and it was not a
wily real estate speculator but a land preservation group, the
Shawangunk Conservancy. The conservancy, one of 1,100 such groups
nationwide that pride themselves on their ethics by buying from
willing sellers with unclouded titles, had long desired the land as
a missing link in a 50-mile chain of ridgeland that it wants to
render forever wild for the pleasure of hikers and climbers.
</P>
<P>
   The group produced two unorthodox deeds that, it argued, proved
that it now had possession of almost half of the land Fink and Ms.
Pardini thought they owned.
</P>
<P>
   In the long, nasty quarrel that followed, a judge ruled in March
that the conservancy's deeds were worthless and said Ms. Pardini
and Fink could sue for fraud. As a result, the conservancy and
other groups that preserve land in the Shawangunks have found
themselves on the defensive. Even some other land preservationists
have accused the conservancy of overzealous tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land conservation for many people is a crusade,'' said David
Church, executive director of the New York Planning Federation,
which advocates sound land use. ``And well-meaning or not, what you
discover on a crusade is that the means are justified by the
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy is appealing the judge's decision. Keith
LaBudde, its president, says it acquired the disputed land in legal
and upright fashion because Ms. Pardini and Fink never
authentically owned it. He rejects the idea that his group should
have passed up the disputed land rather than distress people who
bought the land in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmentalists are supposed to be featherheads, is that
it?'' said LaBudde, a 63-year-old retired professor of computer
science. ``I think what you do is pursue with rigor, you look at
all the facts and approach it in a businesslike way.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has had some wider ramifications as well. Though the
conservancy is a small, 10-year-old organization, it works to
acquire land with much richer and better known organizations in New
York like the Mohonk Preserve and the Open Space Institute.
Together, the three groups have assembled more than 10,000 acres in
the breathtaking Shawangunks, which stretch from the Delaware River
almost to the Hudson and are the setting for the popular and
historic Mohonk Mountain House resort near New Paltz.
</P>
<P>
   The Pardini-Fink dispute is not the first in which residents in
the New Paltz-High Falls area have felt mistreated by
preservationists. At least two other landowners say that within the
last 10 years they were pressured to give up long-held mountainside
properties after they were barred from using the rights of way to
the land. The Mohonk Preserve eventually acquired the properties.
The preserve denies that it acted improperly and says that the
disputes were complicated by such factors as conflicts with
neighboring landowners.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, Fink and Ms. Pardini accuse the conservancy of trying
to steal their land by tactics more fitting a real estate operator
than an upright environmental group. ``Everybody knew it was our
property,'' Fink said in a recent interview. ``Just because the
bike wasn't in the backyard and tied up doesn't give you permission
to take it.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pardini had long craved the land. Almost 15 years before she
and Fink made the down payment, Ms. Pardini camped out at Smitty's
Dude Ranch here. It had a bar popular with hippies and was owned by
an engaging character, Wilbur Smith, who kept his land in his
wives' names.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Ms. Pardini, a midwife and teacher of African dance,
met Fink, who made a living selecting trees for lumber. They fell
in love and talked about one day buying ``Smitty's'' land. In 1986,
they raised enough for the $300,000 purchase by asking their
parents and a sister to mortgage their homes. Eight years later,
they saw the ribbons put up by Norman Van Valkenburgh, the
surveying consultant for both the conservancy and the Mohonk
Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Van Valkenburgh, a former director of lands and forests for the
state's Department of Environmental Conservation, has a crusty
appreciation of land disputes, writing mystery novels about such
conflicts with titles like ``Murder in the Catskills.'' Poking
around in deeds for land the conservancy might buy up for
preservation, he wrote a letter in 1994 to Smith's first wife, Mary
Lue, telling her ``it may come as a surprise,'' but she still owned
30 acres of Fink-Pardini land. A 1965 deed by which she conveyed
the land to his second wife ended with a comma in the middle of a
sentence, omitting the pages that described two parcels. Fink and
Ms. Pardini said it was a 30-year-old clerical error. Van
Valkenburgh said, ``How did I know it was a clerical error?''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy paid Mary Lue Smith $5,000 for her title. But in
an affidavit in the Fink-Pardini case, Mary Lue, who eventually
remarried Wilbur Smith as his third wife, said Van Valkenburgh and
the conservancy's counsel, Robert Anderberg, ``misled and tricked
me and my husband'' into accepting $5,000. She said they had
implied that the land was unclaimed and landlocked. Van Valkenburgh
replied that he showed the Smiths deeds and maps.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy also tried to claim another piece of
Fink-Pardini land using another deed with an aberrant pedigree. In
1982, two outdoorsmen, Wayne Kelder and his brother-in-law, Lars
Hagen, bought 40 acres of ridgeland for $7,000 from the heirs of a
woman whose own acquisitions were based on fuzzy deeds dating from
1911, 1928, 1937 and 1946. The boundaries were highly questionable,
defined only by the adjoining owners rather than by the usual
manner of distance and angle from the nearest roads.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kelder and Hagen admit they had only a sketchy idea of
where their land was, they spent 13 years hunting and cutting wood
on the property without protests, never realizing it was owned
first by the dude ranch and then by Ms. Pardini and Fink.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation of conflicting claims persuaded Hagen and
Kelder to sell the land to the conservancy for $37,500 rather than
become mired in costly litigation. LaBudde said he ``never had any
suspicion'' the land was owned by Ms. Pardini and Fink.
Nevertheless, he added, ``We recognized we were buying a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue the dispute has exposed is that deeds and tax maps can
be hazy in mountainous woodland where owners are cavalier about
boundaries. The location of the Kelder-Hagen claim is so uncertain
that Van Valkenburgh believes the conservancy can use it to assert
ownership of 136 acres of Pardini-Fink land.
</P>
<P>
   Van Valkenburgh believes that the Kelder-Hagen land is actually
the next parcel to the south. Yet, he maintains, the conservancy
can claim the land the outdoorsmen lived on by a legal principle
known as adverse possession, which entitles an occupant to
ownership of someone else's land if after many years there are no
protests.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Justice Vincent Bradley of New York Supreme Court in
Ulster County rejected the conservancy's deed for the Kelder-Hagen
parcel as worthlessly vague and its deed for the Pardini-Fink land
as exploiting an obvious clerical error.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pardini and Fink are not celebrating the judge's ruling.
They have spent $36,000 on legal fees and fear that in the appeals
process, the conservancy may have the resources to wear them down.
Twelve years after buying their land, they still live in a house in
Kingston, 10 miles away, because the money and time spent on the
dispute have stalled plans to make the barn habitable. Fink and Ms.
Pardini have been told they could get $2 million for their land.
But they say they will not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could you buy with the money that could replace this?''
Ms. Pardini asked, gazing out over her land.

MAYOR AND COUNCIL DEADLOCK OVER BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Negotiations over New York City's next budget broke
down Monday as the City Council prepared for the first time to pass
its own spending plan, perhaps as early as Friday, without the
agreement of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Council leaders said a breakthrough appeared unlikely because of
Giuliani's refusal to consider any changes that council members
have sought in his budget proposal unless Peter Vallone, the
speaker of the council, abandoned his referendum proposal on Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that if the council passed its own budget, he
would use his broad powers to make deep cuts in programs dear to
council members.
</P>
<P>
   After a fruitless 15-minute meeting between the two top
negotiators for the mayor and the council early Monday, Giuliani
and Vallone held dueling news conferences and, amid much
chest-thumping, said they would not budge from their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee Stadium has absolutely nothing to do with the adoption
of this budget, no matter how hard the mayor tries to make it,''
said Vallone, D-Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonexistent,'' Giuliani, a Republican, said when he was asked
about budget negotiations. Clearly relishing the possibility of a
fight with the council, the mayor added: ``I've read the City
Charter three times now. So we're ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last night, no budget meetings between the mayor and the
speaker's aides were scheduled for this week, officials involved in
the negotiations said, but if history is any guide, both sides
could resolve matters at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Under the City Charter, the council must adopt a budget by June
5 for the fiscal year beginning next month. Although City Hall
officials have routinely exceeded that deadline, they said they had
never encountered such a severe impasse before.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor and the speaker were able to reach agreement on
budgets that included painful cuts in city services during
Giuliani's first term, the current apparent deadlock seems
paradoxical, given the fact that the city is ending the 1998 fiscal
year with a record $2 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The battle started in April, when a 500-pound chunk of Yankee
Stadium fell into the seats, prompting renewed discussion about
building a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Giuliani
suggested using revenue from a commercial tax to help pay for a new
stadium. But Vallone, saying the public should have a say on
whether tax money should be used for a new stadium, called for a
referendum on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the referendum proposal now would be politically
difficult for Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
governor. Most council members, especially those in the Bronx and
Manhattan, oppose the idea of moving the Yankees south.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and other leaders want to change Giuliani's budget plan
to include a $1.4 billion cut in the personal income tax over three
years and $226 million more in spending on schools, libraries and
cultural programs. Council leaders said they were ready to draft
and pass their own budget on Friday. Such an action would be a
hostile move that the mayor could veto. The council could then
override the mayor's veto, after which the wrangling would probably
end up in court.
</P>
<P>
   The council has not passed its own budget since the 1989 City
Charter revision enabled it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate when schools are falling down,'' said Bruce
Bender, Vallone's chief of staff, ``when there's over 30,000 day
care slots that need to be filled, when libraries are at risk, when
there's overcrowding in the schools, that we are bogged down in an
issue that's not related to the budget.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Randy Mastro, deputy mayor for operations, said that while
council leaders were publicly saying that Yankee Stadium had
nothing to do with current budget talks, they had in fact privately
examined the issue. To buttress his point, the mayor's aides gave
reporters a page from the council's alternative budget plan, which
includes an item stating that a new Sports Facilities Corporation
can study the idea of a ball park, as long as it is not ``located
south of 125th Street in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Vallone is saying the stadium issue has nothing to do
with the budget,'' Mastro said, ``but his internal documents prove
quite the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McMahon, the council's finance director, said the Council
drew that provision because of the Giuliani administration's
unwillingness to negotiate unless the stadium issue was resolved.
The provision, he said, was in keeping with Vallone's opposition to
a ball park on the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, however, Giuliani barely mentioned the
nettlesome stadium issue. Casting himself as a fiscal conservative
trying to rein in a free-spending council, the mayor focused his
attacks on the council's proposal to spend an additional $226
million.

NORTHEAST BEGINS CLEANUP OF STORM AND TORNADO DEVASTATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Residents in New York, New Jersey and across the Northeast began
the arduous and often heartbreaking task Monday of cleaning up from
tornadoes and fierce thunderstorms that cut a destructive path
through the region.
</P>
<P>
   From early Sunday morning to early Monday morning, storms
flattened houses, felled trees, downed power lines and left two
people dead in New York, where tornadoes touching down with winds
topping 200 miles per hour devastated several northern areas of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the strongest severe weather breaks in a long
time,'' said Mickey Brown, a meteorologist with the Eastern
division of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, after touring some damaged areas Monday,
declared states of emergency in Broome, Saratoga, Rensselaer and
Otsego Counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Oneonta, Richard Simms, a 32-year-old carpenter, was killed
by a falling tree limb while working in his back yard Sunday
afternoon. Another person died of a heart attack in Stillwater,
Saratoga County. Hundreds of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the small Hudson River city of Mechanicville, in Saratoga
County, people returned home from shelters Monday to assess damage
and begin cleaning up, while families whose houses had been
destroyed moved in with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lights, power poles, homes are down _ just destruction,'' said
Frank Greenhall, superintendent of schools in Mechanicville, where
a tornado left at least 12 families homeless. ``Houses don't have
roofs or backs or fronts. There are families with whole homes
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross reported that in Broome, Otsego and Saratoga
Counties, 131 houses were destroyed and 90 were severely damaged.
Nearly 200 had lesser damage.
</P>
<P>
   Power company officials in upstate New York said 131,000 people
were without power Monday morning. They said power would be
restored to all customers by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, 50,000 people lost power in Morris, Passaic,
Ocean and Burlington Counties, but it was restored to most by
Monday afternoon, said Ron Marano, a spokesman for GPU Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed in some of the most severely damaged areas
of upstate New York, as well as in Massachusetts. But most, if not
all, are scheduled to open Tuesday. Even in Mechanicville, where
the lucky have days of cleaning up ahead and the unlucky must
rebuild their houses, the district's 1,400 children are scheduled
to be back in school Tuesday morning. ``We have to give the kids
some semblance of normality,'' said Greenhall.
</P>
<P>
   At a Red Barrel restaurant and service station in Milford in
Otsego County, tornado winds ripped out one gas pump and twisted
another, said Lisa Hoit, manager of a nearby branch of the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A huge cleanup job began Monday in central Massachusetts, the
worst-hit area of New England. In Winchendon, two men were killed
after a tree crushed their pickup truck. Elsewhere in the state,
several people were injured by the high winds and lightning, and a
tobacco barn in Hadley burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raging winds and tornadoes in New York state, there were
hailstorms throughout the Northeast. In Danbury, Conn., a hailstone
that was 1 3/4 inches in diameter was reported, the largest of this
storm, said Gary Conte, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Power failures were reported in Westchester and New York City,
according to a Con Ed spokesperson. In Westchester, about 3,000
homes lost power. One thousand Staten Island homes and 1,000 in
both Brooklyn and Queens also lost power. By Monday afternoon,
power was turned on again in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Trains arrived very late during rush hour on the New Haven line
of Metro-North Monday morning. All four tracks at the New Rochelle
station were shut because of damage to conducting wires. By early
morning two tracks had been restored, but 69 trains arrived up to
an hour late Monday morning, said Dan Brucker, a Metro-North
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There were half-hour delays on the Empire line of Amtrak. Trains
running from Atlantic City to Philadelphia on New Jersey Transit
were delayed when lightning hit an electrical transformer early
Monday morning, but they were running on time by evening.

   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Despite a healthy economy, Nassau County could
be running a $30 million deficit by the end of the year if sales
tax revenues continue to lag behind budget projections, the county
comptroller said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinct possibility of significant budgetary
shortfalls this year,'' and ``decisive action is warranted with
regard to some key areas,'' the comptroller, Frederick Parola, said
in his mid-year review of the county's $2.3 billion budget for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Expected sales tax revenues appear to be running $15 million to
$20 million behind projections, he said, based on a multi-year
trend and 1998 first-quarter receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Parola also said the county had budgeted more than $25 million
from land sales, including the sale of one parcel that that the
county does not yet own. One major sale, that of the Nassau County
Medical Center and nursing home, appears to be proceeding on
schedule, he said. However, Parola warned that failure to complete
this transaction would result in a $36 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Parola said the county could benefit from
$10 million in unexpected investment income and a potential $17
million savings in debt service.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Offtrack Betting could run $4 million over
expectations, and recently enacted recreation fee increases could
bring in an additional $1.6 million in revenue, he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis of George Washington met Monday night
with Ed Manetta, St. John's athletic director, becoming the fourth
coach to interview for the Red Storm's head basketball job.
</P>
<P>
   Manetta also spoke with Davidson's Bob McKillop, Siena's Paul
Hewitt and St. Bonaventure's Jim Baron last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was on Manetta's short list two years ago when the school
hired Fran Fraschilla, but he did not interview for the job. He has
a 253-141 record in 13 seasons as a Division I head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who coached at Boston University for five years and the
last eight at George Washington, reportedly earned about $600,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm is paying off settlements to both Fraschilla and
Brian Mahoney. Fraschilla earned $450,000 last season.

LEGISLATORS OPPOSE WHITMAN MOVE TO HIKE GASOLINE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman faces growing opposition
in the state Legislature over her proposal to raise the gasoline
tax by 7 cents a gallon to help finance improvements in
transportation and preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, the Democratic leader, said Monday
that the Senate's 16 Democrats would not support the tax increase.
Several top Republicans in the Legislature have also expressed
reservations, saying a gasoline tax increase should not be used for
open space. Without bipartisan support, it is unlikely that the
governor's proposal will win enough votes to get on the ballot in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman aides said they remained confident that the plan
would get legislative approval. ``We believe that achieving funding
for transportation projects and finding a stable source of revenue
for open space preservation are still achievable,'' said Whitman's
press secretary, Jayne O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday afternoon, Codey said he would
support a bond referendum in the fall to preserve open space. In
the last 37 years, New Jersey voters have approved nine similar
bond referendums, raising $1.39 billion to help protect more than
400,000 acres of farmland and other land from development. He said
he did not think a gasoline tax increase for transportation
projects was necessary now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just approved putting some money back in the pockets of
drivers with automobile insurance reform,'' said Codey, D-West
Orange. ``But now Governor Whitman wants to take it away even
before the savings arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, state Sen. Robert Littell, a Republican
who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he
would consider raising the gasoline tax for transportation
projects, but not for open space preservation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he supported alternate proposals in the Legislature to
raise money to buy undeveloped land in the state, including a bill
that would dedicate a quarter of a percent of existing sales tax
revenue for land purchases. He also said he would go along with
putting another bond referendum before the voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   For Whitman to get her proposal on the ballot this fall, she
would need a three-fifths vote of the Legislature: 48 votes in the
Assembly and 24 in the Senate. Without the support of Littell and
the 16 Democrats, she would have only 23 votes in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has called for 5 cents of the proposed 7-cent-a-gallon
increase to be used for transportation improvements and 2 cents for
the purchase of one million acres, about half of the remaining
undeveloped land in the state, during the next 10 years. The
increase would raise the state's gasoline tax, the lowest in the
region, to 21.5 cents a gallon from 14.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I talked about an increase in the gasoline tax
going on the ballot is because I want to see it constitutionally
dedicated so that money raised won't go to other things,'' Whitman
said after learning about Codey's remarks. ``What it means if we do
not identify a funding source is that we are not able to preserve
land, and we lose 10,000 acres a year in this state. We are losing
land every day, and it is important that if we care about open
space that we act now.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan's fate is uncertain in the Assembly as well.
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, a Republican who is chairman of the
Assembly Transportation Committee, said he did not believe that a
portion of a gasoline tax increase should be used for open space
preservation, but that he had not yet decided whether he would
support the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never wanted to see motor vehicle taxes diverted for
any reason other than transportation issues,'' DeCroce said.

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S RESPONSE TO A MOTION BY STARR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from papers filed Monday in
the U.S. Supreme Court by President Clinton in response to a motion
on Thursday by the independent counsel for an expedited review of
claims made by Clinton that would block the testimony of some of
his top aides: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STATEMENT OF THE CASE:
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, 1998, the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia (Johnson, C.J.), granted the relief sought in
motions filed by the O.I.C. [Office of the Independent Counsel)
seeking to compel Bruce Lindsey, deputy counsel to the President,
and Sidney Blumenthal, assistant to the President, to testify
concerning discussions they had had with the President of the
United States and with Presidential advisers. The President had
asserted that certain of the communications at issue were covered
by the Presidential communications privilege, the Governmental
attorney-client privilege, and the attorney work product doctrine.
...
</P>
<P>
   In its motions to compel, the O.I.C. raised two legal arguments.
First, it contended that, because the communications over which the
President had asserted the Presidential communications privilege
related to private conduct, the privilege did not apply at all.
Relying on this court's opinion in United States v. Nixon, the
District Court rejected that argument. Indeed, the District Court
found as a fact that the communications that the grand jury was
seeking were related to official decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the court has no evidence that Lindsey and
Blumenthal's conversations discussing the Lewinsky and Jones
matters were not related in some way to official decision-making.
To the contrary, the court has [REDACTED) sworn affidavits
asserting that the conversations at issue involve official matters
such as possible impeachment proceedings, domestic and foreign
policy matters, and assertions of official privileges. The Office
of the President submitted the affidavits ``to establish as a
factual matter that the communications in the White House over
which executive privilege was being asserted related to official
matters and official conduct.'' The grand jury transcripts provided
to the court do not indicate that the witnesses refused to answer
questions regarding conversations that did not relate to the
President's official duties. ...
</P>
<P>
   The O.I.C. also argued before the District Court that as a
matter of law, the President could not assert a Governmental
attorney-client privilege in the face of a Federal grand jury
subpoena. The District Court rejected this argument as well. The
court held that the President did enjoy a Governmental
attorney-client privilege with members of his counsel's office,
but, as was true of the Presidential communications privilege, it
could be overcome on O.I.C.'s showings of need and inability to
obtain the information from any other source. ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite the O.I.C.'s claims to the contrary, the fate of the
nation will not hang in the balance if the O.I.C. is required to
participate in the court of appeals on an expedited basis before
seeking this court's intervention. ... With the question presented,
with respect to the White House, narrowed to that arising out of
the Governmental attorney-client privilege, the benefits that this
court normally derives from fuller explication of legal issues by
the courts of appeals are particularly pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the O.I.C. is complaining that, in granting its
motion, a Federal district judge failed to follow a precedent set
by a Federal court of appeals in a different jurisdiction. But a
disagreement between a single district judge and a single court of
appeals does not amount to a circuit split that would warrant the
granting of certiorari, even in normal circumstances. ...
</P>
<P>
   On the merits, we believe that the O.I.C.'s position, which
rests principally on the proposition that 28 U.S.C. 535(b)
overrides the attorney-client privilege, is misguided. As a matter
of policy, the White House follows the dictates of section 535(b),
reporting to the Attorney General any information it receives of
violations of Title 18 by executive branch officials. We note,
however, that the statute, by its terms, does not apply to the
Office of the President. By contrast, it is apparent that the
O.I.C.'s investigation here is a precursor to a possible referral
to the House of Representatives. Such a proceeding would be against
the President in his official capacity, represented in that matter
by the Counsel to the President. Moreover, some of the questions
the O.I.C. has posed to Mr. Lindsey relate to advice to the
President about the assertions of privilege in this very
litigation. In this setting, where the White House is undeniably an
adversary of the O.I.C., the President is entitled to an absolute
attorney-client privilege for his discussions with White House
counsel, just like any other party to a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, allowing the court of appeals in this
case to assess the rationale of the Eighth Circuit's decision and
determine whether it ought to govern in the District of Columbia
will allow this court to benefit from the court of appeals'
informed deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   The petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment in the
court of appeals should be denied. &QL;

`THE DYING GAUL': DANGEROUS LIAISONS, ONLINE OR OTHERWISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is any act more vicious than the hoax
perpetrated against Robert, the tormented hero of Craig Lucas'
tortured new play, ``The Dying Gaul,'' it might be labeled a
psychic atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, played by Tim Hopper, still deep in mourning over his
dead lover Malcolm, takes up with Jeffrey (Tony Goldwyn), a
bisexual Hollywood producer married to Elaine (Linda Emond), who is
aware of Jeffrey's infidelity and is desperate to understand the
nature of his passion.
</P>
<P>
   With her trusty laptop, she enters the world of Internet chat
rooms posing as a gay man and, wouldn't you know it, there she
encounters the same Robert, a fellow seeker of online liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is unregenerate cruelty: In her male guise (and
having, by virtue of another unlikely complication, broken into the
office of Robert's psychiatrist and memorized his notes), Elaine
convinces Robert that she is the dead Malcolm, floating around in
his computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe in cyberghosts? Lucas, who in ``Prelude to a
Kiss'' displayed a lyrical gift for stories blending romance and
the occult, walks a decidedly darker path in ``The Dying Gaul,'' a
minor tantrum of a play about the kind of black grief that can
mutate into bottomless rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this plot-driven drama at the Vineyard Theater does at
times achieve a disquieting creepiness, thanks to the surehanded
direction of Mark Brokaw and a first-rate cast, led by Ms. Emond
and Hopper, that manages to sustain the dramatic tension, even when
compassion for these harsh characters is too much to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prelude to a Kiss'' took flight on the out-of-body energy
unleashed in the meeting of two pairs of lips; Lucas held you with
the pure poetry of wish fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dying Gaul'' is the somber epilogue to a love
foreshortened by death. Oddly enough, it's a much harder piece to
take seriously. Whimsy is supplanted here by mechanical
plot-twisting; Jeffrey and Elaine, for instance, just happen to
grow a rare plant with a fast-acting poison in their garden that
Robert just happens to recognize in a moment of blinding terror.
</P>
<P>
   It's a play that forces you, as with a clumsy thriller, to be
stingy with your credulity. The exercise proves as joyless as an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The motif of ``The Dying Gaul'' is loss, as it is observed from
neutral corners, whether by Robert's psychiatrist, Foss (Robert
Emmet Lunney), trying to help Robert over Malcolm's death; by
Elaine, absorbing Robert's suffering while surfing the Net; and
even by Robert, a writer whose screenplay about his relationship
with Malcolm, ``The Dying Gaul,'' is named for the Greek sculpture
of the Gallic warrior, frozen in pain and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, played by Hopper with an air of abject despair bordering
on panic, submits ``The Dying Gaul'' script to Jeffrey, a
hotshot-producer type familiar from a hundred other plays. Goldwyn,
himself a member of a famous film-producing family (and a
last-minute substitute for Cotter Smith, who was forced to drop out
after an injury), is fine in this obviously duplicitous Hollywood
role, in which he woos Robert while sealing deals on his cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The play inhabits a world of gorgeous surfaces _ Allen Moyer's
modern, sand-colored set of sliding screens is a little bit of Zen
in and around Los Angeles _ that is not the least bit inviting.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeffrey, in a hubristic act worthy of his profession,
brings Robert home to meet Elaine, an ethereal menage a trois is
enjoined. Ms. Emond brings a wonderful composure to the wronged
Elaine that almost makes her terrible trick on Robert, more
terrible by far than anything he does to her, seem a reasonable
revenge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scenes in which Robert and Elaine communicate by computer _
scenes that carry echoes of ``Closer,'' a play by Patrick Marber
about the hollow lives of four Londoners, that transferred to the
West End after a sold-out run at the National Theater last fall _
are easily the most engrossing and disturbing in ``The Dying
Gaul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am spirit without body _ your guardian,'' Elaine says,
chipping away at Robert's defenses until he reveals more about his
love, and his lovers, than is good for either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, unfortunately, is not very convincing in the resolution
of this act of manipulation, or in the final brinkmanship in the
marriage of Jeffrey and Elaine. Out of all these vacant
relationships, Robert and Jeffrey, Jeffrey and Elaine, Elaine and
Robert, comes a hostile conclusion that makes Robert seem smaller
and more embittered than one could possibly have been prepared for.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a play of extreme pessimism, a hope-dashing
experience that suggests that in the face of such desolation, the
remedy is not applause but heavy sedation.
</P>

SHE LOVES HER SON, MOTHER TELLS A JURY WEIGHING HIS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Telling jurors who are deciding whether her son
should be executed that his fate was really ``in the Lord's
hands,'' the mother of a former jail guard recounted Monday how she
fell apart when the police told her that her ``special child''
killed three people.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the bloody 1996 rampage that made her son, Darrel
Harris, the first person to be convicted of first-degree murder
under New York state's new capital punishment law, Bertha Harris
declared in a Brooklyn courtroom of rapt jurors and spectators,
``My love for my child has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him and I always will love him,'' the 71-year-old woman
said as her son, 40, stared at her intently from his seat at the
defense table in state supreme court. ``He will always have a
special place in my heart, regardless of what happens to him,'' she
continued, even as she acknowledged his ``very terrible crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris did not ask the jury to spare her son's life _ the
panel may sentence him to death or to life in prison without
possibility of parole _ saying instead: ``I don't know what
decision you all are making. That's not in my hands. It's in the
Lord's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But her son's lawyers clearly hope that Ms. Harris' appearance _
and her portrayal of him as a devoted son who a decade ago made her
proud when he was honored for saving the life of a fellow jail
guard during an inmate riot _ would help influence the jury to
forgo a death sentence. Deliberations are to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of intense emotion, a brother of Harris did ask the
jury to spare the convicted man's life. ``I don't really feel that
one incident, as great as it is, should determine his life, should
put his life on the line,'' the brother, Esau Harris, said.
</P>
<P>
   He was repeating a theme that his brother's lawyers have sounded
throughout the trial: that the jury should consider his entire
life, including his heroic act as a jail guard and his lack of a
criminal record before the murders he committed during a robbery at
an illegal social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only ask, dig deep in your hearts and search out the
truth and know that one day shouldn't count for someone's life,''
said Esau Harris, a senior systems engineer for a banking
corporation who is also an ordained minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway outside the courtroom, as a sister of Harris,
Shirley Smith, collapsed amid a swirl of television and newspaper
cameras, relatives of the people whom Harris murdered reacted
emotionally to the testimony by his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for the mother, she got my heart,'' said a crying
Detria Davis, the mother of Evelyn Davis, who was 32 when Harris
fatally stabbed her at Club Happiness on the morning of Dec. 7,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughter came to her in a vision Monday morning
``and told me she wasn't dead, but I know my daughter is dead,''
Ms. Davis, who is in her 50s, continued. ``And I don't feel sorry
for Harris. I don't feel sorry for him at all. Whatever they give
him, he deserves it. I'll keep on saying it till I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in the first stage of Harris' trial, which dealt with
the question of guilt or innocence, testified that after shooting
three men in the head at close range _ two died and one survived _
and finding himself out of bullets, Harris fatally stabbed Evelyn
Davis as she beseeched him to spare her life because ``I have five
babies to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses Sims, the brother of Jerome Sims, one of the two men
Harris killed, told reporters after listening to his relatives:
``Obviously, he came from a very nice family. But he's still a
killer and he still should get the death penalty. His family said
nice things about him, but I could say nice things about my
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Sims, who was 58, was the manager of Club Happiness and
was the first one shot after Harris pulled out a gun and ordered
everyone to get on the floor, witnesses testified. One of the
witnesses, Eddie Brown, the man who survived a shot in the head,
said Harris had demanded money from the victims and took $200 from
him.
</P>
<P>
   The third person killed was Michael Harris, 37; he was no
relation to the convicted man.
</P>
<P>
   One relative of a victim expressed resentment with Harris'
relatives because, she said as she left the courthouse, they were
making the victims' family members ``feel guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Darrel Harris' relatives was the last of the
trial, and Acting Justice Anne Feldman told the jury of seven women
and five men that they would begin deliberating his sentence
Tuesday.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET: BEAUTIFUL BODIES AND MYSTERIOUS PRIESTESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins' ``Afternoon of a Faun,'' a ballet
about beautiful bodies, received a beautiful performance when it
was offered by the New York City Ballet on Sunday afternoon at the
New York State Theater. What helped make it satisfying was
Alexandra Ansanelli's debut in the role of a dancer who has a brief
romantic encounter with another dancer while rehearsing in a
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ansanelli made her character a young woman who fully
realized how attractive she was, and she took delight in admiring
her long, flowing hair. No wonder she caught the eye of Damian
Woetzel, who played a dancer otherwise obsessed with contemplating
his own image in a mirror. But when he surprised her with a kiss,
Ms. Ansanelli's expression indicated that this woman was totally
unprepared for such attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Both dancers portrayed young people whose bodies had matured
more quickly than their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was also represented by ``Antique Epigraphs,'' which
resembles a series of ancient rituals on some Greek island. The
priestesses on this occasion were Helene Alexopoulos, Maria
Kowroski, Riolama Lorenzo and, for the first time in her role,
Monique Meunier. All moved with authority through mysterious
ceremonies for which Andrew Lolya served as the flute soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Looking appealingly wistful, Miranda Weese made her debut as a
visionary figure adored by Jock Soto in Peter Martins' ``Symphonic
Dances.'' But the ballet, which gets off to a stormy start, soon
grows long-winded and aimless. Ms. Weese's lyricism was better
displayed in a repeat performance of George Balanchine's
``Divertimento No. 15,'' which opened the program, conducted by
Hugo Fiorato.

OFFICER SAYS YOUNGSTER IMPLICATED FATHER IN DOUBLE HOMICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., _ On the opening day of New York's second
death penalty trial, a police officer testified that a 6-year-old
boy had implicated his father in a double homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Gregory Wagler described finding the boy, Anthony
Williams, crying and screaming that his father had shot him as he
sat in the back seat of a car. The boy, now 8, is expected to
testify later in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Edward
Whitesell told the jury that Dalkeith McIntosh, 38, had committed a
``final act of domestic violence'' on Aug. 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, he said, had shot his estranged wife, Francine
Williams, 47, twice in the head that day as she sat in the idling
car on a secluded street here. Whitesell said McIntosh then turned
his gun on the boy, who survived being shot in the face. And
finally, the prosecutor said, McIntosh murdered Mrs. Williams'
23-year-old daughter, Eunice, as she tried to flee the car.
</P>
<P>
   Part of McIntosh's motivation, the prosecutor said, was to
prevent Mrs. Williams from testifying against him in a pending
assault case and to make sure there would be no witnesses to her
death.
</P>
<P>
   But the defendant's lawyer, William Tendy, said the police had
picked up the wrong man and carefully rebutted each point raised by
the prosecution, in particular asking how Anthony Williams could
have said his father shot him if the boy had a mouth full of
shattered teeth. Tendy urged the jurors to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you hear is going to point to someone other than
this defendant,'' he said. ``And you will see the danger of
convicting someone _ let alone killing someone _ based on the
evidence you are going to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   If the jury finds McIntosh guilty of first-degree murder, it
will then decide on his punishment _ death by lethal injection or
life in prison without possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The first witness of the day, a woman who happened upon the
scene just after the shooting, appeared to cloud the prosecution's
case. She said the gunman was carrying a shiny, silver revolver _
something that looked very different from the dull, black weapon
shown to her as evidence in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors had already heard in Whitesell's opening statement
that the murder weapon was missing in a swampy area for nearly a
year after the shootings, and that exposure could have altered its
coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Proceedings in the small courtroom were quiet and orderly _ even
when McIntosh turned and waved at the mother of one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that he has no conscience,'' said Francine Williams'
mother, Maxine Green, with tears in her eyes.

 EX-MCI EXECUTIVES ADMIT GUILT IN FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three former managers at MCI International in Piscataway, N.J.,
pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges of accepting $312,000 in
kickbacks from companies seeking to do business with the company.
</P>
<P>
   John Vicari, 45, of Marlboro, N.J., former senior manager of
information technology; Richard Thies, 55, of Randolph, N.J., who
was director of operations; and John Mastromarino, 58, of
Spotswood, N.J., former senior manager of network operations,
admitted that between 1990 and 1995 they had accepted the money
from three vendors of office supplies and security and computer
consulting services in exchange for contracts with the company, a
unit of MCI Communications Corp., the United States' second-largest
long-distance telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Thies also pleaded guilty to defrauding MCI of $250,000 by
paying for computer products and services the company did not
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Vicari told Judge Katherine Hayden in U.S. District Court in
Newark, N.J., that he received more than $180,000 in the scheme.
Mastromarino admitted receiving $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three more MCI officials, including a vice president, were also
involved in the scheme, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Liebman, an assistant U.S. attorney, declined to say
whether the other MCI executives or the vendors would also be
charged, but he added that he expected additional proceedings
Wednesday concerning the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 10. Vicari faces up to 10
years in federal prison and $500,000 in fines; Thies faces eight
years and $500,000, and Mastromarino three years and $250,000,
Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that justice is served,'' MCI said in a
statement. ``In this case, MCI was the victim of the crime. MCI
paid for products and services which we never received.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz may be within sniffing distance of its
first NBA title, but the Chicago Bulls sense something else in the
air.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the sweet smell of six-cess.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls and Michael Jordan will be gunning for their sixth NBA
championship in the '90s when they take on the Jazz in the
championship series starting Wednesday night at the Delta Center, a
rematch of last year's NBA Finals won by Chicago in six games.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much time for the Bulls to recover from their
physically demanding battle in the Eastern Conference finals, in
which they edged Indiana 88-83 in Game 7 on Sunday at the United
Center. Utah, meanwhile, has been sitting around since eliminating
the Los Angeles Lakers on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has an excellent chance of going out there and
stealing one of the first two games,'' said Indiana coach Larry
Bird. ``Utah has been lying around for 10 days. I was in that
situation one time. I think we had eight days off, and there's no
way you can stay in game shape by sitting around. So Chicago has a
great opportunity to go out there and get one early.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen is hoping Bird is correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back over the season at some of the games you should
have won, and it comes back to haunt you,'' the Bulls forward said.
``We go into this next series now not having the home-court
advantage. But with all the time off Utah has had, it could work in
a negative way for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago coach Phil Jackson wasn't sure how the quick turnaround
will affect his team, which isn't exactly overflowing with young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very curious to see how we're going to recover,''
Jackson said. ``We're going to have two days off, and that's not a
lot of time. But then again, we're going to be playing hard, and
we're going to battle tougher, because that's what happens when you
play all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utah runs a great fast break, and they move the ball up and
down the court quickly. If we're fatigued and can't get up and down
in transition, it's going to hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   As if anything can hurt the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   There were whispers that the Chicago dynasty was teetering on
the brink, that a combination of age and the incessant talk about
dismantling the team when the season ends had sapped the Bulls of
their drive.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, who registered a near triple double (28 points,
nine rebounds and eight assists) in the Game 7 victory over the
Pacers, feels something else has been chipping away at the Bulls _
human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is trying to do something for the third time, it's
not uncommon to lose focus at certain times,'' Jordan said. ``You
have to fight yourself, basically, to excel as a team. I think
that's the battle we deal with now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a great team we're about to play against, but when
you talk about a team (the Bulls) that has won so much, achieved so
much, and an organization that has won so much, a lot of times it's
a battle against yourself. The expectations are there, and you try
to live up to those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe you come into the situation a little cocky, with a
little swagger, which you can understand, and you don't put forth
the team effort. That's just human nature. That's something that
you just can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Bulls have pretty much been able to control
through the years _ the home court _ will not be in their favor
this time. While the Bulls were busy ringing up 72 and 69 wins over
the previous two championship seasons, they won just 62 games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good, but not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Utah also won 62 games but swept the two meetings with the Bulls
during the regular season, giving the Jazz the home-court advantage
in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before during the Bulls' championship reign, in the
1993 Finals against the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns, did
Chicago not have the home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one year,'' Jackson said. ``Obviously that was a
unique year, because we won both of the opening games (in
Phoenix).''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson and the rest of the Bulls think the Eastern
Conference finals against the Pacers was a tremendous tutorial for
the Jazz. Just like Utah, Indiana loves to fast-break. And just
like Utah, the Pacers have a deep bench. Neither Bird nor Utah's
Jerry Sloan is afraid to use his reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about Utah, they played very well this season,''
Jackson said. ``Their bench is very similar to Indiana's. I think
this was a very good preparatory series for us as far as the type
of matchups and the type of energy their bench gives them _ the
relief they get from their bench players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team that has much more poise and moxie than a lot of
teams in the league because of their veterans. The matchups are
going to be very difficult for us. (John) Stockton and (Karl)
Malone, obviously, and some of their players coming off the bench
have played very well in the playoffs.''

THE LAST OF THE GIRLS' SCHOOL GRANDES DAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edes Gilbert will soon be the last of the grandes
dames to step down as head of a selective New York City private
girls' school, and thus ends an era of powerful women who cloaked
their ambitions in plummy diction and good manners.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert recalls that when she first arrived on the Upper
East Side to pull the Spence School out of a slump, she was greeted
by her friend Evelyn Halpert of Brearley, the girls' school of
choice for the city's intellectual elite. ``It was clear to me that
Brearley was running away with the admissions,'' Mrs. Gilbert said.
``It's not that I'm competitive or anything, but I did say, `Watch
out!'''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Mrs. Gilbert, 66, is retiring as head of an
institution that has given Brearley a good run. Spanish at Spence
now starts in third grade, Japanese in seventh. There are courses
on India, Africa and China. Minority enrollment is up to 17
percent, and the endowment has reached $31 million. (It was $5
million when Mrs. Gilbert took over.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to fund-raise,'' Mrs. Gilbert said, which would make
her rare among school administrators. ``I know for a while there
was a joke that `If you get a call from Edes Gilbert for breakfast
at the Carlyle, leave your checkbook at home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert talked last week about her school, her life and her
future in her office on East 91st Street overlooking Central Park.
No one has ever called her shy, and she comes with a sense of humor
_ probably the essential requirement in running a private girls'
school with any number of rich, famous and self-important parents.
``School can be a very funny place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert dismissed as a ``minor dust-up'' the 10 weeks last
year that Soon-Yi Previn, now Woody Allen's wife, spent as a Spence
student teacher, and said she wondered whatever happened to
Shakespeare when the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, the school's most
famous recent alumna, gushed on television about all the women
whose works she had read at Spence.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after a handful of girls told Spence students and
teachers that they considered themselves bisexual, Mrs. Gilbert
seemed to take it in stride, and had in a gay psychiatrist to talk
to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find a lot of girls exploring various aspects
of their sexuality,'' she said. ``I think it's part of growing up
in New York City, to tell you the truth. In fact, I think it would
be odd if these girls didn't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, when Mrs. Gilbert presides over her last Spence
commencement, she leaves private girls' education in good shape.
Like the other retired grandes dames (Mrs. Halpert at Brearley,
Millie Berendsen at Chapin, Joan McMenamin at Nightingale-Bamford),
she is convinced that girls thrive free of the pressures of boys.
``You don't have to cry, you don't have to flirt,'' Mrs. Gilbert
said. ``You can just say what's on your mind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She herself is a product of Vassar, when it was all female, and
has spent parts of her life married, divorced and widowed. From
1970 to 1980, she worked full-time and was the single parent to
three children. ``That was not easy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert grew up Edes (pronounced EEDS) Powell in Brooklyn
Heights, descended from New England Yankees like John Edes, the
captain of an early 19th-century clipper ship that brought
treasures back from China.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a feature writer for The New York World-Telegram and
Sun, died when she was 5; her mother wrote for magazines, including
an article about traveling with children, for a publication called
You. ``She had all sorts of instructions,'' Mrs. Gilbert said.
``One of them was `Keep your child on a harness.' I was always on a
leash. Which may say more about what kind of child I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert graduated in 1953 and did what was expected. ``I
got my M.R.S. pretty quickly,'' she said. She had three children,
but by 1970 the marriage was over. ``I left him,'' she said.
``There isn't a more glamorous way to put it.'' She taught at a
boys' school near Boston, became headmistress of a private girls'
school in St. Louis and remarried in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Her second husband, Peter Gilbert, a cable-system owner, had
been part of the Israeli Irgun, or underground; he fled Vienna,
Austria, with his parents, who changed their name from Gans, just
ahead of the Nazis. He died of cancer in 1989, just three months
after Mrs. Gilbert presided over the funeral of a Spence teacher,
who had also died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, of course, because I knew I was going to lose
Peter,'' she said, recalling the silence at the service as both
``beautiful and hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert will now be a part-time consultant to private
schools. Former heads, she said, are not so much retired as
recycled. And she can always give advice about how to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people don't like asking for money is because they
think of it as raising money,'' she said. ``I think of it as
fulfilling a dream. So my language is the language of investment:
`Your daughter is in this school. We want to have the best library
we can. This is what we need to get the job done.''' After a first
meeting, she said: ``Then you go back and see them. And at that
point, if you haven't already, you say, `I hope you'll consider a
gift in the range of ....' And you have to be careful that you hit
a high enough range, so that you're complimenting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``You do not ask for money over breakfast at the
Carlyle.''

MLICKI LOOKS BAD IN METS' LOSS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Hideo Nomo is looking for work. Brian Bohanon would
rather start than relieve. And Bill Pulsipher is chafing at Norfolk
over the possibility of pitching in the major leagues again.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means Dave Mlicki should be looking over his
shoulder about now.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the strongest staffs in the majors, Mlicki has been
the weak link. Monday night, another poor outing by the 29-year-old
right-hander helped break the Mets' string of nine straight
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (1-4) allowed four runs, three of them earned, in six
innings in a 4-3 loss to Jason Schmidt (8-1) and the Pittsburgh
Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium. The hole Mlicki dug for them led
to the end of the Mets' longest winning streak in nearly seven
years and was just too deep for them to overcome, even though they
rallied for three runs in the last two innings.
</P>
<P>
   In losing for only the second time in 13 games, about the only
things that went right for the Mets were Mike Piazza's first home
run with the team, which spoiled Schmidt's bid for a shutout with
two out in the eighth, and three more hits from Carlos Baerga, who
is now batting .306.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, whose earned run average over 10 starts is 5.68, did not
have it from the start. By his third pitch, the Mets trailed by 1-0
on a home run by Tony Womack, the Pirates' leadoff batter. After
Mlicki walked the No. 7 and No. 8 hitters in the Pittsburgh order
to open the second inning, both scored, and the Mets were down by
three runs after two innings. It was a deficit that even these new
and improved Mets could not overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Mets' pitching and defense had often been able
to compensate for a lack of hitting. And during the last 10 days,
the hitting _ bolstered immeasurably by the addition of Piazza, who
has hit safely in each of his eight games with the Mets _ had been
able to offset lapses in pitching. But Monday night, no pitching,
no defense (three errors, tying a season high) and very little
hitting (just six hits off Schmidt after the Mets had 100 in the
previous seven days) translated into only one thing: the Mets'
first defeat in 10 games, and their first in eight with Piazza
behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That it came with Mlicki on the mound could only lead to
questions about how long he would remain in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really tough on himself, to the point of being a little
ridiculous sometimes,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said before the
game. ``I don't see him as being so unique in his worries, his
efforts and his results as a lot of people do. The difference is
he's had pretty good stuff, and he's had it work in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not lately, however. Over his last three starts, Mlicki has
allowed 13 earned runs in 151/3 innings, with an ERA 7.63. When do
the guarantees end, Valentine was asked before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time is right for them to end,'' the manager said.
``He started last year, and I remember all the same questions. It
was very similar to Carlos Baerga's situation. He was the pitching
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel he's the best starting on my staff. Because
some people don't understand that, I sometimes say, `Too bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine also said: ``I don't like to make promises or
assure anybody anything. Remember, this is the big leagues. One guy
has the opportunity. And three or four guys are waiting for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those guys could include Nomo, who is a close friend of the
Mets' Masato Yoshii and who thrived with Piazza as his catcher in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Mets pass on Nomo, Bohanon and Pulsipher are waiting
in the wings. But Valentine feels he has Bohanon slotted in just
the right spot as a long reliever/spot starter. And the Mets may
feel Pulsipher is not yet ready for the prime time again.
</P>
<P>
   So Mlicki might remain in the rotation by default. For how long
might be the better question.

STREET VENDORS SAY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THREATENED
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadening their efforts to limit what they see as
dangerous congestion on New York City's sidewalks, city officials
said Monday that their vending ban would include not only food
carts but also street sales of books, baseball cards, art, T-shirts
and all other goods.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious enforcement plan targets yet another signature of
the Manhattan streetscape and potentially courts a First Amendment
battle, according to opponents of the restrictions. The widening of
the ban also gives food vendors a host of potential new allies as
they seek to build opposition to the rules by staging a citywide
shutdown of the carts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions, to be enforced by the police beginning in
about mid-July, cover 144 blocks of Manhattan, including much of
the financial district and several stretches of midtown. In the
past, the city has designated some areas where food vending was
prohibited and others where vending of general merchandise like
clothing was banned. Peddlers of books and other printed matter
were accorded the widest latitude because of their First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Earl Andrews Jr., chairman of the city's Sidewalk Vendor
Review Panel, which approved the 144-block ban, said the
restrictions approved by the panel applied to vendors of both food
and general merchandise, and thus covered artists and those who
sell printed matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a street is congested, it's going to be congested, whether
it's a food vendor or a general vendor,'' said Andrews, who is
commissioner of the Department of Business Services. ``All vending
should exist in an area where there is no congestion and no threat
to the safety of the citizens and the flow of traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Street artists, who have been persistent critics of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, said they would join the food vendors in a
demonstration that is to begin at 9 a.m. Wednesday in City Hall
Park, to be followed with a lunchtime march to Wall Street and
back.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lederman, president of Artists' Response to Illegal State
Tactics, said the wider ban would mean that ``fundamental elements
of free speech and alternative expression'' would be ``the next
casualty in the mayor's quality of life campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about hot dogs,'' Lederman said. ``Mayor
Giuliani's war on vendors is virtually eliminating free expression
from large areas of New York City's public streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Taussig, the chief of the administrative law division of
the city's Law Department, said peddlers of books and other printed
matter, including collectors' cards, were exempt from city
regulations requiring vendors to be licensed. But he said the city
was allowed to place limits on their displays _ for instance, how
much space they take up on a sidewalk and their proximity to a
subway entrance. Under the same rationale, he said, the city could
limit the streets on which the vendors could set up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of street artists, Taussig said that under a 1996
decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the artists have
the same rights as book vendors. ``The legal principle is that we
have to give the greatest deference to vendors engaged in First
Amendment activity,'' Taussig said. The standard has been that book
vendors were disallowed in places where both food and
general-merchandise vendors were prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials were elaborating on comments that
Giuliani had made at a news conference earlier Monday, when he had
seemed to doubt whether the city could impose the same restrictions
on book merchants that it would impose on food carts. Asked whether
the regulations would also apply to book vendors, the mayor said:
``The rules apply to food vendors. The rules with regard to book
vendors are different because of their additional First Amendment
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Anthony Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat who has
called for the abolition of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, said
the broad enforcement was ``intellectually consistent'' on the part
of the administration but that it put Giuliani in a potential
``legal thicket.'' Wiener charged that the review panel's decisions
were arbitrary and were targeted in many cases at neighborhoods
where ``sophisticated lobbying'' resulted in vendor bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is a process built more on politics than on public
safety,'' Weiner said. ``Although courts may allow that when it
comes to buying a hot dog, they can be expected to have a higher
standard when it comes to the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, the chairman of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, said
the official list of vending restrictions would be published by the
city in two to three weeks. Enforcement is to begin 30 days after
that. He said many areas would remain open to vending, and asserted
that the availability of goods ``is not going to drastically change
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vendors are a part of the fabric of New York,'' Andrews said.
``We are not trying to stop vending. We are only regulating it.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, the vendor review panel will begin reviewing a
second round of petitions for more bans on vending. On Friday,
officials made available 40 petitions covering 95 blocks of
Manhattan, filed by a broad array of New York institutions, from
the Museum of Modern Art to Lenox Hill Hospital. Andrews said at
least 25 more petitions had been received.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apple Food Vendors Association, which is organizing
Wednesday's march, said 2,000 more corners were at risk of being
restricted. The mayor's staff discounted that figure as a wild
exaggeration.

REASONS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT A DUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (See NY-GOLF-COURSE)  (ja)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Nicklaus has designed golf courses in the
desert, on tropical islands and in remote wooded areas. But
building a golf course on a Bronx garbage heap should rank as one
of his most creative projects.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' company has released only a preliminary sketch of a
design for the course, to be built on 175 marshy and undeveloped
acres in Ferry Point Park. It is hard to predict what sort of
course golfers should expect, because Nicklaus prides himself on
variety, and the characteristics and terrain of a site go a long
way toward determining what kind of course he creates.
</P>
<P>
   But there is certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality
of the layout. The list of courses that Nicklaus has designed,
either as the project chief or as a consultant, is impressive.
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, the sight of the
Memorial Tournament that was won by Fred Couples on Sunday, is
regarded as one of the world's finest courses.
</P>
<P>
   While Muirfield may be Nicklaus' best work, his other acclaimed
courses include Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario;
Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Miss.; Castle Pines Golf Club in
Castle Rock, Colo., and Grand Cypress in Orlando. All of these have
hosted PGA Tour or Senior Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Jack Nicklaus, My Story,'' Nicklaus laid out some
general guidelines for what he called a ``well-balanced golf
course.'' For example, he said, a course should have one long
par-five hole _ where even the best players would have trouble
reaching the green in two shots _ one ``definitely reachable''
par-five hole, and two others par-fives that would be reachable
depending upon weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sought similar variety in the par-three holes, and
added, ``Ideally, they should go in different directions to vary
the wind factor.'' He also noted that he liked to include water
hazards on about a third of the holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I take the greatest pride in as a designer is
honesty _ not tricking up holes, trying to keep everything out in
the open,'' Nicklaus wrote. ``I don't want to play with the
golfer's mind, just make him or her use it fully.''

 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Robert Young, a longtime president and publisher of
Family Circle magazine who guided the publication through growth
here and abroad, died after a short illness last Wednesday in
Greensboro, N.C, where he lived. He was 78.
 &HT;    Young joined Family Circle in 1968 as vice president and
assistant to the president. He was named publisher in 1970 and
president in 1975. During his tenure, the magazine expanded into
Australia and Japan and began publishing a Chinese-language edition
for the Hong Kong and Taiwan markets. Family Circle was purchased
by The New York Times Company in 1971 and sold in 1994.
 &HT;    Before joining Family Circle, Young was a senior vice president
and member of the board of directors of the advertising agency
Benton &AMP; Bowles Inc. in New York, now D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP;
Bowles. He joined the agency as an account executive in 1956 and
worked for clients that included Procter &AMP; Gamble and General
Foods.
 &HT;    He was a former squadron commander who served in the Army Air
Corps during World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Flying
Cross and the Air Medal with Cluster. He was a native of New York
City and attended City College in 1941.
 &HT;    Young is survived by his wife, Judith; two daughters, Melinda
Rosengarten of Carmel, N.Y., and Julie O'Connor of Swampscott,
Mass., and two sons, Steven, of Vermont, and Christopher, of
Carmel. He is also survived by a sister, Lenore Cerrone of Carmel,

   NEW YORK _ Dominick Corso, a New York Civil Court judge and
former city councilman, died May 23. He was 90 and lived in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Corso won election to the city council in 1960 and served on it
for nine years, representing the Bushwick-East New York district.
Among his responsibilities was serving as head of the committee
that oversaw the city's anti-poverty programs. He was chairman of a
committee that fought, without success, to create a review board of
City Council members to investigate reports of police brutality;
the Police Department and Patrolmen's Benevolent Association
opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he was appointed to fill an opening on the bench of the
New York City Civil Court by Mayor John Lindsay and later that year
was elected to a 10-year term after being nominated by both the
Democratic and Republican parties. Dominick Corso was born in
Brooklyn on Nov. 6, 1907. He began pre-law studies at St. John's
Pre-Law School and graduated from St. John's University in 1931. He
is survived by his wife, Lillian; two sons, Anthony of McLean, Va.,
and Robert of Staten Island; a daughter, Carol Ann Canapari of
Glastonbury, Conn., and four grandchildren.

MERGER MAY BOOST AMGEN'S PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The news that drug makers American Home Products
Corp. and Monsanto Co. will merge in a $34.4 billion stock swap has
revived speculation over the future of biotechnology powerhouse
Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal announced early Monday, American Home
will exchange 1.15 shares for each Monsanto share, based on
Monsanto's closing price Friday of $55.56 a share.
</P>
<P>
   American Home makes products such as Advil painkiller and Chap
Stick lip balm. Monsanto makes products ranging from the artificial
sweetener Nutrasweet to Roundup herbicide, and is active in
agricultural biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Management of the two midsize companies determined they could no
longer face bigger rivals alone. If shareholders and regulators
approve the merger, it would create a $96 billion life sciences
company with $3 billion in expected annual profits. The new entity,
still to be named, will be 65 percent owned by American Home
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The stock swap provides American Home with a strong partner
following a difficult year. In September, the company withdrew two
obesity drugs after it was found they could cause coronary
bleeding. And earlier this year, merger talks with British drug
maker SmithKline Beecham PLC collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   For Monsanto, the merger has allowed the company to choose its
business partner rather than have an acquisition thrust upon it. A
mid-May report in Business Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column
said Monsanto, along with Amgen, was a leading candidate for a
takeover by chemicals giant DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, DuPont has made clear it plans to be a major player in
the biotechnology arena, with Chief Executive Officer Charles
Holliday Jr. saying he expects drugs and biotechnology to account
for one-third of the company's sales within five years, compared to
18 percent today. The company recently agreed to pay more than $2
billion for a 50 percent stake Merck &AMP; Co. holds in a biotech joint
venture the two companies formed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   With Monsanto now effectively off the market, Amgen is one of
the few remaining firms that immediately could thrust DuPont to the
front of the biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   What would make a DuPont bid plausible, said Genesis Merchant
Group Securities analyst Robert LeBoyer, is that Amgen's research
and development infrastructure is unmatched in the industry. The
company spent $152.5 million on R&AMP;D in the first three months of
this year, and it has 12 potential medicines in various stages of
development for diseases ranging from obesity to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Amgen is experiencing slowed growth in sales of its
two standard-bearer drugs and has no blockbuster products near
completion to make up the difference. The projected earnings growth
shortfall could make institutional investors particularly receptive
to a takeover offer, especially one as generous as the $25 billion
-- or $95 a share -- DuPont was rumored to be considering for
Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities analyst Caroline Copithorne said there is
far more logic in a DuPont purchase of Amgen than similarly rumored
deals in the past featuring pharmaceutical companies such as
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Eli Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually no commercial biotech drug presence currently,
she said, DuPont would benefit from getting Amgen's research brains
and marketing brawn. Existing drug companies like Eli Lilly already
have their own sales forces and would therefore be paying at least
in part for redundant personnel, Copithorne said.
</P>
<P>
   But both Copithorne and LeBoyer said a DuPont bid for Amgen
remains a long shot. ``For one, I don't think Amgen is looking to
be acquired,'' LeBoyer said. And while DuPont wants to grow its
biosciences presence, it is still digesting the Merck purchase,
Copithorne said. Taking on Amgen any time soon would strain the
company's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not sure that's the route DuPont would want to
take,'' she said.

CLASSICAL CDS: BITTER, LIGHT, THEN GLORIFYING RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biography and historical context inevitably shape the way
listeners understand a composer's music, and in the case of Dmitri
Shostakovich, those details are freighted with the nightmarish
interaction between the composer and the Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, though, that even a listener entirely
unaware of Shostakovich's story could listen to his major works _
the symphonies, quartets and operas _ and not get a sense of what
he was about. It may be a confusing sense, actually: Works seeming
to glorify the state mingle with works of bitterness and intensity
that seem mainly to evoke struggle and protest. It can seem, in
fact, as if bitterness was his driving force.
</P>
<P>
   But Shostakovich also had a lighter side. Dmitri Kitaenko,
conducting the Frankfurt Radio-Sinfonie Orchestra, offers four
suites that are as cloud-free as anything Shostakovich composed
(RCA 09026-68304-2). Two of them, the Ballet Suites, Nos. 1 and 3,
are compilations of dances from Shostakovich's early ballets and
movements from his incidental music for the theater, cobbled
together by Lev Atovmyan to help raise money for Shostakovich after
he was denounced as a formalist in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the suites are meant to entertain rather than
challenge, and they do so cheerily by way of lilting waltzes and
vibrant galops, all orchestrated with the same vitality one hears
in the more serious works. Also on the disc are the two Suites for
Jazz Orchestra, composed in 1934 and 1938. There is nothing
particularly jazzy about them, although the closing fox trot of the
Suite No. 1 could be mistaken for one of Kurt Weill's Berlin
cabaret works, in both instrumentation and melodic accent.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich's light side sometimes had a biting edge, as in
``Rayok,'' a satirical 20-minute opera originally scored for
soloists and choir with piano accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which parodies Stalin and his functionaries and
skewers their artistic pronouncements, was written for the private
entertainment of Shostakovich's musician friends and was not
published in the composer's lifetime. The work has had several
performances in New York, most recently in November, when Vladimir
Spivakov led the Moscow Virtuosi in his own orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   Spivakov and his orchestra have now recorded that version with
the Moscow Choir Theater and its principal soloist, Aleksei
Mochalov (Musicmasters 01612-67189-2). The vivid performance
conveys the work's spirit, although Musicmasters was remiss in not
including a translation of the text.
</P>
<P>
   The disc also includes the song cycle ``From Jewish Poetry''
(Op. 79a), sung with moving beauty by Nikolai Kurpe, Marina Ahukova
and Yelena Svechnikova, and a robust account of the invitingly
lyrical Concertino (Op. 94), originally a piano duet but reworked
as a piano concerto by Julia Ziberquit, who is the energetic
soloist here.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing Shostakovich's scoring decisions, now a
venerable industry, began during Shostakovich's lifetime and with
his approval. These days the String Quartet No. 8 (Op. 110) is
heard more frequently in Rudolf Barshai's expansion, as the Chamber
Symphony (Op. 110b), than in its original form.
</P>
<P>
   It is included, in a sharply accented, acid-toned and unusually
high-contrast reading, on an all-Shostakovich disc by the Chamber
Orchestra Kremlin, conducted by Misha Rachlevsky (Claves CD
50-9115). Its companions are the Symphony for Strings (Op. 118b) _
Barshai's less-known orchestration of the String Quartet No. 10 _
and Rachlevsky's transformation of the dark-hued Quartet No. 15
into a Requiem for Strings (Op. 144b).
</P>
<P>
   The latest trend in midpriced reissues is to strip boxed sets of
their jewel boxes and package the individual discs in cardboard
sleeves. This is good news for the space-conscious: A
conventionally packaged Shostakovich symphony cycle takes about 5
inches of shelf space; a compact new reissue of Mstislav
Rostropovich's recordings of the 15 Symphonies (Teldec 0630-17046,
12 compact discs) takes only 1 inch.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it is an eloquent and impassioned traversal.
Some of Rostropovich's tempos and phrasing ideas are
unconventional, but as an intimate of the composer he can claim a
measure of authority, and his interpretive twists make for
consistently compelling and enlightening listening.

 &HT;    Georgia native jailed in Ecuador is indicted

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jim Williams, the St. Simons Island, Ga. native who
has been in jail in Ecuador for 20 months, has been indicted by a
federal grand jury in Florida on charges he was part of a cocaine
smuggling operation, according to an indictment made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His family in Georgia welcomed the news as a glimmer of hope
that he soon would return to the United States, even if it is to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begged them to indict Jim because we thought it was the
only way to get a fair trial,'' Charlie Williams, a St. Simons
Island restaurateur and brother of Jim Williams, said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose cause has been taken up by former President
Jimmy Carter and members of Congress, was named in three counts of
a six-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It described an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering
ring led by Jose Castrillon, a Colombian from whom Williams bought
fish for his Jacksonville, Fla. importing company.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury in Tampa, Fla. also indicted Castrillon and 14
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), one of several members of Congress
who have questioned Williams' treatment in Ecuador, said the
indictment should lead to his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., he would receive a fair and timely trial,''
Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress also have questioned the circumstances of
Williams' arrest in Ecuador in September 1996, a month after a Drug
Enforcement Administration official told his counterparts in
Ecuador that Williams was part of Castrillon's alleged drug ring.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Robin, said he was arrested in Ecuador to
pressure him to testify against Castrillon.

 &HT;    Lawyer pleads no contest to DUI charges for Gilkey
 &HT;    By Scott Cech
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The New York Mets outfielder who denied
to police he was too drunk to drive in March, pleaded no contest
Monday to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced Bernard Gilkey, 31,
to a year of probation and 50 hours of community service. His
license was suspended for six months and he must attend DUI classes
and pay $250 plus court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was not in court when his attorney, Richard Kibbey,
entered the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey said his client decided to plea no contest to the charges
because there was no videotape of his arrest, meaning the case
would boil down to his word against that of the two police
officers. He also didn't want to interrupt his ball playing for a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a phenomenal season right now,'' Kibbey said. ``He
wants to focus his energies towards what he does best.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing reporters soon after his arrest, Gilkey said he'd had
``a couple of beers'' on his way home but denied his driving was
impaired. He was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I want to make, yes, I did make a mistake, and the
mistake probably, most definitely, was driving after having a
couple of beers,'' Gilkey said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dropped a charge of driving with license suspended.
A charge of failing to drive within a single lane was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3 Port St. Lucie, Fla. police pulled over Gilkey's
leased 1998 Cadillac at 1:30 a.m. _ half an hour past his curfew.
Police said the ballplayer was driving westbound at about 55 mph on
Port St. Lucie Boulevard, where the limit is 40 mph. Gilkey slammed
on his brakes and had to swerve to avoid a concrete median when
officers behind him turned on their blue lights, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Maycen wrote in his report that Gilkey smelled like
alcohol and ``seemed to be confused'' when Maycen pulled him over.

TAKING CARE OF RANGE WINS RANCHER $250,000 GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Genius? Him? Bill McDonald thought it was a joke when
he answered the phone Wednesday at his isolated ranch near the
Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right, he thought, as the caller said he'd been picked to
receive a ``genius grant'' of $285,000 over five years from the
MacArthur Foundation f or his work forging compromises among
ranchers, environmentalists and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the call (begin ital) did (end ital) sound like it was
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's hand went numb.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought about his tax consulta nt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, my taxable income has just tripled,'' McDonald said of
his first reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the problems that follow good deeds, said Sandy
Eastlake, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bi ll is a brilliant man who has looked at the big picture to
see what we can do to keep ourselves in business in the future,''
Eastlake said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was recognized for his part in forming the Malpai
Borderlands Group, an organization of 25 e nvironmentally aware
ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico. It has done some very
unorthodox things on the 800,000 acres the cattle growers graze in
the adjoining corners of the two states.
</P>
<P>
   The group has worked on increasing the numbers of the
threatened Chiricahuan Leopard Frog in their stock tanks and on
reintroducing jaguars in the area.
</P>
<P>
   They have enthusiastically backed the use of natural fires on
their range for ecological cleansing; 150,000 acres have burned in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And the non-profit Malpai group has spent more than $400,000 to
buy ``conservation easements'' on land in their area to ensure that
it stays range and is not developed.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he is considering using much of the $285,000 award
to buy additional conservation easements in the area, which is
located east of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just bang heads and make noise,'' McDonald said.
``We've worked with all the agencies and environmental groups and
have formed some true par tnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the group first came together in 1992 ``to try to
take care of wide open spaces and biological diversity at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea the ranchers quickly came up with was using ``grass
banks,'' which allow r anchers low on forage to use the grass of

YANKEES EDGE WHITE SOX IN 10TH, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees, the team with the best record in
baseball and, therefore, the fewest problems, don't often have to
sweat the details. But lose two games in a row and even the Yankees
encounter some turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Monday night when even baseball's best were beset with
niggling little questions.
</P>
<P>
   Could Ramiro Mendoza stop creeping concerns about a couple of
the Yankees starters, including himself? Could Tino Martinez shake
the 0-for-12 slump he had found since coming back from the
injurious hit laid on him by an Armando Benitez fastball?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, could the team recover after watching not only Mike
Stanton but Mariano Rivera blow saves after the Yankees had come
within six outs of beating the visiting White Sox Monday night?
</P>
<P>
   The answer proved to be a resounding yes to all the questions,
because Tim Raines and Chad Curtis _ two Yankees seemingly always
above question _ combined a two-out walk and a double into the
left-field corner to bring the Yankees a 5-4 victory in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Raines scored all the way from first as Curtis ended a night in
which he had also homered by delivering the winning hit against
Chicago reliever Matt Karchner.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the Yankees had lost a second straight game for
only the third time this season, there was little introspection
among the members of the winningest team in the major leagues.
That's the way manager Joe Torre prefers it.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's preference was clear when asked whether he was concerned
about Andy Pettitte. The left-hander's record fell to 6-5 and he
saw his earned run average balloon to 4.88 after allowing eight
earned runs in a 13-7 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Torre insists that he will be concerned only if Pettitte is
concerned, dismissing easy answers such as injury or overt
consternation over being away from his wife and two children, one a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people look for reasons as to why things happen,''
Torre said Monday. ``Very few of us are satisfied that it could be
a slump, and just let it go at that. You've got to just dissect it
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre obviously is reluctant to put Pettitte's psyche on the
slab. ``Like I said with Bernie Williams a month ago, if he's
concerned, I'm concerned,'' the manager said. ``And I'm not
concerned about him because he's too good of a pitcher. And his
stuff is good. Right now I think it's more overpreparation. He's
trying to do too much. It's got to be more of a mental thing than
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the Yankees' machine is not searching for
answers, dissecting things in the video room, according to the
owner George Steinbrenner. After revealing that the Yankees' staff
has met and reviewed tapes of Pettitte's starts, Steinbrenner,
saying that ``Pettitte is my main concern,'' went on to say: ``We
think we have discovered a a couple of things. Baseball films are
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Steinbrenner would not specify what the revelations were,
the team's principal owner said, ``The Yankees' staff is going to
sit down here soon and discuss whatever these are,'' adding that
Pettitte would likely be amenable to whatever suggestions come out
of the video sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The findings would be news to Torre, who said he was unaware of
the viewing sessions or the results. When asked whether his staff
was involved, Torre said no. When asked whether it was likely that
the Yankees' officials at the team's complex in Tampa, Fla., where
Steinbrenner has his business headquarters, were the ones involved,
Torre said: ``Must be. I don't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte met with Torre and the pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre,
informally on the field during batting practice before Monday
night's game. ``We just basically talked,'' the pitcher said.
``They just wanted to pick my brain. I'm doing fine. There are no
miracle cures. I just have to keep on going out and throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said he watched tapes of his performance against the
Red Sox a few times. ``I had real good stuff, then I gave up a walk
and it almost looked like I got real tentative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner analyzed more than just Andy Pettitte
Monday. He also took a look at the Yankees' two-game losing streak,
which resulted in a split of the four-game series against the
visiting Red Sox last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an outstanding start,'' Steinbrenner said of the
Yankees, who carried the majors' best record (37-13) into Monday
night's game. ``We'll be very difficult to catch. It's possible,
but it's going to be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Steinbrenner, who termed ``winning the most important
thing in my life other than breathing,'' said the weekend losses
were ``a little wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for us,'' he said. ``They realize they've got to
do more than just throw their gloves out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored a double coup Monday when Bernie Williams and
Hideki Irabu were named player and pitcher of month in the American
League for May.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led the league in batting (.402), slugging (.729) and
on-base percentage last month. Irabu went 4-1 with a league-leading
1.44 earned run average. In six starts he pitched 43 2/3 innings,
second in the league, and gave up only 25 hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Derek Jeter (44 hits, tops in the league in May)
and David Wells (perfect game, 4-0 for the month) also received
consideration in their categories.
</P>
<P>
   Gabby Martinez, the shortstop at the Yankees' Class AAA
affiliate in Columbus, was put on the inactive list for ``personal
reasons,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said.

Draft's future uncertain
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cost of signing picks, court action may force change
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The annual draft of college and high school baseball players _ an
exercise that for decades was locked in time as the rest of sport's
economic picture took wing _ takes place today amid questions about
its future viability.
</P>
<P>
   The first pick in the draft belongs to the Philadelphia
Phillies, a team that spent 11{ months holding strong in the face
of the explosive growth of contract demands by top selections.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Phillies took outfielder J.D. Drew with the
second overall pick but refused to pay the reported $11 million
signing bonus demanded by Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Drew is back in the draft this year, but the Phillies will not
select him. They are expected to take third baseman Pat Burrell of
the University of Miami, a player whose demands are expected to be
far less than Drew's and whom the Phillies believe they will be
able to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest word among draft prognosticators is that the Oakland
Athletics, who have the No. 2 pick, also will not select Drew. Nor
will the Chicago Cubs or Kansas City Royals. Drew could fall to
fifth, where he might be selected by St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results, it's a given that bonuses for unproven
players will continue to skyrocket. As salaries for major-league
players went through the roof in the 1980s and '90s, bonus money
for amateurs remained relatively static.
</P>
<P>
   That changed two years ago when four first-round draft picks
parlayed a loophole in the tendering of contracts into becoming
free agents. As often is the case in baseball, teams couldn't
control themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A bidding war for the four players resulted in the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks paying $10.2 million for first baseman Travis
Lee and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays giving $10 million to righthander
John Patterson _ nearly five times the record signing bonus for a
drafted player.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Scott Boras, who is the adviser for Drew, used those
figures as the benchmark for the 1997 collegiate Player of the
Year. The Phillies offered a package that would have been worth a
reported $6 million; Boras and Drew declined to sign.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads at least one veteran baseball executive to
wonder if the draft has outlived its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Astros president Tal Smith, who was around when the draft was
instituted in 1965 as a way to hold down bonuses to amateur
players, isn't sure the initial purpose of the draft is viable
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some uncertainty to the future of the draft,'' said
Smith. ``It was instituted for economic reasons, and a lot of
reasons it was instituted don't apply these days. Absolutely, the
draft has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a dramatic change the last couple years. You look
at the J.D. Drew situation, and what the Diamondbacks and Devils
Rays did a couple years ago, and you can see what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, teams stocked their farm
systems by scouting and signing players without the restriction of
a draft. Smith, who worked for the Cincinnati Reds in the late
'50s, said the Milwaukee Braves, New York Yankees and Los Angeles
Dodgers pushed the envelope by paying huge bonuses to players.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, some teams were paying more in bonus money
to unproven players than they were to their major-league players.
Baseball executives instituted the draft as a way to hold down
bonuses and help teams maintain a competitive balance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trend toward huge bonus payouts has come back
around even with the draft in place.
</P>
<P>
   Rice pitcher Matt Anderson, the No. 1 overall pick in 1998,
signed with the Detroit Tigers for a $2.505 million bonus, the
all-time high among drafted players. That bonus likely will be
surpassed this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since teams with high picks in the draft often are those that
have been forced to the bottom of the standings because of economic
constraints in their payroll structure, the idea of achieving
competitive balance through the draft might be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Draft proponents claim big-market teams like the Yankees,
Dodgers and Atlanta Braves would dominate the signing of amateur
players if the draft were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   However, teams that relied on strong scouting might be able to
use their money more wisely if they weren't forced into paying top
picks the huge bonuses they currently receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a second-division club, the draft sort of works
against you the way it is now,'' said Smith. ``If you draft first,
second or third, the (signing) costs have risen so much it may
preclude from signing the top players. I'm not certain the draft
works best for the teams at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a second-division or small-market club that has to
rely on scouting and development, the draft works against you in
that you get only one of 30 picks (one each round).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had an opportunity to sell your team as a way to reach
the majors more quickly or appeal to players on a regional basis,
you might have a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's views are not held by the majority of baseball
executives, including acting commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   So the draft is not about to go away _ unless Boras and Drew try
to use the court system to unravel it.
</P>
<P>
   In one regard, this year's draft will remain the same in an
important area. Unlike the drafts in other professional sports,
which are televised live amid much hoopla, baseball goes about its
selection process in virtual secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Only first-round picks will be announced today; the rest of the
draft lists will be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Baseball believes colleges would increase
scholarship offers to high school players selected in higher
rounds, making it more difficult to sign the players and costing
teams more in bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a rising feeling among baseball people to go
public with the draft and televise the proceedings to gain some
needed publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ton of interest,'' says San Diego general manager
Kevin Towers. ``You can't overestimate the interest in college
baseball and the impact of high school baseball, especially at the
small-town level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have the No. 17 pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   According to a mock draft in Baseball America, a publication
that studies and analyzes each year's draft with a high degree of
success, the Astros are expected to select high school pitcher Pat
Strange, a righthander from Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   However, Baseball America predicts that Rice outfielder Bubba
Crosby will be available when the Astros pick in the first round.
If Crosby indeed is still on the board, the Astros might be tempted
to take him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Astros took power-hitting Lance Berkman from Rice
in the first round.

CLINTON DROPS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts sentence in graf that begins ``By removing.'')  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday dropped the claims of
executive privilege he had invoked in the Lewinsky investigation,
moving to reduce the prospect of a quick Supreme Court review in
the highly charged constitutional clash between the White House and
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the president continued to press claims of a lawyer-client
privilege to sharply limit the questioning of Bruce Lindsey, one of
Clinton's closest confidantes. And the Justice Department filed its
intention Monday to appeal a lower-court ruling that ordered Secret
Service agents to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuver over executive privilege, approved by Clinton
at a meeting Monday morning with his lawyers, was an attempt by the
White House to narrow its appeal so as to rob the Supreme Court of
an opportunity for a fast review, as independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has sought. If the tactic works, it could prolong the legal
wrangling between the president and the independent counsel for
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there were fresh signs Monday that even if Starr
ultimately succeeds in defeating the attorney-client claims, he
would be unlikely to gain any incriminating evidence against the
president from Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote in the White House brief filed Monday with the
Supreme Court, administration lawyers said that Lindsey, a close
friend of the president's for three decades, had already told the
grand jury that he ``had no information that anyone had committed
perjury or obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey and many other senior and junior Clinton aides have been
called before the grand jury that is examining whether the
president or anyone else illegally sought to coverup Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had argued in March that a broad array of
questions asked of Lindsey and another presidential aide, Sidney
Blumenthal, could not be answered because they intruded on the
fundamental right of the president to get confidential advice from
his aides, a principle enshrined in the law by the courts as
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot overstate the intolerable threat that an unduly
constrictive reading of the privilege poses to the president's
ability to get frank and candid advice from his advisors,'' the
president's lawyers said in court papers at the time. ``President
Eisenhower underscored the crucial role the privilege plays in
promoting effective governance, going so far as to remark that, if
confidential presidential communications were `subject to
investigation by anybody,' it could `wreck the government.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House on Monday quickly dispensed with a
discussion of executive privilege in its motion to the Supreme
Court, saying only that the claim is no longer a controversy
because a federal judge, while ordering the aides to testify, had
confirmed that the president was entitled to such a privilege in
some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The White House already had filed a notice that it intended to
appeal the federal judge's decision, which said Starr's need for
the testimony of Blumenthal and Lindsey outweighed the privileges.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr petitioned the Supreme Court last week for an
expedited review.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blumenthal must now answer the questions he had
initially refused to answer about his conversations with the
president, Hillary Rodham Clinton and others, the White House's
move makes a speedy resolution of the other privilege claims,
already considered a longshot, even less likely.
</P>
<P>
   By removing the executive privilege claims, the White House
eliminated the constitutional questions that provided the most
attractive issues for a Supreme Court review. The full scope of
arguments on both sides remains out of public view, however, with
Starr and the White House filing some sections of their briefs
under seal.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a vote of five justices to grant Starr's motion
for an expedited appeal, and four justices to decide whether to
hear the case at all.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Acting Monday under a Supreme Court deadline, administration
lawyers told the justices that there was no pressing need to
quickly consider the independent counsel's petition.
</P>
<P>
   The Court has traditionally bypassed the appeals court, the
White House brief said, in ``cases presenting the most profound and
compelling circumstances.'' Generally, those have been ``cases of
overwhelming national emergency, such as in times of war; and cases
where the courts below are in substantial disarray on highly
important federal questions, and there has been development and
disagreement among courts of appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rare instances when the Court had accepted cases for
expedited review include the 1947 seizure of the nation's coal
mines following labor disturbances; the 1952 seizure of steel mills
during the Korean War; and the 1981 resolution of the case of
Iranian assets seized by the United States to meet a diplomatic
deadline in a deal that freed American hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the independent counsel's office would not comment.
In a speech Monday before a North Carolina group, Starr made some
thinly veiled criticisms of the White House's extensive use of
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Inveighing against litigants who ``try to concoct new
privileges,'' he said that the courts have properly concluded that
government lawyers cannot cloak their conversations in
lawyer-client privilege in the face of criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to expand an existing privilege, to apply it in a
new or unusual area, then the place to go is Congress, not the
courts,'' Starr told a gathering of the Mecklenberg County Bar
Association in Charlotte, N.C. ``The courts cannot be in the
business of creating new privileges from whole cloth. And lawyers
ought to tell their clients that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's comments also appeared to be aimed at the recent effort
by the administration to block the testimony of three officials of
the Secret Service under a new kind of privilege the administration
has claimed should prevent them from testifying about Clinton.
Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled last month that no such
privilege exists, but the Justice Department filed its intent to
appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But although the administration on Monday dropped the executive
privilege appeal, the White House signalled in its brief that it
might raise new claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House continues to have reservations that the
procedures the district court followed and intends to follow as
witnesses appear before the grand jury may inadequately protect the
confidentiality of presidential communications,'' the lawyers
wrote. ``The White House will continue, however, to work with the
district court to ensure that adequate safeguards are employed.''

UPSET NOMO CUT LOOSE BY DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for add after 4th graf and fix in 6th graf.) (ja)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship
with Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize
interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew
delivery, but this year had pitched terribly, grew disenchanted and
requested a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo, while
the New York Yankees said they might also be interested in the
29-year-old right-hander, who was designated for assignment and
removed from Los Angeles' 40-man roster. Nomo, who was 2-7 with a
5.05 earned run average this season, was perturbed that the Dodgers
had included him in trade discussions with Seattle about Randy
Johnson and asked to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Fred
Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said. ``There is a time
frame. That being said, there is also a great demand for
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have the lowest ERA in the major leagues, could be
very involved in pursuing Nomo, who must be traded or assigned in
10 days or could be placed on unconditional waiver release in seven
days. Nomo is in the last year of a contract that pays him $2.8
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major move by the Fox Group, which bought the
Dodgers from the O'Malley's two months ago and traded Mike Piazza
as part of a seven-player deal last month. This decision almost
certainly reduces Nomo's trade value because teams know Los Angeles
has a deadline by which to move him.
</P>
<P>
   After having his four-year major league career take a drastic
turn, Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine
managed in Japan, pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend, Mike
Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace, a senior adviser for
the Mets, was Nomo's coach with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something, in general terms, that you might consider
internally,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who
broached Nomo's name during a discussion about other pitchers with
a reporter before Monday night's game against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, was
flabbergasted by the Dodgers' decision and promised to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers designated him for assignment?'' he said. ``Wow!
That's very interesting. I don't know what else to say other than
that's surprising. I'm certainly going to look into it like
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo barely spoke during a news conference in Los Angeles,
saying he ``definitely needed a change of scenery, a change of
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the devastating work stoppage in 1994 canceled the World
Series, Nomo helped baseball regain attention by arriving from
Japan with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball and a wicked split-finger
pitch, both emanating from a seldom-seen corkscrew delivery. He was
13-6 with a 2.54 ERA and 236 strikeouts in 1911/3 innings in 1995
and was named the National League's rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's success was followed so fervently in Japan that thousands
watched him pitch on mammoth screens in Tokyo in early morning
hours. He became one of the most popular players on the Dodgers and
struck out 500 batters faster than any other pitcher, 4442/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was 16-11 with a 3.19 ERA in 1996 and 14-12 with a 4.25 ERA
last year. He had allowed 18 earned runs in his last 262/3 innings
and had dropped his last four decisions, causing some fans to boo
him at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think trades are inevitable in this
business,'' Yoshii said. ``Even Mike Piazza was traded. He's a
friend. It would be nice. But it's not my decision.''
</P>

GRAND CANYON TO BE `WILDERNESS' 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX _ It looks like wilderness, feels like wilderness and _
usual ly _ sounds like wilderness. But Grand Canyon National Park
is not officially wilderness. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon will be, in all but in name.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal released Monday, the National Park Service by
year's end would manage 94 per cent of the 1.3 million-acre park as
if it were officially designated wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilderness'' is the highest level of protection granted any
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The new management plan, which would not require congressional
approval,
</P>
<P>
   would prevent development of roads and buildings, prohibit
motorized vehicles and require that more than 120 miles of old
roads be turned into trails or restored to their natural condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been in recent times that the hierarch y of the Park
Service has recognized the significance of wilderness management,''
said Linda Jalbert, the park's outdoor recreation planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a national park, we get a lot of pressure for
new uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the propo sals have been new helicopter landing pads, a
gondola from the rim to the river, new hotel lodges and even
floating casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan could even mean that park rangers would repair
trails with less intrusive picks and shovels, as opposed t o chain
saws and jackhammers, to protect the serenity of the wilderness. It
also calls for stepped-up education programs for back-country
hikers and scientific investigators. In the past decade, several
hikers have died and thousands more have bee n evacuated because of
heat exhaustion and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, when most of the park was first proposed as
wilderness, the Park Service has bought grazing, mining and other
private development rights, conducted land-use studies and in
creased the acreage proposed for wilderness by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new draft Wilderness Management Plan also goes further,
calling for 1,109,257 acres to be immediately designated wilderness
as soon as Congress could act. That would inclu de nearly all of
the Canyon's inner gorges, most of the North Rim, and the South Rim
west of Hermit's Rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the footwork has been done,'' Jalbert said. ``The next
step would be to present a bill to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   How far such a bill
</P>
<P>
   may get in the current Congress is questionable. Just last year
Congress proposed just the opposite _ designating millions of miles
of roadways in federal forests and parks to maintain access for
devel opers. Under pressure from park advocates and
</P>
<P>
   a veto threat from President Clinton, the roads proposal was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Gullett, administrative assistant to Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said she was not aware of any plans to designate official
wilderness areas in the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service plan released Monday also calls for 29,820
acres _ the Colorado River that flows for 277 miles through the
park, and its shorelines _ to be designated as proposed wilderness,
and that studies be done to include the river in the na tion's
``Wild and Scenic'' river program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wild and scenic'' designation, which could be done by
Congress or the secretary of the Interior, would forever prohibit
dams or diversions, such as were proposed in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   C urrently, 39 miles of the Verde River above Horseshoe Lake is
the only Arizona waterway with such protections, although
environmentalists have called for up to 1,700 miles of the state's
rivers and streams to be added.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed wildernes s management plan covers virtually the
entire park except for the major trails (Bright Angel and Kaibab)
that cross the canyon from the South Rim to the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   It also excludes the few areas inside the park _ mostly
surrounding Grand Can yon Village and the South Rim east of the
village _ that already are developed or have paved roads. Those
areas, which handle most of the park's 5 million visitors each
year, are subject to other park management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Designated campsites w ould be established and natural
vegetation restored at several backcountry sites where visitors now
camp wherever they please: Deer Creek, Cape Final, Point Sublime,
Fire Point, Swamp Point and Pasture Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Campsites and trails would be reh abilitated at Horseshoe Mesa,
Hermit Creek, Monument Creek and Upper Tapeats.
</P>
<P>
   Trails that would be rehabilitated: Tanner, New Hance, South
Bass, South Canyon and Nankoweap.
</P>
<P>
   Among the roads that would be converted to trails are more tha n
40 miles of former fire roads along the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would retain 10 primitive roads that lead to wilderness
trail heads, and retain seven wilderness trails for use with horses
or mules.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens have until July 15 to submit c omments on the proposed
management plan. More information is available at: http:// &QL;

CHALLENGERS LINE UP FOR BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Real Quiet's van arrives at Belmont Park in
New York on Wednesday, the colt might find as many as 11 opponents
and 1{ miles of mud standing between him and thoroughbred history.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight challengers have been lined up, which is more
than any the 11 Triple Crown winners faced in their Belmont Stakes
victory. The eagerness of rival owners to take on the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness Stakes winner confirms the obvious, that not
everybody sees Real Quiet as a great horse worthy of mention
alongside Count Fleet, Citation and Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   The debate promises to dominate this week leading up to
Saturday's Belmont Stakes: Is Real Quiet somehow unworthy of a
Triple Crown because of his 4-for-14 record and the fact that
injuries to some other top 3 year olds have simplified his task?
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet is scheduled to put in his last serious, 5-furlong
workout this morning at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and fly
and van to Belmont on Wednesday morning along with owner Mike
Pegram, trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was pleasant on Long Island on Monday. Thunderstorms
are predicted today and Wednesday. The long-range forecast for
Saturday has partial cloudiness and temperatures in the 80s _ but
the skies can change quickly on the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The weather could be a factor, because Real Quiet ran the worst
race of his career on a mucky surface at Golden Gate Fields in
Albany, Calif., in January.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux said Monday morning he's having trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would Real Quiet become the first Triple Crown winner
since Affirmed 20 years ago, his team would divide a $5 million
bonus from Visa for sweeping the three races. Including the
winner's share of the $500,000-added Belmont purse, the
California-based horse could earn the biggest racing payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so anxious for the race _ to find my destiny, so to
speak,'' said Desormeaux, 28, from his home in Bradbury. ``I'll
definitely have the weight of history on my shoulders. But I feel
very fortunate just to be the lucky pilot in the saddle with the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The field and post positions will be set Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, eight horses were on the ``probable'' list. They
included five horses Real Quiet has already defeated _ Derby and
Preakness runnerup Victory Gallop (Gary Stevens riding), Classic
Cat (John Velazquez), Hot Wells (Calvin Borel), Parade Ground (Pat
Day) and Basic Trainee (Joe Bravo); and three new challengers _
Yarrow Brae (Jerry Bailey), Thomas Jo (Chris McCarron) and Raffie's
Majesty (Jorge Chavez).
</P>
<P>
   Officially dropping off the list Monday was Silver Launch, who
came out of a Sunday workout with an ankle chip that will require
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Three other horses are listed as ``possible'' starters: Grand
Slam (rider undetermined), who recovered from a nasty injury at age
2 to win the Peter Pan at Belmont nine days ago; Hanuman Highway
(Jose Santos), who was seventh in the Derby; and lightly raced
Limit Out (Jean-Luc Samyn). Grand Slam trainer D. Wayne Lukas might
wait as late as Wednesday before announcing a decision. Hanuman
Highway trainer Kathy Walsh plans to make up her mind today. Limit
Out trainer Allen Jerkens is aiming for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Triple Crown winners faced as many as seven and as few as
two horses in the Belmont. By contrast, of the 13 Triple Crown
hopefuls who were tripped up in the Belmont, seven were up against
eight or more horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, I find myself wondering how the race is going to
be run,'' Desormeaux said. ``(But) it's hard to dream about the
race when you don't know who the players are yet.''
