Some Tinkering Could Let NHL Translate to TV  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, I took my son and some other 10-year-old
boys to a San Jose Sharks game. To say they were blown away is an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   They loved the smoke, the lasers, the action, the speed, the
crowd and the fact that pizza was served between the second and
third periods. They begged to come back. That would be tough, I
said, but did they know that the games were on TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?!'' they asked. ``Awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Saturday afternoon my son was planted on the couch,
ready for some totally cool ice action. Thirty minutes later, I
walked by and noticed he'd changed the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same,'' he said, sadly.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not, and there is hockey's problem in a slapshot.
Hockey's deep philosophical question is this: If a puck drops in
Detroit, and no one watches it on TV, is hockey really happening?
</P>
<P>
   The good news out of the NHL conference finals over the weekend
was that TV ratings were up 56 percent. The bad news? At 2.5, they
still trail the French Open (2.7) and both days of the Memorial
golf tournament (2.9 Saturday and 3.5 on Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   So why don't we just let the sport of frozen water fizzle out
and disappear? Because hockey is hotter than ever _ in person.
</P>
<P>
   Through the conference semifinals, attendance at NHL playoff
games was at 99.2 percent of capacity around the league, which is
up from last year. In Buffalo, scalpers reportedly were getting
$125 for lower-bowl tickets for the Sabres, and the team sold
18,000 playoff tickets in 21/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you say, what else are they going to do in Buffalo? But
the same kind of surge is happening in Washington, where there were
concerns about empty seats. The Capitals can close out the Sabres
tonight and reach the Stanley Cup Finals, and according to a
front-page story in the _ ahem _ Washington Post, the Capitals are
``dominating conversations around town.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with this picture? You can bet they are banging
their heads against the boards over at ESPN and Fox, which are
televising the playoffs and have seen their overnight ratings fall
as low as 1.6.
</P>
<P>
   You can give Fox credit for knowing that something has to be
done. Unfortunately, as toupee salesmen have proved for years,
acknowledging there is a problem does not mean you will take the
right action.
</P>
<P>
   Let's lay this out. There are two problems with hockey on
television: the puck and the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Fox went right after the puck problem, and ended up getting
hoots for the red-and-blue vapor trails that follow the puck on its
broadcasts. It seems no one likes it, including Red Wings coach
Scotty Bowman, who claimed the puck, which cannot be frozen because
of the computer chip inside, ``was bouncing like a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pshaw, I say. That's the least of their problems. The puck with
a tail offends purists because it is hokey, not hockey. That's
fine, but the problem with the purists is that there aren't enough
of them. Keep the vapor trail if it means that much to you.
</P>
<P>
   The real deal with the puck is that it spends most of its time
down around the players' ankles. In virtually every other sport,
the ball/ puck is carried at least waist-high. That makes all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because, in case you hadn't noticed, there is no other sport in
which a four-foot fence is placed around the playing surface. You
need to get up above the boards and look down on the puck to see
what is going on. Otherwise, as soon as the puck hits the boards,
the view on your television is of the tops of four helmets as four
guys look down and dig around with their sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Fox understands the problem, but not the solution. The
network is putting cameras down low on the sides and risking motion
sickness among viewers by creating a blur of action along the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   What we really need are either cameras above the ice _ not way
up there so the players resemble water bugs, but at
scoreboard-height or lower. Too difficult to set up? OK, how about
shots from what hockey veterans know is the best seat in the house,
behind the goals?
</P>
<P>
   Again, you'd have to have some elevation, but if you are behind
the goal, you can see the puck along both sides as well as watch
the plays develop. It wouldn't be televised the way any other sport
is on television, but what would be wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Any other suggestions? Sure. A shorter season, protection
against shots to the head to stop concussions, better marketing of
the most personable players in any sport, and anything to get more
people to have the experience of being at the rink.
</P>
<P>
   We know they've got a product. Last Monday night, President
Clinton was impressed. Clinton attended the Eastern Conference
finals, and when he was interviewed by ESPN between periods, what
do you think he said?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first of all,'' Clinton offered, ``it is much more
exciting in person than on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir, we know the problem. Now we need a solution.

Game 1 Will Reveal Whether Jazz 
 &HT;    Stayed in Tune  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utah Jazz wanted this to be their
breakthrough year. One distinction they did not exactly yearn for,
however, was to be one of the best-rested teams in NBA playoff
history.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they got, thanks to their four-game sweep of the
Lakers in the Western Conference finals and the Chicago Bulls'
seven-game white-knuckler against Indiana in the East. By Wednesday
night's NBA Finals opener at the Delta Center, the Jazz will have
been off for 10 days (the 1982 Lakers sat for 12 days before their
Finals opener against Philadelphia). And no one will know until
Wednesday whether that's good or bad for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has their theories, of course, and all are
well-supported and perfectly reasonable. They are also nothing more
than guesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win that first game, it might give us the advantage for
the future because we will be rested,'' Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek
told reporters Monday. ``But that first game will be questionable
because you can go only so hard in practice. Then to go against a
great team like the Bulls, it's going to be a different level of
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek is one of several older Jazz players who, it has been
assumed, needed the extra days to rest various aches and pains.
Backcourt mate John Stockton has been bothered by a sore back since
the first round against Houston. Karl Malone's right (shooting)
hand has been sore all season. The Bulls, like Utah among the NBA's
oldest teams, could have used the rest as well but instead got only
one day off and were scheduled to fly to Salt Lake City Tuesday.
That would give one theoretical edge to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jerry Sloan, however, was not in favor of that kind of
edge and put the Jazz through brutal drills last week _ telling
them that he was not going to stand for any sloppiness or laziness
just because they were blessed with extra time off. ``It's been
like training camp,'' said starting center Greg Foster (an Oakland
native), ``and everybody knows training camp isn't any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, some believe that such a layoff is no edge at all, no
matter how sadistic the workouts are. ``Utah's been laying around
for 10 days. One time I had eight days off waiting for the
championship, and there is no way you can stay in game shape by
laying around,'' said Pacers coach Larry Bird, referring to his
playing days with the Celtics. ``So Chicago has a chance to go out
there and get a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone acknowledged that potential pitfall. ``We've got to come
out and prove that we can beat anybody in our building,'' he said.
``We have to keep right on going from the Lakers series.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bulls, it is imperative that they go to the Delta Center
and win one of the first two games. This is only the second time in
Chicago's six trips to the Finals that they have not had home-court
advantage. The 2-3-2 format has been criticized in recent years as
being more of an advantage to the team with the three middle games,
and the Bulls have a cnace to prove a point: If they win one of the
first two games in Utah, they will have a chance to take control of
the series at the United Center, where they are 28-2 in the
playoffs the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls believe they can win in Utah, not so much because the
Jazz might be sluggish from inactivity, but because they themselves
are in a rhythm. ``I think it was good for us, because we were
playing pretty much every other day,'' Scottie Pippen said after
the Bulls' series-clinching win Sunday. ``We know what it's like,
we're ready to play, our intensity level is there. Utah's been off.
We want to be able to go out there and catch them on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz have been caught on their heels once in this
postseason, in the first game of the first round, when the Rockets
surprised them in the Delta Center. They were a game away from
elimination twice in that series but won Game 4 in Houston and Game
5 in Salt Lake City and have won 10 of their past 11 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the reason the series is opening in Utah rather
than Chicago: The Jazz won both meetings with the Bulls this
season, once in the Delta Center and once in Chicago, where the
Bulls lost just four times in the regular season. When the two
teams met in the Finals last year, the Jazz looked clueless in the
United Center, but it isn't likely they will be awed or overwhelmed
this time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bulls will not bring anything remotely
resembling fear into the Delta Center _ even though they lost all
three games of the East finals in Indianapolis. Last year's Finals
turned in Game 5, when an ill Michael Jordan turned in one of his
legendary performances and gave the Bulls a victory in Utah and a
3-2 lead going back to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big challenge to get there (to the Finals against
Utah), but you look at our record,'' Jordan said. ``We haven't lost
in the Finals, and that's a great confidence to have. . . . Sure,
it was a battle to get there. No one said it would be easy. But
we're there. So now, let's just do the job.'

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AFTER the Celtics beat the Rockets in Houston in Game 6 to win the
NBA title in 1986, the Today show sent out a crew to interview
Larry Bird. The producer popped a tape into the VCR, and maybe a
dozen people gathered around to watch the final minutes of the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   All you could see were the players racing up the court; there
was no shot of the scoreboard to indicate where they had picked up
the action. Someone wondered how much time was left, and Bird
nodded at the screen and said, ``That's with 5 minutes and 40
seconds to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone turned and stared at Bird. ``How do you know that?''
the producer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Replied Bird, ``That's when they played that song.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone said, ``What song?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That song,'' he replied, ``Houston's fight song. I remember
checking the clock. There was 5:40 left when the band got up and
played the fight song.''

LIKE HIS FANS, JOHNSON ASKS M'S: WHAT'S THE PLAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Mariners' frustrating decision to let Randy
Johnson go without even attempting to negotiate a contract
extension has turned into just plain ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Andy Pettitte, no Jaret Wright, no Darren Dreifort
in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   There is no team willing to trade a 20-something up-and-comer
for a 34-year-old Cy Young Award-winning dominator who probably
does have three good years left, back surgery or no back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the Mariners fail to make a deal, the more the
Dodgers and Yankees can laugh and the stranger and funnier and more
stupid the entire situation grows.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not even talking about the Mariners' continued bullpen
woes. Yes, that was Lou Piniella shouting about how something has
to change after last night's 10-9 loss to the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the Big Unit was laughing Monday. It was a
180-degree mood swing from two weeks ago, when the reeling Johnson
admitted he was rocked by all the stuff going on between his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two great starts and a flurry of trade talks, Johnson
is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. He will go on. His
season-ending stats will be good, no matter where he is, so he
promises.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Mariners whose future is uncertain, mostly because it
seems they flat-out had no real plan when it came to Johnson.
Exhibit A: They spoiled Ken Griffey Jr.'s MVP day last November
with their simultaneous announcement that Johnson was not in their
future.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They did not have a plan this winter when the Yankees offered
starter David Wells and closer Mariano Rivera and the Mariners
refused, wanting lefty Pettitte or fuggetaboutit.
</P>
<P>
   And they did not seem to have a firm idea about what to do about
Johnson when the Dodgers offered starter Ismael Valdes and
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth in January, or when Cleveland offered
starter Chad Ogea and closer Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   And here we are in early June and still there is no sense of
purpose, or at least reality. What the Mariners thought they could
get, they can't.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appear to be the only team acting serious about a
trade. And word was Monday that the Dodgers have offered Valdes and
Wilton Guerrero as a counter to the Mariners' request for Deifort,
the 26-year-old right-hander the Dodgers vow to keep.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Dodgers understand they don't have to blink first,
not with a trading deadline that will whittle away at the Mariners'
pricetag on the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're stuck in a `Lost In Space' episode,'' Johnson
declared Monday afternoon, holding court in the visitors' clubhouse
under Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling they don't know what they want to do right
now. ... It's like Woody Woodward and Chuck Armstrong are molecules
bouncing off each other, no idea which way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the M's scared to deal the Big Unit?
</P>
<P>
   ``From my vantage point, it looks that way,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Or the M's might deal him to the Dodgers in what could be an
embarrassing trade. That's why the situation does not make sense.
None of it adds up, except that maybe the M's are freaked out about
what to do with the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   This is a monumental turning point in the club's history. But a
week into trade speculations, it has gotten no easier to fathom
what the Mariners are hoping to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you get rid of somebody and create a headache where
there isn't one?'' fellow pitcher Jamie Moyer said. ``Can the
Mariners do the right thing in this situation? Who can they get for
Randy who is going to give you what he gives you?''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer is right. There is no deal that gives the Mariners value
for Johnson. And if Heathcliff Slocumb was worth a $3 million deal
this winter, why wasn't Johnson worthy of at least a negotiation?
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I worth? What have I been worth to this team the last
two or three years? What's my value there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's inquiry was mostly rhetorical, an indication he
believes the Mariners do not value him as much as they now want
other teams to value him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only one player. I'm worth a couple of fungo bats and a
couple of balls, at least,'' Johnson said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   What is Johnson worth? It's the same question over and over, but
the M's appear to be discovering what they should have known from
the start: There is no trade for the Big Unit that makes any shred
of sense.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest value to the M's might have been to pitch and win
in Seattle for three more years and finish a Hall of Fame career
where it blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't get Andy Pettitte? Well, then, what else are you
offering? Chuck Armstrong and Woody Woodward were saying no teams
were calling. Well, that's because they're asking for Andy Pettite
and Mariano Riviera. They're asking for Jaret Wright and Bartolo
Colon. That's pretty steep,'' Johnson said. ``That's why I'm still
here. The players they want, the other teams aren't willing to give
up. The asking price is a little too steep.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to load the cannon, like the M's did, it's
always good to know what you're aiming at _ and know if there's
enough powder to reach the target.

SAN DIEGO _ Throughout the course of the baseball season, a team's
starting rotation can resemble a deck of cards. And in any game
during the 162-date shuffle, a club can draw a coveted ace.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds, the Astros' opening-day starter each of the past
three years, is all too familiar with the whims of the deal. But
the 30-year-old righthander currently is trumping with the best of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the smoke generated by hot starts from teammates Mike
Hampton and Jose Lima, Reynolds was something of a forgotten man
during the first month of the season. His numbers weren't terrible,
but they clearly weren't up to his standards.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was 1-2 with a 4.30 earned run average in Apr s~Zv1UQ

JOHNSON TRADE ON SIMMER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Mariners want to trade Randy Johnson, but they
aren't eager to face him.
</P>
<P>
   That is why that on-again, off-again deal with the Los Angeles
Dodgers probably would not be consummated before Wednesday night at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have offered right-handed pitcher Ismael Valdes and
the choice of outfielders Todd Hollandsworth or Wilton Guerrero for
Johnson, according to a source close to the National League team.
</P>
<P>
   The teams nearly pulled off this deal six months ago, but it
fell apart when the Dodgers took Valdes out of the trade. L.A.
instead inserted right-hander Ramon Martinez, and the Mariners
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want to complete the deal Tuesday, but the Mariners
apparently want to wait until after Johnson pitches against the
Anaheim Angels tomorrow night at the Kingdome. That would prevent
their all-time winningest pitcher from making his Dodger debut this
weekend when Los Angeles plays a three-game series at the Kingdome
in the first interleague games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more hangup.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle wants to lure right-hander Darren Dreifort away from the
NL West team, but the Dodgers refuse to include the
reliever-turned-starter in any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they will take Valdes, the deal is done,'' the Dodger
source said. ``If they keep insisting on Dreifort, it won't be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Los Angeles radio stations reported Monday that the teams
had reached agreement on a trade. One report said the Mariners
would receive Valdes, Hollandsworth and Guerrero, while the other
said it was a Valdes-Hollandsworth swap for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner officials wouldn't comment, as has been their policy
since trade talk heated up last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on rumors,'' said M's vice president of
baseball administration Lee Pelekoudas, who is with the team in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the team's vice president of baseball
operations, was not available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes would move into Seattle's starting rotation, joining
Jamie Moyer, Jeff Fassero, Bill Swift and Ken Cloude.
Hollandsworth, a product of Newport High in Bellevue and the
National League Rookie of the Year in 1996, would give Mariner
manager Lou Piniella the left-handed bat he has wanted for several
weeks. Hollandsworth is batting .267 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who had a 10-11 record last season despite a 2.65 earned
run average, is 3-5 with a 5.33 ERA. The Mexican native reportedly
is having a difficult season because his father recently was
diagnosed with cancer.

MARINERS BLOW ANOTHER LATE LEAD, FALL TO ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>

 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Something seems wrong with this picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are seriously thinking about trading left-hander
Randy Johnson, but little is being said about another lefty who is
much less dependable.
</P>
<P>
   What do they do with Tony Fossas?
</P>
<P>
   The veteran reliever with the long history of dominating
left-handed batters continued his journey to who-knows-where Monday
night at Camden Yards, serving up a game-losing home run to
left-handed hitter Rafael Palmeiro in an explosive eighth inning as
the Mariners' bullpen blew another gasket in a 10-9 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles before 42,622 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy defense by third baseman Russ Davis, leading to three
unearned runs off starter Jeff Fassero, and a Mariner-like,
three-homer barrage in the eighth by the Orioles sent the M's to
yet another gut-punching defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather obvious this isn't working,'' manager Lou Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be construed as a plea that it is going to take more
than trading Johnson to solve the Mariners' woes. Too many errors.
Too many runs allowed by the bullpen. Too many losses.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez hit two home runs, and David Segui and Russ Davis
hit one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you score nine runs, you expect to win,'' Segui said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles scored more.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells, who relieved Fassero in the fifth inning, pitched
brilliantly until the eighth inning, striking out the side in the
fifth to keep the Mariners in front by two runs. Davis' homer in
the eighth made it 9-6. Wells had retired nine of the 10 batters he
faced until Chris Hoiles singled.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeff Reboulet struck out, Brady Anderson homered, slicing
the lead to one. The first pitch to Eric Davis was called a strike,
and it made the hitter so mad that he nearly got ejected by plate
umpire Al Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller and third-base coach Sam Perlozzo
interceded and kept Davis in the game. Davis rocketed the next
pitch he saw into the left field bleachers for a game-tying home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells was throwing the ball so well, and then all of a sudden,
I don't know what happened,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander got his pitches up and the Orioles hit them
out.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Fossas got another opportunity and failed
miserably. A quality slider missed inside. Another slider became a
souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a flat slider down the middle of the plate,'' Fossas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``He has thrown flat pitches all (bleeping) year.
Excuse my language, but there is just too much duplication. I've
got whiplash.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossas, 40, has allowed 11 hits to the 29 lefties he has faced
this season _ a .379 batting average. This was the first home run
he has allowed to a lefty in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the pitching coach or manager, I'd be pulling my
hair out,'' he said. ``I was signed for the purpose of getting out
left-handers and I haven't done anything. I'm going through the
worst time of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   He entered this season with a terrific track record, holding
opposing left-handers to a .204 (78-for-382) average over the past
five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give up,'' Fossas said. ``I will leave this
game fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the same approach Fassero took into his 10th start of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Segui's 10th homer of the season capped a four-run first inning,
but the first of two errors by Davis led to two unearned Oriole
runs. Seattle added another run in the third on Martinez's first
homer of the game, and tacked on three more in the fifth, two of
them coming on Martinez's second homer.
</P>
<P>
   But forced to throw extra pitches because of Davis' miscues at
third base, Fassero weakened in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated his effort,'' Piniella said of Fassero, who
missed Sunday's scheduled start in Tampa Bay because of the flu and
sore throat. ``He wasn't strong. He was still sick, but he went out
there and did the best he could, which is appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro and Robby Alomar did most of the damage against
Fassero. The Orioles' 4-5 hitters were a combined 5-for-6 against
Seattle's five-game winner, and Alomar slugged a two-run homer in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Their bats and Davis' glove were instrumental in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving up too many unearned runs,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis now has 14 errors this season, and the M's have allowed 25
unearned runs, fourth-highest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Seattle is losing too many games in the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the M's bullpen didn't get a blown save (the starter
must be the pitcher of record before a blown save is possible), it
got a blown game.
</P>
<P>
   The M's now have lost five games when leading after seven
innings and the latest came against a team that had won only once
when trailing after seven innings.

McGWIRE NEEDS TO LET LOOSE A BIT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The reluctant phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   That might best describe Mark McGwire as he arrives at Dodger
Stadium today with his inhuman biceps and ungodly statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals first baseman is hitting home runs with
greater frequency _ and hitting them farther _ than anyone in
baseball history. He could overtake a home-run record that Roger
Maris has held for 36 years, and an RBI mark that Hack Wilson has
owned for 67 years. And yet he said he can't understand what all
the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Looks you right in the eye and expresses that.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend in San Diego, where McGwire set a major-league
record for most home runs through the month of May _ 27 _ he wore a
perpetual scowl and seemed testy at every turn. A sampling of
scenes:
</P>
<P>
   __ Perhaps 8,000 fans filled the left-field seats for batting
practice before the series opener, and McGwire, 34, was cheered
warmly the first time he stepped into the cage. He shook his head
back and forth several times, then laid down a bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving ovations on the road ``is very flattering,'' McGwire
said later, ``but I'm realistic about things. This is not an
individual sport.... I could see if you're a golfer and Tiger Woods
is at the driving range and you want to see him hit 300-yard
drives. He controls his destiny. I can't. I have a bat in my hands
and there's a guy on the mound trying to get me out (in a game).
It's a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The scene at the rail above the Cardinals' dugout was almost
biblical in nature, with fans literally climbing over one another
to get close. You half expected to see an autograph-seeker on a mat
lowered through a hole in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire: ``When I was a kid, I could care less about what guys
(in the major leagues) did. Nowadays, you hear kids say, `You're my
hero.' It sort of ticks me off because I never did that when I was
a kid. My comeback is, `Your father's your hero.'''
</P>
<P>
   __ McGwire further griped that he has commanded headlines
throughout this season when he !ital!hasn't!off! hit home runs, and
wondered aloud why he was considered a more sought-after news
subject than any of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever hit a home run every game,'' McGwire said. ``I
think sometimes people are getting so wrapped up in this home-run
stuff that they're (failing) to realize that baseball is not a
home-run game. It's the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   My. Here we haven't even gotten to Flag Day yet and the man is
already exasperated by the frenzy he and his bat have generated.
Imagine what it will be like if he is mounting a serious challenge
to Maris' record of 61 home runs come September.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire might do well to lighten up and enjoy the moment, which
was the case in recent years as Cal Ripken Jr. chased Lou Gehrig's
ironman record, Pete Rose tried to match Joe DiMaggio's hitting
streak, and George Brett sought to join Ted Williams as a .400
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Even as McGwire attempts to shrug off his feats, teammates,
managers and former players ratchet up the rhetoric in attempting
to describe them. And him.
</P>
<P>
   Said former Dodgers and Cardinals pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, a
broadcaster in San Diego: ``It's almost like they should have
another league besides this one, and somebody should call McGwire
up, because he's that much better than anybody at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, a teammate of McGwire's at
Oakland who previously had faced him while a member of the Toronto
Blue Jays, said, ``He's definitely the premier and marquee power
hitter today _ and possibly in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter point could well be decided this season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing expressions in baseball is ``on pace
to.'' It's usually not invoked until the All-Star break. McGwire
has changed that.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for home runs through the month of May was
24, set last year by Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. McGwire equaled that
with a week to go in the month, then tacked on three more homers
for 27 _ through the 51 games he's played.
</P>
<P>
   The arithmetic is simple enough to do. McGwire has had six stays
on the disabled list during his 11 seasons in the major leagues,
which has limited him to an average of 124 games per year. If he
maintains his homer pace and logs that many games, he'll hit 66. If
he can put in 143 games (his average over the past two seasons),
the projection climbs to an inconceivable 76.
</P>
<P>
   With 68 RBI in those 51 games, he has set a pace for 191 RBI.
Wilson set a record of 190 _ long thought to be untouchable _ with
the Chicago Cubs in 1930. (Texas' Juan Gonzalez, with 71 RBI, might
get there first.)
</P>
<P>
   Another possible record that so far has received little
attention: walks. Babe Ruth set the major-league record with 170 in
1923. With 60 walks through 51 games, McGwire is on track to break
that one if he plays 145 games.
</P>
<P>
   And as pitchers have gotten more and more shy about putting
something over the plate to McGwire, he might not even need that
many. In a recent four-game series at Chicago, Cubs pitchers walked
him nine times. In extra innings against San Francisco recently, he
was intentionally walked with two out and the bases empty.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire doesn't seem to be in danger of getting annoyed with his
ever-shrinking complement of hittable pitches and chasing bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand players who get frustrated with a walk,''
the former USC slugger said. ``You give the guy behind you a better
chance of getting a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And being a cog in the program, St. Louis manager Tony La Russa
said, is McGwire's singular objective. ``He's not a selfish guy and
that will not change from the beginning to the end,'' La Russa
said. ``With some players around the league, it's `I've got to get
my numbers. I've got to get my money.' But Mark knows that a walk
could trigger a rally as well as a finishing hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors will work in McGwire's favor as he piles up home
runs at a rate not seen since Maris was busting fences for the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball just expanded by two teams, to 30, and McGwire is sure
to benefit from a diluted pitching pool. Also, as part of the
effort to attract fans, several new ballparks are more
hitter-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will further benefit from a pitching philosophy that has
been revised in recent years. This 6-foot-5, 250-pound hulk stands
right on top of the plate to achieve maximal reach of the outside
corner, but there are few pitchers today who will attempt to move
him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intimidating figure,'' said Stottlemyre. ``You get
into those situations where you think, `Well, I've got to pitch
around this guy. I can't let him beat me here.' But those are the
times where you hang a breaking ball. What is pitching around him?
Throwing four balls to the screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home crowds boo when they walk him. Everybody wants to see him
swing the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has just proven, each time he goes to the plate and doesn't
hit one (a home run), he's that much more dangerous the next time
he comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   What's this? Someone dwelling on the home runs again? Someone
citing the phenomenon and the stir it creates?
</P>
<P>
   It could well cause the furrows in Mark McGwire's troubled brow
to deepen ever more.

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

DODGERS, NOMO AGREE IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hideo Nomo changed the face of baseball and
brought pride to Japanese people on two continents, but in the last
few weeks he never could shake the feeling that he was no longer
wanted by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Nomo, who is struggling after once being the
club's top pitcher, asked the Dodgers to trade him. Monday they
obliged, designating him for assignment and leaving behind the 1995
Rookie of the Year Award, a 1996 no-hitter and countless memories
that forever make him part of Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   The club now has seven days to make a trade and three more to
pass him through waivers. If Nomo's status is unchanged after 10
days, he becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not pitching well and he would admit to that,'' said
former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, who was instrumental in
bringing Nomo to the Dodgers four years ago. ``I talked to him and
this was not a sudden decision. We had a good dialogue, but when he
decided a change in environment was best for him and the team, it
came to closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His time here will always be remembered as very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, 29, who came to the United States after pitching five
successful seasons in Japan, finishes his Dodgers career with a
45-36 record and 3.51 ERA. He averaged 234 strikeouts during his
first three seasons and led the National League during his rookie
year. Last September, Nomo reached 500 strikeouts faster than any
pitcher in major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, Nomo was just 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA in 12 starts.
He lost 7-3 on Saturday and matched a career high with seven walks
in his previous outing. He complained to teammates that the Dodgers
were pulling him out of games early.
</P>
<P>
   Although his spot as the most popular player in the Asian
community had been replaced by Korean Chan Ho Park, it still was a
surprising move given the vast global potential of the Dodgers
through new owner Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's arrival in 1995 had sparked Nomomania with sellout crowds
at Dodger Stadium and his face all over television and national
magazines. He was the first Japanese player in the major leagues
since Masanori Murukami of the San Francisco Giants in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But the club, mired in lengthy trade talks with the Seattle
Mariners over pitcher Randy Johnson, was not in a position to be
nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid further distractions to its struggling (27-29) team,
the Dodgers quickly designated Nomo for assignment and cleared him
off the roster. Triple-A lefthander Gary Rath takes Nomo's spot on
the roster and left-hander Dennis Reyes will replace him in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, through his agent Don Nomura, first spoke to the Dodgers
six weeks ago about his displeasure. The two sides spoke again
Saturday and Sunday and demanded a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be best for me that I go to a team that needs my
pitching,'' he said during an afternoon news conference at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very surprised by all that has happened,'' Dodgers
manager Bill Russell said. ``He struggled this year, but we kept
sending him out there every fifth day. I know we had disagreements
when I took him out of games, but I told him that that was my role
as manager. He always came to play and he never wanted to come out.
He was a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nomo complained to teammates about a lack of support
from Russell, there were several other factors that figured in
Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!According to sources, Nomo was displeased when the
Dodgers refused to discuss a contract extension last winter. Nomura
traveled to the club's training camp in Vero Beach to talk to
Claire, but the Dodgers said they would talk about a new contract
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo is at the end of a three-year deal worth $2.8 million this
season and $4.3 overall. He was coming off arthroscopic surgery on
his right elbow and did not pitch well during spring training.
Although he led the club with two complete games, his velocity and
control were erratic.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!The trade of the Dodgers top player, Mike Piazza, on
May 15 showed no one was safe after the sale by O'Malley to
Murdoch's Fox group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a much different place to him,'' Nomura said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Nomura said, the move was designed to give him
a new start. It is an idea not lost on Seattle's Johnson, who wants
to leave the Mariners because they will not give him a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I worth?'' Johnson said Sunday. ``And what have I been
worth to this team the last two or three years. What is the value?
I'm worth a couple of fungo bats and a bucket of balls. Used ones
at that. It's comical.''

NEW ORDER DRAGS DODGERS OFFICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Less than 24 hours after Hideo Nomo told the Los
Angeles Dodgers he was going public with his demand to be traded,
he was gone. Nomo tried to force the hand of club executive vice
president Fred Claire and the wrath was quick and permanent.
</P>
<P>
   That has been Claire's style since he took over the Dodgers
baseball operation in 1987. And that's why the dragging nature of
the pending Randy Johnson trade with Seattle is so surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Claire called an agent or another team and said
this was the offer and the guy on the other line had 24 hours to
respond. He did it with Kirk Gibson, Darryl Strawberry, Orel
Hershiser and Todd Worrell. Most of those stories had happy
endings.
</P>
<P>
   But once again it is clear that Claire no longer acts alone.
</P>
<P>
   Claire says the Johnson trade talks ``have dragged on far too
long and will be resolved soon.'' It could happen before tonight's
game against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But.
</P>
<P>
   The differing management styles of the new Dodgers hierarchy has
helped create the impasse in the Johnson deal and ruined all the
momentum the club took out of its first winning road trip. That's
why former owner Peter O'Malley, now chairman of the board, has to
get the troops in one room and get them all on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have Fox man Chase Carey, new team president Bob
Graziano and Claire, who was passed over for Graziano's job.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, the point man on the Piazza deal after Claire dragged his
feet, spends money to make money. He was ripped when overspending
to get the new NFL TV contract for Fox. But football became a
bargain when all the CBS local affiliates jumped to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Carey wants Johnson and doesn't mind the time and money it will
take. He doesn't appear to understand that a protracted negotiation
can destroy a team, even one he thought he had overhauled by
getting rid of Piazza. His new team is better, but lingering trade
talks disrupt the delicate balance of a clubhouse no matter what
Bobby Bonilla says.
</P>
<P>
   This impasse is not all the Dodgers' fault. The Seattle Mariners
have a lot of issues on their end. General manager Woody Woodward
was vilified when the team did not make do well last year after an
inspiring run in 1996 that landed the Mariners within two games of
the World Series. He has two of the top players in baseball in Ken
Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez and still hasn't won a pennant. He
also traded promising Jose Cruz Jr. last year for relief help that
never came.
</P>
<P>
   After Woodward failed to offer Johnson a contract extension, the
pitcher became disruptive. Griffey and manager Lou Piniella want
him out even if it costs Seattle the playoffs. It is a far bigger
mess than anything the Dodgers have seen, Nomo or not.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, a former GM with the Yankees and Cincinnati Reds, is a
plodding sort, which makes his dilemma worse.
</P>
<P>
   He is asking for tonight's starter Darren Dreifort, who has won
three straight and is looking very much like the pitcher they took
with the second pick in the 1992 draft (behind Rodriguez).
</P>
<P>
   Woodward wanted Ismael Valdes for Johnson during the winter.
Claire said no, remember former Dodger Pedro Martinez and the Cy
Young Award he won with Montreal?
</P>
<P>
   Claire was looking at trouble if he let Nomo stick around. At
one time, he was hopeful the Mariners might take Nomo off his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six days, Claire will talk to a lot of clubs about a
suspect right-hander who can give them 200 innings even if many of
them are bad. Baltimore and Boston already are interested. Nomo
could even wind up in Seattle, although the Mariners watched him
pitch on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Dreifort does wind up in the Johnson deal, know that it will
not be a Claire deal. Graziano is a quick thinker, but Claire's
baseball experience made him the man for the job during the Fox
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Dodgers have a three-headed dog. And lots of
confusion.

SIGNS POINTED TO EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire is due in town today and his former
USC teammate, Randy Johnson, might be on his way to L.A., too.
Meanwhile, back in Omaha, Neb., the current crop of Trojans
ballplayers are still alive after turning back Florida in extra
innings in an elimination game at the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ... We interrupt this column to bring you the following weather
advisory: The severe weather system that spawned tornadoes in South
Dakota and driving rain and wind in Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Michigan has left its mark locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tornado'' pulled up from Chavez Ravine on Monday
afternoon, some three years after touching down, and there's no
telling where it'll land, though sophisticated radar tracking the
phenomenon indicates Baltimore or Boston could be directly in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Hideo Nomo and the Los Angeles Dodgers parted ways on
Monday and some people sounded as if they couldn't have been more
surprised if a dark funnel cloud had appeared out of nowhere and
ripped the roofs off their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, there were warning signs aplenty that Nomo's days
as a Dodger were numbered. The first sirens sounded in Nomo's head
long before he started on a losing streak that reached four games
Saturday and well before he was pulled into manager Bill Russell's
office last week and given assurances he wasn't part of a trade
package for Seattle southpaw Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't sign the 29-year-old righthander to a
long-term deal over the summer, citing his offseason elbow surgery
and the team's impending sale to Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group. It was
then Nomo knew he wasn't in the Japanese pro league anymore, where
tradition and loyalty are batterymates.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo figured he had more than earned his keep here, having
brought busloads of new fans to the ballpark and inspired the sale
of sushi in Dodger Stadium concession stands as well as the
construction of 31 large outdoor screens in 13 cities in his native
Japan so his countrymen could follow each of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   Nomomania was big on both sides of the Pacific Rim. But the
pitcher from Osaka who earned the nickname ``The Tornado'' because
of his unorthodox twisting delivery sensed his support within the
Dodgers' organization was waning after pitching coach Dave Wallace,
who had overseen Nomo's initial tryout with the Dodgers, left last
fall for a front-office position with the New York Mets and owner
Peter O'Malley turned the team over to Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that his fastball _ which in his first three
years had been the perfect foil for his forkball _ had been
downgraded by the experts this year, from the F-5 class to F-3 in
terms of the havoc it was capable of wreaking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers traded catcher Mike Piazza, the supposed
cornerstone of the franchise, Nomo could see the sayonara on the
wall. If anything, his desultory performance in his past five
starts _ he allowed 18 earned runs in his last 262/3 innings _ was
a message in and of itself, one he finally articulated through an
interpreter on Monday when he said he ``definitely needed a change
of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   The end might not have come so abruptly if the Dodgers had been
able to put Tupperware lids over the mouths of all their employees.
As soon as word leaked out that Nomo's name was being bandied about
in trade talks, the pitcher's course was clear.
</P>
<P>
   After all, where Nomo comes from, appearances matter. In Japan,
you don't dare send a gift of cash if the bills are wrinkled and
worn. Anything less than crisp bills is liable to be taken as an
affront rather than an act of generosity. Likewise, in Nomo's eyes,
anything less than a crisp new contract was an insult. To save
face, he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Nomo's agent Don Nomura finally met with
general manager Fred Claire and requested a trade on Sunday, some
six weeks after Nomo had first voiced his misgivings in a
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Johnson saga, which has been dragging on for almost a
week now, effectively coating the Dodgers clubhouse floor in
eggshells, the Dodgers moved swiftly on this, designating Nomo for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The move meant Nomo was dropped from the team's 40-man roster.
The Dodgers have 10 days to shop Nomo around. Meanwhile, Johnson
can be theirs today for the right price, which figures to include
pitcher Ismael Valdes. It's a deal they can no longer afford to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   When Nomo broke in with the Dodgers in 1995, he became only the
second Japanese player to appear in the major leagues and the first
in 30 years. That he went on to win Rookie of the Year honors after
posting 236 strikouts that season was no small source of pride to a
nation that perceived its own ballplayers as lesser stars than
their counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers routinely fielded some 100 Japanese media requests
on days when Nomo pitched at home. Now he's taking his arm and his
army elsewhere. Dodgers fans can only hope a heat wave _ something
in the high 90s _ is moving in.

L.A. SKIES NOT TRUE BLUE FOR RUSSELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is two hours before game time, and the manager
of the Los Angeles Dodgers is alone in his office filling out his
lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   There is an eerie silence, and an air of gloominess pervades the
room.
</P>
<P>
   It is late Sunday morning, and the Dodgers have lost two
straight home games to the Cincinnati Reds to drop below .500
again.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Russell is feeling the pain of their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we get back from our first winning road trip, and all we
hear about is this Randy Johnson trade,'' says Russell softly.
``It's been a terrible distraction. A few players on the team
wonder if they're going to be here or not. We come back here on a
high, and all our players are asked about is Randy Johnson. All
that stuff makes it tough for our players to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell shakes his head slowly in exasperation because he
knows his team is performing below expectations for a new corporate
ownership that won't have as much patience with him as Peter
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby Dodger clubhouse, Eric Karros is saying, ``We have
the potential to turn it around and start winning. But potential is
a funny word. It means you haven't achieved what you're expected to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Sheffield is saying, ``When I first heard I was traded
to L.A., I thought, `Wow, I'll be playing with Mike Piazza. I'm
gonna see some pitches.' I didn't realize I was being traded for
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bobby Bonilla is smiling and laughing and acting in his
free-spirited manner.
</P>
<P>
   The room where the Dodger players dress doesn't have the
funereal atmosphere of their manager's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell knows the cruel rites of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his job is on the line because the Dodgers are
struggling and because new people are running the team who have no
allegiance to him because they didn't hire him.
</P>
<P>
   He knows fingers are being pointed at him by those who would
like to see him fail, and he knows there is only one way he will
survive this dark season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to start winning,'' says Russell. ``Winning cures
a lot of ills. This is a long season. Things change. Things turn.
Our turn will come. I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the brightest of Dodger years.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the season when the team would ascend to
the next level with Mike Piazza and Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros
and Todd Zeile supplying the power and with Eric Young getting on
base and with a heralded pitching staff shutting down the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers still might go on a frenzied tear, but the season
has not unfolded the way it was scripted in the optimism of the
early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza and his thundering bat now are now dispensing
heroics for the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile is doing hard time with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo has lost seven of nine decisions, lost speed on his
fast ball, and has lost the confidence of the Dodger hierarchy that
on Monday all but waived him.
</P>
<P>
   The earned run averages of Ismael Valdes and Chan Ho Park look
like T-bill percentage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin refugees named Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles
Johnson and Jim Eisenreich now are part of the Dodgers roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching just hasn't performed like we expected it to,''
admits Russell, and it will unravel again later in the day when
Antonio Osuna and Scott Radinsky fail to protect a Dodger lead in
the late innings against the Reds. ``No one expected us to struggle
as much as we have in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Mike Piazza to depart the Dodgers, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising,'' says Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if someone told you a year ago that Mike Piazza would be
traded by the Dodgers?'' Russell is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have believed it,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are Sheffield and Bonilla behaving?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. No problems. And I don't expect any. They want to win
just like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel pressure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Pressure's part of this job. I knew it would be there when
I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bill Russell took it, Peter O'Malley was signing his
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   And Peter O'Malley and his father, the late Walter O'Malley,
never fired a manager during the team's 40 previous seasons in Los
Angeles, remaining faithful to Walter Alston and Tom Lasorda and
Russell through the successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter O'Malley is now gone, and the Rupert Murdoch Fox
forces now operate the team.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Russell is quite aware that Murdoch has a ruthless
history of making major changes when he takes over a new business.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell won't say it because it would violate the codes of
his sport.
</P>
<P>
   But he's feeling the pressure these days.
</P>
<P>
   That sorrowful look that remains fixed to his face as he sits
solemnly behind his office desk betrays his feelings about what has
been a numbing season for him and his team.

UCLA'S VALENT AWAITS BASEBALL-DRAFT JUDGMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So here is Eric Valent sitting in the UCLA
baseball locker room, a place he's called home for three
power-packed years, trying to explain that he's neither too small
nor too slow to play pro baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have really good power for my size, but yeah, I'm only 200
pounds,'' he explained. ``But that's not all it is. It's the swing,
the bat speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost exasperated, as though he had to prove something to
someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can play, you can play,'' he said. ``And that's the
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No, here's the thing: Eric Valent, only a junior but already a
two-time All-American, a Team USA veteran, the Pacific-10
Conference's career home-run leader and UCLA's career RBI leader,
is one of the best outfield prospects in college baseball and
easily will be taken within the first two rounds of today's Major
League amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   You see, he doesn't have to state his case because he already
has.
</P>
<P>
   Valent strode to the plate in mid-April against USC freshman
pitcher Rik Currier in a Six-Pac game at Dedeaux Field. Currier
threw away from the left-hander, moving the count to 2-0. Valent,
in the midst of hitting eight home runs in nine games _ he would
eventually average one home run in every three games this year _
squared his frame in the batter's box and waited.
</P>
<P>
   Currier offered a fastball inside but not inside enough. Valent
turned with lightning-quick efficiency and crushed the ball to dead
right field. It seemed to rise as it left the park, finally landing
on the roof of an adjacent parking garage some 480 feet later.
</P>
<P>
   Said USC coach Mike Gillespie after the game, arching his neck
toward Valentville: ``You don't see many go up there.''!off!
</P>
<P>
   With a home-run swing and home-run power to go with it, Valent
is hearing a lot of different things these days. He hears the
Yankees and the Dodgers love him and could make him a first-round
pick, ensuring him at least a shot at a $1 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy, isn't it,'' he asks, a huge grin emerging.
</P>
<P>
   He hears the Mariners also adore his skills.
</P>
<P>
   But he also picks up other things. He's too slow, some say, so
whoever picks him up will have to move him from center field to a
corner outfield position, where he can rely less on his feet and
more on his rocket arm.
</P>
<P>
   He sees Baseball America, which named him the 34th-best prospect
in the draft and the second-best power hitter in college baseball
(behind Miami's Pat Burrell, rumored to be the top pick of the
draft). After his freshman All-American season with the Bruins,
they wrote Valent needed more power in his game to raise his stock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after his 30 home runs (second in the nation) in 1998, the
same people are saying he's one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear some stuff, but all it is is talk,'' he said.
``Someone is always going to knock you, but all it takes is one
person to like you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that, being a top prospect in what is considered an
unusually deep amateur draft, many more than one person likes
Valent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the greats,'' UCLA hitting coach Vince Beringhele
said. ``You don't have to worry about him ... he's worked hard on
both his defense and offense. He's complete.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA head coach Gary Adams looks around his office before he
says it, as though he wants to make sure no one is listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got him, I didn't think he would hit with that much
power,'' he said. ``I thought he'd be a doubles hitter. I didn't
take into account him getting that much stronger. He has such
strong, quick hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Adams compares Valent with former USC center fielder
Fred Lynn, only with more power. Not too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Valent hit .289 with 12 home runs and 55 RBI as a freshman, then
blossomed in 1997 with 27 homers and 91 RBI, helping the Bruins to
the College World Series for the first time since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had such a good time,'' Valent said. ``I was in
the lineup with Jon Heinrics and Troy Glaus (Glaus had 34 homers in
1997 and Heinricks 28). ``You see them hit homers...''
</P>
<P>
   Valent joined in. His 27 home runs were the best of any
returning player this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaus (the third pick of the '97 draft) and Heinrics (a
ninth-round selection of the Marlins) left, as did a trio of junior
pitchers (Pete Zamora, Jim Parque and Tom Jacquez). Valent and
right fielder Eric Byrnes were left holding the brunt of
responsibility for offensive production and leadership on a very
young team.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1998, it got to him. He began the year miserably,
hitting .148 with no homers through his first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to carry the team,'' Valent admitted. ``It was
tough after getting a taste of glory last year. We'd have it some
days, then wouldn't have it other days.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Beringhele: ``He was playing for the draft and he had to be
the leader. He tried to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Valent, with a bit of coaxing, realized as much. He relaxed at
the plate and good things started to happen.
</P>
<P>
   He batted .362 with 30 home runs and 72 RBI over the rest of the
year. In his last 20 games, he hit .400 (40-100) with 16 homers and
36 RBI. At one point, he homered in five consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, he had the Pac-10 home-run record (69), becoming the
third player in conference history _ with Glaus and some guy named
Mark McGwire _ to hit 30 or more homers in a year. His career RBI
total (219) was one shy of the Pac-10 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was easy to put up big numbers,'' he said. ``This
year it wasn't like that. So I'm pretty happy with what I've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could've stayed a little longer, maybe, but maybe
it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he will, without the cliched waffling between pro
baseball and a final year of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's drafted past the first round, I'll talk to him about
coming back,'' said Adams, a gleam in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is not going to happen.''

BUFFALO'S FANS GIVE CRITICISM TOO QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JARRE FEES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seinfeld's Kosmo Kramer knew how to make an entrance. A stumble,
a pratfall, a laugh. Buffalo's Kramer is about to make an exit and
it won't be funny to anyone but the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek, nicknamed Kramer by his teammates, on Sunday wore
two homemade signs on the back of his practice jersey. One sign
read ``Kramer,'' the other read ``Swiss Cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kramer sign was a peace offering to his teammates; Hasek
reportedly hated the name. The second was an apology for the
70-foot goal he allowed in the Sabres' 2-0 loss to the Caps in Game
4 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   One soft goal and the man thinks he's Swiss cheese. Worse,
Buffalo fans behaved like cheeseheads, booing their favorite son in
the last minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same fans who booed Hasek a year ago when his
public feud with Coach of the Year Ted Nolan led to Nolan's exit
from the team; the same fans who forgave Hasek's transgressions
when he won the Olympic gold medal for the Czech Republic; the same
fans who pretended until Saturday that Hasek could win the Stanley
Cup all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't score a goal, a 70-foot shot goes in and all of a
sudden he's a bum,'' said coach Lindy Ruff on Sunday. ``He carried
us all year and through the playoffs. I thought the (Swiss cheese)
sign was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff scoffed at the idea Hasek doesn't do well in big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score one goal last night. One shot beat us and I
don't consider that not coming up big.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 takes place tonight, and Washington has a 3-1 lead in the
series. The Swiss-cheese goalie will probably not lift the Stanley
Cup this year. He will have to make do with the gold medal, his own
asteroid from Czech astronomers and almost certain MVP and Vezina
(goaltending) trophies from the league.
</P>
<P>
   TV's Kramer had his series ended by the star. Buffalo's Kramer
 &UR; !ital! &LR; is &UR; !off! &LR;  the star. Considering how long he's held this
series together, Sabres fans should be clamoring for a curtain
call.
</P>
<P>
   __Rinkside: The return of injured defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakonov to Detroit's Joe
Louis Arena on Sunday left Detroit fans cheering, Dallas players
banging their sticks on the ice and the Fox announcers too choked
up to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinov and Mnatsakonov were critically injured in a
limousine accident last summer. Both are in wheelchairs and are
expected to remain there for some time; in Mnatsakonov's case,
probably the rest of his life. They watched part of the game from
owner Mike Illitch's luxury box, waving to the crowd when they were
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said Saturday he knew the men's
introduction would be an emotional moment for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the accident) didn't just happen to Detroit,'' he said.
``It happened just as much to our team. It happened to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the accident occurred after postseason play,
Konstantinov was not covered by medical insurance. The Illitch
family has taken care of most of his expenses, and Detroit players
have raised an additional $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ More heroes: Kings captain Rob Blake, Detroit's Vyacheslav
Fetisov and Jamie McLennan of the St. Louis Blues are the finalists
for the NHL's William Masterson Memorial trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The award, named after the former Minnesota North Stars player,
is given annually to a player who shows a high degree of
perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who recovered from injuries that limited him to 92 games
over the previous three seasons, led the Kings to the playoffs this
year for the first time since 1993. He also played for Team Canada
in the 1998 Olympics and was named outstanding defenseman of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fetisov survived the limousine accident that critically injured
Konstantinov and Mnatsakonov, recovering in time to take the
Stanley Cup home to Russia last summer. The 40-year-old defenseman
is expected to retire after the playoffs and plans to work with
minor hockey in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan, 26, had bacterial meningitis two years ago. He was
hospitalized for nearly a month, lost 30 pounds and had to learn to
walk again. McLennan returned to the Blues this season and had a
16-8-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor won the Masterson trophy in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kings media relations assistant dies: Michael Jund, Los
Angeles Kings media-relations assistant, died Sunday of a heart
attack. Jund, 22, was born with a heart defect. He grew up in
Manhattan Beach and worked with the Kings during the 1997-98
season.

FOR USC, IT'S BEEN A WHILE BETWEEN CONQUESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ USC used to spend so much time in Omaha that it
had to pay state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of two decades between 1958 and 1978, USC came to the
College World Series 13 times and won the NCAA title 10 times,
including five in a row from 1970 to 1974. On three occasions, the
Trojans went unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Omaha didn't roll out the red carpet back then as much as a
green one, envious that one team in college baseball could be so
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to treat us like royalty,'' said former USC coach
Rod Dedeaux. ``Of course, they booed us during games. Everyone
likes the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. People around here aren't calling USC an
underdog as much as a stranger. The Trojans' trip here in 1998
marks only the second trip to Omaha for USC since their last
title-winning team in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They lost their first game to LSU but stayed alive Monday night
with a 12-10 extra inning win in an elimination game against
Florida. The Trojans play Mississippi State in another
loser-go-home game tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of USC coming here as something other than a heavy
favorite is different for the Trojans as much as its fans. Florida,
the team USC eliminated, was the No. 1 seed in the tourney. All
three of Florida's career appearances have come since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that somehow this has devalued the Trojans is
understandable, but also bothersome. ``You stay away for awhile
like we did, and people start to wonder where we are, or what's
gone wrong,'' said USC coach Mike Gillespie. ``It gets like those
people who wonder why Denver or Buffalo can't win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had good teams. Seven USC teams in the last seven years
played in the regional final. We haven't been able to get here as
often as we like. But that doesn't mean we don't have a good
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Omaha is flush with opinions that the SEC and ACC are now the
best conferences, too, and that west coast baseball is losing
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams from the west coast have given a pretty good account of
themselves over the years,'' said Gillespie after the win. ``It
won't surprise me to see one or two teams in the final. But many
people are riding the wave of the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of Long Beach under Dave Snow is a perfect
example of how baseball in the west has grown. Pepperdine has been
strong for a long time. So have several teams in our conference.
Now we're seeing Washington, Oregon State and Loyola step up.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't need carbon dating to find out when things began to
unravel at USC.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA cast the first asteroid-sized stone in the late '70s
when it reapportioned scholarship limitations during the first
major phase of cost-cutting and gender equity. Scholarships in
spring sports like track and baseball were essentially cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   There was an extra twist to that knife, too. ``It wasn't just
that they cut scholarships,'' said Dedeaux, who retired after the
1986 season. ``It was also how they interpreted the use of those
scholarships. They even put limits on how we counted academic
scholarships toward our team total.''
</P>
<P>
   Public schools, like Long Beach, Fullerton and UCLA, could split
their scholarships up since their tuition costs, relative to a
public school like USC, were modest. The impact meant USC could
sign half as many players as they were accustomed, and they felt it
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1979 and 1987, USC failed to qualify for a postseason
regional eight of nine times. The one year it did, it lost two
straight games to Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Gillespie has fielded a team which has been a
regular contender for the Pac-10 title. Troy's East Regional win
which got them here marked the eighth postseason appearance in 10
years. In 1995, the last time USC made it to Omaha, Troy made it to
the title game, losing to Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the job Mike has done,'' said Dedeaux. ``We're winning
every year and contending for the league title and a regular in the
tournament. There are a lot more programs now playing top-level
baseball. It isn't as easy for any one program to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Fullerton has won three NCAA titles in
the last 20 years (1979, 1984 and 1995). Pepperdine won the title
in 1992 under Andy Lopez, who now coaches Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, Fullerton and Long Beach State have been
to the CWS four times. Only three schools have made more
appearances in Omaha LSU (8) Miami (7) and Florida State (6). Among
USC's Pac-10 friends, titles have been won in the last two decades
by Arizona (1980, 1986), Arizona State (1981, plus a second and two
third-place finishes) and Stanford (1987, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   If it vexes USC fans to see Pepperdine and Stanford, private
schools from different ends of the athletic spectrum, win national
titles while USC struggles to win a regional, so be it. The field
has changed and it's probably to the benefit of baseball on the
left coast.
</P>
<P>
   USC and Long Beach are in the same state, Nebraska. They are in
the same state, too, meaning they're very much alive in the CWS.

SEAN BURROUGHS FAVORITE OF BIG-LEAGUE SCOUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ When Long Beach Wilson High third baseman
Sean Burroughs boots a ball, the major league baseball scouts are
there to see it.
</P>
<P>
   A swing and miss? Yep, although a rarity, they see that, too.
</P>
<P>
   A popup? You got it, again not common, but they see that, too.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this happens during practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here nearly every day,'' Wilson coach Mark Clabough
said while a couple of scouts watched Burroughs swing a wood bat
during a mid-season practice.
</P>
<P>
   For the typical 17-year-old kid, the attention has created deal
of
</P>
<P>
   pressure and, at times, ruined a senior season.
</P>
<P>
   For Burroughs, who won't turn 18 until September, it's greeted
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big of a deal,'' said Burroughs, who is expected
to be a top 10 pick this morning when the three-day Major League
amateur draft begins, and will be at third base when the Bruins
play Esperanza at 4 p.m. in the CIF Southern Section DivisionI
semifinals at Blair Field.
</P>
<P>
   But it is
</P>
<P>
   a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to forget about these days,'' Jeff Burroughs, Sean's
father, said. ``Scouts these days put (prospective draftees)
through psychological tests, eye tests, strength tests, signability
discussions and home visits.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that way in 1969 when Burroughs was completing his
final days terrorizing the Moore League as a senior at Wilson. The
scouts did their homework by strictly watching the kids play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have a scout come to my house,'' Jeff said.
</P>
<P>
   xleg Jeff Burroughs was chosen by the Washington Senators with
the first pick of the 1969 draft. His son probably won't be the
first pick today. The owners of the top pick, the Philadelphia
Phillies, list Sean among their four candidates, but are expected
to choose University of Miami power hitter Pat Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   Sean will almost certainly be selected early in the opening
round, though. If that happens, the Burroughs will join Tom and Ben
Grieve as the only father and son to be selected in the first round
and the first father-son combo from the same high school to be
chosen in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Jeff was given an $80,000 signing bonus by the
Senators, which was enough to sway him away from a USC scholarship
to begin a professional career that included 16 major-league
seasons, 240 home runs and National League MVP honors in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, whom Baseball America projects as the ninth overall pick
by the San Diego Padres, will be offered considerably more. Three
players from last year's draft signed for more than $2 million as a
bonus, including a record $2.5million given to pitcher Matt
Anderson by Detroit, and 15 others collected more than $1million.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will the bonus be enough to keep Sean from
honoring the USC scholarship he signed in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too hard to say right now,'' said Sean, rated by Baseball
America as the high school player most ready to play in the big
leagues, and the best pure prep hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Sean ends up, he'll be ``going on to the next
chapter,'' according to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The book began about the time Sean, who was born in 1980, left
the crib.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good arm and a good swing when he was 3 or 4 years
old,'' said Jeff, who retired from baseball in 1985. ``I guess you
could say he was born with a bat in his crib.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jeff Burroughs and his wife, Debbie, didn't steer Sean
toward the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played soccer first,'' said Jeff, who was a quarterback in
his days at Wilson. ``He was a normal Southern California kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal, that is, if a normal Southern California childhood
included the ability to throw a baseball 75 mph and hit home runs
traveling 350 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sean introduced himself to the world as a 5-foot-5, 175-pound
11-year-old when he led the Long Beach Little League All-Stars to
the first of two consecutive World Series championships. The second
season ended with a guest appearance on the David Letterman Show
and a parade down Pine Avenue in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Sean, ``seems like a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sean grew older, he transformed from the pudgy youngster into
a well-proportioned 6-foot-2, 195-pounder with a calm disposition
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're pretty darn similar,'' Jeff Burroughs said.
``It's really kind of scary how similar we are. The poor guy even
looks like me a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years of varsity soccer helped Sean slim down, as did a
stringent workout program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these pictures around the house,'' Sean said,
``where I'm a short kid with a couple of chins and a big belly.
It's kind of funny to look at now.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what his body looked like, however, he could always
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the best third baseman in the league as a
freshman,'' Lakewood coach Spud O'Neil said. ``And that hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Millikan's Dan Peters, who played against Jeff in high school,
remembers his first encounter with the younger Burroughs. It was
during a Moore League game in Sean's freshman year and Millikan had
senior Eric Ireland, who owned a fastball that reached the low 90s
and a scholarship to the University of Texas, on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland made him look silly the first time up,'' Peters said.
``I go out to coach third and I hear Sean getting kind of verbal
with his teammates. He was saying things like `This guy has
nothing,' (and) `I'll (get a hit) next time.' I'm thinking, OK,
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time up, Burroughs lined a single off Ireland's foot
and he followed that up with another line-drive single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK, this guy's legit,''' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs hit better than .300 as a freshman, bested .400 as a
sophomore, and earned All-CIF honors last season after hitting .456
and compiling a 7-1 record with a 1.75 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   This year he's been even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so much better than anyone else around here, it's not
even funny,'' Poly coach Bill Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs is hitting .511, with seven doubles, three triples,
seven home runs, 35 RBIs, 22 walks and three strikeouts in 88
at-bats. He also committed only three errors at third base and
routinely makes the tough plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work over the summer helped build those numbers. In
addition to playing locally in the Connie Mack League, Sean
traveled to North Carolina, Florida and San Diego for competition.
The highlight of the summer was an invitation to the Team 1
Showcase, featuring the country's best prep players, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out at the beach took a back seat to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a different guy ever since (the Team 1 Showcase),''
Clabough said. ``He went there with a real good group of guys and
stood out. He always knew he was a good ballplayer, but I think he
saw he could play against the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, he would be named as the CIF Player of the Year,
which his father won following his senior season in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Sean doesn't really care to talk about any player of the year
awards. That's not his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the attention,'' Sean said. ``I never really
have. The team recognition is more important. I just want to do my
thing and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a CIF championship would be included in his definition
of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working our (butts) off for four years,'' Burroughs
said. ``We had big plans for this year. It's the last year that a
lot of us will play with each other. Obviously, a CIF championship
would be a great way to go out.''

DAY ENJOYING CWS PROVING GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Paul Day knew the situation perfectly well. He'd
been practicing it since he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be playing Whiffle Ball,'' Day was saying on Monday,
still relishing Long Beach State's stunning come-from-behind
College World Series victory over the Florida State the night
before, ``and we'd be saying stuff like `Seventh game of the World
Series, bottom of the ninth, two out, two on, and here's the pitch
...'''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a home run. It was always
</P>
<P>
   a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now, older all of 22 and considerably wiser, Day has learned
that, by gosh, sometimes they aren't homers after all, that
sometimes ... well, go back to the fifth inning Sunday evening:
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were trailing FSU, 4-1, but they'd loaded the bases
with nobody out. And Day was the hitter ... Paul Day, the
All-American third baseman, the Big West Conference Player of the
Year, a guy who'd practically rewritten the Long Beach State record
book in what he'd earlier called his ``dream season.''
</P>
<P>
   And he struck out on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're disappointed, sure, but you can't take that at-bat out
on the field with you, or to your next at-bat,'' he said. ``Hey,
major-leaguers strike out, too. And, anyway, this whole season has
been one of picking one another up if one guy doesn't get the job
done, the next guy will. That's Dirtbag baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that seldom-used Mike Hota drilled a two-run
single, and lightly regarded Scott Redfox poked a three-run homer,
and the 49ers managed to win and stave off elimination, and Paul
Day will have another day.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon the 49ers take on Miami again; the winner moves
on, the loser goes home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about baseball,'' Day said, smiling.
``There's always the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Day, who carried the 49ers through a good part of the regular
season, has had only brief flurries of success so far in the
post-season. In 11 post-season games, in the Big West tournament,
the West Regional and in two games so far in the College World
Series, Day is hitting just .229 (11 for 48), his average falling
from .438 at the end of the regular season to today's .401.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it, Day says, is the caliber of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' he said, ``you're facing the best teams in the nation,
the best pitchers, and on an everyday basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And part of it, too, he acknowledged, is pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly,'' he said, ``it is pressure you put on your self. You
want to be aggressive but not overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each level you get to is different pressure. Like when we were
2-8 (to start the season). There was pressure to prove that we were
a better club than that. Then there was the pressure of the
Fullerton-Long Beach rivalry. And then, when we lost seven of eight
(in late April and early May), there was pressure not to let our
season get away because we'd worked so hard. And then there's the
pressure of the post-season, and now the College World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a different type of pressure today for Day, and
for just about every other amateur ballplayer, when the major
leagues conduct their draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to think about it,'' Day said. ``I'm not
worrying about where I go, or what round. It doesn't matter. It's
already been determined (by the big scouts) anyway. I wasn't
drafted out of high school, so I haven't been through it. But, like
I said, it doesn't matter. I play baseball because I love to play,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing in the College World Series, Day said, ``is the
absolute ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone playing college baseball, their dream is the College
World Series,'' he said. ``And, for us, this is like a proving
ground. The other teams here, they didn't expect us to come of the
West (Regional), so we're the underdogs. The people in Omaha have
picked up on it; we've got a lot of fans at our games, it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is Paul Day looking forward to getting another chance in the
clutch today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' he said, eagerly. All he's got to do now is get
the whiff out of Whiffle Ball.

USC STAYS ALIVE IN OMAHA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ The USC Trojans will play another day in Omaha,
and all they can do is hope their College World Series game tonight
against Mississippi State isn't as exhausting as their last two.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of watching LSU hit eight home runs against them in
their opener Saturday, the Trojans saw an 8-5 lead blow up on them
Monday night before 20,738 at Rosenblatt Stadium against top-seeded
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually outlasted the Gators by the same score as
Saturday, 12-10, scoring four runs on five hits in the 11th,
including doubles by Eric Munson and Jason Lane. But they could not
have strayed any closer to a series-ending loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Florida scored three runs with two out to tie,
the tying runs coming on Mark Ellis' two-run homer off the first
pitch by Trojans ace reliever Jack Krawcyzk. Before the inning was
over, the Gators would put runners on second and third before the
Trojans closer struck out Casey Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In the tenth, the Gators put runners on first and second with
two out, with Florida All-American Brad Wilkerson coming to the
plate. USC coach Mike Gillespie chose to walk Wilkerson
intentionally, putting the winning run on third base.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble worked. Smith worked Krawcyzk to a full count before
the closer got him on a little dribbler in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great move, especially when you win,'' said
Florida coach Andy Lopez, who took Pepperdine to the 1992 title.
``I wouldn't have pitched to Wilkerson in the same spot. I did the
same thing in 1992 (he walked Fullerton's Phil Nevin without an
open base in the title game).''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a difficult decision,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie
said. ``He's a very special hitter, a future major-leaguer. We
could not let him be the guy to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack stayed with it in an incredibly tough situation,''
Gillespie added. ``He's shown he's the kind of guy who won't crack.
That's about as gutsy as it can get for a college kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole stadium was standing on its feet and cheering that
situation,'' said USC outfielder Jeremy Freitas. ``But it was just
one moment in a game that had a million.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after USC scored four in the 11th, the Gators rallied.
Jason Dill hit a line drive off the top of the left field fence,
less than a foot away from a home run, that cashed in the second
run of the inning. But the carom off the wall came on a line right
to Freitas, who threw to second to get a stunned Dill by a good 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Florida jumped on top in the first on Casey Smith's three-run
home run off Trojans starter Jason Lane. But the Trojans scored two
runs in the second, third and fourth. Munson hit a two-run homer in
the second, Robb Gorr doubled in two runs in the third, and Brad
Ticehurst and Freitas each hit long solo home runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   While the Trojans bats were booming, Mike Penney was silencing
those of Florida. Penney replaced Lane with two out in the third.
After allowing a double and walk, Penney retired ten straight
Florida batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans scored solo runs in the sixth and seventh to take an
8-4 lead, but they also left five men on base in those innings,
failing to convert anything out of a bases loaded, one out
situation in the sixth.

GLEEFUL GIANTS ROLL OVER REDS
</HEADLINE>
  By HENRY SCHULMAN 
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Giants' hitters have done a lot of good
things this season, but they had not orchestrated one of those
gut-busting laughers that let a starting pitcher sit on the bench
and dream about his November golf vacation on Maui instead of
worrying about the next half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants finally pulled one off Monday night, burying
Cincinnati 16-3, they accomplished it against a hot team. The Reds
rolled into town off three straight wins at Los Angeles, but the
Giants simply rolled over them for their fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rout got so bad, by the eighth inning, the Reds had
utilityman Lenny Harris pitch. Sure enough, he retired the Giants
1-2-3 and even struck out his first batter, Brent Mayne, on three
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games that no matter who we threw out
there, we got the hell knocked out of us,'' Reds manager Jack
McKeon said. ``At least we found a relief pitcher in Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent and Charlie Hayes each tied career highs with five
RBIs, Hayes notching four of his in the fifth inning, when the
Giants scored a season-best eight runs.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds scored four runs and Rich Aurilia three. In fact,
every Giants starter scored at least once. Chris Jones was the last
to join the party, homering in the seventh inning for the Giants'
season-high 16th run and their 16th hit.
</P>
<P>
   This game fell under the heading of Hitting Is Contagious, a
controversial school of thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe in it,'' Giants center fielder Darryl
Hamilton said. ``In the first inning, after we were down a couple
of runs, we scored a few back to set the tone. Everyone just jumped
in and swung the bats well. You hope to have nights like this every
night, but they don't happen so often, so you've got to try to take
advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hamilton said, the Giants actually trailed 2-0 after a half
inning behind starting pitcher Mark Gardner, who has now allowed 15
first-inning runs in 12 starts. Reggie Sanders, the first batter of
the game, homered.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants fought back against rookie Eddie Priest in the
bottom of the first. Hamilton, Aurilia and Bonds all singled to
center, and all eventually scored. McKeon lifted Priest after five
batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting him hard,'' McKeon said, ``and I didn't want
to get the kid crucified.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the bullpen's job.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants went ahead 6-2 on Kent's three-run homer in the third
off Scott Sullivan, Kent's sixth of the season. The Reds got a run
back in the fourth on doubles by Dmitri Young and Bret Boone, but
the Giants blew the game open 14-3 when 13 hitters batted in the
fifth off David Weathers and Gabe White, and eight of them scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everything we hit fell in,'' said Hayes, who has
24 RBIs in just 113 at-bats. ``It's good to have that a couple of
times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes drove in the first two runs of the big inning with a
scorching double to the wall in center, then drove in the last two
with a soft single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, the second-leading RBI man on the team, raised his total
to 41 with a sacrifice fly in the first, the three-run homer in the
third and a bases-loaded walk in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Kent is achieving one preseason goal, to raise his batting
average. This time last year he was hitting .257 en route to a .250
finish. This season he's hitting .288. But his home run production
has fallen from 11 at this time last season to six.
</P>
<P>
   Kent was asked if there was any correlation between the rise in
average and the drop in home runs. He didn't like the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't appreciate any comparisons of stats this time of
year,'' he said. ``You can't judge 162 games against 30, 60, 80 or
100. You don't know what might happen. I could get hurt tomorrow,
or I could turn into Mark McGwire. I could find the right mix.''
</P>
<P>
   For one night, the Giants had nine McGwire's out there,
producing so much offense the Reds felt compelled to send a
position player to the mound for an inning. The three guys he
retired, Mayne, Stan Javier and Bill Mueller, may have been the
only dudes crying after a laugher.

A'S GET ALL SENSITIVE, THEN SLUG OUT A WIN 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It sounded crazy at first. A's manager Art Howe
was upset with his bullpen and its 7.80 ERA over the previous eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   So what did he do? He made nice. That's right. He called all
seven relievers into his office before Monday night's game, and for
a good 40 minutes he encouraged them to share their feelings with
Howe and pitching coach Rick Peterson about how they can be more
confident.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds a little like a whole staff of Stuart Smalleys
out on the mound saying to themselves, ``I'm good enough, I'm smart
enough and, doggone it, people like me.'' But who wants to argue
with results?
</P>
<P>
   The encounter-group-assisted A's bullpen was a roaring success
Monday night. It held the Twins to one run over the final 31/3
innings of the game, taking over from Mike Oquist (2-3). The A's
bombed their way to an 8-5 win, sparked by homers from Ben Grieve,
Matt Stairs, Mike Macfarlane and Scott Spiezio. Billy Taylor picked
up his ninth save, the first by an A's pitcher since May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen did a good job,'' Howe said. ``We got focused in
there. We decided what we had to do and went out and did it. We
went after people for the most part. I didn't talk to the starters,
so Okie's out of that. ... More than anything, the meeting was
about getting ahead in the count and going after hitters low in the
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern over the first third of the season was for the A's
offense to go limp when the pitchers let a game start to slip away.
The A's (23-31) had lost six of eight games before Monday and in
the losses, A's hitters were batting just .133 after the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the A's did not pick up their first hit off starter
Eric Milton (3-5) until the fourth. Once they started hitting, they
had trouble stopping and scored in every subsequent inning but the
seventh. Stairs' two-run homer in the sixth put them ahead to stay,
but late insurance runs helped a lot, too.
</P>
<P>
   The offense looked like something to be taken seriously. Rickey
Henderson stole two bases to give him 21 and tie him with Tom
Goodwin for the American League lead. Henderson, 39, is on pace to
steal 63 bases this year and surpass 50 for the first time since
1991. He's still playing like a man who wants to make a point, so
don't expect the stolen-base productivity to taper off any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve just keeps hitting, and still ranks second on the team in
RBIs with 35. One-third of the way through the season, he's on pace
to hit .310 with 24 homers and 105 RBIs. Spiezio went 3-for-4 to
extend his hitting streak to 10 games and lift his average to .286.
He's on pace for 90 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a lot of early hitting,'' Spiezio said. ``Let's
hope we're talking like this at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen can't think that far down the road. Safe to say,
they'll be taking it one day at a time. Monday night they needed a
little luck to look so good. Left-hander Buddy Groom's first
batter, Otis Nixon, drilled a double to left-center, but dynamo
center fielder Ryan Christenson made a good play to get to the ball
quickly, and Spiezio's relay nailed Minnesota catcher Terry
Steinbach at the plate to end the Twins' sixth with no runs
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters came in with two out in the seventh and got Ron
Coomer to snuff a small threat, then Taylor came out with two gone
in the eighth and needed just one pitch to get Nixon on a groundout
to second. That stranded two runners and kept the A's in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have confidence, you're not going to win,''
Fetters said. ``We've been on a roller-coaster ride all season
long. You can't hope for outs. You have to know you're going to get
outs. That meeting was basically to say: We have to pick each other
up.''

FIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WIN MACARTHUR AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LORI OLSZEWSKI and DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five Northern California talents are among the
winners of the MacArthur ``genius'' awards announced Monday _
Oakland writer Ishmael Reed, a Stanford economist, two scientists
and an attorney who works with female prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who arrived home Monday after a visit with his mother in
New York and a stop at a book convention in Chicago, said he
learned of the honor through a phone call Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe it,'' said Reed, the groundbreaking
poet, playwright and novelist. ``I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Terry McMillan said, ``It's about time he got one. He's
brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed is among 29 people selected as this year's John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellows. The other four Northern
Californians to receive the honor are: attorney Ellen Barry,
founder of Legal Services for Prisoners with Children in San
Francisco; Avner Greif, the Stanford University economist;
neuroscientist Leah Krubitzer of the University of California at
Davis; and Benjamin Santer, a senior atmospheric scientist at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been handing out the awards since 1981 to
honor outstanding creativity _ with no strings attached. There is
no application process. A secret panel of talent scouts makes
nominations to the foundation board, which makes the final choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is recognized for his literary work, including novels such
as ``Mumbo Jumbo,'' ``Reckless Eyeballing'' and ``The Terrible
Twos,'' but he is also a popular teacher in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said Reed, who has been an instructor at the University
of California at Berkeley for the last 30 years, was her first
fiction professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very supportive of young writers, and they don't forget
him,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very deserving and I am just thrilled for him,'' said
Blanche Richardson, the manager of Marcus Book Stores in Oakland
and San Francisco, a national center for black literature for more
than 35 years where Reed is a regular.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's politically charged art has often illuminated the serious
issues of urban poverty and America's racial divide with biting
satiric humor that takes on everybody from hypocritical whites to
cultural icons such as Oprah Winfrey. He has been criticized by
feminists and praised as an important force behind the publication
of writers with multiethnic perspectives through his Before
Columbus Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 60, said he wants to use some of the $355,000 he will
receive as a MacArthur fellow over the next five years to stage a
San Francisco production of his opera, `Gethsemane Park,' which he
and composer Carman Moore premiered in Berkeley earlier this year
at the Black Repertory Group.
</P>
<P>
   The other four Northern Californians to receive the 1998 awards
are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Attorney Barry of Oakland, 44, founder of Legal Services for
Prisoners with Children, a San Francisco-based organization that is
nationally recognized as a leading advocate for women in prison.
She receives $275,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned. This is the first time in my life I won't have
to raise my own salary,'' said Barry with a laugh, who founded her
organization fresh out of New York University Law School in 1978.
It has gone on to be an important national force in developing
sentencing alternatives for mothers who are in prison and in
supporting grandparents left to care for their incarcerated
daughters' children.
</P>
<P>
   It also has filed lawsuits that helped improve health care for
women in California state prisons, including Chowchilla and
Frontera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these women are in on nonviolent charges, with a
history of drug abuse and petty theft,'' Barry said. ``Most have
been victims of physical or sexual abuse at an early age. That is
not an excuse, but it clearly is an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Stanford University economist Greif, 42, who has applied
modern techniques of game theory to explain the development of
social institutions in the medieval Mediterranean region. He
receives $265,000, which he hopes to use to complete more archival
work overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-born Greif has applied game theory to explain the
growth of social institutions, such as legal systems and insurance
contracts, among Genoese traders in the 12th century and contrasted
why they did not develop among Jewish traders, known as the
Maghribi, in the Arab world a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The broader import of his work is to show the interactions of
individual behavior and social institutions, and how together they
affect the course of history. Many other scholars take a region's
culture or institutions as a given in explaining the history of a
period.
</P>
<P>
   -- Neuroscientist Krubitzer, 37, an assistant professor at the
University of California at Davis, whose research on the brain has
provided insights into the development of the cerebral cortex and
the evolutionary forces driving brain adaptation. She receives
$240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Krubitzer describes her work as ``the exciting business of
building a brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The award will help her crucial research into how the brains of
all living mammals have developed many common features of
organization through evolution, at the same time they acquire
special features unique to each species. It also will give her a
chance to visit Africa for the first time, to observe the
continent's widely varying animal life.
</P>
<P>
   -- Santer, 43, a climatologist at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, whose research supports the hypothesis that
human activity contributes to global warming. He receives $270,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Santer led a distinguished panel of experts who concluded
two years ago that global warming is real and that ``greenhouse
gases'' are a significant factor in the dangerous problem, a
dwindling but powerful minority of scientists opposed him. Some
even charged him with unprofessional conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the MacArthur Foundation has provided some vindication with
its award for Santer's leadership in providing ``important
scientific foundations'' for last year's international negotiations
in Kyoto, Japan, on greenhouse gas emissions.

   TOBACCO-SEX (San Francisco) _ State health officials are hoping
the fear of missing out on sex will curb sales of cigarettes, which
medical researchers have linked to impotence. ``We're not certain
men will stop smoking to save their lungs or their hearts,'' said
Carla Agar, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services.
``Maybe they'll stop to save their sex lives.'' By TYCHE HENDRICKS.
</P>
<P>
   COPYCATS (Houston) _ Many vendors selling cheap imitations or
knock-offs of Nike T-shirts, Rolex watches and Dooney &AMP; Bourke
handbags used to glide through the courts with a small fine and
slap on the wrist. But with a change in Texas law and aggressive
undercover police efforts, authorities here say brokers of
illegitimate merchandise are now facing the real thing _ a felony
charge. By STEVE BREWER.
</P>
<P>
   MacARTHUR-WINNERS (San Francisco) _ The message in scientist
Benjamin Santer's fortune cookie read: ``You will hear good news
from far away.'' The next day, Santer got a phone message from far
away that he had won one of the so-called ``genius awards'' from
the MacArthur Foundation. The prize was $270,000. By MARIANNE
COSTANTINOU.
</P>
<P>
   VALEDICTORIAN (Kerrville, Texas) _ Tivy High School
valedictorian Josh Walther saw humor in calling on the two
lowest-ranking members of his class to replace him at the podium at
commencement exercises. ``Why should I have to do more work and
give a speech?'' he planned on saying. ``I wasn't the one slacking
the last four years.'' School officials stopped him from giving the
speech. By ZEKE MacCORMACK.

<P>
   MUSHROOM-HUNTER (Schenectady, N.Y.) _ ``Americans have a fear of
mushrooms because we haven't studied them and we don't have a
tradition of looking for them,'' said mushroom hunter Marjorie
Lutz, who has been gathering and eating wild fungi for more than
two decades. ``But they really can be wonderful.'' By ELIZABETH
BENJAMIN.
</P>
<P>
   BIG-TOOLS (Albany, N.Y.) _ This year, Americans will purchase
upwards of 22 million gas-powered lawn and garden tools _ a record
number, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. And as
sales of these tools grow, so too have the size of the engines
powering them _ producing harmful noise and air pollution. By PAUL
ZIELBAUER.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN-COLLEGE (Kendleton, Texas) _ When the Rev. J. Horace
Germany launched a college for black preachers in Mississippi, he
was nearly killed. He made his way to East Texas to revive his
dreams. Nearly 40 years later, Germany feared his dream was dying
along with his financially strapped Bay Ridge Christian College
campus. But Bay Ridge is poised to become a leader in the
surrounding communities. By PATTI MUCK. (Art available on the New
York Times photo service)
</P>
<P>
   PARTNERS-BENEFITS (San Francisco) _ San Francisco officialdom
celebrated the first anniversary of a landmark law that, despite
ongoing legal challenges, has resulted in more than 1,700 companies
extending equal benefits to their workers' domestic partners. By
RACHEL GORDON and ANASTASIA HENDRIX.

   YIP-COLUMN (Undated) _ If you've gotten an offer in the mail
saying you've been pre-approved for credit, don't assume you're a
shoo-in for a loan. You can still be turned down. By PAMEL YIP
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SKI-LAKE-TAHOE (Truckee, Calif.) _ In the battle of the seasons
being waged at Lake Tahoe, skis and snowmobiles definitely have the
edge on canoes and fishing poles. El Nino has crashed the summer
party that should have kicked off on Memorial Day weekend, when
hiking and mountain-biking trails heat up. By RAY DELGADO.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   PETS (San Pedro, Calif.) _ I always wanted a pet. Once I even
brought home a dog I found in a Beirut alley. But that was years
ago, back in Lebanon, and that stray dog wasn't allowed to enter
the threshold of my childhood home. I am now an American citizen
who has become the owner of a pet. By GLADYS ALAM SAROYAN.

 &HT;    
 By MARVINE HOWE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In honor of that intrepid seafarer Vasco da Gama and his journey
to India 500 years ago, the Portuguese have organized celebrations
the likes of which have never been seen in this onetime imperial
capital.
 &HT;    On May 22, Lisbon opened the gates to Expo '98, with a record
participation of 154 countries and the theme ``The Oceans, a
Heritage for the Future.''
 &HT;    During Expo's four-month run, visitors can discover the beauty,
riches and challenges of the seas through scores of exhibits. There
will also be nautical competitions, daily multimedia shows, live
entertainment and food from around the world.
 &HT;    The industrial wasteland on Lisbon's east side is being replaced
with new residences and businesses and, of course, Expo, a 150-acre
fairgrounds with international exhibits, a riverside esplanade,
exotic gardens and a panoramic cable car along three miles of
riverfront.
 &HT;    To avoid a post-Expo ghost town, the main pavilions will be
turned into cultural sites, like an aquarium, a science museum and
a theater.
 &HT;    Expo has parking for 17,000 vehicles, but the public is urged to
use bus, subway, train or taxi to the new Oriente Station, which
rises like a forest of steel and glass near Expo's eastern gate.
There will also be regular ferries from the Cais do Sodre river
terminal.
 &HT;    Also on the eastern periphery, the new 10-mile-long Vasco da
Gama Bridge over the Tagus River estuary connects with highways to
the Algarve and Spain.
 &HT;    On the northern ring is Colombo, one of Europe's largest
shopping centers, honoring another great explorer. This popular new
destination includes 425 shops, 10 movie theaters and an amusement
park.
 &HT;    All around the city, ancient monuments and neighborhoods have
been refurbished and new green spaces planted. But the new highways
and Metro stations are a maze of works in progress, causing dust
and delays.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Each day of Expo '98, which runs until Sept. 30, its showpiece
event, a multimedia program called ``Ocean Myths and Legends,''
will be presented at the giant UFO-like Utopia Pavilion at noon, 3,
5 and 9 p.m.
 &HT;    People in carnivalesque sea-monster costumes will provide street
shows all day long, and incredible-looking water-themed machines
will parade around at sunset.
 &HT;    Artistic and folk groups will perform at the Dock Amphitheater
and other open areas in the late afternoon.
 &HT;    Small ensembles offer fado (Portuguese soul music), jazz,
classical music, hip-hop and rock at a dozen open-air stages
starting at about 8:30 p.m. Evenings close with Midnight Tea, an
open-air disco from midnight to 2 a.m.
 &HT;    The fairgrounds themselves are open from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    International performers are scheduled every evening. The Greek
Art Theater will perform ``The Birds'' by Aristophanes on June 11
at 9:30 p.m. at the Dock amphitheater. Free tickets are available
at the national pavilions.
 &HT;    On July 25 some 120 tall ships in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships'
Race start to arrive in Lisbon for the Vasco da Gama Memorial
International Regatta July 31 to Aug. 3.
 &HT;    A ticket for Expo '98 good for one day and night is $28; a
one-night ticket good after 8 p.m. is $11. The three-day pass is
$70 and three-month pass $285. Children 5 to 14 and people over 64
pay half price. Telephone (351-1) 868-0426, fax (351-1) 868-1800.
 &HT;    Many cultural events will coincide with Expo. Les Ballets C. de
la B. from Belgium will perform ``They Feed, we/ Eat, Eat, Eat,''
choreographed by Van den Broeck on June 19 and 20 and the premiere
of the dance-drama ``Bach,'' set to music by Bach, on July 1, 2 and
3, both at 10 p.m. at the Belem Cultural Center's Grand Auditorium,
Praca do Imperio at Belem. Tickets are $5.80 to $17; (351-1)
361-2400.
 &HT;    The Royal Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, conducted by Sir Colin
Davis, will perform the Overture to Berlioz's ``Benvenuto
Cellini,'' with the pianist Maria Joao Pires playing Chopin's
Concerto No. 1, on June 25, and Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust'' on
June 26.
 &HT;    Both programs begin at 9:30 p.m. at the Coliseu dos Recreios,
Rua Portas de Santo Antao. Tickets: $28 to $85; (351-1) 796-6306.
 &HT;    Bizet's ``Carmen,'' directed by Giuseppe Raffa and starring
Dulce Pontes in the title role, will be performed July 1 to 15,
nightly except Thursdays at 10 at the Campo Pequeno Bullring, Praca
de Touros. Tickets are $20 to $170; (351-1) 303-3113.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The main attraction at Expo is the Oceanarium, one of Europe's
largest aquariums, designed by the American architect Peter
Chermayeff.
 &HT;    Visitors are surrounded by re-creations of environments of the
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic Oceans, culminating in a
Global Ocean.
 &HT;    The Portuguese pavilion, overlooking Olivais Dock, will recount
the country's long struggle to master the seas. Other pavilions
will provide interactive experiences.
 &HT;    Germany will offer a virtual journey to Oceanis, an underwater
station equipped with the latest marine research technology.
 &HT;    The United States pavilion is a showcase for American technology
in diving, charting the ocean bottom and protecting the deep-sea
environment.
 &HT;    By the river, a huge abstract wave of stainless steel will be
inscribed with the names of Portuguese-American contributors to the
project.
 &HT;    Expo has provided the inspiration for renovation projects in
neighborhoods and landmarks throughout the city.
 &HT;    Sao Jorge Castle, atop Lisbon's highest hill and dating from
Roman times, has been restored, and now includes a giant periscope
(see all of Lisbon for $1.70) and tourism information office.
 &HT;    The castle, opening onto Rua Chao da Feira, is an oasis of shady
terraces, towers and ramparts around the old palace, used for
official receptions, a luxury restaurant in the walls and, soon to
open, an esplanade cafe. Open daily in summer 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    The surrounding medieval neighborhood of Castelo, a jumble of
tiny houses with iron balconies and patios but few modern
conveniences, is being rehabilitated.
 &HT;    And down the hill, the Moorish quarter of Alfama _ with its
orange-tile roofs, cobblestone alleys and flowering balconies _ has
also been spruced up.
 &HT;    Near the 12th-century Se, or cathedral, the old customhouse has
undergone major work and will open in mid-June as the Fado Museum,
dedicated to the singers and their way of life. No telephone yet.
 &HT;    The Baixa, or downtown area, a lovely ensemble of 18th-century
offices, banks and shops, is also getting a face lift.
 &HT;    Praca do Comercio, a handsome square of bright yellow government
buildings facing the river, is no longer spoiled by a parking lot.
 &HT;    Historic buildings like Dona Maria II Theater and the
18th-century Cafe Nicola have been restored.
 &HT;    Reconstruction is almost finished in the Chiado, the city's most
fashionable shopping neighborhood before it was devastated by fire
in 1988.
 &HT;    The new Chiado Museum for Contemporary Art stands on the site of
a 17th-century monastery, 6 Rua Serpa Pinto, (351-1) 343-2148.
 &HT;    Belem, a western suburb, is Lisbon's monument zone. The
16th-century Jeronimos Monastery and Belem Tower have just
undergone repairs.
 &HT;    Nearby, the Monument to the Discoveries, built in 1960, honors
Prince Henry the Navigator.
 &HT;    The vast fortresslike Belem Cultural Center, built in 1993,
offers music and dance programs and art exhibitions.
 &HT;    A new grassy esplanade runs along the riverfront from Belem to
Alcantara, where decrepit warehouses have been converted into
cafes, restaurants and discos.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Azulejos, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, (351-1)
814-7747, has marvelous decorative tiles.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Reservations promise to be difficult during Expo, and prices
higher than normal.
 &HT;    Only one hotel is open on the Expo site: the Oriente, (351-1)
893-0000, fax (351-1) 893-0099, a bright new apartment-hotel with
116 rooms with kitchenettes and simple decor. A double is $160.
 &HT;    Centrally situated, Hotel Eduardo VII, 5 Avenida Fontes Pereira
Melo (351-1) 353-0141, fax (351-1) 353-3879, has been remodeled. It
has 130 rooms with park and river views. A double is $125 with
breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: Away from downtown, near Lisbon University, the
renovated Hotel Lisboa Penta, Avenida Combatentes (351-1) 726-4054,
fax (351-1) 726-4418, has 600 comfortable rooms with views of
central Lisbon and Monsanto Park. A double is $90, with breakfast.
 &HT;    Hotel Amazonia, also outside the center at 12-20 Travessa
Fabrica dos Pentes; (351-1) 387-7006, fax (351-1) 387-9090, in the
quiet Amoreiras section near the 18th-century aqueduct, has 192
comfortable modern rooms. A double is $100 with breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: Overlooking Eduardo VII Park, the Ritz, 88 Rua Rodrigo
da Fonseca; (351-1) 383-2020, fax (351-1) 383-1783, became a Four
Seasons Hotel this year, and has been renovated with new beige
carpets and gray and yellow marble in the hall.
 &HT;    The 280 rooms still feature oversize marble bathrooms and
private balconies. A double is $335.
 &HT;    Formerly a private mansion, Hotel da Lapa, 4 Rua do Pau da
Bandeira; (351-1) 395-0005, fax (351-1) 395-0665, is on a hill in
the elegant diplomatic quarter. It has a richly decorated lobby and
banquet hall, and the 94 spacious rooms are tastefully done.
 &HT;    The large balconies overlook lush gardens with a fountain and
pool. A double is $270.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    About 80 restaurants and kiosks inside Expo will offer a range
of cuisines and prices.
 &HT;    At a Turkish restaurant run by Istanbul's Divan Hotel,
specialties include sea bass in parchment (dinner for two with wine
is about $50), and Portugal's Panoramic Tower has spectacular views
to accompany local favorites like cataplana (steamed pork and
clams) for $68 to $114 for two.
 &HT;    In the Chiado, Cervejaria da Trindade, 20C Rua da Trindade,
(351-1) 342-3506, a popular beer hall in a former monastery,
specializes in beefsteak but also serves tasty grilled sole and
other fish. Dinner for two with beer or wine, about $22.
 &HT;    For Old World gilt, mirrors, crystal chandeliers and attentive
service, the place is Tavares, 37 Rua da Misericordia, (351-1)
342-1112. Closed Sunday afternoon and Saturday. Specialties include
stuffed crab and duck with prunes. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    Popular with the diplomatic community, Ja Sei!, 202 Avenida
Brasilia in Belem, (351-1) 301-5969, serves high-quality Portuguese
fare like roast lamb with thyme sauce, with a terrific view of the
Tagus. Dinner for two with wine, $60. Closed Saturdays and Sunday
evening.

 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The main attraction at Expo is the Oceanarium, one of Europe's
largest aquariums, designed by the American architect Peter
Chermayeff.
 &HT;    Visitors are surrounded by re-creations of environments of the
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic Oceans, culminating in a
Global Ocean.
 &HT;    The Portuguese pavilion, overlooking Olivais Dock, will recount
the country's long struggle to master the seas. Other pavilions
will provide interactive experiences.
 &HT;    Germany will offer a virtual journey to Oceanis, an underwater
station equipped with the latest marine research technology.
 &HT;    The United States pavilion is a showcase for American technology
in diving, charting the ocean bottom and protecting the deep-sea
environment.
 &HT;    By the river, a huge abstract wave of stainless steel will be
inscribed with the names of Portuguese-American contributors to the
project.
 &HT;    Expo has provided the inspiration for renovation projects in
neighborhoods and landmarks throughout the city.
 &HT;    Sao Jorge Castle, atop Lisbon's highest hill and dating from
Roman times, has been restored, and now includes a giant periscope
(see all of Lisbon for $1.70) and tourism information office.
 &HT;    The castle, opening onto Rua Chao da Feira, is an oasis of shady
terraces, towers and ramparts around the old palace, used for
official receptions, a luxury restaurant in the walls and, soon to
open, an esplanade cafe. Open daily in summer 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    The surrounding medieval neighborhood of Castelo, a jumble of
tiny houses with iron balconies and patios but few modern
conveniences, is being rehabilitated.
 &HT;    And down the hill, the Moorish quarter of Alfama _ with its
orange-tile roofs, cobblestone alleys and flowering balconies _ has
also been spruced up.
 &HT;    Near the 12th-century Se, or cathedral, the old customhouse has
undergone major work and will open in mid-June as the Fado Museum,
dedicated to the singers and their way of life. No telephone yet.
 &HT;    The Baixa, or downtown area, a lovely ensemble of 18th-century
offices, banks and shops, is also getting a face lift.
 &HT;    Praca do Comercio, a handsome square of bright yellow government
buildings facing the river, is no longer spoiled by a parking lot.
 &HT;    Historic buildings like Dona Maria II Theater and the
18th-century Cafe Nicola have been restored.
 &HT;    Reconstruction is almost finished in the Chiado, the city's most
fashionable shopping neighborhood before it was devastated by fire
in 1988.
 &HT;    The new Chiado Museum for Contemporary Art stands on the site of
a 17th-century monastery, 6 Rua Serpa Pinto, (351-1) 343-2148.
 &HT;    Belem, a western suburb, is Lisbon's monument zone. The
16th-century Jeronimos Monastery and Belem Tower have just
undergone repairs.
 &HT;    Nearby, the Monument to the Discoveries, built in 1960, honors
Prince Henry the Navigator.
 &HT;    The vast fortresslike Belem Cultural Center, built in 1993,
offers music and dance programs and art exhibitions.
 &HT;    A new grassy esplanade runs along the riverfront from Belem to
Alcantara, where decrepit warehouses have been converted into
cafes, restaurants and discos.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Azulejos, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, (351-1)
814-7747, has marvelous decorative tiles.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Reservations promise to be difficult during Expo, and prices
higher than normal.
 &HT;    Only one hotel is open on the Expo site: the Oriente, (351-1)
893-0000, fax (351-1) 893-0099, a bright new apartment-hotel with
116 rooms with kitchenettes and simple decor. A double is $160.
 &HT;    Centrally situated, Hotel Eduardo VII, 5 Avenida Fontes Pereira
Melo (351-1) 353-0141, fax (351-1) 353-3879, has been remodeled. It
has 130 rooms with park and river views. A double is $125 with
breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: Away from downtown, near Lisbon University, the
renovated Hotel Lisboa Penta, Avenida Combatentes (351-1) 726-4054,
fax (351-1) 726-4418, has 600 comfortable rooms with views of
central Lisbon and Monsanto Park. A double is $90, with breakfast.
 &HT;    Hotel Amazonia, also outside the center at 12-20 Travessa
Fabrica dos Pentes; (351-1) 387-7006, fax (351-1) 387-9090, in the
quiet Amoreiras section near the 18th-century aqueduct, has 192
comfortable modern rooms. A double is $100 with breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: Overlooking Eduardo VII Park, the Ritz, 88 Rua Rodrigo
da Fonseca; (351-1) 383-2020, fax (351-1) 383-1783, became a Four
Seasons Hotel this year, and has been renovated with new beige
carpets and gray and yellow marble in the hall.
 &HT;    The 280 rooms still feature oversize marble bathrooms and
private balconies. A double is $335.
 &HT;    Formerly a private mansion, Hotel da Lapa, 4 Rua do Pau da
Bandeira; (351-1) 395-0005, fax (351-1) 395-0665, is on a hill in
the elegant diplomatic quarter. It has a richly decorated lobby and
banquet hall, and the 94 spacious rooms are tastefully done.
 &HT;    The large balconies overlook lush gardens with a fountain and
pool. A double is $270.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    About 80 restaurants and kiosks inside Expo will offer a range
of cuisines and prices.
 &HT;    At a Turkish restaurant run by Istanbul's Divan Hotel,
specialties include sea bass in parchment (dinner for two with wine
is about $50), and Portugal's Panoramic Tower has spectacular views
to accompany local favorites like cataplana (steamed pork and
clams) for $68 to $114 for two.
 &HT;    In the Chiado, Cervejaria da Trindade, 20C Rua da Trindade,
(351-1) 342-3506, a popular beer hall in a former monastery,
specializes in beefsteak but also serves tasty grilled sole and
other fish. Dinner for two with beer or wine, about $22.
 &HT;    For Old World gilt, mirrors, crystal chandeliers and attentive
service, the place is Tavares, 37 Rua da Misericordia, (351-1)
342-1112. Closed Sunday afternoon and Saturday. Specialties include
stuffed crab and duck with prunes. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    Popular with the diplomatic community, Ja Sei!, 202 Avenida
Brasilia in Belem, (351-1) 301-5969, serves high-quality Portuguese
fare like roast lamb with thyme sauce, with a terrific view of the
Tagus. Dinner for two with wine, $60. Closed Saturdays and Sunday
evening.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From the Mississippi to the Columbia, one of the most unique
ways to see America is on a river cruise. Here are some companies
that make America's rivers come alive. Prices are per person, based
on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Despite the name, Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West (4th &AMP; Battery
Bldg., Suite 700, Seattle, Wash. 98121; 800-426-7702) offers more
than some of the best cruises in Alaska. They have seven-night,
round-trip, small ship cruises on the Columbia and Snake Rivers
from Portland, Ore., starting at $925.
 &HT;    These trips, from March to May and again in September and
October, run on the 78-passenger ``Spirit of Alaska'' and the
84-passenger ``Spirit of Discovery.''
 &HT;    The ships follow in the wake of Lewis and Clark on this
1,000-mile journey, negotiating eight locks and dams each way on
the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
 &HT;    The highlight occurs at the port of Clarkston, Wash., where
guests switch to high-speed jet boats for a 140-mile round-trip on
the Snake River into Hells Canyon.
 &HT;    All shore excursions, including visits to wineries, historic
forts, the Whitman Mission and the Maryhill Museum, are included.
 &HT;    The company also offers California wine country cruises from
September to October on the 102-passenger ``Spirit of Endeavour''
and the 96-passenger ``Spirit of 98.''
 &HT;    The three-night trip starts at $645 and sails round-trip from
San Francisco, travels up the Sacramento River to the heart of Old
Town Sacramento, then up the Napa River to the Napa Valley, with
visits to the Schramsberg and Carneros Alambic wineries and lunch
at Clos Pegasse winery.
 &HT;    The four-night cruise starts at $855 and follows a similar
itinerary, with the addition of a day in Sonoma and tastings at
Domaine Carneros and a lunch at Merryvale Winery.
 &HT;    History, culture and nature all the hallmarks of this cruise
line.
 &HT;    American West Steamboat Company (601 Union St., Suite 4343,
Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-434-1232) operates the 163-passenger
sternwheeler, ``Queen of the West.''
 &HT;    A replica of the classic 19th-century paddlewheelers, the ship
follows a nearly 1,000-mile itinerary on the Columbia, Snake and
Willemette Rivers for seven nights.
 &HT;    The main lounge features nightly variety entertainment, similar
to that aboard showboats in the 19th century.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, which are included in the price of the cruise,
include a ride on the Mt. Hood Railroad, the Columbia Gorge
Discovery Center and jet boats on Hells Canyon. Rates start at
$1,045.
 &HT;    The Delta Queen Steamboat Company (Robin Street Wharf, 1380 Port
of New Orleans Place, New Orleans, La. 70130-1890; 800-543-7637) is
probably the best-known river boat cruise company in the country.
 &HT;    They offer three- to 14-night steamboat cruise on the
Mississippi River, the Ohio River, the Tennessee River, the
Cumberland River, the Arkansas River, the Illinois River, the
Kanawha River, the Atchafalaya River, the Red River and the
Intracoastal Waterway.
 &HT;    The three steamboats that the line uses have become American
icons. There's the 174-passenger Delta Queen, built in 1925-1927
and designated a National Historic Landmark; the 414-passenger
Mississippi Queen, built in 1976; and the 436-passenger American
Queen, built in 1995.
 &HT;    Together, they offer a distinctive way to experience the
heartland of America.
 &HT;    While the newer vessels have been built with modern amenities,
the restored Delta Queen has been likened to staying in a Victorian
bed and breakfast, with the old-fashioned elegance associated with
brass, hardwood paneling and Tiffany-style stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    There are dozens of itineraries year-round among the ships, as
well as theme cruises that focus on the ``Civil War,'' ``Big
Band,'' ``Gardens of the River'' and even ``The Elvis Years.''
 &HT;    Take a typical seven-night cruise aboard the Delta Queen this
July, which embarks in Nashville, Tenn., and ends in Little Rock,
Ark.
 &HT;    Navigating the Cumberland, Ohio, Mississippi and Arkansas
Rivers, the fares for this journey, with Memphis as a highlight,
start at $1,050.
 &HT;    RiverBarge Excursion Lines (201 Opelousas Ave., New Orleans, La.
70114; 888-650-5041;) is a new company and its first vessel, ``R/B
River Explorer,'' sets sail on Aug. 22.
 &HT;    What sets the ``R/B River Explorer'' apart is the fact that it's
a hotel barge, designed to travel along both rivers and the
Intracoastal Waterway on four- to 10-day excursions.
 &HT;    The company claims that it's the first American-built, flagged
and crewed hotel barge offered in North America.
 &HT;    The ``R/B River Explorer'' is actually comprised of two barges,
the La Salle and the De Soto, and is propelled by the towboat,
``Miss Nari.''
 &HT;    All cabins are outside and a minimum of 200 square feet, with
the usual cruise chip amenities, from televisions with VCRs to
telephones with modem ports to full-size bathrooms.
 &HT;    Take ``The Route of Jean Lafitte,'' which goes between New
Orleans and Port Isabel, Texas, along the Gulf Coast. This
eight-day cruise, which starts in New Orleans and ends in
Galveston, Texas, starts at $1,730.
 &HT;    Other trips include ``Delta South,'' a four- or five-day trip
that goes round-trip from New Orleans.
 &HT;    The eight-day trip ends in Memphis, with stops at Natchez and
Vicksburg, Mississippi as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
 &HT;    Prices range from $740 for the four-day trip to $1,730 for the
eight-day voyage.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, as well as tips, taxes and port charges are
included with the price.

a hotel barge, designed to travel along both rivers and the
Intracoastal Waterway on four- to 10-day excursions.
 &HT;    The company claims that it's the first American-built, flagged
and crewed hotel barge offered in North America.
 &HT;    The ``R/B River Explorer'' is actually comprised of two barges,
the La Salle and the De Soto, and is propelled by the towboat,
``Miss Nari.''
 &HT;    All cabins are outside and a minimum of 200 square feet, with
the usual cruise chip amenities, from televisions with VCRs to
telephones with modem ports to full-size bathrooms.
 &HT;    Take ``The Route of Jean Lafitte,'' which goes between New
Orleans and Port Isabel, Texas, along the Gulf Coast. This
eight-day cruise, which starts in New Orleans and ends in
Galveston, Texas, starts at $1,730.
 &HT;    Other trips include ``Delta South,'' a four- or five-day trip
that goes round-trip from New Orleans.
 &HT;    The eight-day trip ends in Memphis, with stops at Natchez and
Vicksburg, Mississippi as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
 &HT;    Prices range from $740 for the four-day trip to $1,730 for the
eight-day voyage.
 &HT;    Shore excursions, as well as tips, taxes and port charges are
included with the price.

   MALE-IMPOTENCE-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE TUESDAY AT 3 P.M.
EASTERN _ SAN DIEGO _ As the hype continues over Viagra, two new
reports offer possible alternatives to the widely acclaimed
anti-impotency drug.

   CANCER-SURVIVAL-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE TUESDAY AT 4 P.M.
EASTERN _ Recent research has shown that people with late-stage
cancer often overestimate their odds of survival. Now, a new study
shows that such unrealistic expectations may impact on the type of
medical care a terminally ill patient chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to less optimistic cancer patients, those who believed
that they had a better than 90 percent chance of living six months
or longer were more than two-and-a-half times as likely to choose
aggressive treatment rather than more conservative therapy that
emphasized relief of pain and discomfort, researchers reported in
Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But choosing more aggressive care did not result in longer
survival, according to the study of 917 adults hospitalized with
late-stage cancer of the lung or colon that had spread to the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   When factors such as age, race, sex and education were taken
into account, there was no significant difference in survival at
six months between patients who chose aggressive treatment and
those who sought so-called comfort care, reported researchers led
by Dr. Jane C. Weeks of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

   SMOKE-HEARING-MED _ EMBARGOED UNTIL 4 P.M. EASTERN _ New
research suggests that smoking may lead to hearing loss, Wisconsin
researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   Current smokers were about 70 percent more likely to have
hearing loss than nonsmokers in the study of 3,753 adults ages 48
to 92 years old. In addition, nonsmokers who lived with a smoker
were more likely to have a hearing problem than those not exposed
to secondhand smoke at home, researchers reported in Wednesday's
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The more a person smoked, the more likely he or she was to
report hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30 percent to 35 percent of adults ages 65 to 75
years old have some hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, just under 15 percent of the participants were
smokers. Of the entire group, 45 percent reported some hearing
loss.
</P>
<P>
   One mechanism by which smoking might affect hearing is by
constricting the blood supply to the ear, causing cells involved in
processing noises to die, said Karen J. Cruickshanks, an associate
professor of ophthalmology at the University of Wisconsin Medical
School in Madison. (500 WORDS)

 &HT;    BOOKREVIEW: ``Widow'' not without beauty
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR, by John Irving. Random House; 537 pages;
$27.95.
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for John Irving, which is both his most
admirable quality and his most reliable failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Widow for One Year'' begins with a prologue that sets up the
rest of the book, a prologue that limps along for 180 pages and
should have been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it is 1958, and we are introduced to the characters
that we meet again in 1990 and follow through until the book's
ending in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There is Marion, beautiful, blond, the mother of three, two of
whom are dead in a car accident before the book opens but who hover
over every waking and sleeping moment of their mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   There is Ted, her husband, a serial adulterer and author of
famous children's books. There is Ruth, Marion and Ted's
replacement child.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Eddie, a young Exeter student hired as Ted's
assistant for the summer, who grudgingly manages the logistics of
Ted's affairs when he's not vigorously pleasuring Marion, who ruins
him for any woman who isn't two decades his elder.
</P>
<P>
   When we pick up the characters 32 years later, we find Irving up
to his old tricks of compulsive character cheating, the better to
keep the plot pot boiling and indulge in his waggish sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie who, at 16, was an inventive, industrious, resourceful
young man, has in middle age unaccountably mutated into a
creatively impotent, feckless joke.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth has grown up to be her mother's flip side _ extremely
inhibited, not very sexual at all, driven mostly by the quest for
excellence in her novels _ which, in the excerpts Irving provides,
are uninteresting, prototypically P.C. feminist fiction in the Anna
Quindlen mode.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Ruth goes to Amsterdam, where she develops a deeply
unlikely interest in the sex trade and ends up embroiled in a
murder that conveniently propels her to the next stage of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Ted, in his late 70s, is still in pursuit of every female he can
find, which is at least consistent, although it beggars the
imagination that he could beat people _ athletic people _ half his
age at squash.
</P>
<P>
   Irving seems to have some sort of literary bipolar disorder; if
his people were flesh and blood, they'd all have whiplash from the
way they're yanked around for the sake of narrative amusement.
</P>
<P>
   For me, Irving falls between two schools: He has little interest
in pure naturalism, but he lacks the capacious imagination to go
all the way into extravagance a la Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   And, as nearly as I can tell, he's completely without the lyric
gift. Irving's idea of setting a scene is a cursory, ``The sky was
a crisp and cloudless blue.''
</P>
<P>
   This prosaic flatness sometimes earns a laugh; a dreary woman
who assails Ted Cole for an autograph is described as having ``hips
like a mule.'' Not elegant, but blunt and funny. Other equally
abrupt lines _ ``as deceitful as a damaged condom'' _ are less
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   So Irving presses on, both of him. There's the Irving who's a
devout absurdist, with his nose pressed firmly against the glass as
he objectively catalogs the ridiculousness of other people's
Christmas celebrations, and there's the Irving who is inside,
happily decorating the tree.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, he has it both ways and dissolves the glass,
portraying the celebration and the exhaustion, the endless
irritation bred by the forced march of extended family obligations,
which can be all that keep people sane.
</P>
<P>
   At these times, he's a literary Robert Altman, but ``A Widow for
One Year'' is more like a middling four-hour miniseries than it is
even a mediocre Altman movie.
</P>
<P>
   Why then, is he so popular? Why are even Irving novels that are
truly unreadable _ I know many people who began ``A Son of the
Circus;'' I know nobody who finished it _ accorded such good
reviews?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is the continuing goodwill engendered by ``The World
According to Garp,'' one of those rare modern novels that people
truly loved. And there is the fact that, if you take away the
(often inventive) sex, Irving writes very old-fashioned fiction,
but with a modern twist.
</P>
<P>
   Irving indulges in all sorts of tics borrowed from the
Victorians, the early Victorians _ little pin-pricks foretelling
the narrative: ``If she'd known then that it would be their last
conversation, she might have tried to patch things up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial novels are all plot; most literary novels are
all character. Irving's primary gift is for character, sweet
characters, whose lives shift and twist with changing times and
circumstances. If you buy into Irving's people, you buy the often
arbitrary, occasionally ludicrous vicissitudes visited upon them by
their creator.
</P>
<P>
   Besides problems of character consistency, ``A Widow for One
Year'' is hampered by the unpleasant fact that its most interesting
character is more or less disposed of after the prologue. Marion is
driven, haunted, intensely sexual, extremely strong-minded. By
comparison, everyone else in the book is near-beer. Irving's idea
seems to be that if the other characters mention her enough, she'll
be there, but that's wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``A Widow for One Year'' is not without its incidental
beauties. Irving is very good with time, the way something that
happens 30 or 40 years earlier, something as tiny as a cut finger,
can suddenly resonate like a sharply struck tuning fork.
</P>
<P>
   And I like his extended homage in which Ruth spends years
working her way through Norman Sherry's biography of Graham Greene,
one of her _ and my _ favorite writers.
</P>
<P>
   Irving always has a large supply of good humor, and a good eye
for the domestic detail: ``In every marriage there are designated
chores; there is always someone who is largely responsible for
putting out the trash, and someone who is principally in charge of
not running out of coffee or milk or toothpaste or toilet paper.
Allen was in charge of temperature. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And, for all of his too-cute self-indulgence, Irving's emphasis
on humanity seems to me ultimately admirable. The middle-aged Eddie
is asked how he can possibly press himself against the withered
flesh of the older women he takes as simulations of Marion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to see the whole woman,'' he replies. ``Of course I
recognize that she's old . . . (but) I can picture her when she was
much younger than I am _ because there are always gestures and
expressions that are ingrained, ageless. An old woman doesn't
always see herself as an old woman, and neither do I. I try to see
her whole life in her. There's something so moving about someone's
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a coarse running joke is redeemed by a
poignant sympathy. In moments like these, John Irving justifies his
reputation.

 &HT;    Sandberg poem charming, but is he still read?
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Sandburg won two Pulitzer prizes, one for his poetry and
one for writing the most popular Lincoln biography of the first
half of this century. He also wrote a best-selling novel
(``Remembrance Rock''), but all this was a long time ago and I get
the distinct sense he's not widely read anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Knopf has issued ``Not Everyday an Aurora Borealis
for Your Birthday'' ($13), a previously unpublished, but charming,
poem with lovely illustrations by Anita Lobel.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth your attention are two new volumes from New
Directions. The first is Balzac's ``Colonel Chabert'' ($9.95), a
new translation of one of the best sequences from ``The Human
Comedy,'' the great cycle that eventually encompassed more than 90
novels and novellas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colonel Chabert'' concerns a war hero believed to have been
killed, but who returns to Paris a disfigured man who finds his
wife remarried and his soldier's pension long gone. He hires a
lawyer and begins the arduous process of proving he is who he says
he is, in order to force his ex-wife to give up some of her money.
</P>
<P>
   There are some similarities to Dickens' ``Bleak House,'' and one
can easily imagine Twain using the same idea for a savage attack on
human cupidity, but Balzac wasn't writing out of satirical or
mordant impulses, but in a deeply realistic vein of pity and power.
Balzac wrote ``Colonel Chabert'' in 1832, and it remains completely
involving.
</P>
<P>
   The second volume, ``The Notebook of Trigorin'' ($19.95) is a
real curio, Tennessee Williams' free adaptation of Chekhov's ``The
Sea Gull.'' It was written in the early '80s, when Williams' best
work was far behind him, and not performed until a year ago in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   A ROOM FOR TWO, OVERLOOKING THE POOL: One of Miami's landmarks
is the lovely Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, and Helen Muir's book
about it, originally published in 1987, has gone into its third
edition. It's full of great photos that bring back the salad days
of the great Florida land boom of the mid-'20s, when the hotel was
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Biltmore: Beacon for Miami,'' costs $19.95 and is
available at Books and Books, gift shops around South Florida, and,
of course, The Biltmore itself.
</P>
<P>
   Also noteworthy is ``The BFI Companion to Crime,'' from the
University of California Press ($29.95). It's a reliable,
accessible, one-size-fits-all _ more or less _ guide to the world
of crime movies and film noir.
</P>
<P>
   The book is organized encyclopedia-style _ ``Gaslight'' is
followed by ``Get Carter,'' which is followed by ``The Getaway,''
etc. The entries are concise, well-written, often provocative and
feature a good selection of Japanese Yakuza films although the
emphasis is on English and American films.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or so years ago, the British Film Institute published ``The
BFI Guide to the Western,'' and this might even be better than that
worthy volume.

 &HT;    I just couldn't give it up
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On the stage, she will dance without
fear. The four tendus a la seconde to the right, the four to the
left. She will land in a near-perfect fifth position, her soft,
classy navy blue outfit falling around her and then she will close
her eyes and listen to that spectacular applause. She will run
backstage with the other girls, her comrades with the aching
muscles and the smelly Icy Hot ointment stuffed into their scuffed
Danskin bags, her comrades with the school-girl giggles, and they
will hug and laugh and hug some more.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Morgan, the strictest of the strict at the Academy of
Ballet Florida in West Palm Beach, Fla., will come forward and
enthuse, as only Miss Morgan can, `Girls, that was beautiful.' And
then Shannon Pasley, a girl who just 15 months ago had something so
wrong with her brain that her family didn't know if she'd be able
to feed herself again, let alone do a plie, will go home and wake
up in the morning and be just a normal teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel lucky,'' she scoffs. ``Very.''
</P>
<P>
   There she was, all legs and smiles, in the fourth grade and
barely reading chapter books, when she started getting The Feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon went to her mother, Jane, and complained about it. It
felt as though she was having a spasm in her arm, a tightness that
wouldn't go away. Something wasn't right, she told her mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm would become dead weight and I would just lean toward
it because I couldn't keep it up and then I would just lean all the
way down,'' Shannon says now. ``I knew before it would happen and
that would give me time to get down, or something. I'd get that
feeling and go, Oh, God.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Jane Pasley treated Shannon's complaints casually. But
after a while, it became clear that something, something big, was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were finding her everywhere,'' says her mother. ``On the
floor in the bathroom, on the floor in the bedroom. And she didn't
know what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to a doctor, of course, who sent them to another
doctor who did some tests on the brain of the smiling 9-year-old
and then delivered the very bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon had a noncancerous tumor that was causing her seizures,
three or more a day. At one point during the diagnosis they hooked
Shannon up to a machine as she slept. Her brain was seizing,
practically nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor put Shannon on medicine and, for about a year, the
episodes were controlled, although ``controlled'' is a misleading
word when you are discussing seizures. Everywhere the Pasleys went
_ school, church, the mall, the movies _ there was the fear that
Shannon would collapse in a puddle on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were constantly on pins and needles,'' says her mother.
``Oh, it was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the while, Miss Shannon Pasley, the girl who put on her
first dance leotard at the ripe old age of 3, reported to Ballet
Florida, to practice her biggest love.
</P>
<P>
   She practiced her shuffle off to Buffalos.
</P>
<P>
   She practiced her ronde de jambe en l'airs.
</P>
<P>
   She practiced her dance over and over and over again, even
though she was still getting The Feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Morgan, dance teacher extraordinaire, remembers the time
Shannon collapsed during class.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the important instructor with all the right moves,
freaked out. But Shannon's friends who had been with her for a
while knew ``just what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' says Morgan. ``But one of her friends just
took her by the hand. And by the time I had opened the door to the
tap studio and turned around, Shannon was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that she was having two, three, four, even five and six,
seizures a day. ``We just never knew,'' said her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, doctors at Miami (Fla.) Children's Hospital learned
near the very beginning, was a small lesion on Shannon's brain. In
February 1994, surgeons cut through the fifth-grader's skull to get
to the tumor, about the size of a small eraser head. But because of
its location _ on the motor strip of the left side of her brain _
they couldn't get it all.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the seizures continued. At the beginning, right
after the surgery, they weren't nearly as frequent. But by the
winter of 1997, when Shannon was an eighth-grader, they were
happening eight, nine, 10 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting to the point where she was actually hurting
herself,'' said Jane Pasley, remembering the time Shannon fell in
dance class and scraped her face. The doctors and the family
decided this could not go on. They'd go in again, only this time
they would do something a little fancier, something called a
Multiple Subpial Transection.
</P>
<P>
   This is how doctors explained it: Epileptic seizures travel
vertically in the brain, so the surgical team would go in and cut
the connectors that were carrying the seizures. When they were
done, the seizures wouldn't be able to travel from spot to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing, Mrs. Pasley. There's no telling the
outcome with this operation. Your daughter might never dance again.
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour surgery went well, but when 13-year-old Shannon
woke up, she couldn't move her right side. She couldn't wiggle her
fingers. She couldn't wiggle her toes. Her hand would not move. Her
leg would not move. Her father, Sam, a downright emotional wreck by
this point, had to carry her to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were freaking out,'' says Jane Pasley.
</P>
<P>
   But Jane Pasley had something else to say to Shannon and the
doctors and anyone else who would listen:
</P>
<P>
   She is not leaving this hospital in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The physical therapy started the very next day. Shannon bounced
a ball against a trampoline and tried to hit it back. She struggled
to support herself on a flat treadmill and to balance herself on a
big, rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, most of the feeling back in her right side,
Shannon Pasley walked out of Miami Children's.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, the real therapy began. The weights.
The leg lifts. The hours and hours of muscle-strengthening
exercises. And within a couple of months, just after spring break,
in fact, Shannon went back to school. And back to dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts,'' said her mother. ``We were so proud
of her because she just went in there almost like nothing had ever
happened. It took so much strength, because a lot of the kids
didn't understand what had been happening to her. And, then, she
started to get her confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 15 months since the operation. That first year, she
stayed on seizure medicine, but then, this last March, they even
started weaning her off that. And now, glory be! No more medicine.
No more seizures! Not in the bathroom. Not in the bedroom. Not on
the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tire easily and her mother had to watch her like a
hawk. But just this past week Shannon and her mother were in
Washington, D.C., so Shannon could represent Florida in the
Children's Miracle Network, an international, nonprofit group that
raises money for children's hospitals, including Miami Children's.
While there, she met Hillary Rodham Clinton and saw an Orioles game
and raced around shopping and sightseeing with her mother. And she
could have stayed longer, honest, she had the strength, but she
needed to get home.
</P>
<P>
   So now, the stage awaits. Finally. Shannon prepares for her
first show since her big surgery in Miami a year ago February. And
she is strong enough and confident enough and good enough to do the
four tendus a la seconde to the right and then to the left and land
in her perfect fifth position. Miss Morgan will be so proud!
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I would have done if they'd told me I could
never dance again,'' says the ballerina, the one who used to be 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never give it up.

 &HT;    Still hot after 35 years
 &HT;    (Has two sidebars: EASY-BAKE-SIDE0NE-03, EASY-BAKE-SIDE2-03)
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Watts cookin'? A cake the size of a
hockey puck. More than 100 million since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The Easy-Bake Oven _ that plastic Kenner gizmo fueled by a light
bulb _ is 35 years old. Not only did the toy teach tots about
baking, it also launched careers. Powder, water and whammo! A chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``It catapulted me into cooking,'' says chef John Carlino, 35,
an instructor at the Florida Culinary Institute in West Palm Beach,
Fla. ``That's where it all started _ with a light bulb. I had a
60-watt bulb, and I remember replacing it with a 100 watt so I
could increase production.''
</P>
<P>
   (A 100-watt bulb is standard on today's model.)
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dodge, 47, owner of Susan's Bistro in West Palm Beach,
also started with an Easy-Bake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember most are the little tiny cake pans,'' she
says. ``And the teeny-weeny cookie cutters _ I had the rabbit and
the chicken. I couldn't wait to get home from school.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you not in the Easy-Bake loop, here's how it works:
You mix a packet of cake powder with water, pour it into a pan 4
inches in diameter, push the pan through a slot so it sits under a
bulb for 12 minutes, then push the pan (with another pan or a
plastic stick, depending on the oven model) into a cooling chamber.
The wee treat cools for 10 minutes, then voila! Slather on icing.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: One Easy-Bake chocolate devil's food cake has 228 calories
and 0 vitamins. But there is a smidgen of calcium and iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not a great story about some crazy inventor
with a light bulb who came up with the oven,'' says Easy-Bake
spokeswoman Sonia Fuller. ``They say a warm pretzel bought from a
street vendor inspired the idea, but the product was created by
Kenner in 1963 so kids could imitate adults. It remains a
top-selling toy.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Hasbro, which bought Kenner in 1991, created a
separate Easy-Bake division. Knockoffs have sprung up _ such as the
Mrs. Fields Baking Factory for $24.99 _ but the $19.99 Easy-Bake
remains No. 1. The original price 35 years ago was $15.99.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 11 models since 1963, each reflecting the colors
and oven styles of their day.
</P>
<P>
   The first was turquoise and had a carrying handle and fake stove
top. In 1969, the avocado green Premier Easy-Bake Oven came out
with more dials, a fake clock and an oven hood. A year later, the
harvest gold Super Easy-Bake Oven _ with no fake stove top _ hit
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The ovens were orange and brown throughout the '70s, including
the ``high-tech'' Easy-Bake Mini-Wave Oven introduced in 1978. Next
came several white models before this year's pink and purple
microwave-shaped Easy-Bake Oven &AMP; Snack Center with a mock digital
clock that always says 12:30. (Not unlike many real digital
clocks.)
</P>
<P>
   Cake mixes aren't just chocolate and vanilla anymore, either.
You can buy a Creme Pups Bake Set to make little cake sandwiches;
an All My Love Chocolates kit to make candy; and a Tiny Turnovers
Bake Set to make pastries. Plus, Easy-Bake has teamed up with
M&AMP;M's, Dunkin' Donuts and Oreo for mix ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our house once you ran out of mix that was it,'' says Betty
Baird, 43, owner of Sweet Tiers Bakery in Hobe Sound, Fla. ``So I
used to get my own red clay, mix it with water and salt, and make
little figures. I knew you weren't supposed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, who needs rules? When the Easy-Bake first came out, guys
weren't supposed to play with what was billed as ``the hottest
girl's toy since dolls.'' But they did. (``There was always a girl
on the box,'' Carlino recalls, jokingly miffed. Nowadays, there's
just a picture of the oven).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about 8, and I kept it inside the house, of course,''
says David McBride, 26, a chef with Total Food Service Direction, a
Miami-based corporate dining company. ``I asked for one because I
saw it on TV. A couple of my friends got into it, too. My biggest
problem was that everything was undercooked.''
</P>
<P>
   (Guess he didn't ``illegally'' boost wattage like Chef Carlino.)
</P>
<P>
   Chef David Pantone, 37, director of the Florida Culinary
Institute, had an Easy-Bake knockoff that made monster-shaped
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a Rambo oven,'' he says, laughing. ``It was a guy oven.
I'd decorate my cakes with candy bugs and worms so people would
think I was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A passing observation: Many boys who played with Easy-Bakes grew
up to be kitchen professionals, while a lot of women say their
Easy-Bake was the last time they cooked _ or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine was orange, and I thought the neatest thing about it was
the little pans,'' says Christy Drolet, 24, at Max's Bakery in Boca
Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A bakery?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, I work the register. I didn't stick with the baking
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Precilla Burleson, 39, who works _ but doesn't bake
_ at The Upper Crust in Lake Worth, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite was chocolate,'' she says. ``But I used to cheat
and use my grandmother's mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Storandt, 26, a teacher who lives in Boynton Beach,
Fla., used to break rank from standard mix and make pineapple
upside down cake. (``It was a challenge because you had to place
things.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was in the Navy, and we got mine at a thrift store in
Japan,'' she says. ``I was about 7, and it was avocado green.''
</P>
<P>
   (If you're savvy, you can guesstimate someone's age by the color
of their oven. Next time you're at a party, slyly ask, ``So . . .
what color was your Easy-Bake?'')
</P>
<P>
   More than 16 million Easy-Bake Ovens have sold since 1963, plus
more than 100 million packets of mix. And Hasbro _ which launched a
Web site this year: http://www.easybake.com _ plans to keep
updating the toy that has become a pop-culture icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the next thing is a voice-activated model,'' Fuller
predicts with a laugh. ``Or maybe one that's solar-powered.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, how about one that comes with a cook?

 &HT;    Netw(at)tch: Internet access, Microsoft top Harvard agenda
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cambridge, Mass. _ The Microsoft antitrust litigation cast a
long shadow over the Harvard International Conference on Internet
and Society held in Cambridge, Mass. May 25 - 29.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's Larry Ellison and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy, who
have never been fans of the software giant, did not hide their glee
over Microsoft's current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the gathering of Internet professionals who came
from as near as Harvard's graduate school and as far away as
Australia had more on their minds than Microsoft. That's good news
for anybody who ever has or ever plans to log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There were discussions of copyright, community and the need to
push harder to wire more people in more countries as the millennium
approaches. Americans tend to think the Net is something uniquely
American -- a toy used to read magazines and browse movie Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson -- known in technology circles as one of the
philosophers of the digital age -- and others made it clear the
Internet isn't just a cool hobby for rich Americans. Their message
was simple: Internet access is as vital as telephone access. Wiring
the poorest citizens in the United States and around the world will
empower them and enable them to tap into wisdom and news from half
a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Boston will be able to diagnose an exotic illness of
a patient in an African village. Eastern European companies will be
able to develop, helped by information and advice from Western
businessmen. Students in remote areas will be able to get an
education from some of the best and the brightest teachers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   None of these scenarios is fantasy. They are possible now if the
world community could find some way to get computers and technical
know-how into the hands of people who can't afford them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one at the four-day conference seemed to know
how to do this, who would pay for it or how long it would take to
close the gap between Internet haves and have-nots. Some academics
pointed to Microsoft's efforts to wire schools and libraries,
although others were just as quick to say Microsoft's interest in
wiring schools is more of an effort to build brand loyalty than to
bring technology to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' said one panelist. ``I don't care why they are
doing it. If they are going to give us the computers and the
training, I'm just gonna take the money and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks were met with applause from a packed auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But every discussion, whether about regulation, content or
society, was colored by the specter of Microsoft. Every speaker
seemed to feel duty-bound to make a witty comment about Microsoft.
Most people tired of the Microsoft jokes and predictable lectures
on monopolies from its competitors. So when Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft executive vice president, began his talk via cybercast
from Redmond, Wash., people were waiting to hear something --
anything, really -- that would make Bill Gates seem more like
Florence Nightingale and less like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer stuck to his script and gave a talk he's given many
times before. He described Microsoft products, hyped the Microsoft
Network and talked about the company's numerous content
partnerships. A speech like that at a conference like this gave the
appearance Microsoft was out of touch with the global community and
more focused on its stock price and market share than anything.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a go-round with the Justice Department might give
Microsoft some of the perspective and vision the people at the
Harvard conference had. But don't place any bets just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Katz covers the Internet and the World Wide Web. She has
been attending the Harvard Conference on Internet and Society. Her
coverage of specific Web sites will resume next Sunday.

 &HT;    Viagra even cures unemployment!
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When future generations speak of 1998, and I
feel sure they will at great length, and when perspectives have had
a chance to shift and re-focus, I am certain that yet another truth
will have become self-evident to this great nation: Viagra cures
unemployment. Such a simple solution to such a pernicious problem.
Like it or not, the little blue pill has begun a revolution. In
Ohio and Michigan, welfare recipients have been told that if they
want to play, they're going to have to pay. The Ohio Department of
Human Services has declared that Medicaid will not foot the happy
pill bill because no lives are hanging in the balance due to a lack
of it (Viagra, that is).
</P>
<P>
   The potency pill debuted in late March to rave reviews and even
testimonials. Everybody's talking about it and that's
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of folks, it's a miracle. Only a possible cure for
cancer has been able to push Viagra out of the headlines. The pill
hits millions of folks where they live (or used to live) and what's
wrong with that? Not a thing the way I see it, but according to
what I read, some folks are seeing it quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   A lady in Garden City, N.Y., is suing her 70-year-old ex-live-in
for $2 million in palimony. Seems he got a little heavy-handed with
the Viagra and has begun to stray from their 10-year relationship.
Her lawyer says the drug should carry a warning label. Excuse me
while I snicker. How should such a warning read? CAUTION: Might be
habit forming and user may experience periodic symptoms of
well-being, happiness, and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   A man in Long Beach, Calif., hopes common sense will prevail.
``If sexual performance is fading,'' he writes, ``so be it! It may
be wiser to exchange machismo for maturity. That is the true
measure of manliness.'' No comment.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in San Francisco writes: ``...9 out of 10 of us who are
over 60 would tell you that we do not want bad-tempered, horny old
men on our hands.'' Tsk, tsk. Nice talk for a lady! (And where did
you get your statistics, dearie?)
</P>
<P>
   Viagra provides a temporary cure for impotence just like aspirin
provides temporary pain relief. And where do we get off waxing all
righteous about a little blue pill?
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, folks, we're a pill-popping society.We have
pills to relieve stress and overcome anxiety. We have hormone
replacement therapy. We have pills to put us to sleep and pills to
wake us up. We even have pills to make us look like we've been
lying on the beach in Bermuda. So why not a potency pill? Who
knows? It could turn out to be the cure for ``road rage.''
</P>
<P>
   An old friend (15 years my senior which makes her slightly older
than Moses) called a while back for a giggle and a chat. ``I've got
a new boyfriend,'' she confided, ``and he's the most romantic man
I've ever known. I feel sixteen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, I'm thinking. Seniors' sex lives are
their own business and now that there's Viagra, business should be
better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, on a visit to my parents' home, I overheard a
conversation between my then 72-year-old father and my 67-year-old
mother. He was offering her a deal. He'd repair the washing machine
in exchange for certain favors. She, of course, was playing hard to
get and telling him he should be ashamed of himself, a man of his
age. I remember her saying, ``...and even with our daughter in the
house.'' My father's sage comment was, ``We must assume she's
worldly enough to have figured out where we got her.'' Mother
choked. Daddy chuckled. And I can only assume the washer was
repaired and the bill subsequently paid.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a gentleman of the old school who called all ladies
``Ma'am'' and never came to the table without his coat, would have
been mortified if he'd known I was listening, but I'm also sure
that if he were alive today he'd have a prescription (if he even
needed it) for Pfizer's little blue pill. Of course, we would be
too polite to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, even if it turns out to be useless as a cure for road
rage, is a miracle for millions. It solves two problems at once -
impotency and, in Ohio and Michigan, unemployment.

 &HT;    Tech Report: 200 CDs, accessible by a touch
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of
compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop
it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to just
tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. One of the key
advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random
access _ the ability to play the track you want without first
listening to a bunch of other stuff. The new Kenwood line means to
take that idea one step further by making the CD player your
storage unit as well.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't
want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes? Each of the
new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in
data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed
categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.). Then if you wake up
Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the
Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the
Motown genre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you want to play DJ for friends dropping
by late some night, you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks
that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to
Percy Sledge. Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded
in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class, ranging from $230
to $500 in list price. The top of the line, the CD-2280M, can play
two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms. For
more information, contact Kenwood USA, Box 22745, Long Beach,
Calif. 90801.
</P>
<P>
   Burn your own
</P>
<P>
   The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is still illegal, of course, to make those recordings and
sell them without a license from the owner of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections
in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton,
Miles Davis or Brahms would be. Digitization of music is making it
possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put
on disc, or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in
their own CD collections, then rearrange them in the right order,
there are CD recorders. Popular Science in its June issue offers a
primer on recording CDs, with sidelong glances at other formats
like DVD and mini-disc.
</P>
<P>
   But say you want to select from a much larger database than you
have on your shelves. How about choosing from tens of thousands of
songs? Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the company's business is the logic of Internet
commerce: the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will
soon be done over the Net. But the Net is not merely the conduit,
since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many
arrangements that can play to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of Custom Revolutions
(http://www.customdisc.com), consumers are invited to select as
many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library,
which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes
it has licensed. Each 10-track CD costs $18 plus shipping, and
customers are also offered the option of ``personalizing'' the art
for the case. Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of
the tunes before buying, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse
list, leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far. Named by
the company are Buddy Guy, Charlie Parker, Hot Tuna, Jim Croce and
Nat King Cole.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Custom Revolutions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and identify
</P>
<P>
   Just how picky are you about phone calls?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a
telemarketer, eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not
to mention the boss. The question is, just how much screening do
you want your machines to do?
</P>
<P>
   And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before
you will deign to pick up your phone?
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, which shows you the caller's number as the phone
rings, is the most obvious option and is available from your local
phone company for a monthly charge. But maybe that is not enough
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of
Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says
``Please enter the four-digit pass code''? If the caller doesn't
have your code, the phone doesn't ring and the call is
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Edge Co. (1-800-732-9976) or visit the
company's site (http://www.edgeco.com).

<P>
   VCR verbal
</P>
<P>
   The videocassette recorder, despite its near-ubiquity in the
homes of America, just might be the least understood of our most
well-used products. You can pop in a movie, but can you actually
record on your VCR? Can you set it to tape something next week?
</P>
<P>
   Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature, an addition to its
VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the
process of recording. It works something like calling an office
voice mail.Bela Lugosi
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $170 to
$250. For more information, visit the Zenith site on the Net
(http://www.zenith.com).

 &HT;    Just for Fun: Whatever your gizmo, there's a case
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter what portable electronic device you use,
from the smallest personal digital assistant to the bulkiest
laptops, Targus has a carrying case to fit and protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed for strength, durability and user comfort, the
Targus line of computer luggage combines a protective carrying case
and convenient briefcase into a single system.
</P>
<P>
   Most allow electronic devices to be operated easily, without
removal from their carrying cases, and most cases are equipped with
pouches, dividers and pockets, making them a virtual portable
office. Some are even designed to hold a variety of portables and
their accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line notebook cases are designed with the Air
Protection System, a layer of sealed pressurized air to protect
sensitive portables from bumps and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Fabricated from nylon or leather, Targus carrying cases are
widely available from $30 to $300. For more information, visit the
Web site at http://www.targus.com.

   Polaroid camera named for the Spice Girls
</P>
<P>
   Whether you love them or hate them, there's no denying the Spice
Girls have gained worldwide notoriety. Capitalizing on that
popularity and targeting Generation X and Y-ers, Polaroid has just
released SpiceCam, which it says is the first instant camera in
history to be named after a pop group.
</P>
<P>
   However, like the fun-loving quintet, SpiceCam has more style
than substance. Modeled after Polaroid's newly restyled OneStep,
SpiceCam is highlighted in the Spice Girls' ``Girl Power'' colors
of pop purple, hot pink, neon orange and touch-of-class silver.
It's packaged with Spice Girls portrait stickers to allow users to
customize and personalize it.
</P>
<P>
   The multihued SpiceCam accepts Polaroid 600 instant film,
including Platinum and the new AlterImage, a matte-surface film
that invites after-exposure artistic expression with pens, paint
and markers.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price is $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   System 270 caters
</P>
<P>
   to home theater crowd
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Technology says its speaker systems are designed for
home theater only. As a result, its speaker systems are built from
the ground up to meet the demands of multichannel movie sound
tracks, such as Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro-Logic and DTS.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently introduced System 270, a midpriced,
six-piece home theater speaker system, designed to deliver the
sonic excitement of the latest Hollywood blockbusters to serious
home movie viewers.
</P>
<P>
   System 270 consists of an adjustable center-channel speaker with
boundary compensation, two left and right front speakers, two
dipolar surround speakers and a 225-watt, powered subwoofer, which
promise optimum music performance without sacrificing home theater
sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   The system has a $2,396 suggested retail price. To learn more,
visit the Web site at http://www

   Digital assistant fits in your palm
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot by U.S. Robotics is a pocket-size personal digital
assistant that will help users keep track of contacts, appointments
and personal notes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-compact, the PalmPilot stores and retrieves tons of
information at the touch of a button. It will also exchange
information with a PC and display it on a backlit screen for easy
viewing, even in low light conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Applications include a date book, address book, to-do list, memo
pad, expense report, calculator and games.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot has a suggested retail price of about $290. The
PalmPilot Pro, with more features and expanded memory, has a
suggested price of $380.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It is not clear that any survey of the

football league, but it looks as though we may be getting one

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Political carnivorousness remains unabated,
partisan appetites never satiated. Hypocrisy _ a technical-sounding
term for the droppings of a male cow _ is the main ingredient of
much of it. Two great recent examples are the incongruous rantings
of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as he spews his double-speak bile
about the Middle East _ a breach of U.S. political ethics _ and
last weekend's so-called response to President Clinton's Saturday
radio address. Howard Kleinberg is a former editor of the Miami
News. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED 6/1.

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The potency pill debuted in
late March to rave reviews and even testimonials. Everybody's
talking about it and that's understandable. For millions of folks,
it's a miracle. Only a possible cure for cancer has been able to
push Viagra out of the headlines. The pill hits millions of folks
where they live (or used to live) and what's wrong with that? Not a
thing the way I see it, but according to what I read, some folks
are seeing it quite differently.(Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   REAL-LIFE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There she was, all legs and
smiles, in the fourth grade and barely reading chapter books, when
she started getting The Feeling. Shannon went to her mother, Jane,
and complained about it. It felt as though she was having a spasm
in her arm, a tightness that wouldn't go away. Something wasn't
right, she told her mom. But now, it's been 15 months since the
operation. And glory be! No more medicine. No more seizures! Not in
the bathroom. Not in the bedroom. Not on the dance floor. (Minor,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

Microsoft. That's good news for anybody who ever has or ever plans

to erase them. But instead, she decided to correct the problem one
afternoon with a quick-and-easy injection of one of the world's
most deadly toxins. Call it botulism for beauty. Originally
harnessed for serious medical conditions such as swallowing
disorders and crossed eyes, Botox _ a diluted purified form of the
toxin _ is now one of the hottest new weapons against wrinkles.

   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ In the end, the gathering of Internet
professionals who came from as near as Harvard's graduate school
and as far away as Australia had more on their minds than
Microsoft. That's good news for anybody who ever has or ever plans
to log on to the Internet. There were discussions of copyright,
community and the need to push harder to wire more people in more
countries as the millennium approaches. Americans tend to think the
Net is something uniquely American -- a toy used to read magazines
and browse movie Web sites. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   JUST-FOR-FUN _ ATLANTA _ No matter what portable electronic
device you use, from the smallest personal digital assistant to the
bulkiest laptops, Targus has a carrying case to fit and protect it.
Whether you love them or hate them, there's no denying the Spice
Girls have gained worldwide notoriety. Capitalizing on that
popularity and targeting Generation X and Y-ers, Polaroid has just
released SpiceCam, which it says is the first instant camera in
history to be named after a pop group. (And more news on
technology.) (Davis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

   TECHREPORT _ ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the
stack of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering
for, pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be
nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. (And other news on new
technology.) (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

   BOTOX _ ATLANTA _ Lisa Randolph was tired of hearing people tell
her to stop frowning. The 36-year-old Alpharetta resident had deep
lines above her brow, and was considering having laser resurfacing
to erase them. But instead, she decided to correct the problem one
afternoon with a quick-and-easy injection of one of the world's
most deadly toxins. Call it botulism for beauty. Originally
harnessed for serious medical conditions such as swallowing
disorders and crossed eyes, Botox _ a diluted purified form of the
toxin _ is now one of the hottest new weapons against wrinkles.

<P>
   (1,500 words) EDITORS: For the opposing view, see Mortimer
Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the
world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will
not record that the 21st century belonged to America.

   (1,450 words) The French always seem to be opposing the United
states on some issue or another. Why is France so difficult to deal
with? It is, quite simply, in a bad mood, unsure of its place and
status in a new world. The French are jealous of America, which
seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

 AMERICA THE BOASTFUL  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (1,500 words) EDITORS: For the opposing view, see Mortimer
Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the
world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will
not record that the 21st century belonged to America.

   &UR; AMERICANIZING ASIA? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DONALD K. EMMERSON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial
crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways. The Asian
economies holding up the best may be those with the most political
freedom, but the real key may be competent government. East Asia is
changing, but not Americanizing.

 &UR; By EDWARD J. LINCOLN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Tokyo's economic sluggishness is souring life at
home and setting off international reverberations. Scandal after
scandal exposes unethical or illegal behavior. Yet the impulse to
reform is weak, and those who believe Japan will adopt an American
economic model are mistaken.

   &UR; FRANCE IS IN A BAD MOOD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DOMINIQUE MOISI &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,450 words) The French always seem to be opposing the United
states on some issue or another. Why is France so difficult to deal
with? It is, quite simply, in a bad mood, unsure of its place and
status in a new world. The French are jealous of America, which
seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

</P>
<P>
   Part III:  &UR; RUSSIA: WHAT IS TO BE DONE? &LR;  _ A new set of rules

 By MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The American economy is in the eighth year of sustained growth
that transcends the ``German miracle'' and the ``Japanese miracle''
of earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that should be up is up _ GDP, capital spending,
incomes, the stock market, employment, exports, consumer and
business confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that should be down is down _ unemployment,
inflation, interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been ranked No. 1 among major industrial
economies for three years in a row. America is riding a capital
spending boom that is modernizing its existing industrial base and
expanding its industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial average is more than four times as high
as it was six years ago. The New York and NASDAQ stock exchanges
have added over $4 trillion in value in the last four years alone _
the largest single accumulation of wealth in the history of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Europe is stagnating and burdened with double-digit
unemployment, and Asia is floundering in the wake of financial
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fluke. The unique American brand of entrepreneurial
bottom-up capitalism is made up of structural elements that have
wrought the stunning economic success of the 1990s and are likely
to provide the basis for extending America's comparative advantage
over time.
</P>
<P>
   Consider where the country has come from and where it is
undoubtedly going. America was all but written off in the 1980s
because of its apparently uncontrollable fiscal deficit and its
products' steady loss of competitiveness in the global economy.
Downsizing and restructuring depressed everyone, but that valley is
now largely traversed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lost some 44 million jobs in the process of
adjusting its economy but simultaneously created 73 million
private-sector jobs _ a net gain of over 29 million jobs since
1980. A stunning 55 percent of the total work force today is in a
new job, some two-thirds of them in industries that pay more than
the average wage.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast all of continental Europe, with its larger economy and
work force. It has created an estimated 4 million jobs in the same
time period, virtually all of which are in the public sector. Since
1991, the European Union has lost about 5 million jobs while the
U.S. economy has created more than 14 million new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Today a record 64 percent of American adults are working, the
unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent, and GDP growth has
accelerated at the rate of close to 4 percent over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such figures have raised the red flag of inflation.
But inflation is at a 30-year low and, like unemployment, is still
falling. This contradicts the historical experience of the late
phase of a traditional business cycle, where accelerated growth
usually correlates with higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does there seem to be an imminent inflationary threat.
The markets do not anticipate it, and many in the private sector
accept what many economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, believe _ that the official consumer price index
overstates inflation by at least a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   If that is correct, it means the United States is closing in on
a zero-inflation economy.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation means lower interest rates, more capital
investment, rising productivity, and higher growth _ a virtuous
cycle not likely to be broken by external forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slowing and riskier global economy, the United States
remains a balanced economy with the world's most buoyant domestic
demand and a more limited exposure than other major industrial
nations to exports, which account for only 13 percent of the U.S.
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. exports are less vulnerable because they are
diversified around the world. Exports are rising three times as
fast as the overall economy. They are growing even more rapidly in
the fields where America dominates, such as advanced
semiconductors, computer network servers, personal computers,
software and services, entertainment, finance and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The United States dominates the knowledge industries of the
future. Americans spend vastly more on research and development in
these areas than their competitors, and the gap between the United
States and the rest of the world will grow, not contract. America
dominates the world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the brink of the 21st century, the United States is at a
point reminiscent of its entry into the twentieth. Frederick
Jackson Turner pronounced the end of the American frontier in 1893.
The newly settled continent, linked by rail, lay open as a vast,
tariff-free marketplace, conducive to mass-produced products at
prices the masses could increasingly afford _ Edison's electric
lights, Singer's sewing machines, Bell's speaking tubes, Ford's
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, the new frontier is the global economy.
Evidence is growing that the United States is as well placed to
exploit that as it was the new continental marketplace of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   America's business achievements grew out of a culture that has
long valued individualism, entrepreneurialism, pragmatism and
novelty. This legacy has outlived the passing of the frontier and
still inspires millions.
</P>
<P>
   American culture nourishes its mavericks, cherishes its young,
welcomes newcomers, and dramatically opens to energy and talent
rising from the bottom up. In the 19th century, men like Carnegie,
Frick, Rockefeller, and Morgan seized their chances. Today, their
heirs are Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Larry Ellison, Craig McCaw and
the many others who vie for the top of Forbes' list of the 400
richest people in America.
</P>
<P>
   American history uniquely encouraged the development of a
management culture. The anthropologist Lionel Tiger showed that the
development of American corporate management was America's response
to a huge market, vast distances and diverse populations, and the
administrative and economic challenges they presented.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, what has dominated our business world is contract
and law rather than kinship and custom, not primogeniture but a
market economy and a belief in technology and scientific
management. Indeed, the science of management was invented by an
American, Frederick Winslow Taylor, who pioneered the
time-and-motion study and was the father of mass-production
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   No other country met the requirements of an emerging industrial
system that needed people to be mobile, both physically and
psychologically. No other country, for example, shares the American
belief in numbers and statistics as the basis for decision-making.
No other country has a population so prone to self-help,
self-improvement and even self-renovation in a manner that carries
over into business life.
</P>
<P>
   No other country invests so much in the business training and
retraining of its people _ some $100 billion a year _ in addition
to having the largest and best graduate and undergraduate business
schools in the world. And no other country sees its most talented
move so overwhelmingly into the private domain, where the most
successful are celebrated and rewarded as symbols in a nation of
doers.
</P>
<P>
   American entrepreneurialism and individual initiative are so
widely accepted that in the 1990s about 1.8 million businesses will
have been started, on top of 1.5 million in the 1980s. Smaller
companies have demonstrated they can compete in this swiftly
changing environment with flexibility, openness, innovation and the
ability to attract the best people.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip, large-scale companies no longer have a lock on
recruiting the best and brightest graduates of elite business
schools. Thousands of these smaller companies have had the
potential to blossom and grow, even as thousands have gone
belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as new products and services are developed, American
business' unique marketing and advertising skills establish their
success at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The energy in the business economy is matched by a unique and
remarkable world of finance capital. This realm has proven its
capacity to provide the multiple sources of entrepreneurial capital
needed by entrepreneurial management, thereby demonstrating its
ability to meet the needs of a modern, rapidly changing, globalized
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world may send their sons and daughters to
business schools; they may strive to open up their more parochial
business and national cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But America will not be standing still. If anything, American
business should widen its lead over the rest of the world. France
had the 17th century, Britain the 19th, and America the 20th. It
will also have the 21st.

   Today, of course, the new frontier is the global economy.
Evidence is growing that the United States is as well placed to
exploit that as it was the new continental marketplace of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   America's business achievements grew out of a culture that has
long valued individualism, entrepreneurialism, pragmatism and
novelty. This legacy has outlived the passing of the frontier and
still inspires millions.
</P>
<P>
   American culture nourishes its mavericks, cherishes its young,
welcomes newcomers, and dramatically opens to energy and talent
rising from the bottom up. In the 19th century, men like Carnegie,
Frick, Rockefeller, and Morgan seized their chances. Today, their
heirs are Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Larry Ellison, Craig McCaw and
the many others who vie for the top of Forbes' list of the 400
richest people in America.
</P>
<P>
   American history uniquely encouraged the development of a
management culture. The anthropologist Lionel Tiger showed that the
development of American corporate management was America's response
to a huge market, vast distances and diverse populations, and the
administrative and economic challenges they presented.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, what has dominated our business world is contract
and law rather than kinship and custom, not primogeniture but a
market economy and a belief in technology and scientific
management. Indeed, the science of management was invented by an
American, Frederick Winslow Taylor, who pioneered the
time-and-motion study and was the father of mass-production
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   No other country met the requirements of an emerging industrial
system that needed people to be mobile, both physically and
psychologically. No other country, for example, shares the American
belief in numbers and statistics as the basis for decision-making.
No other country has a population so prone to self-help,
self-improvement and even self-renovation in a manner that carries
over into business life.
</P>
<P>
   No other country invests so much in the business training and
retraining of its people _ some $100 billion a year _ in addition
to having the largest and best graduate and undergraduate business
schools in the world. And no other country sees its most talented
move so overwhelmingly into the private domain, where the most
successful are celebrated and rewarded as symbols in a nation of
doers.
</P>
<P>
   American entrepreneurialism and individual initiative are so
widely accepted that in the 1990s about 1.8 million businesses will
have been started, on top of 1.5 million in the 1980s. Smaller
companies have demonstrated they can compete in this swiftly
changing environment with flexibility, openness, innovation and the
ability to attract the best people.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip, large-scale companies no longer have a lock on
recruiting the best and brightest graduates of elite business
schools. Thousands of these smaller companies have had the
potential to blossom and grow, even as thousands have gone
belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as new products and services are developed, American
business' unique marketing and advertising skills establish their
success at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The energy in the business economy is matched by a unique and
remarkable world of finance capital. This realm has proven its
capacity to provide the multiple sources of entrepreneurial capital
needed by entrepreneurial management, thereby demonstrating its
ability to meet the needs of a modern, rapidly changing, globalized
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world may send their sons and daughters to
business schools; they may strive to open up their more parochial
business and national cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But America will not be standing still. If anything, American
business should widen its lead over the rest of the world. France
had the 17th century, Britain the 19th, and America the 20th. It
will also have the 21st.

MACHO YARD TOOLS POPULAR DESPITE HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mowers, blowers, throwers and whackers _ '90s men
love their big lawn and garden tools. In the social strata of
suburban America, horsepower rules: The bigger the mower, the
bigger the man riding it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Americans will purchase upwards of 22 million
gas-powered lawn and garden tools _ a record number, according to
the Environmental Protection Agency. And as sales of these tools
grow, so too have the size of the engines powering them _ and the
egos of the men buying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very testosterone-driven business,'' conceded Bill
Redmond, president and chief executive of Garden Way Inc., the
Troy, N.Y., manufacturer of Troy-Bilt lawnmowers. Most buyers of
lawn tools are men, he said, and most of them like to brag about
the size and power of their lawn arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some people,'' Redmond said, ``this is almost recreational
and a toy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the 4.5 horsepower Lawn Boy that you could hang
on the garage wall after a day's work seemed good enough. No more.
Nowadays, suburban lawn kings drool over souped up muscle mowers
with 8 horsepower engines and up to six gears (including reverse)
that have reduced lawnmowing to a heart-thumping finger exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all this macho lawn technology, suburban yardmasters
and their neighborhoods are paying a price. Namely, the
ear-battering noise and noxious smog our gas-powered society
generates.
</P>
<P>
   From whining two-stroke leaf blowers to the $6,000, Buick-sized
riding mowers, lawn tools have changed some suburbs into
Dolby-style theaters of noise.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to backyard noise, leaf blowers rule. Blowers have
become such a problem that cities and towns around the country have
banned them. In Los Angeles, where police receive 21 complaints
each day, blowing a leaf can garner a $271 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Mow enough lawns without protecting your ears and your hearing
will suffer, said Dr. Donna Wayner, director of the Hearing Center
at Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, people won't know that they're doing damage,'' she
said. ``Then all of a sudden they realize, `Gee, I'm not hearing as
well as I had been.' The tragic part is you can't undo it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her study of college students in Chicago six years ago,
Wayner found that a full summer of lawn mowing noticeably damaged
the students' high-frequency hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Wayner said exposure to noise at or above 110 decibels _
slightly louder than a 22 cc weed wacker at full throttle _ for
more than one minute may cause hearing loss. Prolonged exposure to
90 decibels or higher _ the average lawnmower hums at about 97 _
also can damage hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss aside, lawn tools are no friend to the environment.
Because they often employ two-stroke engines that burn a noxious
mixture of gasoline and oil, the small engines cause about a tenth
of all airborne pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, America's lawn mowers, leaf blowers, hedge trimmers
weed cutters and chain saws spewed 492,811 tons of ozone-forming
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides into the air, EPA statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the average passenger car, driven 14,000 miles a
year, emits about 80 pounds of hydrocarbons a year. Overall, those
innocent-looking tools hanging in garages across the country
contributed about 10 percent of the nation's airborne pollution,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrocarbons are bad because they create ozone, a principal
ingredient in the lung-choking smog that accumulates in large urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   To combat such pollution, the EPA last September began enforcing
the nation's first limitations on emissions that it estimates will
reduce small-engine hydrocarbons levels by 32 percent. Yet stricter
measures, cutting these emissions by another 30 percent, will begin
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chainsaws are the filthiest. Running a 4-horsepower chainsaw for
two hours produces the same amount of ozone-creating hydrocarbons
as driving 10 1995 cars for 250 miles, according to the California
Air Resources Board.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn mowers aren't much better. Today's average new lawn mower
will, after two years, produce 34 times as many hydrocarbons as an
average passenger car, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions manuals for most of these new lawn tools even warn
customers, ``Engine exhaust from this product contains chemicals
known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or
other reproductive harm.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these drawbacks, however, appear to be infringing on the
American right of a lawnmower and weed wacker in every garage.
</P>
<P>
   While last year's federal emissions restrictions have made
lawnmower engines $5 to $15 more expensive to make, Redmond said,
the price of Troy-Bilt mowers has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling our lawnmowers for less than we did last year,
as is Toro,'' he said. ``We've had to do this to remain price
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Redmond predicted, as the trend toward less small-engine
emissions continues, ``this will end up costing the consumer
more.''

EL NINO GIVES LAKE TAHOE CHRISTMAS IN JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUCKEE, Calif. _ In the battle of the seasons being waged at
Lake Tahoe, skis and snowmobiles definitely have the edge on canoes
and fishing poles.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has crashed the summer party that should have kicked off
on Memorial Day weekend, when the lake normally heats up and the
hiking and mountain-biking trails and campsites begin to defrost.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in storm after storm, the mountains that frame the
picturesque lake have been dusted with fresh snowfall that has
prolonged stellar late-season skiing.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day weekend, more than 10,000 skiers and
snowboarders hit the slopes while traditional summer activities
like water skiing, camping and sunbathing were avoided because of
chilly temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just ready for a change of scenery,'' said 43-year-old
Lisa Fielding, an avid skier who traded in her skis for in-line
skates Friday, even though the latest storm to roll through the
region made the paths dangerously slick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great winter, but it's summertime now. I'm really
anxious to get it started already.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe isn't used to prolonged winter seasons. Little League
games have been postponed because the fields are too soggy. Popular
hiking and mountain-biking trails are closed because they are still
covered with snow. A local newspaper dubbed last month ``Mayuary.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiing would normally be winding down right about now as the
snowpack melts away, but a few savvy resorts have stayed open and
are still enjoying good crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum from having a strong winter has definitely pushed
into the spring and now summer,'' said Jody Churich, sales manager
at Alpine Meadows Ski Resort. ``We're still seeing great turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort has logged its fourth snowiest season in 28 years,
thanks to the record February snowfall of 186 inches. Alpine had
planned to close its doors May 5. But with a snowpack of between
seven and 17 feet, it extended daily skiing through June 7, and
plans to offer weekend skiing through the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the endless winter,'' said Jeannette Lewis, a member
of the resort's ski patrol. ``It just won't quit snowing. We're
hardly ever open through June.''

<P>
   SAN PEDRO, Calif. _ I always wanted a pet. Once I even took home
a dog I found in a Beirut alley. But that was years ago, back in
Lebanon, and that stray dog wasn't allowed to enter the threshold
of my childhood home.
</P>
<P>
   I am now an American citizen who, along with dreaming in a
California accent, has become the owner of a purchased pet. He's a
little dog who, according to my Lebanese father, will fill my house
with all kinds of germs.
</P>
<P>
   You can't really blame my father the physician for his aversion
to animals in the home. He was the only person in Lebanon in charge
of infectious diseases. He could have lost his job if he blamed the
minister of health for Lebanon's unsanitary conditions. Instead, he
blamed the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This puppy we call Dixie seems to like me. He follows me around
and chews the sandals I brought last year from my native country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a baby,'' my husband tells me. And I want to
believe him. I rub the puppy's back with the tip of my fingers and
he growls at me.
</P>
<P>
   When I sit on the couch, he snuggles beside me. I don't dare
move. I am afraid he will relieve himself on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss the puppy,'' my son says.
</P>
<P>
   I pucker up my lips. The dog stares at me. I bring my face
closer. He licks me. Oh my stars, quick bring me the heavy-duty
soap. I am certain I am now infected with an army of invisible
canine germs.
</P>
<P>
   But, when the house is empty, and it's just me and Dixie, there
is a feeling inside of me that surprises me. I think I am
developing a crush on this new addition to my family.
</P>
<P>
   I sure have come a long way from that little girl in Lebanon who
picked up a stray dog in an alley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only I can convince my father that Lebanon's woes had
nothing to do with the four-legged kind of dogs.

CLERICAL ERROR PUTS TEXAS MASS MURDERER IN PRISON TRUSTY JOB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN MAKEIG 
and MATT SCHWARTZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A clerk's error left longtime inmate Elmer Wayne
Henley, serving a life sentence in the killings of 27 youths in the
Houston area, as a trusty in charge of youths at a prison boot
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system spokesman David Nunnelee said that Henley, 42, was
a trusty at the Coffield Unit boot camp near Palestine from April
15 until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned there based only on his prison identification
number by someone unfamiliar with his history, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Henley's career as trusty ended hurriedly once Coffield Unit
Warden Kevin Moore learned the convicted multiple murderer had the
assignment. Henley now is back inside the maximum-security prison
unit, adjacent to the boot camp, working as a ``unit artist,''
meaning he paints signs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
called it an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a mistake is made by our personnel, I become
concerned,'' Polunsky said. ``I wouldn't describe it as systematic
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding that, there has been, from what I can see, a
slight breach in the policies and procedures in the division. And
that calls for a review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said he asked Texas Department of Criminal Justice
officials to investigate the incident and make necessary changes to
procedures to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Henley qualified for trusty status, he said, TDCJ
policies prohibit inmates convicted of dangerous crimes from being
placed in positions with less security from which they could
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said Henley was transferred to a facility adjacent to
the Coffield Unit that housed adult inmates, adding there were no
youthful offenders there.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnelee said prison files suggest that Henley has been an ideal
inmate during his 24 years and nine months in custody, with only
two infractions on his record. In 1986, he got in trouble for
fighting with another inmate and in 1973 he was written up for
failing to obey a posted order.
</P>
<P>
   Henley is serving six concurrent life sentences for his role in
the torture-slayings of 27 youths in the Houston area in 1973 when
he was a teen-ager. His co-defendant, David Owen Brooks, also is
serving a life sentence in four of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Corll, 33, was the primary culprit in the killings. Henley
shot Corll six times _ in self-defense, he told authorities _
before calling police and confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite his record as a good inmate, Henley has been
passed over for parole numerous times. Nunnelee said Henley has
accumulated 73 years of good-time credit toward parole, but it
remains doubtful he will ever be freed. Henley's next review for
parole will be in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henley's name is pretty much synonymous with mass murder,''
said Andy Kahan, the mayor's advocate for crime victims. ``Even if
it was a clerical error, the minute you yell out `Elmer Wayne
Henley,' that should raise some eyebrows. Anything that involves
Elmer Wayne Henley draws notice and attention, even the name. Even
when the transfer comes across your desk, you take notice of the
name.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wondered why it took two weeks for officials to
realize the error but _ like Polunsky _ Kahan stopped well short of
criticizing TDCJ procedures. ``I don't know if you can say there is
a problem,'' Kahan said. ``You're dealing with 140,000 inmates on a
daily basis. Clerical errors do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an inmate named Steven Jay Russell won a
special needs parole to a South Texas nursing home after duping
prison doctors and parole officials into believing he was
terminally ill with AIDS. Once there, Russell had someone call the
facility posing as a doctor authorizing special treatment at a
Houston hospital, from which the inmate escaped. He was later
captured in Dallas, but slipped free after feigning a heart attack
and being taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky drew a distinction between Russell and Henley's cases,
noting that Henley ``was never outside the fence at all. He was
under supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Russell escaped from TDCJ's Estelle Unit near
Huntsville, posing as a doctor after he used a green marker to
color his white prison uniform.

PRE-APPROVAL MAY NOT MEAN APPROVAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've gotten an offer in the mail saying you've been
pre-approved for credit, don't assume you're a shoo-in for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   You can still be turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Under changes in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, banks
may reject your pre-approved credit card application if they find
that changes in your financial condition make you a bad credit
risk. For example, they can take back that offer if you've lost
your job or have taken on too much debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, (which sets
rules for credit reports), give creditors more leeway after making
a prescreened offer to get information about the applicant,'' said
Sandra Wilmore, an attorney in the credit practices division of the
Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the credit reporting act.
``If they found out you were unemployed or any circumstance that
was different than what their prescreened information suggested,
then they could turn you down.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about that letter saying you are ``pre-approved?''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has ruled that if a creditor tells you you've
been pre-approved for credit, they should ``have the intention'' of
extending you credit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not true, that would violate the FTC Act, which
prohibits unfair and deceptive practices,'' Wilmore said.
```Pre-approved' means they've already made a decision to give you
credit. Our view is that if they say that, they should mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid getting themselves in legal hot water, many creditors
have revised their offers to say you've been ``preselected'' to
apply for credit. In other words, you've been invited to apply.
</P>
<P>
   If creditors deny you credit, don't hold a grudge. They may be
doing you a favor. If your financial circumstances have taken a
turn for the worse, it's not a good time to add to your debt load.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you have too much credit _ even if you're not
tapping it _ it could affect your chances of getting a loan in the
future because creditors may view excess borrowing as too much of a
temptation for you.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect an end to such tempting come-ons. Banks dangle
credit lines of as much as $100,000, offer an initial ``teaser''
rate of as low as 5.9 percent or promise a gold or platinum card.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders are fighting for your business. Last year, they sent out
a record 3 billion credit solicitations, said Bob Litwin, director
of creditor/community relations at Consumer Credit Counseling
Service in Houston, a community organization that helps consumers
with credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   Don't choose your credit card by opening your mail each day.
It's just too easy to get yourself in financial trouble by adding
more and more credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true if you've gotten way behind on your
bills. The law says if you charge more than $1,000 on a single
credit card 60 days before filing for bankruptcy, it's highly
unlikely that a bankruptcy court will allow you to walk on that
debt &UR; , &LR;  said J. Thomas Black, a consumer bankruptcy attorney in
Houston and vice president of the Houston Association of Debtor
Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption is you knew you were going to file for
bankruptcy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy reform proposals before Congress are seeking to make
the law even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   So before accepting a pre-approved credit offer, consider why
they are so eager to lend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at primarily what interest rate are the credit card
companies offering,'' Litwin said. ``Is it a better interest rate
than what they already have on their current card?''
</P>
<P>
   If it is a super-low rate such as 5.9 percent, many times, it's
just for six months. After that period, it soars to a double-digit
rate.
</P>
<P>
   It's not worth it to apply for the credit if the rate eventually
will be higher than the rate you're paying now. Also, pre-approved
credit cards may well come with fees.
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to apply for credit based on the initial lower
rate, have a plan to pay off the balance before the lower rate
expires. The only way to get out of debt is to bear down and really
be determined to whittle down the bills and pay them off.
</P>
<P>
   Black offers a simpler plan: Consumers should just toss all
pre-approved credit offers in the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lending money to increasingly shaky people, far more
than they could ever afford to repay,'' said Black, adding that he
``routinely'' gets pre-approved credit card offers at his office,
addressed to his clients. ``It's too expensive. It gives them a
feeling that they're richer than they are.''

DEALERS SELLING FAKE GOODS FACE REAL TIME IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Most vendors selling cheap imitations or knockoffs of
Nike T-shirts, Rolex watches and Dooney &AMP; Bourke handbags used to
glide through Texas courts with a small fine and slap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But with a change in Texas law and aggressive undercover police
efforts in Harris County, authorities say brokers of illegitimate
merchandise are now facing the real thing _ a felony charge and the
possibility of being fitted with an authentic wardrobe of jail
attire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six weeks, Houston police have made 21 arrests using
the state's new trademark counterfeiting statute. Five of those
arrested have been indicted by Harris County grand jurors, who are
expected to hear a dozen more of the cases in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, less than 10 cases were filed elsewhere in the
state. But since Sept. 1, Houston has taken the lead in being the
most assertive and aggressive city in the state,'' said Mike
McKenna, a security consultant and private investigator who
specializes in intellectual property rights and trademark theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is going to end up being a model city for the rest of
the country on this type of enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guidry Group, the firm McKenna works for, has offices in
Houston and Dallas and represents companies such as Disney, Warner
Brothers, Oakley, Rolex, Louis Vuitton, Dooney &AMP; Bourke and Nike.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are active in catching trademark thieves in
Houston because counterfeits of their products _ T-shirts,
handbags, sunglasses, jewelry, luggage and other items _ are so
popular here, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   His firm helps police and prosecutors in identifying bogus
merchandise and provides the expensive expert testimony and
trademark documents needed to make the cases in court.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said trademark theft is especially acute in Houston, New
York and Los Angeles _ big cities with ports, international
connections and a base of customers who want to pay cheap prices
for the status they think comes with a brand like Nike or Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and police were frustrated for years because Texas
law only allowed them to charge offenders with a misdemeanor, no
matter how much of the counterfeit merchandise the vendors moved.
That meant mostly small fines and probation if the cases even made
it to court.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Jennings, a prosecutor in the district attorney's major
fraud division, said that many times, the misdemeanor cases weren't
feasible because taxpayers weren't getting ``a lot of bang for
their buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said the companies were wary of providing the experts
and documents needed to make the cases with little or nothing on
the line for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   So the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, based in
Washington, D.C., went to Texas lawmakers and pointed out that more
than $200 billion a year is lost to U.S. companies because of
trademark theft, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers, following their counterparts in New York and
California, responded by revamping the law during the last
legislative session. As of Sept. 1, vendors and their employees
selling the fakes can now face felony charges and more substantial
jail time.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the old law, the seriousness of the charge can be
enhanced depending on how much merchandise the vendors and their
employees are caught trying to sell. That opens the door to more
severe punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said there's also a caveat for those who buy the fakes.
The law may be tailored to hit the merchants, but it's conceivable
customers could also face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the new law) makes it more worthwhile to pursue these
cases because the old statute just wasn't effective,'' Jennings
said. ``Now, there's commitment all around. The law is more
equitable and efficient. The ball is rolling. (The companies being
victimized) are taking it seriously and we're taking it
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Houston police Sgt. Doug Osterberg and a team of
undercover officers come into the picture. They recently targeted a
number of shops in southwest Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants in some of the small shops in the area had no
problem telling undercover officers that their products, like $16
fake Rolex watches, were fake. The officers bought some merchandise
and returned with search warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of dollars' worth of the products were seized at the
shops and at other locations, Osterberg said. After that, many
vendors moved their lucrative businesses to flea markets. But the
authorities were right behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran 10 search warrants (May 16) in several places, like
small flea markets, and seized over $20,000 in merchandise,''
Osterberg said. ``And all these cases are being made in a short
time. We're not even working on them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the merchants in southwest Houston who ended up facing
charges reacted to a sting in his shop by trying to pay Osterberg
and another officer, Jennings said. Now, he's also facing bribery
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Osterberg said the vendors might be a little less brazen in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement used to be next to nothing and they were pretty
open about it all,'' Osterberg said. ``I don't think they'll be
quite as open anymore.'' &QL;

MINISTER HOPES TO KEEP DREAM ALIVE AT TEXAS SCHOOL

(Attn: Miss., Ind., and Chicago area) 
 
By PATTI MUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENDLETON, Texas _ When the Rev. J. Horace Germany launched a
college for black preachers in Union, Miss., in 1960, he was nearly
killed for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutal beating by thugs who wanted him and his black
students to leave, Germany, who is white, hid out in a hospital
attic with the help of sympathetic nuns and made his way to this
East Texas community in Fort Bend County revive his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Here he started Bay Ridge Christian College. Students _ mainly
young, black men _ came from around the nation and other countries.
Many went on to become pastors, Germany said.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 40 years, however, Germany _ now 84 and retired in
Covington, Ind. _ feared in recent times that his dream of
brotherhood and equality among races was dying along with Bay Ridge
Christian College, which was losing money and land nearly as
quickly as it was losing students.
</P>
<P>
   But like the recently planted roses and fresh landscaping around
campus, Bay Ridge is showing new signs of life and is poised to
become a resource and a leader in the surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived here three years ago, Bay Ridge was on the
respirator and hemorrhaging,'' said Dr. James L. Phillips, senior
associate dean and professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. ``There were questions about whether we could
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was elected board chairman this year at the college,
which is one of eight higher education institutions nationwide with
ministry programs for the Church of God.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the late 1800s, the Church of God is a Bible-based
religious movement headquartered in Anderson, Ind. Its membership
is reported at more than 220,000.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the first and most important step in getting Bay
Ridge back on its feet was putting the right leader in place _ a
step he said the board accomplished when it hired longtime educator
Verda Beach of Chicago about a year ago to become the school's new
president.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly an administrator with the City Colleges of Chicago
system, Beach grew up in the Church of God, where Germany was a
legend of sorts. Phillips also grew up in that church and remembers
as a youth hearing Germany speak.
</P>
<P>
   Beach and Phillips vowed that Bay Ridge will meet its
longstanding commitment to fulfill its founder's dream, and to
provide some sort of retirement benefits for him.
</P>
<P>
   Since he stepped down several years ago, his family says, he has
lived on a tiny income from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to enhance the great work he started,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in Indiana, Germany said he has special hopes for
the campus where he and his deceased wife, Janetta, reared four
children and where scores of young, poor black men were trained to
become leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they receive a basic education, but they also were
taught a living through training in agriculture, mechanics,
construction, welding, carpentry _ a host of practical occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful thing going,'' Germany said. ``We've got
pastors pastoring churches all over the country from that little
school. I put 44 years into it (including four years trying to get
started in Mississippi).
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows I want that school to go on so bad. It would make me
sick enough to die if it closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the school has fought its way back after
hurricanes, tornadoes and economic busts. When Germany wasn't
laboring on campus, he was flying around the country seeking
donations.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like to mix doubt with anything related to the
college, but his family's concern about his lack of retirement
benefits after years of near-volunteer work prompted him last
November to write to the then-chairman of the college board.
</P>
<P>
   His letter lamented the decisions by that board, some of whose
members are no longer in office, to sell real estate to pay for
operating expenses, to use property to secure loans and to raise
administrators' salaries. He also criticized the lack of
fund-raising and what he considered mismanagement of monies left to
the college.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, who has since remarried, asked that his family's campus
home, which he deeded to Bay Ridge in 1977, be returned to him. A
1981 resolution by the board guaranteed him and his deceased wife
lifetime use of the property and also set up a life annuity note of
$60,000 in appreciation for his years of sacrifice and service to
Bay Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 percent interest was payable on a monthly basis beginning
at Germany's retirement, according to the note, but Germany said it
never was paid regularly. His Social Security payments are minimal
because he never made more than $3,500 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's letter said he feared the school was ``no longer being
used as an instrument of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Holifield, a stepgrandson of Germany's and general counsel
to the family, said negotiations are continuing about setting up
some more substantial retirement benefits for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not getting any income,'' said Holifield, a law
clerk for a federal judge in Tyler, Texas. ``I think the last thing
he would ever want is for this to detract from the wonderful
accomplishments of Bay Ridge.''

KENDLETON, Texas: Bay Ridge.``
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, the rich history of Bay Ridge and its founder is making
its way into a nearly completed autobiography with Nashville
publisher Larry Arnett and Light of Day Publishing. ``Brotherhood
at Any Cost'' traces the roots of Bay Ridge in Mississippi, where
Germany faced death at the hands of Ku Klux Klansmen who had warned
him to get the black students out of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   New interest in the 1960 attack on Germany has been sparked by
the opening of the long-sealed Mississippi Sovereignty Commission
files in March. The commission is said to have been a state-run spy
agency designed to protect segregation, and its files may hold
clues to criminal acts during the turbulent 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett said there is interest from a Hollywood filmmaker in
making a movie about Germany's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horace Germany is a true believer,'' Arnett said. ``He's
real.''
</P>
<P>
   His on-campus home at Bay Ridge outside Kendleton, where he
raised bird dogs out back and held meetings in his spacious front
room, has remained unused since he left several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acknowledged many of the concerns Germany's letter
cited.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than $300,000 willed to Bay Ridge by Germany's
friends and supporters _ including several nuns he had developed
friendships with over the years _ was exhausted and the college has
nothing to show for it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous administrations basically didn't know how to
manage,'' Phillips said. ``Perhaps there were too many clergy on
the board. You have to have a wealth of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The board has been reduced from more than 30 members to 16,
Phillips said, and Beach has cut operating expenses significantly.
</P>
<P>
   She has spent her first year assessing the campus, improving the
facilities and working toward a fall enrollment of 25 _ a major
increase, considering that only one or two students were on campus
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beach said Bay Ridge should no longer be considered a school
just for black students. It is multicultural, she said, and has a
much broader role than just educating preachers.
</P>
<P>
   Society needs good Christians in all phases of life, she said,
and Bay Ridge will be a model for starting students down that path.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Ridge also is starting to take an active role in the
community, including becoming the library for Kendleton's nearly
600 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Beach is loaded with ideas on how to turn the campus into an
areawide resource. One idea is to turn Germany's former home into a
bed-and-breakfast inn for visitors to the college and to Kendleton,
where she serves on the economic development committee.
</P>
<P>
   She and Phillips are intent on finishing the campus gymnasium,
which has been under construction about 15 years. Just a decade
ago, Bay Ridge had a decent basketball team _ the Eagles _ and a
trophy case filled with honors still sits in the library. Beach
said Bay Ridge has a potential donor ready to finish the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Beach has overseen a host of physical improvements at Bay Ridge,
not the least of which was a repair job to the library roof and an
effort to dedicate hallways around campus to history, past
presidents and other topics. The hallways are packed with
portraits, stories and documents to trace the college's history.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Beach has accomplished more in one year than had
been accomplished in the previous 10. Both are excited about
another deal in the works to house up to 60 Houston-area youth in
campus dormitories. Designed for low-performing students or those
who have not adjusted to their schools, the program would involve
Bay Ridge students training in counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still master-planning the college,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Beach pledge that Germany has nothing to fear about
the future of Bay Ridge Christian College. It will survive, they
say, and without compromise.

FUNGI LOVERS PICK THEIR MUSHROOM FEASTS, CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Armed with a sharp knife and a wooden
basket, Marjorie Lutz stalks her quarry in the undergrowth on
Monument Hill in this city's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Birds twitter in the treetops overhead. The ground is a tangle
of roots and dappled shadows. Except for the broken glass and
crumpled potato chip bags underfoot, civilization could be miles
rather than blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   With sharp eyes trained downward, the 65-year-old resident of
nearby Voorheesville looks for the convoluted, brain-like head of
her prey: Morels, a mushroom that grows from mid-April to early May
around the base of elm, apple and ash trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have a fear of mushrooms because we haven't studied
them and we don't have a tradition of looking for them,'' said
Lutz, who has been gathering and eating wild fungi for more than
two decades. ``But they really can be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding edible mushrooms does not necessarily require a daylong
trek into the depths of the woods. Delectable specimens of fungi
can be found in a patch of suburban lawn, under a bush in an urban
park or even in a planter on the street. Morels, in particular,
Lutz said, grow well in ``trashy or burned-over places,'' more
frequently found amid development not in the wilderness. Foraging
for a few hours in public spaces, particularly parks, can turn up a
wide variety of mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fungi inhabit the whole Earth, not just the pristine forest,''
said John Haines, senior scientist and mycology expert with the
state Biological Survey and New York State Museum. ``Mushrooms grow
on city trees and in lawns and flower beds. There are certain
mushrooms that thrive in those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that wild mushrooms can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy can be avoided by being sure not to eat anything you
gather unless you're completely certain about what it is, Haines
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of toxins in poisonous mushrooms. Only one
has an antidote, Haines said, although others respond to early
treatment. There are more edible mushrooms than poisonous ones,
however.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of avid mushrooming, Lutz is an experienced
amateur mycologist. She first became interested when she was out
walking in Vermont with a European friend who picked a Puffball
mushroom and said she would take it home for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Lutz recalled. ``I asked her if she
was really going to eat that and she said, `Oh, yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she would die, but when I called her a few days
later, she was fine. Then I thought: `If she can do it, so can
I!'''
</P>
<P>
   Lutz started out very slowly, collecting every mushroom she
could find, taking it home to study, draw and identify. She thinks
Americans are afraid to eat wild mushrooms, in part, because of
``those stories'' about someone eating just a piece of one and
dropping dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the same stories told over and over and blown out
of proportion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lutz realizes even an experienced mushroomer must
be careful. She takes great pains to identify whatever she finds,
using a miniature magnifying glass to search for characteristics
that set one mushroom apart from another. She looks for a
fringe-like ``veil'' hanging off the edge of the cap, for example,
which not all fungi have, or ``gills'' on their undersides that are
either attached to the stem or not.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny weekday at Schenectady's Central Park, Lutz
spots her first mushroom growing in the grass several feet off a
paved path. Carefully, she pries the lone, buff-colored fungus from
the earth with her knife.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the all-important, yet difficult, task that must
precede eating the booty _ identification.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz notes the mushroom's traits on a small note card:
``Glaberous (which means the cap is almost sticky to the touch).
Thick, brownish, attached gills. Striated stem about one inch long.
A slight veil.'' After consulting the ``Audubon Society Field Guide
to North American Mushrooms'' (Alfred Knopf), which lists
characteristics of several thousand mushrooms and includes color
photographs of many of those, Lutz reaches a verdict: She's not
entirely sure what her find is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a Lawn Mowers Mushroom (Psathyrella
foenisecii). But there are so many similar to this type, that I'm
not sure. So, we won't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lutz wraps the mushroom in wax paper and places it
in her basket to take home for closer inspection. She then cleans
the knife by inserting it into the soil several times, and wipes
her hands on her jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming her search several hundred yards into the woods atop
Monument Hill, Lutz discovers a trove of what she identifies as the
Coprinus atramentarius, more commonly known as one of the ``Ink
cap'' family. The small, reddish-brown mushrooms are growing on and
around the base of a cottonwood tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Coprinus atramentarius are parasites that live on rotting
wood, and their presence can mean impending doom for the tree host.
However, these particular fungi are good to eat as long as they are
not consumed with alcohol, which can give some people a
stomachache. She harvests several bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz also finds some ``LBMs,'' or little brown mushrooms, in the
grass at Central Park, which she studiously avoids, saying that
they are almost always poisonous and not worthwhile for all but the
most amateur of fungi-hunters who are working on honing their
identification skills.
</P>
<P>
   There are no morels to be found in Central Park. Lutz is
disappointed because morels, with their delicate ``woodsy'' flavor,
are among her favorite of the edible wild fungi. But the
hollow-stemmed mushroom is elusive, Lutz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz does not despair. She knows local supermarkets and
specialty stores stock varieties of wild mushrooms that have become
fashionable and mainstream _ morels, chanterelles and oyster
mushrooms _ for the less adventurous of fungi lovers who may not
have time or the courage to forage for themselves.

<P>
   Whatever its duration and outcome, the Asian financial crisis
will be remembered for destroying the conventional wisdom that East
Asia's economies would prosper indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Still in question are the political lessons that Asians will
draw from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How much, for example, will political freedom be valued as a
necessary corollary to sound economic performance? Or will those
who argue that sound economic management is the political key prove
persuasive?
</P>
<P>
   And will a ``Confucian'' version of the discredited ``Asian
values'' thesis find adherents?
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began on July 2, 1997, when the Thai government
ceased wasting foreign reserves on a defense of the baht and
allowed it to fluctuate versus the dollar. The resulting ``managed
float'' immediately proved unmanageable. The baht's fall triggered
a regional currency and equity cascade.
</P>
<P>
   As it swept from Bangkok through Kuala Lumpur, Manila and
Jakarta to Seoul and Hong Kong, upbeat exponents of ``Asia
rising,'' ``the East Asian model,'' and an imminent ``Pacific
century'' barely had time to edit these phrases from their screens
and diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   A few early warnings had been sounded. The World Bank had
worried about trends in Thailand before July. And some skeptics,
such as the MIT economist Paul Krugman, had doubted that East
Asia's breakneck economic pace could be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most analysts were sanguine and slow to
reconsider. But in hindsight it is clear that for much of Asia,
1997 was an annus horribilis. The crisis appeared to have abated in
some countries earlier this year, notably Thailand and South Korea,
but it worsened in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy,
where President Suharto has finally been forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   These days most observers expect the crisis, or its aftershocks
at any rate, to endure into 1999 if not beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 five East Asian stock markets _ those of Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand _ lost more
than three-fifths of their value in dollars. Economic,
environmental and health problems due to Indonesia's prolonged
drought and forest fires compounded these shocks in maritime
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan's economy remained in doldrums that have lasted
seven years, longer than any other lapse in that country's growth
since World War II. As for China, financially hemorrhaging state
enterprises continue to threaten stability across the Middle
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of East Asia's crisis go beyond the region.
And they amount to more than the question the media keep asking:
``Who else will catch the Asian flu?''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the rupturing of optimism about East Asia
seems to tip the balance between the two most widely discussed
positions about the dynamics of power in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Asian financial crisis ravaged the
credibility of a supposedly distinctive East Asian, or Japanese,
model of economic growth based on cooperation between conglomerates
_ Japan's keiretsu, South Korea's chaebol, Indonesia's konglomerat
_ and astute government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing Asian markets revealed the crony capitalism beneath
the surface of East Asia's ``developmental state.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Asian crisis reduced the chances of a trans-Pacific
``clash of civilizations.'' Falling growth rates and mounting
losses in dollars jeopardized the resources and self-confidence
that leaders of the Asian world would need were they to challenge
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis damaged the Asian leg in the tripod model favored by
those who expected power after the Cold War to coalesce around
three regional blocs, each with its respective hinterland and hub:
East Asia fanning out from Tokyo, the Americas centered on
Washington, and Europe led from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head to head to head'' competition became less plausible as
the Asian head became less formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of this, American observers especially were prone to
believe that just as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 had
vindicated the American political model _ liberal democracy _ so
the fall of Asia's markets in 1997 proved the wisdom of the
American economic model _ free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is presumptuous to think that the crisis foretells Asian
acceptance of American ways _ that Americans can now truthfully
sing, ``We are the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, East Asia's diversity _ historical, cultural, political,
economic _ ensured that the crisis would affect each country
differently. And that has meant different explanations as to why
the trauma occurred and what still needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   For Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, to cite a vocal
example, anything-goes American capitalism was not the solution. It
was the problem. Blaming the crisis on arbitrageurs and hedge fund
managers such as American financier George Soros, Mahathir proposed
global controls on money trading that appalled Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The American model is hardly monolithic, and the issue of how to
resolve the Asian crisis has become contentious among Americans
themselves. On the same page of the Wall Street Journal, one expert
called for higher taxes and lower spending while another advised
the opposite. A third recommended doing nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Especially controversial have been the International Monetary
Fund's efforts to help resolve the crisis. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Laurence Summers, for instance, defends the IMF and its
prescriptions as crucial to Asia's recovery. But Harvard economist
Jeffrey Sachs claims it has made matters worse, while former
Secretary of State George Shultz recommends its abolition. Who can
say which of these men stands for the real American model?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Asians have been under mounting pressure to believe that
freer markets and freer politics could have prevented the crisis in
the first place, or at least mitigated its effects.
</P>
<P>
   As if the prescription of political freedom were a cure for East
Asia's economic ills, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung blames
the Asian crisis squarely on authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every country in Asia, including Korea,'' he has said,
``the major reason for (economic) failure was lack of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a comparison between South Korea and Singapore does not
confirm Kim's sweeping belief in lack of democracy as the major
reason for the economic setback in every country in Asia. For
example, in 1997-98 the value of South Korean stocks was set back
more in dollar terms than Singaporean equities, despite the greater
lack of political freedom in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In his own allocation of blame for the Asian crisis, Singapore's
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has suggested that what distinguishes
the unscathed from the damaged is not political democracy but good
governance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Singaporeans, Lee said, are not champions of human rights or
democracy, ``but we are very fastidious in the way in which we run
our business, and on financial matters we are completely
aboveboard.'' Lee also in effect acknowledged that not all ``Asian
values'' are constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the weaknesses of Confucianism,'' he noted, is
nepotism. The economies least able to resist the crisis are those
where nepotism _ ``the bane of East Asian countries,'' in his words
_ is most entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   But the views of Kim and Lee are more compatible than they first
appear. Electoral democracy can undermine good governance in the
absence of the rule of law. And good governance in a liberal
democracy requires public servants who are insulated from the
blandishments of special interests and the passions and whims of
momentary majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of East Asia are in a race to leave 1997 behind.
The leaders _ Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong _ are politically much
freer than Indonesia, the laggard. And in 1998 East Asia is
changing _ one hopes for the better _ but it is not Americanizing.
It is important for Americans to think realistically, not
wishfully, about the region.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly we may conclude that it is far too early to reinvent
the debunked East Asian miracle as any new parable about ``Asia
rising'' toward liberal democracy.

   Whatever its duration and outcome, the Asian financial crisis
will be remembered for destroying the conventional wisdom that East
Asia's economies would prosper indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Still in question are the political lessons that Asians will
draw from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How much, for example, will political freedom be valued as a
necessary corollary to sound economic performance? Or will those
who argue that sound economic management is the political key prove
persuasive?
</P>
<P>
   And will a ``Confucian'' version of the discredited ``Asian
values'' thesis find adherents?
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began on July 2, 1997, when the Thai government
ceased wasting foreign reserves on a defense of the baht and
allowed it to fluctuate versus the dollar. The resulting ``managed
float'' immediately proved unmanageable. The baht's fall triggered
a regional currency and equity cascade.
</P>
<P>
   As it swept from Bangkok through Kuala Lumpur, Manila and
Jakarta to Seoul and Hong Kong, upbeat exponents of ``Asia
rising,'' ``the East Asian model,'' and an imminent ``Pacific
century'' barely had time to edit these phrases from their screens

<P>
   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

<P>
   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

<P>
   To Americans, France is a beautiful country, home to that most
elegant of cities, Paris, the seductive tones of the French
language, and some of the world's finest wines, which makes it all
the more difficult for them to understand how such a charming
nation could be so irritating an ally.
</P>
<P>
   The French always seem to be opposing the United States on some
issue or other, whether it is in the realm of international
diplomacy, where between the lines of France's carefully worded
policy statements one can discern a distinct distaste for America's
oft-proclaimed sole-superpower status, or on matters of culture,
where France is always the first to denounce American ``cultural
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Franco-American friction has manifested itself most
visibly in the Persian Gulf, where France's interests _ in Iraq and
Iran _ seem to clash with America's security needs. Many Americans
ascribe France's prickliness to the legacy of ``Gaullism,'' the
conservative, nationalist inheritance bequeathed by that country's
greatest twentieth-century leader.
</P>
<P>
   But in France nobody even knows what Gaullism means anymore,
apart from being able to say no to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the annoying behavior coming out of Paris is best
explained by the fact that the country is, quite simply, in a bad
mood, unsure of its place and status in a new world. The less
confident France is, the more difficult it is to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century, France faces four major
challenges, which are together the source of its melancholy. The
first is globalization, which is often blamed for the erosion of
France's culture and its depressingly high levels of unemployment.
(Last year, one of Paris' biggest bestsellers was a tract titled
``The Economic Horror'' _ a bitter philippic against
globalization's ills.)
</P>
<P>
   The second is the unipolar nature of the international system,
in which the United States leads and a once-proud France is
grudgingly forced to follow. The third is the merger of Europe,
which threatens to drown out France's voice.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth, and by far the toughest, challenge is France itself.
The nation must overcome its economic, social, political, moral and
cultural shortcomings if it is to successfully face its other
challenges. The rise of Jean-Marie LePen's extreme right National
Front is symptomatic of France's internal difficulties. To combat
them, France must, in essence, transcend itself.
</P>
<P>
   France's special strengths are its culture and its heritage, and
these are being worn away, replaced by a ``universal culture'' that
looks strangely American.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, information technology and other trappings of the
global economy can reinforce the centrality of the United States or
multiply the strength of a small city-state such as Singapore, but
they often penalize middle-size countries like France.
</P>
<P>
   If France were a young state, less set in its ways, less
burdened by the weight of old traditions or images from the past,
it might be able to adapt. But France is an ancient country. It
cannot forget its history, and in trying to reconcile it with
elements of the modern world ends up merely superimposing it upon
them, creating a hodgepodge that is true to neither.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, France's most popular computer game today is not a
high-tech, outer space adventure, but a thriller called
``Versailles,'' which takes place amid the grandeur of the court of
Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the difference between France and the United States.
America is not only big and young; it is, above all, open. French
society remains closed and rigid _ incapable of attracting the best
talent from other countries while unwittingly supplying its own to
America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Luc Montagnier, codiscoverer of the AIDS virus,
now teaches and conducts research in the United States because he
reached mandatory retirement age at the Institut Pasteur.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the essential message of Hollywood _ if you want to
make a difference you can _ with the classical archetype of the
French movie: A loves B, who loves C, who loves D, all of whom end
up in despair.
</P>
<P>
   America's flexibility can be seen in the success of its melting
pot, which, in an age of globalization, is exported worldwide.
Today, the sounds of the world are essentially African-American,
everybody eats Italian-American pizza at least once a week, and
children the world over delight in films by an Eastern European,
Jewish American named Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   The American-accented brand of English is the closest thing we
have to a universal language, while the French, obsessed with
defending ``Francophonie'' and dreaming of a world united by their
tongue, erect protective linguistic barriers, not understanding
that this isolates them instead of preserving their culture.
</P>
<P>
   What France should seek to preserve _ once it has conceded
defeat in the language battle _ is the context and originality of
its message, not its medium.
</P>
<P>
   France's struggle with globalization is complicated by its
people's high quality of life. Most of the French feel they have
little to gain and much to lose from globalization _ the space and
beautiful diversity of their countryside, the quality of their food
and wine, and the respect for tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Why risk all these unique pleasures for the sake of an uncertain
competition in a global world? The temptation for many Frenchmen is
to retreat into the protective bubble of the good life.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War only reinforced French envy of America.
They resent the global reach of America's power and Washington's
presumption to speak in the name of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the pragmatic British or the historically guilt-ridden
Germans, the French feel that they, like the United States, carry a
universal message. Remember that France, like the United States, is
the font of ideas about ``the rights of man,'' liberty, equality
and fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   French frustrations are exacerbated by the mixture of benign
neglect, sheer indifference, and mild irritation with which
Washington considers Paris' initiatives. In the absence of the
unifying threat posed by the Soviet Union, Franco-American tensions
can be eased only by shared interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, France's jealousy of America will be muted by
the political constraints imposed on it by a united Europe, the
other members of which do not share France's feelings. The French
know all too well that their secret dream _ to build a Europe that
will challenge the United States _ is the nightmare of their
continental partners.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe's attempt to transcend its fratricidal
quarrels by integrating its resources, economies, currencies and
political institutions will serve it well in the global era.
Regionalization is the best way to meet the challenges of
globalization, because it makes states bigger, and bigger is
better.
</P>
<P>
   But globalization reinforces the likelihood of fragmentation.
Today, the need to express one's difference in a global world leads
to a desperate search for identity that can end in peaceful divorce
between some nation-states and jingoistic tensions and bloody
conflicts between others.
</P>
<P>
   France is a perfect example of this identity dilemma. For
decades the French have oscillated between celebrating their
exceptionalism and proclaiming its end. Today France is torn more
than ever between the desire to be a modern, normal country and the
reflex to cling to the belief that France is not like other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The first choice presupposes openness, flexibility and a secure
sense of one's identity. The second opposes globalization, is wary
of a more unified Europe and embraces anti-Americanism. But the
second choice is no choice at all; protectionism would lead to
isolation and decay.
</P>
<P>
   France is probably sicker politically than is generally thought.
The fact that large numbers of the French have thrown their support
behind LePen's National Front, which is highly represented in the
country's regional assemblies, indicates that the people of France
have reached the end of their tether.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by despair over their country's high unemployment rate
and declining importance in the world, they have begun to cast
their lot with the exceptionalists, in a wistful but dangerous
attempt to recapture France's past glory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the weaknesses, there is hope for France. It has
surmounted crises worse than this current crisis of confidence. Its
long history will ultimately guarantee its stability.
</P>
<P>
   The land of Libert, Egalit, Fraternit will not soon cede all of
that for an imaginary kingdom of French supremacy, for its citizens
know the despair that would bring. The French will come to realize
that globalization, that most feared bogeyman on the streets of
Paris, will not bring France's demise but rather force it to hone
its skills and refurbish its message.
</P>
<P>
   A more unified Europe will not smother it but in fact give it
new purpose, allowing it to determine its own destiny in the world
far better than it could do alone.
</P>
<P>
   The depression will subside. In the end, France will endure.

other members of which do not share France's feelings. The French
know all too well that their secret dream _ to build a Europe that
will challenge the United States _ is the nightmare of their
continental partners.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe's attempt to transcend its fratricidal
quarrels by integrating its resources, economies, currencies and
political institutions will serve it well in the global era.
Regionalization is the best way to meet the challenges of
globalization, because it makes states bigger, and bigger is
better.
</P>
<P>
   But globalization reinforces the likelihood of fragmentation.
Today, the need to express one's difference in a global world leads
to a desperate search for identity that can end in peaceful divorce
between some nation-states and jingoistic tensions and bloody
conflicts between others.
</P>
<P>
   France is a perfect example of this identity dilemma. For
decades the French have oscillated between celebrating their
exceptionalism and proclaiming its end. Today France is torn more
than ever between the desire to be a modern, normal country and the
reflex to cling to the belief that France is not like other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The first choice presupposes openness, flexibility and a secure
sense of one's identity. The second opposes globalization, is wary
of a more unified Europe and embraces anti-Americanism. But the
second choice is no choice at all; protectionism would lead to
isolation and decay.
</P>
<P>
   France is probably sicker politically than is generally thought.
The fact that large numbers of the French have thrown their support
behind LePen's National Front, which is highly represented in the
country's regional assemblies, indicates that the people of France
have reached the end of their tether.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by despair over their country's high unemployment rate
and declining importance in the world, they have begun to cast
their lot with the exceptionalists, in a wistful but dangerous
attempt to recapture France's past glory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the weaknesses, there is hope for France. It has
surmounted crises worse than this current crisis of confidence. Its
long history will ultimately guarantee its stability.
</P>
<P>
   The land of Libert, Egalit, Fraternit will not soon cede all of
that for an imaginary kingdom of French supremacy, for its citizens
know the despair that would bring. The French will come to realize
that globalization, that most feared bogeyman on the streets of
Paris, will not bring France's demise but rather force it to hone
its skills and refurbish its message.
</P>
<P>
   A more unified Europe will not smother it but in fact give it
new purpose, allowing it to determine its own destiny in the world
far better than it could do alone.
</P>
<P>
   The depression will subside. In the end, France will endure.

<P>
   Russia faces a watershed decision. The vital question for Russia
is whether it will become a quasi-democratic oligarchy with
corporatist, criminal characteristics or take the more difficult,
painful road to becoming a normal, Western-style democracy with a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Communism is no longer an option. That was settled in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Russians will make this fateful choice and be its principal
victims or beneficiaries. But its consequences to Americans,
Europeans and others who share this shrinking globe should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the widespread view in the United States that Russia
is essentially irrelevant or of secondary concern, our continental
country, stretching from Eastern Europe to upper Asia, will be
important in the next century because of its location between east
and west, its possession of weapons of mass destruction, its
natural resources and its potential as a consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous choices in recent Russian history, the decision
will not be made on a single day by a coup or an election. Rather,
it will evolve through the many decisions made by Russia's millions
of people, leaders and ordinary citizens alike, over the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Boris Yeltsin's sacking of much of his cabinet in
March, while deeply disturbing, was one more bump along the road,
not the end of the journey. Nevertheless, the route chosen will be
no less important than the choices made earlier in the decade in
its effect on the society in which our children and grandchildren
live.
</P>
<P>
   Corporatist states, marked by high-level criminality but bearing
the trappings of democracy, differ more than is sometimes
recognized from Western-style market democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Their markets are driven by oligarchs whose highest goal is
increasing their personal wealth. Freedom of the press and other
civil liberties are suppressed. Laws are frequently ignored or
suspended and constitutions obeyed only when convenient. Corruption
is rife from the streets to the halls of power. Personalities,
contacts, and clans count for more than institutions and laws.
</P>
<P>
   For examples, one need only reflect on the unhappy experiences
of many Latin American countries in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, in Western-style democracies, markets are driven
by the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Government economic policies are intended to serve the nation,
not those in power. Through hard work, citizens can succeed.
Personal freedom is universally respected, including the right to
express opinions that differ from those of the government. Civilian
rule is unchallenged. Corruption is normally minimal and its spread
swiftly checked. Laws and constitutions are respected by both
government leaders and citizens. The contrast with oligarchy is
stark.
</P>
<P>
   Today Moscow is a boomtown. Some of the newly established and
privatized corporations that operate with international mentalities
and ambitions are making their way to the top. Certain regions of
the country have received favorable international credit ratings,
and a handful of Russian companies have held successful
international bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are now ready to adapt to the new market system and
steer clear of crime as the country develops new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, while occasionally delaying tranches of its $10 billion
loan because of poor tax collection, always seems to reinstate them
after promises by senior Russian officials to do better. All this
seemingly points toward the path of a normalized Western market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But while Russia has its economic success stories, many aspects
of the economy suggest that it is moving toward a corporatist
market in which corruption is rampant. The most important of these
trends is the rise of the Russian oligarchs, who have created a
form of robber-baron capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Far from creating an open market, Russia has consolidated a
semi-criminal oligarchy that was already largely in place under the
old Soviet system. After communism's collapse, it merely changed
its appearance, just as a snake sheds its skin.
</P>
<P>
   The new ruling elite is neither democratic nor communist,
neither conservative nor liberal _ merely rapaciously greedy. In an
interview published in the Financial Times in November 1996, one
Russian tycoon claimed that the country's seven largest bankers,
who became the core of Yeltsin's reelection campaign, controlled
more than half the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that these nomenklatura capitalists have had a
profound impact on the Russian economy, but their market of insider
deals and political connections stands in the way of an open
economy that would benefit all Russian citizens. The robber-baron
market cannot tackle important social and economic questions. It is
primarily concerned with issues that affect its masters' short-term
power and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   At recent debates at Harvard University's U.S.-Russian
Investment Symposium and at the Davos World Economic Forum, Western
investors sharply criticized the robber-baron mentality of many
Russian business leaders and the process of privatization under
former Deputy Premier Anatoly Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   As George Soros put it, first ``the assets of the state were
stolen, and then when the state itself became valuable as a source
of legitimacy, it too was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a country with nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons should not be allowed to slip into the chaos of rule by
semi-criminal, corporate, oligarchic robber barons. Unfortunately,
those who believe that the capitalism of the robber barons will
eventually give way to a market economy that benefits all in
society, as occurred in the United States at the turn of the
century, are mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   America had an established middle class with a work ethic and a
government that remained largely free of robber-baron infiltration.
The American tycoons were still investing in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's robber barons are stifling their homeland's economic
growth by stealing from Russia and investing abroad. In the late
1990s, Russia has no emerging middle class, and the oligarchy,
which is deeply involved in the government, can alter policy for
its private benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, while the big boys _ they are all men _ fight
over an ever larger piece of the Russian economic pie, the
government has been unable to create economic conditions in which
the majority of Russians can thrive. The problem is not only that
the majority of Russians remain worse off than before the economic
transition began, but that they cannot become better off.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is stagnating at half its 1989 level. Real incomes
have fallen by a third, and living standards in most regions have
deteriorated to levels not seen in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Government attempts to curb inflation resulted not only in
tremendous wage and pension arrears, but also in the government's
inability to pay its bills for the goods and services it consumed.
This led to total disarray in payments, with up to 75 percent of
goods and services either paid in kind, or by promissory notes that
cannot be cashed, or transacted through illegal channels to dodge
taxes entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, government pensions and wages were cut to 40
percent or less of their original value, and the government still
cannot collect enough taxes to cover these expenses. Tax receipts
have fallen to less than 20 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, external debt has skyrocketed, and domestic debt,
which was next to nothing just a decade ago, has reached almost 15
percent of GDP. Servicing these debts, paid out to local bankers
and foreign speculators at exorbitant interest rates, will take no
less than 25 percent of total government expenditure in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The current Russian market economy has created a handful of
super-wealthy individuals while leaving the rest behind to
struggle. It is no wonder that these economic policies resulted in
some 250 communists and 50 ultranationalist Zhirinovskyites being
elected to the 450-seat State Duma in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Russia is bedeviled by a corruption problem
reminiscent of Latin America's in the 1970s and 1980s. The European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development ranks Russia as the most
corrupt major economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Graft permeates the country, from street crime to mafia hits to
illegal book deals in Kremlin corridors to rigged bids for stakes
of privatized companies. Recent polls by the Public Opinion
Foundation show that Russians believe the best way to get ahead is
through contacts and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to select criteria needed to become wealthy in
today's Russia, 88 percent picked connections and 76 percent chose
dishonesty. Only 39 percent said hard work. Anyone who attempts to
start a small business in Russia will encounter extortion demands
from the mafia, so there is no incentive for entrepreneurship.
Better to stay home and grow potatoes at your dacha.
</P>
<P>
   A crime-ridden market cannot be effective. With no certainty
about the future, with or without inflation, nobody will invest.
Such a market can support the current level of consumption _ which
for the majority of the population means semi-pauperhood _ for some
time, but it does not and cannot provide any progress.
</P>
<P>
   With such problems, despite the good news about the Russian
economy over the last year, it is clear that the Russian market is
still veering toward the corporatist, criminalist, oligarchic path.

   Russia's current democratic institutions deserve a mixed review.
Certainly there are reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are freer than at any time in their history. They can
now read what they like, travel, talk, worship and assemble.
Russia's citizens have quickly grown accustomed to these liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances such as the Internet, fax machines, and
mobile phones will make it impossible for any one source ever to
monopolize information in Russia again.
</P>
<P>
   Through this continuous contact with the world, with each
passing day, Russia becomes a more normalized society.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most often cited examples of successful Russian
democracy are the Russian elections. Over the past three years,
elections have become an accepted part of Russian life. This was
hardly always the case. A mere three years ago, debate raged in
Russia as to whether the ruling authorities would even allow
elections to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But from the December 1995 Duma elections to the June 1996
presidential race to the subsequent gubernatorial and regional
legislature elections, again and again elections have been
successfully held in the Russian Federation. In many of those
contests, notably the Duma election and some regional gubernatorial
races, opposition candidates from the communist and other parties
have won and taken office.
</P>
<P>
   With minor exceptions, voting and ballot counting have been
peaceful and relatively free, while voter turnout has been higher
than that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent elections are a positive development in the
creation of Russian democratic institutions, some disturbing trends
point to trouble in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While international observers have cited Russian balloting as
free and fair, Russian campaigns _ most notably the 1996
presidential election _ have been notoriously unfair. Spending
limits are routinely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   While no actual figures have been disclosed, the 1996 Yeltsin
presidential campaign is estimated to have cost at least $500
million. Some put it at an even $1 billion. (By comparison, Bill
Clinton's primary and general election campaigns that year together
cost $113 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russian presidential campaigns could spend only $2.9
million, but Yeltsin's overspending neither elicited a major outcry
nor started judicial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more disturbing is the often cited European
Institute on the Media survey that documents the media's flagrant
pro-Yeltsin bias. According to the EIM, Yeltsin enjoyed 53 percent
of all media coverage, while his closest competitor, Gennady
Zyuganov of the Communist Party, received only 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appeared on television more than all the other
candidates combined. Moreover, election coverage was extremely
slanted in the president's favor. Giving candidates a point for
each positive story and subtracting a point for each negative one,
Yeltsin scored +492 before the first round of the election;
Zyuganov earned -313. In the second round, Yeltsin had +247 to
Zyuganov's -240, despite the fact that Yeltsin disappeared from the
public eye a week before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral politics, like much else in Russia, are also at a fork
in the road. As Russian political consultants learn more tricks of
the trade, the danger increases that they might join with the
robber barons to try to turn future Russian elections into nothing
but window dressing for irremovable oligarchic rule _ as was the
case in the Soviet Union, where results were predetermined and the
people were an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's democratic institutions have not developed as fully as
its elections. As the recent cabinet firings show, the system of
checks and balances is underdeveloped, leaving the country prone to
the whims of a mercurial chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law is often not respected. The judicial branch of
government remains overly influenced by the executive branch. The
lower house of parliament has made some headway in becoming more
than a mere talking chamber in which the occasional fistfight
breaks out, and the executive branch now has to lobby the Duma to
pass the budget, the Start II treaty, and other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin and his team still reserve the option of bypassing
the Duma altogether _ thereby ignoring the constitution _ if the
Duma disagrees with an executive initiative or is unwilling to be
co-opted by promises of some new monthly leadership meeting with
the president and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy is routinely applied to the budget, where
compromises are made to ensure passage and are then ignored
throughout the year. Another example is the persistent rumor that
Yeltsin will seek an unconstitutional third term as president.
</P>
<P>
   No successful democracy functions without some kind of political
party system, but attempts to develop such a system in Russia have
been an unambiguous disappointment. Although political factions
boasting varying degrees of regional activity exist within the
Duma, a true functioning political party system in Russia has yet
to develop, for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, after 70 years of ``party rule,'' Russians are
understandably skeptical of political parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, President Yeltsin's actions have actively undermined
the development of a political party system. By rejecting any party
affiliation, the president acts as if parties and party development
are an afterthought in the consolidation of Russian democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin accepts the assistance of like-minded parties when it is
politically convenient and distances himself from them when it is
not. So no party is the true party of the government, and Yeltsin
cannot be held accountable to the people short of a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, for political reasons, Yeltsin sought in the past to
limit the development of parties by trying to abolish the ``party
list'' system that elects half the Duma, seating only parties that
win over five percent of the popular vote. In 1995, only four
parties did so, and over half of the Duma seats went to parties
opposed to the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
   The list system ensures that parties will exist in some part of
Russian society, but in 1998, Yeltsin renewed his call to change
it. To better control the Duma, he advocates having the entire
chamber elected from regional districts, similar to the system used
in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With more control over local leaders, Yeltsin believes he can
influence who wins these Duma seats. In reality, however, organized
crime would buy many of the seats. If Yeltsin succeeds in
abolishing the party-list system, he will destroy the only arena in
Russian society where parties currently exist without minimizing a
major source of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy would hurt Yeltsin politically, but even worse,
it would damage Russian democracy, which needs a functioning party
system to allow people to express their views to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media also earns a mixed review. On the one hand,
Russians have a variety of news sources from which to choose.
Opposition newspapers exist, and journalists are free to do
investigative reporting and write their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The November book payment scandal, where senior members of
Yeltsin's economic team were revealed to have accepted $500,000 for
writing a book on privatization, first broke in the Russian media.
Political leaders appear on TV programs like ``Hero of the Day''
and ``Itogi'' to explain their views to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in the past two years the media has become entirely
controlled by the oligarchs, who are part of the government and use
their editorial boards and programmers to promote their own selfish
agendas. Nowhere was this more evident than in last summer's
corrupt bidding process to privatize the Svyazinvest
telecommunications giant, where the resulting ``bankers' war'' was
played out in the media.
</P>
<P>
   By reading a certain paper or watching a certain television
station, a Russian citizen got either one or another robber baron's
version of the truth. Depressingly, the Russian service of Radio
Free Europe-Radio Liberty remains Russia's primary supplier of
impartial news, just as it was in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Russian democracy still has a long way to go. True,
elections are held, freedoms are respected, parties exist, and the
media express divergent views. Indeed, Russia is better off with
its imperfect institutions than without them, but they do not yet
properly reflect the people's needs and will.

   Russia's current democratic institutions deserve a mixed review.
Certainly there are reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are freer than at any time in their history. They can
now read what they like, travel, talk, worship and assemble.
Russia's citizens have quickly grown accustomed to these liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances such as the Internet, fax machines, and
mobile phones will make it impossible for any one source ever to
monopolize information in Russia again.
</P>
<P>
   Through this continuous contact with the world, with each
passing day, Russia becomes a more normalized society.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most often cited examples of successful Russian
democracy are the Russian elections. Over the past three years,
elections have become an accepted part of Russian life. This was
hardly always the case. A mere three years ago, debate raged in
Russia as to whether the ruling authorities would even allow
elections to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But from the December 1995 Duma elections to the June 1996
presidential race to the subsequent gubernatorial and regional

<P>
   In October 1996, Vladimir Nechai, the director of a nuclear
complex near the Ural city of Chelyabinsk, killed himself because
he lacked the money to pay his employees and could no longer ensure
the safety of his plant's operations.
</P>
<P>
   His suicide underscored the most serious threat to all players
in the post-Cold War world: loss of control of the Soviet arsenal
of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing risks of chaos in a nuclear power are also
evident in the rumors of nuclear smuggling. Russia has thousands of
tons of nuclear, chemical and biological material. Under the rule
of a corrupt oligarchy, uranium and anthrax could become black
market commodities available to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The control of Russia's weapons of mass destruction is an issue
of world safety that cannot be ignored by Russia or the West.
</P>
<P>
   A Western-style democracy in Russia would be a partner with the
West in confronting the challenges of the 21st century. Russia and
the West would work together better to maintain control over
weapons of mass destruction and would be more likely to cooperate
in containing regional conflict in explosive areas like the
Caucasus and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law would govern business relations and allow for
economic development and growth beneficial for both societies.
</P>
<P>
   What path will Russia take? Its choice will be heavily
influenced by the West. Unfortunately, up to this point, the West
has not always promoted the correct path.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the West's insistence on promoting personalities
rather than institutions hinders Russia from making wise decisions
about its future. The West plays favorites _ and I recognize that I
am one of them _ even though I am not in power. The danger comes
when the West, while promoting the rhetoric of democracy and
capitalism, backs Boris Yeltsin, Anatoly Chubais, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Boris Nemtsov and Yegor Gaidar even when they embark
on actions that do not promote democracy or markets.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin ordered tanks to fire at the Russian parliament,
the West supported him, as it did _ at least publicly _ when he
ordered the army to start the war in Chechnya. That led most
Russians to believe that had Yeltsin canceled the presidential
election in 1996, the West would have backed his choice, despite
the fact that the decision would have ended Russia's nascent
democratic experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The West is also giving rise to bitter resentment in the debate
over NATO expansion. Talk that this is a different NATO, a NATO
that is no longer a military alliance, is ridiculous. It is like
saying that the hulking thing advancing toward your garden is not a
tank because it is painted pink, carries flowers, and plays
cheerful music. It does not matter how you dress it up; a pink tank
is still a tank.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, the most important message of NATO expansion,
however, is that the political leaders of Western Europe and the
United States do not believe that Russia can become a real
Western-style democracy within the next decade or so. In their
eyes, Russia, because of its history, is a second-class democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is understandable. The combination of Chechnya (an
arbitrary war in which Russia unnecessarily killed 100,000 people),
the collapse of the Russian army, failed economic reforms, a
semi-criminal government, and Yeltsin's unpredictability has given
the West enough justification to conclude that Russia, for the time
being, cannot be a dependable partner and that NATO expansion
should therefore continue.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if the United States explained its push for NATO
expansion in these terms to the Russian people, they would at least
understand why the alliance is expanding and respect the West for
its honesty.
</P>
<P>
   But when the West says to Russians: ``Russian democracy is fine,
Russian markets are fine, Russia's relationship with the West is
fine, and therefore NATO is expanding to Russia's borders,'' the
logic does not work, leaving the Russian people and their leaders
bewildered and bitter. This resentment will only be exacerbated if
the West continues its two-faced policy.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? A Russia that works for its citizens and
plays a constructive role in world politics will be a Russia that
has chosen well. To achieve such an outcome, a new set of rules
must be established.
</P>
<P>
   The most important step is to separate business from political
power in order to fight corruption. There must be a decisive break
with the legacy of the past, when administrative power stood above
the law. Individual businesses should be regulated by legislation,
not by government officials or local barons who are often not
easily distinguishable from gang leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The power of oil and gas tycoons, who generate huge profits
using the country's natural resources, must be curtailed. They
should be made accountable to parliament, and their activities
should be made transparent and subject to public control.
</P>
<P>
   The present system of economic management, where most large
enterprises are run by insiders who disregard the owners' rights,
must be radically reformed. ``Collective'' enterprises, whose
management styles and responsibilities smack of the Soviet era,
should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, the government must encourage responsible
management based on a conception of private property that ensures
and protects the owner's rights. Bankruptcy laws should be fully
enforced to help eliminate incompetent managers, crooks, and
Soviet-style directors who are unable to adapt to market realities.
Enterprises that hold on to workers and produce nothing but debts
should be closed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Open accounting that meets international standards is a
prerequisite to controlling corruption. Also required is a strong,
independent, and incorruptible judiciary that will hold crooked
officials accountable. For easier oversight, senior government
officials should sign a declaration of income, property, and
expenses for themselves and their families twice a year for review
by the independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The law making Duma members immune from prosecution should be
immediately repealed. The large number of criminals running for
Duma seats to gain immunity is repulsive. How can a legislature
fight corruption when its members have their own deals on the side?
</P>
<P>
   Free competition must be promoted by encouraging small and
medium-sized businesses and by removing the red tape and excessive
regulation that stands in their way. Former Soviet monopolies
should be destroyed to eliminate domination by a small group of
large companies that account for half the country's GDP while
employing only three percent of its labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Land reform is also essential, since there can be no stable
development in the agricultural sector until the major part of the
country's land is taken from hands of the oligarchic landlords who
``inherited'' it from the Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both power and financial resources must be
decentralized. Russia will be doomed to instability and
underdevelopment as long as 85 percent of the nation's money
remains concentrated in Moscow. Local initiatives and
entrepreneurship should be encouraged if the fruits of economic
growth are to be shared among Russia's numerous regional, social,
and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that an established middle class emerges, an open
market economy must appear based on private property and
competition. Unregulated prices, low inflation rates, and a stable
currency are absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, however, these are not sufficient conditions for a
competitive economy. Lower and simpler taxes, fiscal controls on
oligarchs' incomes from the use of natural resources, incentives
for entrepreneurship, a trustworthy news service, an independent
judiciary and fully developed political parties are also
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the West should hold those in power in Russia
accountable for undemocratic deeds, in much the same way as it is
willing to criticize its allies. Western leaders should apply to
Russia the same criteria for evaluating the health of its democracy
and the strength of its market economy that they apply to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The West should not give Russia advice it is not willing to take
itself. This is especially important because, in the 21st century,
competition will occur between civilizations and not countries.
Although Russia and the West have different histories, they belong
to the same civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The old rivalries need not endure _ if Russia chooses wisely.

<P>
   In October 1996, Vladimir Nechai, the director of a nuclear
complex near the Ural city of Chelyabinsk, killed himself because
he lacked the money to pay his employees and could no longer ensure
the safety of his plant's operations.
</P>
<P>
   His suicide underscored the most serious threat to all players
in the post-Cold War world: loss of control of the Soviet arsenal
of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing risks of chaos in a nuclear power are also
evident in the rumors of nuclear smuggling. Russia has thousands of
tons of nuclear, chemical and biological material. Under the rule
of a corrupt oligarchy, uranium and anthrax could become black
market commodities available to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The control of Russia's weapons of mass destruction is an issue
of world safety that cannot be ignored by Russia or the West.
</P>
<P>
   A Western-style democracy in Russia would be a partner with the
West in confronting the challenges of the 21st century. Russia and
the West would work together better to maintain control over
weapons of mass destruction and would be more likely to cooperate
in containing regional conflict in explosive areas like the
Caucasus and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law would govern business relations and allow for
economic development and growth beneficial for both societies.
</P>
<P>
   What path will Russia take? Its choice will be heavily
influenced by the West. Unfortunately, up to this point, the West
has not always promoted the correct path.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the West's insistence on promoting personalities
rather than institutions hinders Russia from making wise decisions
about its future. The West plays favorites _ and I recognize that I
am one of them _ even though I am not in power. The danger comes
when the West, while promoting the rhetoric of democracy and
capitalism, backs Boris Yeltsin, Anatoly Chubais, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Boris Nemtsov and Yegor Gaidar even when they embark
on actions that do not promote democracy or markets.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin ordered tanks to fire at the Russian parliament,
the West supported him, as it did _ at least publicly _ when he
ordered the army to start the war in Chechnya. That led most
Russians to believe that had Yeltsin canceled the presidential
election in 1996, the West would have backed his choice, despite
the fact that the decision would have ended Russia's nascent
democratic experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The West is also giving rise to bitter resentment in the debate
over NATO expansion. Talk that this is a different NATO, a NATO
that is no longer a military alliance, is ridiculous. It is like
saying that the hulking thing advancing toward your garden is not a
tank because it is painted pink, carries flowers, and plays
cheerful music. It does not matter how you dress it up; a pink tank
is still a tank.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, the most important message of NATO expansion,
however, is that the political leaders of Western Europe and the
United States do not believe that Russia can become a real
Western-style democracy within the next decade or so. In their
eyes, Russia, because of its history, is a second-class democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is understandable. The combination of Chechnya (an
arbitrary war in which Russia unnecessarily killed 100,000 people),
the collapse of the Russian army, failed economic reforms, a
semi-criminal government, and Yeltsin's unpredictability has given
the West enough justification to conclude that Russia, for the time
being, cannot be a dependable partner and that NATO expansion
should therefore continue.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if the United States explained its push for NATO
expansion in these terms to the Russian people, they would at least
understand why the alliance is expanding and respect the West for
its honesty.
</P>
<P>
   But when the West says to Russians: ``Russian democracy is fine,
Russian markets are fine, Russia's relationship with the West is
fine, and therefore NATO is expanding to Russia's borders,'' the
logic does not work, leaving the Russian people and their leaders
bewildered and bitter. This resentment will only be exacerbated if
the West continues its two-faced policy.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? A Russia that works for its citizens and
plays a constructive role in world politics will be a Russia that
has chosen well. To achieve such an outcome, a new set of rules
must be established.
</P>
<P>
   The most important step is to separate business from political
power in order to fight corruption. There must be a decisive break
with the legacy of the past, when administrative power stood above
the law. Individual businesses should be regulated by legislation,
not by government officials or local barons who are often not
easily distinguishable from gang leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The power of oil and gas tycoons, who generate huge profits
using the country's natural resources, must be curtailed. They
should be made accountable to parliament, and their activities
should be made transparent and subject to public control.
</P>
<P>
   The present system of economic management, where most large
enterprises are run by insiders who disregard the owners' rights,
must be radically reformed. ``Collective'' enterprises, whose
management styles and responsibilities smack of the Soviet era,
should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, the government must encourage responsible
management based on a conception of private property that ensures
and protects the owner's rights. Bankruptcy laws should be fully
enforced to help eliminate incompetent managers, crooks, and
Soviet-style directors who are unable to adapt to market realities.
Enterprises that hold on to workers and produce nothing but debts
should be closed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Open accounting that meets international standards is a
prerequisite to controlling corruption. Also required is a strong,
independent, and incorruptible judiciary that will hold crooked
officials accountable. For easier oversight, senior government
officials should sign a declaration of income, property, and
expenses for themselves and their families twice a year for review
by the independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The law making Duma members immune from prosecution should be
immediately repealed. The large number of criminals running for
Duma seats to gain immunity is repulsive. How can a legislature
fight corruption when its members have their own deals on the side?
</P>
<P>
   Free competition must be promoted by encouraging small and
medium-sized businesses and by removing the red tape and excessive
regulation that stands in their way. Former Soviet monopolies
should be destroyed to eliminate domination by a small group of
large companies that account for half the country's GDP while
employing only three percent of its labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Land reform is also essential, since there can be no stable
development in the agricultural sector until the major part of the
country's land is taken from hands of the oligarchic landlords who
``inherited'' it from the Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both power and financial resources must be
decentralized. Russia will be doomed to instability and
underdevelopment as long as 85 percent of the nation's money
remains concentrated in Moscow. Local initiatives and
entrepreneurship should be encouraged if the fruits of economic
growth are to be shared among Russia's numerous regional, social,
and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that an established middle class emerges, an open
market economy must appear based on private property and
competition. Unregulated prices, low inflation rates, and a stable
currency are absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, however, these are not sufficient conditions for a
competitive economy. Lower and simpler taxes, fiscal controls on
oligarchs' incomes from the use of natural resources, incentives
for entrepreneurship, a trustworthy news service, an independent
judiciary and fully developed political parties are also
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the West should hold those in power in Russia
accountable for undemocratic deeds, in much the same way as it is
willing to criticize its allies. Western leaders should apply to
Russia the same criteria for evaluating the health of its democracy
and the strength of its market economy that they apply to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The West should not give Russia advice it is not willing to take
itself. This is especially important because, in the 21st century,
competition will occur between civilizations and not countries.
Although Russia and the West have different histories, they belong
to the same civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The old rivalries need not endure _ if Russia chooses wisely.

 By DOUGLAS FOSTER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Jerry Brown teeters atop a table in an oakland cafe, his arms
akimbo like a jack-in-the-box. Surprise, it's me! It's early on a
Saturday morning, and droopy-eyed customers drift past him,
bellying up to the counter. But Brown won't be ignored.
 &HT;    ``Oakland has been on the verge of greatness for so long, it's
time to push it past the verge!'' he shouts as the black table
wobbles beneath him.
 &HT;    The cafe, called Brewberry's, is wedged between storefronts in
the city's working-class Laurel District, one of the most
integrated neighborhoods in one of the most diverse cities in the
country. Down the street are Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church,
Sun Sun Alterations and La Ultima Restaurant. Inside the coffee
shop, Brown, dressed in a black collarless shirt and black Gap
pants _ denounces the power of moneyed interests in politics and
``the old boys network.''
 &HT;    It's vintage Brown rhetoric. This time, however, the ``old
boys'' targeted by Brown are the blacks and Latinos who run
Oakland's City Hall.
 &HT;    A woman in stretch pants finally speaks up, asking him, ``Why do
you want the job?'' Brown leans toward her and shoots back,
``Because it will be a major contribution to political life in the
whole country.''
 &HT;    He promises to limit the influence of lobbyists, generate ``full
citizen participation'' in local government, enforce ``zero
tolerance for crime,'' improve the schools, stimulate development,
even spark a ``revitalized cultural life.'' Brown rhapsodizes about
``the power of ideas,'' then asks, ``Anybody want to offer an
idea?''
 &HT;    When no one steps forward, he promptly fills the void. ``Ideas
have to be tested in the crucible of reality,'' he exclaims.
``Oakland is the crucible of reality!''
 &HT;    Why does Brown want to be mayor of a largely nonwhite city of
just 388,000 people in which the post is a relatively weak one?
Since Oakland is known more for the size of its underclass (and its
embrace of Ebonics) than for the stature of its political leaders,
many observers have sneered that the mayor's office here is beneath
Brown.
 &HT;    But the pundits have it wrong. In Oakland, crime is down,
employment is up and there are signs of a long-delayed economic
boom _ creating the possibility of a showcase turnaround. Moreover,
at 60, how many more times can he mount unsuccessful bids for the
presidency? Following years of high-flying talk _ he has even been
a radio chat-show host lately _ Brown seems to want to ground
himself, at last, in Oakland.
 &HT;    If it's clear why Brown wants to be mayor, the motivations of
Oakland voters are murkier. Brown is almost always met with a mix
of familiarity and perplexity, the kind of reaction Mario Cuomo
might encounter if he decided to run for mayor of Poughkeepsie. In
front of Brewberry's picture window, an elderly Mexican-American
woman doubts that Brown will stay long at City Hall if he's
elected.
 &HT;    ``I worry about him winning and taking off,'' she says. A
middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic. ``The black
leadership hasn't accomplished much,'' she says flatly, creasing
her lips. ``Brown can change the whole picture. He's energetic,
dynamic. Besides, he's the Kennedy of California. The native son
can do what he wants, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Brown's celebrity may grab headlines, but that is far easier
than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade. And
even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to
pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor
Moonbeam _ simply isn't suited for the managerial challenges that
face urban mayors today.
 &HT;    Brown is a newcomer, having moved to Oakland in 1994. And this
is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white (43
percent are black, 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian). Not
surprisingly, his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper.
 &HT;    For much of its 146-year history, however, Oakland was run by a
clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors. In the
1970s, around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor
_ following in the footsteps of his father, Edmund G. Brown, who
held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther
Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives.
 &HT;    In 1977, Lionel Wilson, a judge, became the city's first black
mayor; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris, a black state
legislator. (Harris chose not to run for a third term this year.)
Against this backdrop, Brown's regular denunciations of
``mediocrity at City Hall'' during ``the past 20 years'' have hit a
nerve.
 &HT;    Exhibit A in Brown's brief against the status quo is the costly
deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the
Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum. (The
deal, aimed at giving the city's anemic economy a shot in the arm,
relied on inflated revenue estimates.) Brown has called for a
criminal investigation.
 &HT;    ``Brown's just playing to the cheapest seats,'' replies Mary
King, one of his key opponents in the mayoral race. King is a black
woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful
position of Alameda County Supervisor. At a public forum, she
vents, ``It's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a
governor! _ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother
on welfare of being too imbedded in the system.''
 &HT;    King places the blame for Oakland's economic collapse in the
1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry
Brown was governor. After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state
money for cities fell. An economic skid grew into a sustained
statewide recession, hitting Oakland particularly hard.
 &HT;    ``Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done
enough, for not having moved farther,'' King murmurs. ``But it's
been uphill all the way.''
 &HT;    King is clearly frustrated by Brown's popularity. ``People have
gotten caught up in a kind of 'white man's ice is colder'
syndrome,'' she says acidly.
 &HT;    Another of Brown's chief competitors is a member of the City
Council, Ignacio De La Fuente, an immigrant from Mexico who started
out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through
trade-union leadership ranks to become the city's first Latino vice
mayor. In a drive around the city, De La Fuente animatedly points
out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new
shopping center in his district, Fruitvale, in two decades.
 &HT;    ``Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire,'' he demands.
``Saying and doing are two different things. Jerry talks a good
line about development and creating jobs. But damn it, I've been
accomplishing what he only talks about.''
 &HT;    With California's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices
elsewhere, Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a
surfeit of affordable space. A decommissioned 422-acre Army base
will be conveyed to the city soon, another plum opportunity. There
are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport, fueling a
potential job surge. De La Fuente ticks off these facts, and winces
at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass.
 &HT;    ``I like Jerry,'' De La Fuente says. ``But he just doesn't have
the attention span to be mayor.''
 &HT;    If a person's home provides a window into his psyche, the $2
million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995
is a fascinating case study. Stretched over a quarter block of land
near Oakland's waterfront, it looks austere from the outside, a
vast expanse of corrugated steel.
 &HT;    Inside, there's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in, with a
garden outside for organic vegetables. It's where Brown's campaign
was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the
room. On the opposite side are two long wooden tables.
 &HT;    ``Here's the only thing about the whole place that matters to
me,'' Brown says, waving his hand. ``The monastic table _ to sit
there and have conversations.''
 &HT;    Brown's longtime friend, the French-born intellectual Jacques
Barzaghi, painted a large red circle in the center of the floor
downstairs _ ``to signify unity,'' he says, fingering his polished
prayer beads. Barzaghi, who has been part of Brown's inner circle
since his gubernatorial days, is a man with a gleaming shaved head
given to sudden proclamations. (``Life is good!'' he regularly
exclaims.)
 &HT;    Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs.
Brown sleeps in a room down the way, and other political supporters
and friends periodically bed down in the rest. (Brown's regular
date for the past eight years, Anne Gust, is general counsel for
the Gap; she maintains her own home in San Francisco.) It's not
your average Oakland politician's digs.
 &HT;    None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of
Brown's living in a commune, perhaps because his unconventionality
_ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for
president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long, vaguely
oracular phrases _ has become, after all these years, familiar to
Californians.
 &HT;    Reporters continue to poke fun, however. ``They write that I'm
quirky,'' he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. ``But the whole
thing I'm doing here is pure practical, nuts and bolts. You've been
around. Have you seen anything quirky?''
 &HT;    One afternoon in the warehouse, Brown pulls out a worn album
that his father kept under his bed. The tattered clippings
chronicle his father's early career. Jerry recites his father's
campaign slogan, laughing: ``'Crack down on crime, pick Brown this
time.' Boy, some things never change.''
 &HT;    His father was an avuncular, beloved politician of the old
school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the
state's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's. When the
younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960, he bided
his time at law school and a clerkship, waiting to begin his own
political hegira until 1969, three years after his father lost his
bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan.
 &HT;    ``The point I'm trying to make with all this,'' he says now, in
a kind of reverie as he pages through his father's scrapbook, ``is
that Edmund G. Brown, father and son, have been involved in
California politics since 1946. It's an unbroken chain.''
 &HT;    This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry
Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor's office while still in
his mid-30s, he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government
spending on infrastructure and social programs, the hallmark of his
father's career.
 &HT;    He openly decried ``the obvious manipulation and role-playing''
in his father's style of politics. Watching him embrace his
father's legacy so fully now, referring casually to their
similarities, you can see how agile he is, how strong his penchant
for reinvention.
 &HT;    Brown regularly touts his experience as governor, citing ``the
tremendous burst of creativity'' in state government during his
years as chief executive. But there's the other side of history too
_ notably, his reputation for poor administrative skills. ``He's
absolutely the worst administrator I've ever seen,'' says a former
member of his cabinet.
 &HT;    In any case, Brown himself admits that what's required
politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a
mayor. ``Being governor is much more abstract,'' Brown
acknowledges. ``This is upfront, in-your-face detail.''
 &HT;    Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to
slog through such details?
 &HT;    Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October, the media
had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by
Brown and titled ``Oakland Ecopolis: A Plan for a Green Plan.'' The
plan upbraided advocates of ``mere economic growth,'' envisioning
an ``ecologically friendly'' city where ``solar generators quietly
hum'' next to ``farm kiosks and craft bazaars.''
 &HT;    This spring, however, he reined himself in, talking almost
exclusively about crime, schools _ and economic development.
Pressed about this change, Brown bristles. ``I do want to do a
sustainability plan for Oakland,'' he says. ``It'll take a few
years to do it. But we'll work it in there.''
 &HT;    As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland's
reality, I ask, can he really set the city's political direction?
``Look, I could do something else _ like enjoy life,'' he says.
``There's everything here that I've ever cared about _ poverty,
environmental issues, labor, crime, schools, transportation. In a
concrete way, everything I've been concerned about in my entire
life is at issue in Oakland.''
 &HT;    Brown's capacity for reinvention could flourish, or founder, in
the pitted streets of Oakland. A mayor in a city like Oakland is
held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the
streets. With hopes raised high, the citizens of Oakland are
unlikely to cut him any slack once he's in office. Power seduces,
but it also stings.
 &HT;    Come next January, Jerry Brown had better know whom to call
about those potholes.

Oakland voters are murkier. Brown is almost always met with a mix
of familiarity and perplexity, the kind of reaction Mario Cuomo
might encounter if he decided to run for mayor of Poughkeepsie. In
front of Brewberry's picture window, an elderly Mexican-American
woman doubts that Brown will stay long at City Hall if he's
elected.
 &HT;    ``I worry about him winning and taking off,'' she says. A
middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic. ``The black
leadership hasn't accomplished much,'' she says flatly, creasing
her lips. ``Brown can change the whole picture. He's energetic,
dynamic. Besides, he's the Kennedy of California. The native son
can do what he wants, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Brown's celebrity may grab headlines, but that is far easier
than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade. And
even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to
pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor
Moonbeam _ simply isn't suited for the managerial challenges that
face urban mayors today.
 &HT;    Brown is a newcomer, having moved to Oakland in 1994. And this
is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white (43
percent are black, 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian). Not
surprisingly, his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper.
 &HT;    For much of its 146-year history, however, Oakland was run by a
clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors. In the
1970s, around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor
_ following in the footsteps of his father, Edmund G. Brown, who
held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther
Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives.
 &HT;    In 1977, Lionel Wilson, a judge, became the city's first black
mayor; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris, a black state
legislator. (Harris chose not to run for a third term this year.)
Against this backdrop, Brown's regular denunciations of
``mediocrity at City Hall'' during ``the past 20 years'' have hit a
nerve.
 &HT;    Exhibit A in Brown's brief against the status quo is the costly
deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the
Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum. (The
deal, aimed at giving the city's anemic economy a shot in the arm,
relied on inflated revenue estimates.) Brown has called for a
criminal investigation.
 &HT;    ``Brown's just playing to the cheapest seats,'' replies Mary
King, one of his key opponents in the mayoral race. King is a black
woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful
position of Alameda County Supervisor. At a public forum, she
vents, ``It's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a
governor! _ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother
on welfare of being too imbedded in the system.''
 &HT;    King places the blame for Oakland's economic collapse in the
1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry
Brown was governor. After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state
money for cities fell. An economic skid grew into a sustained
statewide recession, hitting Oakland particularly hard.
 &HT;    ``Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done
enough, for not having moved farther,'' King murmurs. ``But it's
been uphill all the way.''
 &HT;    King is clearly frustrated by Brown's popularity. ``People have
gotten caught up in a kind of 'white man's ice is colder'
syndrome,'' she says acidly.
 &HT;    Another of Brown's chief competitors is a member of the City
Council, Ignacio De La Fuente, an immigrant from Mexico who started
out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through
trade-union leadership ranks to become the city's first Latino vice
mayor. In a drive around the city, De La Fuente animatedly points
out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new
shopping center in his district, Fruitvale, in two decades.
 &HT;    ``Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire,'' he demands.
``Saying and doing are two different things. Jerry talks a good
line about development and creating jobs. But damn it, I've been
accomplishing what he only talks about.''
 &HT;    With California's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices
elsewhere, Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a
surfeit of affordable space. A decommissioned 422-acre Army base
will be conveyed to the city soon, another plum opportunity. There
are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport, fueling a
potential job surge. De La Fuente ticks off these facts, and winces
at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass.
 &HT;    ``I like Jerry,'' De La Fuente says. ``But he just doesn't have
the attention span to be mayor.''
 &HT;    If a person's home provides a window into his psyche, the $2
million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995
is a fascinating case study. Stretched over a quarter block of land
near Oakland's waterfront, it looks austere from the outside, a
vast expanse of corrugated steel.
 &HT;    Inside, there's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in, with a
garden outside for organic vegetables. It's where Brown's campaign
was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the
room. On the opposite side are two long wooden tables.
 &HT;    ``Here's the only thing about the whole place that matters to
me,'' Brown says, waving his hand. ``The monastic table _ to sit
there and have conversations.''
 &HT;    Brown's longtime friend, the French-born intellectual Jacques
Barzaghi, painted a large red circle in the center of the floor
downstairs _ ``to signify unity,'' he says, fingering his polished
prayer beads. Barzaghi, who has been part of Brown's inner circle
since his gubernatorial days, is a man with a gleaming shaved head
given to sudden proclamations. (``Life is good!'' he regularly
exclaims.)
 &HT;    Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs.
Brown sleeps in a room down the way, and other political supporters
and friends periodically bed down in the rest. (Brown's regular
date for the past eight years, Anne Gust, is general counsel for
the Gap; she maintains her own home in San Francisco.) It's not
your average Oakland politician's digs.
 &HT;    None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of
Brown's living in a commune, perhaps because his unconventionality
_ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for
president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long, vaguely
oracular phrases _ has become, after all these years, familiar to
Californians.
 &HT;    Reporters continue to poke fun, however. ``They write that I'm
quirky,'' he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. ``But the whole
thing I'm doing here is pure practical, nuts and bolts. You've been
around. Have you seen anything quirky?''
 &HT;    One afternoon in the warehouse, Brown pulls out a worn album
that his father kept under his bed. The tattered clippings
chronicle his father's early career. Jerry recites his father's
campaign slogan, laughing: ``'Crack down on crime, pick Brown this
time.' Boy, some things never change.''
 &HT;    His father was an avuncular, beloved politician of the old
school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the
state's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's. When the
younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960, he bided
his time at law school and a clerkship, waiting to begin his own
political hegira until 1969, three years after his father lost his
bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan.
 &HT;    ``The point I'm trying to make with all this,'' he says now, in
a kind of reverie as he pages through his father's scrapbook, ``is
that Edmund G. Brown, father and son, have been involved in
California politics since 1946. It's an unbroken chain.''
 &HT;    This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry
Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor's office while still in
his mid-30s, he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government
spending on infrastructure and social programs, the hallmark of his
father's career.
 &HT;    He openly decried ``the obvious manipulation and role-playing''
in his father's style of politics. Watching him embrace his
father's legacy so fully now, referring casually to their
similarities, you can see how agile he is, how strong his penchant
for reinvention.
 &HT;    Brown regularly touts his experience as governor, citing ``the
tremendous burst of creativity'' in state government during his
years as chief executive. But there's the other side of history too
_ notably, his reputation for poor administrative skills. ``He's
absolutely the worst administrator I've ever seen,'' says a former
member of his cabinet.
 &HT;    In any case, Brown himself admits that what's required
politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a
mayor. ``Being governor is much more abstract,'' Brown
acknowledges. ``This is upfront, in-your-face detail.''
 &HT;    Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to
slog through such details?
 &HT;    Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October, the media
had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by
Brown and titled ``Oakland Ecopolis: A Plan for a Green Plan.'' The
plan upbraided advocates of ``mere economic growth,'' envisioning
an ``ecologically friendly'' city where ``solar generators quietly
hum'' next to ``farm kiosks and craft bazaars.''
 &HT;    This spring, however, he reined himself in, talking almost
exclusively about crime, schools _ and economic development.
Pressed about this change, Brown bristles. ``I do want to do a
sustainability plan for Oakland,'' he says. ``It'll take a few
years to do it. But we'll work it in there.''
 &HT;    As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland's
reality, I ask, can he really set the city's political direction?
``Look, I could do something else _ like enjoy life,'' he says.
``There's everything here that I've ever cared about _ poverty,
environmental issues, labor, crime, schools, transportation. In a
concrete way, everything I've been concerned about in my entire
life is at issue in Oakland.''
 &HT;    Brown's capacity for reinvention could flourish, or founder, in
the pitted streets of Oakland. A mayor in a city like Oakland is
held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the
streets. With hopes raised high, the citizens of Oakland are
unlikely to cut him any slack once he's in office. Power seduces,
but it also stings.
 &HT;    Come next January, Jerry Brown had better know whom to call
about those potholes.

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On a bright, cold day in February, at a clinic in the mountains
outside Denver, a mother sits with her arms folded across her chest
and a polite, bewildered smile on her face.
 &HT;    She is talking about her adopted son, the boy whose troubles
have brought her here to the Attachment Center at Evergreen, where
she hopes he can be taught to love her.
 &HT;    It's just that the boy is so ``strange,'' she says, his emotions
so ``artificial.''
 &HT;    When she and her husband brought him home from Romania in June
1991, the boy was 4 and his sister, whom they also adopted, was 8.
Their mother was dead, the Romanian adoption broker had said, and
their father was an alcoholic and nearly blind. When he wasn't
forcing them to beg in the streets or looking for ways to fob them
off on childless foreigners, he neglected them.
 &HT;    ``We knew all that,'' the mother says, ``so don't think for a
minute that we headed down this path naively.''
 &HT;    She was well into her 30s when she traveled to Bucharest, and
though she had been unable to conceive children, she and her
husband had been foster parents for ``difficult'' children from the
States.
 &HT;    They weren't wealthy people _ he drove a truck for a living and
she kept house _ but they came from a small town in Ohio where they
felt they could rely on their friends and neighbors and where they
were deeply involved in their church.
 &HT;    And yet everything was so much harder than they had imagined.
While the girl seemed to settle in and find some comfort in the
ordinary routines of domestic life, the boy could neither accept
his new family nor control his overwhelming anxiety. He was clumsy
and awkward and subject to night terrors and at the same time oddly
reckless.
 &HT;    He would deliberately ride his bike in front of cars, darting
into traffic at high speed. He lied _ instinctively, it seemed, and
extravagantly. He couldn't stand it when his mother touched him,
but he sought creature comfort in more oblique ways _ sneaking into
the refrigerator in the middle of the night to ``steal'' food, for
instance.
 &HT;    He was rarely invited twice to a schoolmate's house, and the
boys he called his best friends never seemed to think they were
friends at all.
 &HT;    Yet his mother knows that in some ways they are lucky. Her son
is unusual in that he was never in a Romanian orphanage, one of
those warehouses where, so she has heard, babies lay in their cribs
for 18 or 20 hours a day, curled against feeding bottles, their
heads flattened and their faces peaked. So many of the children
here at Evergreen did come out of such places, and she has heard
some of their stories.
 &HT;    There was, for instance, the woman whose 5-year-old daughter,
adopted from a Moscow orphanage,arrived at her new home in the
States so angry at herself and everyone else that she crawled
around on the floor for three months until her knees were bloody,
refusing to stand up when anyone was looking. One night, the girl
threatened to kill her new mother and father and her three new
siblings while they slept.
 &HT;    This boy, on the other hand, is not violent and can even show
genuine tenderness. He loves to hold babies; he loves the marzipan
softness of their skin and their buttery smell; his tactile
remoteness seems to dissolve in their presence.
 &HT;    At times, his mother sounds solicitous, motherly. She wouldn't
allow me to use her family's name or too many identifying details
because she worries that her son will read this some day and she
wants to save him from embarrassment. She is pale and mild-looking,
with rimless glasses and eyes the color of milky blue marbles. Over
her pink dress, she wears a parka, which she seems too shy or
preoccupied to remove, though the room is overheated.
 &HT;    But there is something obdurate about her too. Now that her
son's problem has been diagnosed _ attachment disorder _ much of
what he does seems to strike her as pathological, ``oppositional.''
And when I ask her if she loves her son, she says, ``That's hard to
say.''
 &HT;    For every theory of human behavior, there is a diabolically
perfect experiment that can never be performed _ not, anyway, by
ethical scientists in a democratic society. To test human tolerance
of extreme cold, you cannot immerse a naked human subject in
freezing water.
 &HT;    To test the effects of maternal and sensory deprivation on
infants, you cannot take a population of newborns and confine them
to cribs in a gloomy, ill-heated orphanage with a small, rotating
staff of caretakers who might spend an average of 10 minutes a day
talking to them or holding them. But let's say that such an
experiment has already occurred _ in nature, as it were, far from
the laboratory.
 &HT;    And let's say that assessing its impact on the children who
endured it would not only help them but might also shed light on an
issue that has long intrigued developmental psychologists and
tormented so many working mothers.
 &HT;    This is precisely the experiment being carried out today with
many children adopted from eastern Europe _ chiefly Romania _ and
the former Soviet Union since the collapse of Communism in 1989.
There are more than 18,000 of these adoptees in the United States
now, and the most traumatized among them _ roughly 20 to 30
percent, according to researchers _ are becoming one of the most
scrutinized and therapeutically manipulated populations in the
annals of psychology. This is in part because they, or rather their
adoptive parents, have proven to be such cooperative subjects.
 &HT;    ``To some degree it's a class issue,'' says Victor Groza, an
adoption specialist at Case Western Reserve University who has
conducted several studies on the emotional and behavioral
development of Romanian adoptees. ``Most of the eastern European
kids here were adopted by upper- or middle-class families, and
those families tend to respond to studies at a very high rate.''
 &HT;    But beyond that, many of the adoptees constitute a unique sample
group: babies who were surrendered to the kind of institutional
care that few other countries practice on a large scale anymore and
then adopted, usually as toddlers and usually by people prepared to
lavish on them the kind of affection and sensory stimulation they
had almost entirely lacked.
 &HT;    By comparison, even the most wounded children adopted out of the
foster system in the United States have had at least some history
of family life and one-on-one attention. And most babies adopted
from China, the other rapidly growing source of foreign-born
adoptive children, are both younger _ less than a year old on
average _ and receive better institutional care.
 &HT;    The orphans from Romania and the former Soviet Union are ``by
far the biggest group of deprived babies'' available for study so
far, Michael Rutter, a child psychiatrist at the London Institute
of Psychiatry, told Science magazine.
 &HT;    Or, as Groza put it in a recent paper, ``The children adopted
from Romanian institutions represent an opportunity to examine the
effects of deprivation on child development'' comparable to
``experimental research conducted on primates.''
 &HT;    Which is to say, those studies familiar to all psychology
undergrads demonstrating that infant monkeys, separated for six
months from their mothers, became anxious and then remote and as
adults showed persistent signs of psychological distress.
 &HT;    Above all, the eastern European orphans have become Exhibit A in
the emotional debate over the body of thought known as attachment
theory. It might seem self-evident that human babies, notoriously
helpless creatures that they are, need mother love or something
much like it in order to thrive and develop emotionally and
cognitively.
 &HT;    ``Continuity of affectionate care by one or a small number of
caregivers who can give of themselves emotionally, as well as in
other ways, originates the development of the child's love
relationships,'' wrote Linda Mayes and Sally Provence, both
professors of child development at Yale University.
 &HT;    ``Having repeated experiences of being comforted when
distressed,'' for instance, ``is a part of developing one's own
capacity for self-comfort and self-regulation, and later, the
capacity to provide the same for others.''
 &HT;    But the fact is that in certain hands, a bland and clinical
phrase like ''continuity of affectionate care'' can be loaded. If
that continuous affectionate care is to be provided primarily by a
mother, as so many attachment theorists seem to think, can she be a
working mother? Does day care count as a discontinuity? How small
is ``a small number'' of caretakers?
 &HT;    The original attachment studies found a startling consistency in
the psychological and even physical reactions of very young
children separated from their parents. But those studies _ done by
people like the British psychiatrist John Bowlby and the French
psychoanalyst Reni Spitz in the late '40s and '50s _ were of modest
scale, conducted in a foundling home here or a hospital there.
 &HT;    It was the aftermath of World War II, and a child's longing for
parents during a brief separation _ a frightened child
hospitalized, say, for a routine operation - must have seemed a
rather small thing in the grand scale of sorrows. Moreover, Bowlby
and Spitz were publishing their findings at a time when there were
fewer working mothers with whom they might resonate.
 &HT;    Now, though, many more of us want to know what happens to
children for whom the bonds of attachment have snapped, because
many more of us fear that those bonds are being pulled and
stretched. Mother-child separations are part of the warp and woof
of life these days, and so are our worries about them. The research
on eastern European adoptees matters not only to them and their
parents but also to many of the rest of us as well. Some of the
more fervent attachment therapists do not hesitate to draw these
connections.
 &HT;    ``Child care _ especially when it's not the best _ going back to
work at 6 weeks, these are all risk factors'' for insecure
attachment of the kind, if not the degree, that the orphans
display, says Paula Pickle, the soft-spoken, rather somber director
of the Attachment Center at Evergreen.
 &HT;    ``You know, I think we forget that the hand that rocks the
cradle really does rule the world.'' But even if you regard such
statements as ideologically suspect, even if you recognize that a
vast gulf separates the experience of a baby in an orphanage from
that of a toddler in day care, there may still be observations that
apply to both.
 &HT;    As studies on post-institutionalized children help to isolate
precisely which aspects of orphanage life hamper a child's
development, it becomes possible to consider how these factors, in
more moderate form, might affect young children who spend many
hours in poor-quality day care or who have a frequently shifting
cast of parental surrogates in their early years. And it also
becomes possible to think anew about what it is that good parents
and caretakers do to nourish children emotionally.
 &HT;    Feminists have long criticized attachment theory as a
sentimental scheme for shooing mothers back home. But to write it
off at that would be to misconstrue it. Above all, the theory
argues that emotional engagement is the necessary precursor to
healthy development, engendering trust in the world and the ability
to make sense of it.
 &HT;    ``Without someone specifically oriented to his needs,'' wrote
the psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott, whose work helped inform
attachment theory, ``the infant cannot find a working relation to
external reality. Without someone to give satisfactory instinctual
gratifications, the infant cannot find his body, nor can he develop
an integrated personality. Without one person to love and to hate,
he cannot come to know that it is the same person that he loves and
hates, and so cannot find his sense of guilt, and his desire to
repair and restore.''
 &HT;    Without what the prominent psychologist Mary Ainsworth called a
``secure base'' _ a reliably loving person to whom a toddler can
return periodically for emotional refueling _ he will not feel free
to explore. Relaxing into his dependency is, paradoxically, the
first step to independence. And though attachment theorists
generally assume that the person with whom a baby is figuring all
this out will be her mother, nothing in the theory excludes a
loving father from filling the same role.
 &HT;    It is certainly true that John Bowlby took a dim view of day
care, and indeed of almost anything else that kept mothers apart
from their babies and toddlers. Bowlby's own early research had
been with children who had undergone traumatic separations from
their parents _ delinquents in foundling homes and child-guidance
clinics, young evacuees from the London blitz and otherwise happy
children confined to the hospital in an era when visiting hours,
even for mothers and fathers, were normally restricted to once a
week.
 &HT;    In all of these cases, Bowlby detected an initial stage of
protest, followed by a kind of passive grief or dejection that
could sometimes appear to be cooperative behavior to busy nurses or
social workers, followed by a deeper and lasting emotional
detachment _ the child might be cheerful with others, but
defensively reject his mother when she appeared again.
 &HT;    ``This whole business of women going to work,'' he told the
psychologist Robert Karen in 1989, a year before he died, ``it's so
bitterly controversial, but I do not think it's a good idea. I mean
women go out to work and make some fiddly little bit of gadgetry,
which has no particular social value, and children are looked after
in indifferent nurseries. ... Looking after your own children is
hard work. But you get some rewards in that. Looking after other
people's children is very hard work, and you don't get many rewards
for it.''
 &HT;    For Bowlby, attachment was monotropic; that is, it occurred with
a single other person. But later attachment theorists have argued
that young children live comfortably within a hierarchy of
attachments. Maybe an 18-month-old's mother is the apple of his
eye, but an affectionate father is a close runner-up, followed by
other relatives, a nanny or a particularly attentive day-care
worker.
 &HT;    The important thing is that these be empathetic people,
consistent presences ``attuned,'' as the attachment theorists like
to say, to babies in general and to one baby in particular.
 &HT;    If further refinements of the theory have made some feminist
objections irrelevant, they have hardly shut down the criticisms.
The psychologist Diane Eyer (the author of ``Mother-Infant Bonding:
A Scientific Fiction'') has made a career of denouncing attachment
theory and its more simplistic variants as a new and ingenious
version of an old game: pinning the blame on Mom when a child grows
up insecure or worse.
 &HT;    Placing too much emphasis on the early relationship between
mother and child, she argues, allows society to abdicate
responsibility for its role in shaping children.
 &HT;    ``Children are profoundly affected by an array of people who
interact with them,'' Eyer writes, ``by the foods they eat, by the
music they hear, by the television they watch, by the hope they see
in the adult world and by the institutions _ especially schools _
they attend.''
 &HT;    From another angle, critics like Jerome Kagan, a Harvard
University child psychologist, have argued that while attachment
theory is intuitively appealing _ it sounds right to parents who
find it agreeable to their own style of child-rearing _ it is
extremely difficult to measure the emotional content of
relationships.
 &HT;    Inborn temperament, Kagan contends, is at least as important as
early experience in determining whether an infant will morph into a
happy and secure adult or a miserable one. Some children are simply
more susceptible to separation and loss than others.
 &HT;    It doesn't exactly help that on its pop-psych fringes,
attachment theory has spawned more than its share of wild-eyed
one-noters. In the '70s and '80s, as Eyer points out, there were
the ``experts'' who insisted that immediate skin-to-skin contact
between mothers and their newborns acted almost as a vaccine,
inoculating children against future psychological woes and
antisocial tendencies.
 &HT;    These days, there are the crude Cassandras who speak darkly of
legions of ``unattached kids'' who cannot love and who grow up to
be charmers, con artists and, yes, psychopathic killers. One
example is the overheated 1987 best seller ``High Risk: Children
Without Conscience,'' which blithely equates the trauma of day care
with the trauma of child abuse.
 &HT;    Even more disturbing is the idea that some version of attachment
disorder could be warped into a legal defense in child abuse cases:
the lawyers for a woman named Renee Polreis, who was convicted in
Colorado last year of beating to death her Russian adopted son,
argued that the 2-year-old was so traumatized by his orphanage
experience that he had inflicted the beating on himself.
 &HT;    With overwrought examples like these out there it might be
tempting to dismiss attachment theory altogether. After
encountering a few of them myself, I had the vague impression of a
faddish and slightly histrionic diagnosis and a handful of
questionable therapies to go with it.
 &HT;    Yet after talking to some of the parents of eastern European
orphans I felt otherwise. What they told me about the ways their
children seemed to struggle every day with the legacies of early
deprivation _ ``it's like the grooves were cut in the orphanage and
that's the music he's playing now,'' said the mother of a
9-year-old - made the tenets of attachment theory real in a way
they had not quite been for me before.
 &HT;    There are, to be sure, important caveats. In a study of 229
American families who adopted Romanian children, Groza found that
78 percent of the parents rated the ``overall impact of the
adoption on the family'' as ``very positive,'' and 97 percent said
they ''never thought'' about relinquishing the child.
 &HT;    Moreover, using the parents' own assessments of their children,
Groza divided the adoptees into three distinct groups, each with a
fairly different prognosis. About 20 percent of the adoptees in his
study were what he called ``challenged children'' _ those who had
been ``severely affected by their institutionalization'' and
continued to have alarming emotional problems and marked
developmental lags up to four years after their adoption.
 &HT;    Another 60 percent were what he called ``wounded wonders'' _
those who clearly fell behind their peers in social and
developmental growth but who had managed to make big leaps forward
in their adoptive homes. And a third group, the ``resilient
rascals,'' haven't displayed any obvious ill effects of their
institutionalization at all. Perhaps, Groza speculates, they had
been ``pets'' in the orphanage, charming the staff into giving them
more attention.
 &HT;    Moreover, in what many researchers in the field say is the most
thorough study yet of Romanian children adopted in North America, a
group headed by Elinor Ames at Simon Fraser University in British
Columbia concluded that all 46 of the orphanage children in the
sample had been able to form some sort of attachment to their
adoptive parents.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, 60 percent of the parents reported that three years
after the adoption they still worried about their children's
``overly friendly'' attitude toward adult strangers, and a third of
the children displayed what the study called ``atypical insecure
attachment patterns.''
 &HT;    All of these studies have found that the earlier a child was
adopted _ which is to say, the less time he or she spent in an
orphanage _ the likelier he or she was to develop normally. In the
Ames study, a control group of Romanian infants adopted from homes
and institutions before they were 4 months old did better on
virtually every measure than the children adopted at 8 months or
older, though the two groups had a similar history of prenatal
care, environmental stresses and so on.
 &HT;    ``Orphanage experience tends to dampen all areas of
intelligence,'' concluded the Ames study, which found that 78
percent of the Romanian orphanage children it evaluated (on the
basis of standardized tests and parental assessment) were delayed
in ``fine motor, gross motor, personal-social and language'' skills
when they were adopted.
 &HT;    Groza's study specified two sensitive windows _ the second
half-year of life and the period between 25 and 36 months _ when
institutionalization was especially likely to cause delays in both
emotional and cognitive development.
 &HT;    But no legitimate researcher will say that there is an age
beyond which a child cannot be helped. And though there is a
general feeling among doctors and researchers that certain ages are
more sensitive than others, and a rough consensus on what those
ages are, that's not to say that there is unanimity on these
points.
 &HT;    ``If kids are adopted from an orphanage before 6 months of age,
the data are pretty good that they do comparably to birth
children,'' says Dana Johnson, co-director of the International
Adoption Clinic at the University of Minnesota, who has examined
about 300 eastern European adoptees.
 &HT;    ``At 6 to 12 months, you have some kids who start to fall behind
in certain areas, particularly in language development, and by 1
year nearly all are behind. Still, if you adopt a child from an
orphanage before he's 2, most of the evidence would suggest that
his recovery could be pretty good. After 2, it just depends on the
individual child and the situation they are in.''
 &HT;    Jerri Jenista, a pediatrician who works with foreign adoptees at
St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., and who is the
mother of five adopted children herself, paints a similar picture,
but in broader strokes: ``I'm most worried about kids who are over
5, least worried about those under 6 months. But there is no single
turning point. So much depends on the personality of the child.''
 &HT;    There are always children who astound their parents with their
capacity to rebound. When Julie and Joseph Ferenc decided to adopt
from Russia, they knew they did not want to take on any children
with more than the usual allotment of childhood difficulties.
Julie, who is now 36 and a high-school history teacher in Lacey
Township, N.J., and Joseph, 40, who runs a
bridge-and-storage-tank-inspection company, had not been able to
conceive, and they dearly wanted ``healthy, normal'' children to
love.
 &HT;    Before they adopted 2-year old Anastasia and 3-year-old Alex in
1994, they had already adopted a 2-year-old boy, Joey, who had been
in foster care in Guatemala.
 &HT;    ``With Joey, we had no problems,'' Julie says. ``We wanted to
adopt from abroad, not domestically, because we were really afraid
of having someone come back and challenge the adoption, like in the
`baby Jessica' case. We just didn't want to risk that.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, Alex was not normal and healthy. He had always
looked ``a little strange'' to Julie, and when the Ferencs took him
to a doctor in New Jersey, he was found to suffer from
microcephaly, a condition in which the skull fails to grow normally
and the brain is correspondingly smaller. (The Ferencs are suing
their adoption agency.)
 &HT;    ``We love Alex,'' Julie says, ''but this has caused our family
some major, major difficulties.'' The surprise has been that
through it all, Anastasia has been ``a comfort and a joy, a
gorgeous child.'' She might be one of the ``wounded wonders.''
 &HT;    And who would have thought so? When the Ferencs first brought
her home, Anastasia cried ``so hard and so often that she got
black-and-blue marks under her eyes,'' Julie says. ``It was a
depression _ just the depth of it _ that you wouldn't think was
possible in a child that age.'' Now she is in a special
developmental kindergarten, but she is not depressed. ``I feel
she's past that,'' Julie says. ``I feel we came out the other side
with her.''
 &HT;    ``A lot of these kids are really doing a lot better than
expected,'' Groza says. ``A lot of them have made great strides.
But I think if you adopt such a child you at least have to be
prepared for someone with special needs that may last a lifetime.
You have to be able to say, 'Well, I'd really like to have a brain
surgeon, but if I get a kid who grows up to be a McDonald's worker
who needs to be living in some sort of supportive-living setup,
I'll love him just as much.'''
 &HT;    And when you ask how the eastern European adoptees are faring as
a group, the relevant question is always, Compared with whom? As
the Ames study concluded, when the comparison is with ``children
left behind in the orphanages, the answer is very clear. All of
them are doing much better than they would have if they had never
been adopted _ in health, intelligence, having parents to whom they
can attach.''

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On a bright, cold day in February, at a clinic in the mountains
outside Denver, a mother sits with her arms folded across her chest
and a polite, bewildered smile on her face.
 &HT;    She is talking about her adopted son, the boy whose troubles
have brought her here to the Attachment Center at Evergreen, where
she hopes he can be taught to love her.
 &HT;    It's just that the boy is so ``strange,'' she says, his emotions
so ``artificial.''
 &HT;    When she and her husband brought him home from Romania in June
1991, the boy was 4 and his sister, whom they also adopted, was 8.
Their mother was dead, the Romanian adoption broker had said, and
their father was an alcoholic and nearly blind. When he wasn't
forcing them to beg in the streets or looking for ways to fob them
off on childless foreigners, he neglected them.
 &HT;    ``We knew all that,'' the mother says, ``so don't think for a
minute that we headed down this path naively.''
 &HT;    She was well into her 30s when she traveled to Bucharest, and
though she had been unable to conceive children, she and her
husband had been foster parents for ``difficult'' children from the
States.
 &HT;    They weren't wealthy people _ he drove a truck for a living and
she kept house _ but they came from a small town in Ohio where they
felt they could rely on their friends and neighbors and where they
were deeply involved in their church.
 &HT;    And yet everything was so much harder than they had imagined.
While the girl seemed to settle in and find some comfort in the
ordinary routines of domestic life, the boy could neither accept
his new family nor control his overwhelming anxiety. He was clumsy
and awkward and subject to night terrors and at the same time oddly
reckless.
 &HT;    He would deliberately ride his bike in front of cars, darting
into traffic at high speed. He lied _ instinctively, it seemed, and
extravagantly. He couldn't stand it when his mother touched him,
but he sought creature comfort in more oblique ways _ sneaking into
the refrigerator in the middle of the night to ``steal'' food, for
instance.
 &HT;    He was rarely invited twice to a schoolmate's house, and the
boys he called his best friends never seemed to think they were
friends at all.
 &HT;    Yet his mother knows that in some ways they are lucky. Her son
is unusual in that he was never in a Romanian orphanage, one of
those warehouses where, so she has heard, babies lay in their cribs
for 18 or 20 hours a day, curled against feeding bottles, their
heads flattened and their faces peaked. So many of the children
here at Evergreen did come out of such places, and she has heard
some of their stories.
 &HT;    There was, for instance, the woman whose 5-year-old daughter,
adopted from a Moscow orphanage, arrived at her new home in the
States so angry at herself and everyone else that she crawled
around on the floor for three months until her knees were bloody,
refusing to stand up when anyone was looking. One night, the girl
threatened to kill her new mother and father and her three new
siblings while they slept.
 &HT;    This boy, on the other hand, is not violent and can even show
genuine tenderness. He loves to hold babies; he loves the marzipan
softness of their skin and their buttery smell; his tactile
remoteness seems to dissolve in their presence.
 &HT;    At times, his mother sounds solicitous, motherly. She wouldn't
allow me to use her family's name or too many identifying details
because she worries that her son will read this some day and she
wants to save him from embarrassment. She is pale and mild-looking,
with rimless glasses and eyes the color of milky blue marbles. Over
her pink dress, she wears a parka, which she seems too shy or
preoccupied to remove, though the room is overheated.
 &HT;    But there is something obdurate about her too. Now that her
son's problem has been diagnosed _ attachment disorder _ much of
what he does seems to strike her as pathological, ``oppositional.''
And when I ask her if she loves her son, she says, ``That's hard to
say.''
 &HT;    For every theory of human behavior, there is a diabolically
perfect experiment that can never be performed _ not, anyway, by
ethical scientists in a democratic society. To test human tolerance
of extreme cold, you cannot immerse a naked human subject in
freezing water.
 &HT;    To test the effects of maternal and sensory deprivation on
infants, you cannot take a population of newborns and confine them
to cribs in a gloomy, ill-heated orphanage with a small, rotating
staff of caretakers who might spend an average of 10 minutes a day
talking to them or holding them. But let's say that such an
experiment has already occurred _ in nature, as it were, far from
the laboratory.
 &HT;    And let's say that assessing its impact on the children who
endured it would not only help them but might also shed light on an
issue that has long intrigued developmental psychologists and
tormented so many working mothers.
 &HT;    This is precisely the experiment being carried out today with
many children adopted from eastern Europe _ chiefly Romania _ and
the former Soviet Union since the collapse of Communism in 1989.
There are more than 18,000 of these adoptees in the United States
now, and the most traumatized among them _ roughly 20 to 30
percent, according to researchers _ are becoming one of the most
scrutinized and therapeutically manipulated populations in the
annals of psychology. This is in part because they, or rather their
adoptive parents, have proven to be such cooperative subjects.
 &HT;    ``To some degree it's a class issue,'' says Victor Groza, an
adoption specialist at Case Western Reserve University who has
conducted several studies on the emotional and behavioral
development of Romanian adoptees. ``Most of the eastern European
kids here were adopted by upper- or middle-class families, and
those families tend to respond to studies at a very high rate.''
 &HT;    But beyond that, many of the adoptees constitute a unique sample
group: babies who were surrendered to the kind of institutional
care that few other countries practice on a large scale anymore and
then adopted, usually as toddlers and usually by people prepared to
lavish on them the kind of affection and sensory stimulation they
had almost entirely lacked.
 &HT;    By comparison, even the most wounded children adopted out of the
foster system in the United States have had at least some history
of family life and one-on-one attention. And most babies adopted
from China, the other rapidly growing source of foreign-born
adoptive children, are both younger _ less than a year old on
average _ and receive better institutional care.
 &HT;    The orphans from Romania and the former Soviet Union are ``by
far the biggest group of deprived babies'' available for study so
far, Michael Rutter, a child psychiatrist at the London Institute
of Psychiatry, told Science magazine.
 &HT;    Or, as Groza put it in a recent paper, ``The children adopted
from Romanian institutions represent an opportunity to examine the
effects of deprivation on child development'' comparable to
``experimental research conducted on primates.''
 &HT;    Which is to say, those studies familiar to all psychology
undergrads demonstrating that infant monkeys, separated for six
months from their mothers, became anxious and then remote and as
adults showed persistent signs of psychological distress.
 &HT;    Above all, the eastern European orphans have become Exhibit A in
the emotional debate over the body of thought known as attachment
theory. It might seem self-evident that human babies, notoriously
helpless creatures that they are, need mother love or something
much like it in order to thrive and develop emotionally and
cognitively.
 &HT;    ``Continuity of affectionate care by one or a small number of
caregivers who can give of themselves emotionally, as well as in
other ways, originates the development of the child's love
relationships,'' wrote Linda Mayes and Sally Provence, both
professors of child development at Yale University.
 &HT;    ``Having repeated experiences of being comforted when
distressed,'' for instance, ``is a part of developing one's own
capacity for self-comfort and self-regulation, and later, the
capacity to provide the same for others.''
 &HT;    But the fact is that in certain hands, a bland and clinical
phrase like ''continuity of affectionate care'' can be loaded. If
that continuous affectionate care is to be provided primarily by a
mother, as so many attachment theorists seem to think, can she be a
working mother? Does day care count as a discontinuity? How small
is ``a small number'' of caretakers?
 &HT;    The original attachment studies found a startling consistency in
the psychological and even physical reactions of very young
children separated from their parents. But those studies _ done by
people like the British psychiatrist John Bowlby and the French
psychoanalyst Reni Spitz in the late '40s and '50s _ were of modest
scale, conducted in a foundling home here or a hospital there.
 &HT;    It was the aftermath of World War II, and a child's longing for
parents during a brief separation _ a frightened child
hospitalized, say, for a routine operation - must have seemed a
rather small thing in the grand scale of sorrows. Moreover, Bowlby
and Spitz were publishing their findings at a time when there were
fewer working mothers with whom they might resonate.
 &HT;    Now, though, many more of us want to know what happens to
children for whom the bonds of attachment have snapped, because
many more of us fear that those bonds are being pulled and
stretched. Mother-child separations are part of the warp and woof
of life these days, and so are our worries about them. The research
on eastern European adoptees matters not only to them and their
parents but also to many of the rest of us as well. Some of the
more fervent attachment therapists do not hesitate to draw these
connections.
 &HT;    ``Child care _ especially when it's not the best _ going back to
work at 6 weeks, these are all risk factors'' for insecure
attachment of the kind, if not the degree, that the orphans
display, says Paula Pickle, the soft-spoken, rather somber director
of the Attachment Center at Evergreen.
 &HT;    ``You know, I think we forget that the hand that rocks the
cradle really does rule the world.'' But even if you regard such
statements as ideologically suspect, even if you recognize that a
vast gulf separates the experience of a baby in an orphanage from
that of a toddler in day care, there may still be observations that
apply to both.
 &HT;    As studies on post-institutionalized children help to isolate
precisely which aspects of orphanage life hamper a child's
development, it becomes possible to consider how these factors, in
more moderate form, might affect young children who spend many
hours in poor-quality day care or who have a frequently shifting
cast of parental surrogates in their early years. And it also
becomes possible to think anew about what it is that good parents
and caretakers do to nourish children emotionally.
 &HT;    Feminists have long criticized attachment theory as a
sentimental scheme for shooing mothers back home. But to write it
off at that would be to misconstrue it. Above all, the theory
argues that emotional engagement is the necessary precursor to
healthy development, engendering trust in the world and the ability
to make sense of it.
 &HT;    ``Without someone specifically oriented to his needs,'' wrote
the psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott, whose work helped inform
attachment theory, ``the infant cannot find a working relation to
external reality. Without someone to give satisfactory instinctual
gratifications, the infant cannot find his body, nor can he develop
an integrated personality. Without one person to love and to hate,
he cannot come to know that it is the same person that he loves and
hates, and so cannot find his sense of guilt, and his desire to
repair and restore.''
 &HT;    Without what the prominent psychologist Mary Ainsworth called a
``secure base'' _ a reliably loving person to whom a toddler can
return periodically for emotional refueling _ he will not feel free
to explore. Relaxing into his dependency is, paradoxically, the
first step to independence. And though attachment theorists
generally assume that the person with whom a baby is figuring all
this out will be her mother, nothing in the theory excludes a
loving father from filling the same role.
 &HT;    It is certainly true that John Bowlby took a dim view of day
care, and indeed of almost anything else that kept mothers apart
from their babies and toddlers. Bowlby's own early research had
been with children who had undergone traumatic separations from
their parents _ delinquents in foundling homes and child-guidance
clinics, young evacuees from the London blitz and otherwise happy
children confined to the hospital in an era when visiting hours,
even for mothers and fathers, were normally restricted to once a
week.
 &HT;    In all of these cases, Bowlby detected an initial stage of
protest, followed by a kind of passive grief or dejection that
could sometimes appear to be cooperative behavior to busy nurses or
social workers, followed by a deeper and lasting emotional
detachment _ the child might be cheerful with others, but
defensively reject his mother when she appeared again.
 &HT;    ``This whole business of women going to work,'' he told the
psychologist Robert Karen in 1989, a year before he died, ``it's so
bitterly controversial, but I do not think it's a good idea. I mean
women go out to work and make some fiddly little bit of gadgetry,
which has no particular social value, and children are looked after
in indifferent nurseries. ... Looking after your own children is
hard work. But you get some rewards in that. Looking after other
people's children is very hard work, and you don't get many rewards
for it.''
 &HT;    For Bowlby, attachment was monotropic; that is, it occurred with
a single other person. But later attachment theorists have argued
that young children live comfortably within a hierarchy of
attachments. Maybe an 18-month-old's mother is the apple of his
eye, but an affectionate father is a close runner-up, followed by
other relatives, a nanny or a particularly attentive day-care
worker.
 &HT;    The important thing is that these be empathetic people,
consistent presences ``attuned,'' as the attachment theorists like
to say, to babies in general and to one baby in particular.
 &HT;    If further refinements of the theory have made some feminist
objections irrelevant, they have hardly shut down the criticisms.
The psychologist Diane Eyer (the author of ``Mother-Infant Bonding:
A Scientific Fiction'') has made a career of denouncing attachment
theory and its more simplistic variants as a new and ingenious
version of an old game: pinning the blame on Mom when a child grows
up insecure or worse.
 &HT;    Placing too much emphasis on the early relationship between
mother and child, she argues, allows society to abdicate
responsibility for its role in shaping children.
 &HT;    ``Children are profoundly affected by an array of people who
interact with them,'' Eyer writes, ``by the foods they eat, by the
music they hear, by the television they watch, by the hope they see
in the adult world and by the institutions _ especially schools _
they attend.''
 &HT;    From another angle, critics like Jerome Kagan, a Harvard
University child psychologist, have argued that while attachment
theory is intuitively appealing _ it sounds right to parents who
find it agreeable to their own style of child-rearing _ it is
extremely difficult to measure the emotional content of
relationships.
 &HT;    Inborn temperament, Kagan contends, is at least as important as
early experience in determining whether an infant will morph into a
happy and secure adult or a miserable one. Some children are simply
more susceptible to separation and loss than others.
 &HT;    It doesn't exactly help that on its pop-psych fringes,
attachment theory has spawned more than its share of wild-eyed
one-noters. In the '70s and '80s, as Eyer points out, there were
the ``experts'' who insisted that immediate skin-to-skin contact
between mothers and their newborns acted almost as a vaccine,
inoculating children against future psychological woes and
antisocial tendencies.
 &HT;    These days, there are the crude Cassandras who speak darkly of
legions of ``unattached kids'' who cannot love and who grow up to
be charmers, con artists and, yes, psychopathic killers. One
example is the overheated 1987 best seller ``High Risk: Children
Without Conscience,'' which blithely equates the trauma of day care
with the trauma of child abuse.
 &HT;    Even more disturbing is the idea that some version of attachment
disorder could be warped into a legal defense in child abuse cases:
the lawyers for a woman named Renee Polreis, who was convicted in
Colorado last year of beating to death her Russian adopted son,
argued that the 2-year-old was so traumatized by his orphanage
experience that he had inflicted the beating on himself.
 &HT;    With overwrought examples like these out there it might be
tempting to dismiss attachment theory altogether. After
encountering a few of them myself, I had the vague impression of a
faddish and slightly histrionic diagnosis and a handful of
questionable therapies to go with it.
 &HT;    Yet after talking to some of the parents of eastern European
orphans I felt otherwise. What they told me about the ways their
children seemed to struggle every day with the legacies of early
deprivation _ ``it's like the grooves were cut in the orphanage and
that's the music he's playing now,'' said the mother of a
9-year-old - made the tenets of attachment theory real in a way
they had not quite been for me before.
 &HT;    There are, to be sure, important caveats. In a study of 229
American families who adopted Romanian children, Groza found that
78 percent of the parents rated the ``overall impact of the
adoption on the family'' as ``very positive,'' and 97 percent said
they ''never thought'' about relinquishing the child.
 &HT;    Moreover, using the parents' own assessments of their children,
Groza divided the adoptees into three distinct groups, each with a
fairly different prognosis. About 20 percent of the adoptees in his
study were what he called ``challenged children'' _ those who had
been ``severely affected by their institutionalization'' and
continued to have alarming emotional problems and marked
developmental lags up to four years after their adoption.
 &HT;    Another 60 percent were what he called ``wounded wonders'' _
those who clearly fell behind their peers in social and
developmental growth but who had managed to make big leaps forward
in their adoptive homes. And a third group, the ``resilient
rascals,'' haven't displayed any obvious ill effects of their
institutionalization at all. Perhaps, Groza speculates, they had
been ``pets'' in the orphanage, charming the staff into giving them
more attention.
 &HT;    Moreover, in what many researchers in the field say is the most
thorough study yet of Romanian children adopted in North America, a
group headed by Elinor Ames at Simon Fraser University in British
Columbia concluded that all 46 of the orphanage children in the
sample had been able to form some sort of attachment to their
adoptive parents.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, 60 percent of the parents reported that three years
after the adoption they still worried about their children's
``overly friendly'' attitude toward adult strangers, and a third of
the children displayed what the study called ``atypical insecure
attachment patterns.''
 &HT;    All of these studies have found that the earlier a child was
adopted _ which is to say, the less time he or she spent in an
orphanage _ the likelier he or she was to develop normally. In the
Ames study, a control group of Romanian infants adopted from homes
and institutions before they were 4 months old did better on
virtually every measure than the children adopted at 8 months or
older, though the two groups had a similar history of prenatal
care, environmental stresses and so on.
 &HT;    ``Orphanage experience tends to dampen all areas of
intelligence,'' concluded the Ames study, which found that 78
percent of the Romanian orphanage children it evaluated (on the
basis of standardized tests and parental assessment) were delayed
in ``fine motor, gross motor, personal-social and language'' skills
when they were adopted.
 &HT;    Groza's study specified two sensitive windows _ the second
half-year of life and the period between 25 and 36 months _ when
institutionalization was especially likely to cause delays in both
emotional and cognitive development.
 &HT;    But no legitimate researcher will say that there is an age
beyond which a child cannot be helped. And though there is a
general feeling among doctors and researchers that certain ages are
more sensitive than others, and a rough consensus on what those
ages are, that's not to say that there is unanimity on these
points.
 &HT;    ``If kids are adopted from an orphanage before 6 months of age,
the data are pretty good that they do comparably to birth
children,'' says Dana Johnson, co-director of the International
Adoption Clinic at the University of Minnesota, who has examined
about 300 eastern European adoptees.
 &HT;    ``At 6 to 12 months, you have some kids who start to fall behind
in certain areas, particularly in language development, and by 1
year nearly all are behind. Still, if you adopt a child from an
orphanage before he's 2, most of the evidence would suggest that
his recovery could be pretty good. After 2, it just depends on the
individual child and the situation they are in.''
 &HT;    Jerri Jenista, a pediatrician who works with foreign adoptees at
St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., and who is the
mother of five adopted children herself, paints a similar picture,
but in broader strokes: ``I'm most worried about kids who are over
5, least worried about those under 6 months. But there is no single
turning point. So much depends on the personality of the child.''
 &HT;    There are always children who astound their parents with their
capacity to rebound. When Julie and Joseph Ferenc decided to adopt
from Russia, they knew they did not want to take on any children
with more than the usual allotment of childhood difficulties.
Julie, who is now 36 and a high-school history teacher in Lacey
Township, N.J., and Joseph, 40, who runs a
bridge-and-storage-tank-inspection company, had not been able to
conceive, and they dearly wanted ``healthy, normal'' children to
love.
 &HT;    Before they adopted 2-year old Anastasia and 3-year-old Alex in
1994, they had already adopted a 2-year-old boy, Joey, who had been
in foster care in Guatemala.
 &HT;    ``With Joey, we had no problems,'' Julie says. ``We wanted to
adopt from abroad, not domestically, because we were really afraid
of having someone come back and challenge the adoption, like in the
`baby Jessica' case. We just didn't want to risk that.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, Alex was not normal and healthy. He had always
looked ``a little strange'' to Julie, and when the Ferencs took him
to a doctor in New Jersey, he was found to suffer from
microcephaly, a condition in which the skull fails to grow normally
and the brain is correspondingly smaller. (The Ferencs are suing
their adoption agency.)
 &HT;    ``We love Alex,'' Julie says, ''but this has caused our family
some major, major difficulties.'' The surprise has been that
through it all, Anastasia has been ``a comfort and a joy, a
gorgeous child.'' She might be one of the ``wounded wonders.''
 &HT;    And who would have thought so? When the Ferencs first brought
her home, Anastasia cried ``so hard and so often that she got
black-and-blue marks under her eyes,'' Julie says. ``It was a
depression _ just the depth of it _ that you wouldn't think was
possible in a child that age.'' Now she is in a special
developmental kindergarten, but she is not depressed. ``I feel
she's past that,'' Julie says. ``I feel we came out the other side
with her.''
 &HT;    ``A lot of these kids are really doing a lot better than
expected,'' Groza says. ``A lot of them have made great strides.
But I think if you adopt such a child you at least have to be
prepared for someone with special needs that may last a lifetime.
You have to be able to say, 'Well, I'd really like to have a brain
surgeon, but if I get a kid who grows up to be a McDonald's worker
who needs to be living in some sort of supportive-living setup,
I'll love him just as much.'''
 &HT;    And when you ask how the eastern European adoptees are faring as
a group, the relevant question is always, Compared with whom? As
the Ames study concluded, when the comparison is with ``children
left behind in the orphanages, the answer is very clear. All of
them are doing much better than they would have if they had never
been adopted _ in health, intelligence, having parents to whom they
can attach.''

 By BILL McKIBBEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Late in the 19th century, researchers at Clark University in
Worcester, Mass., undertook perhaps the largest study of children
that had ever been tried.
 &HT;    They sent a questionnaire to teachers around the country, asking
them for accounts of ``peculiar and exceptional'' children they had
seen in their classes, or remembered from their childhoods, or
perhaps read about.
 &HT;    Their final report included 1,045 cases, grouped by peculiarity.
Some of the children were exceptionally strong _ an 18-year-old
girl who ``lifted a corner of the piano up while her mother put the
leg in.'' Some were buffoons - ``F. 14 yrs. old. ... Rolled her
eyeballs so as to show only the whites.''
 &HT;    Some were cruel or generous or loquacious or ugly (``F. 9 yrs.
old. Ugliest person ever seen. Looks like a monkey.'') or had
birthmarks. One was timid _ or at least, at the age of 6, he was
``afraid of toads.''
 &HT;    After analyzing the ``data,'' the researchers reached two
conclusions: immigrants were more likely to be ``peculiar and
exceptional.'' And so were only children.
 &HT;    The researchers were so struck by the results that they arranged
for a follow-up study, this time of several hundred only children.
A Miss Lillie Williams, a teacher in New Jersey, provided more than
half the cases; the children were examined for health, their
adjustment to school and their play and social life. (``F. 11.
American-Jew. Nervous. ... At home she places books on chairs as
her pupils and, with another book in her hand, addresses the chairs
as her pupils.'')
 &HT;    The report ends with a homily from a nature magazine: ``It will
be noticed that all creatures which have large families ... have
less trouble in rearing them than those which have only one or two
young. Little pigs are weeks ahead of young calves, and the young
partridge, with its dozen brothers and sisters, is far more
teachable than the young eagle.''
 &HT;    In fact, according to G. Stanley Hall, who oversaw the studies
and was the acknowledged child expert of his day, being an only
child was a ``disease in itself.''
 &HT;    For the next generation this view ruled unchallenged. In the
first three decades of this century, while the foundations of
modern psychology were being laid, no one else studied the
question. Dozens of magazine articles repeated Hall's gospel.
 &HT;    ``It would be best for the individual and the race if there were
no only children,'' one journalist insisted.
 &HT;    Finally, in 1928, a man named Norman Fenton conducted the first
study to suggest that only children were, in fact, quite normal.
But he published his work in the obscure Journal of Genetic
Psychology. In any event, it was probably too late. The stereotype
had taken hold.
 &HT;    The prejudice retains much of its power today. One of the most
common reasons parents give for having a second child is simply to
provide a sibling, so the first won't be spoiled or selfish or
weird or unhappy or lonely. This is doubtless one of the notions
that have kept America's population growing faster than any other
developed nation's _ if our fertility rate were like Europe's,
where single-child families are nearly as common as two-child
families, our growth would have nearly plateaued, even with our
high immigration levels.
 &HT;    And the only-child stigma doubtless is worrying hundreds of
thousands of parents who feel themselves boxed in by long hours at
work, who feel that for them a second child would make life almost
unmanageable. Even people who have made firm _ even surgical _
decisions to have just one child wonder if they are damaging their
children by denying them a brother or sister.
 &HT;    So it came as a great relief to me to spend some time recently
with Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the
University of Texas who is one of the foremost authorities on only
children _ someone who has reliable data and real conclusions. An
only child herself, Falbo decided to study the subject in graduate
school at UCLA.
 &HT;    ``It was the early 1970s, and what we were all interested in was
stereotypes,'' she recalls. She did survey research of her own, and
with a colleague, Denise Polit, she eventually examined more than a
hundred studies done since the 1920s.
 &HT;    In the mid-1980s, Falbo and Polit concluded that ``only children
scored significantly better than other groups in achievement
motivation and personal adjustment,'' and were in all other
respects indistinguishable from children with siblings.
 &HT;    In the years since, Falbo has gone to China, home of the world's
largest pool of only children, to study reports of wildly spoiled
``little emperors.'' There too her studies, carried on across wide
swaths of urban and rural China, show that neither parents,
teachers, peers nor the children themselves found only children to
be out of the ordinary in any major way.
 &HT;    Falbo is not alone in her work, of course, not in this century
of People Studying Things. Other analyses show that only children
score somewhat higher on achievement tests than children with
siblings. Probably, say researchers, this is because parents'
resources _ especially their time _ are diluted as additional
children arrive.
 &HT;    Only children have slightly higher IQs and complete slightly
more years of school (13.5 vs. 13.2 for children with one sibling);
they are read to more often; their vocabulary scores are markedly
higher, probably because conversation in the household does not
become as childlike.
 &HT;    But are they strange? Are they badly socialized? Do they whine
all day? These are sensible questions, because only children do
miss some of the rough and tumble that comes from having brothers
and sisters. In the first place, though, most modern children spend
large parts of every day in nursery school or day care, surrounded
by other children _ they are hardly only children.
 &HT;    And here again the studies speak quite clearly. Only children
have as many friends, they're picked as quickly for teams, they
score lower on indexes of anomie and resentment. They may even be
better at sharing than other children, partly because they're used
to the idea that their turn will come. When they grow up, they make
as much money and they are slightly less likely to find themselves
at the shrink.
 &HT;    As for self-esteem, the chief concern of any right-thinking
modern parent, only children are smack in the middle of the pack.
Surveys show that firstborns have the highest self-esteem, because
they compare themselves with their smaller brothers or sisters.
 &HT;    Last-borns score the lowest, because they're always the
littlest, unable to do as much as their elders. Middle-borns and
onlies score in between, but for different reasons: middle-borns
because they're bigger than some siblings and smaller than others,
and onlies because ``their self-esteem development process is
unaffected by comparison with others.'' They are, in other words,
who they are.
 &HT;    It's a thesis confirmed, albeit pretty much by accident, in
Frank J. Sulloway's 1996 best-selling analysis of birth order,
``Born to Rebel.'' Sulloway was trying to show that older children,
with a monopoly on their parents' attention, are more likely to be
conservative, while younger children try to earn more parental
affection by breaking the mold, becoming more inventive. His
methodology has come under fire from some critics, but on only
children his results couldn't be clearer.
 &HT;    ``Singletons tend to be more variable,'' he writes. They are
``the least predictable subgroup in my family dynamics model,
precisely because they had no siblings.'' Hence Leonardo da Vinci,
Nancy Reagan, Elvis Presley, Jean-Paul Sartre and Brooke Shields.
 &HT;    Falbo stresses that the differences between onlies and children
with siblings are slight: ``It's 1 or 2 percent on the scores. If
you're sitting next to someone on an airplane, you can't tell if
he's an only.''
 &HT;    And that's really the point, she says. ``I've done this research
up one side and down the other. Believe me, my career would have
taken off _ it would have been Nobel Prize stuff _ if I'd found
that only kids were sick, sick, sick. But they're not. The
conventional wisdom is wrong.''
 &HT;    It's interesting to guess why we're so attached to this
stereotype. Partly, I think, it's because parenting is so much fun
that there's an undeniable (and biological) urge to see what the
next child will be like, and the next, and the next. And most of us
had brothers or sisters, so questioning how we would have done
without them may seem disloyal.
 &HT;    And large families have traditionally been extolled, from the
pulpit, in the pages of books like ``Cheaper by the Dozen'' and on
screens large and small. If the Brady Bunch is the ur-program of
the TV generation, it's no wonder many of us feel a little odd with
just one child.
 &HT;    And there is no denying that life as an only child is different.
Though psychologists caution that many sibling relations are
damaging, many more are wonderful. Siblings are the only people you
can share your life with, beginning to end. Though only children
may be just as happy and satisfied in their youth, there's more
chance for loneliness late in life.
 &HT;    Parents need to balance the potential of those very real
sadnesses against the realities of their own time and energy, and
also against the larger realities of a crowded planet that strains
to support even its present population.
 &HT;    As I lay in bed this morning, I could hear my 5-year-old
daughter out in the living room, singing happily to herself as she
worked a puzzle. A few hours later, we both suffered through a
noisy timeout. Tonight we snuggled on the couch and read Roald
Dahl. She's not an only child, darn it. She's a child.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these

SAN FRANCISCO MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF DISPUTED PARTNERS' LAW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ City officials have marked the first anniversary
of a contested law that has resulted in more than 1,700 companies
extending equal benefits to their employees' domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one-year anniversary shows the rest of the country that
not only do we have a symbolic victory in assuring equality in the
workplace, but there has been a tremendous practical effect,''
Supervisor Leslie Katz, co-author of the city ordinance, said
during a City Hall celebration Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was on hand to celebrate, however. With some 50
uniformed police officers standing guard, a small band of
protesters demonstrated against the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, led by the Rev. Fred Phelps of the Westboro
Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., carried signs saying gays will burn
in hell and that AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
will cure homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the demonstration, Shirley Phelps-Roper, one of Fred
Phelps' 13 children, said: ``Righteousness exalts a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuals have taken this city hostage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The law also is the target of legal challenges. The nation's
major airlines seek to overturn the ordinance. And an Ohio company
that lost out on a contract because of its failure to provide
domestic-partners benefits is suing the city in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic-partners ordinance, which took effect June 1, 1997,
requires companies that do business with the city of San Francisco
to provide the same benefits to their workers with domestic
partners _ both gay and heterosexual _ as they do to married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very proud day for San Francisco. It was a significant
day internationally when the legislation was signed,'' Mayor Willie
Brown said. ``Now that we proved it is working, my guess is that it
will be replicated in jurisdictions all over this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's Human Rights Commission has had inquiries about the
law from New York, Seattle, Madison, Wis., and West Hollywood,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, which
oversees the law, 6,331 companies have requested compliance review
by the city. Of those, 1,738 companies, with more than 700,000
employees, offer domestic partners benefits; 351 do not comply
outright; 1,366 offer no benefits to anyone and are exempt from the
law; and 755 have no employees in the United States and also are
exempt. Another 2,121 compliance reviews are pending.

DUO FINDS VERMONT A CHOICE SOURCE FOR FILM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A.   DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARNET, Vt. _ Filmmaker Jay Craven and novelist Howard Mosher
seem at first to be unlikely collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With his long hair and beard, intense air and commanding
manner, Craven comes across as the activist, organizer, and
entrepreneur that he is. This is a man who excels at the
deal-making, cajoling, improvising, innovating, stroking,
hard-selling, and creative financing necessary to make a big movie
on a small budget in an unlikely location.
</P>
<P>
   Graying, soft-spoken, and serious, Mosher looks and talks like
the high school English teacher he once was. Not so obvious is the
outdoorsman, a guy who when he's not writing is happiest walking a
forest trail or wading with rod in hand into a fast-moving trout
stream.
</P>
<P>
   What the two share is a deep love and concern for the place
where they live and work: the beautiful but remote corner of their
state that Vermonters call the Northeast Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Craven has made three films based on Mosher's work, all set in
the kingdom. The most recent is ``Stranger in the Kingdom'' _ a
story of xenophobia and racial intolerance in a small town, which
will be released in August. A fourth, ``Disappearances,' a
picaresque tale of rum-running along the Vermont-Quebec border in
the 1920s, goes into production later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others in Vermont these days, both men were born
elsewhere, the 47-year-old Craven in Pennsylvania and Mosher, 55,
in upstate New York. No longer viewed as outsiders by most natives,
``transplanted'' Vermonters like Craven and Mosher are in the
forefront of the struggle to preserve the character of a state now
going through the painful process of becoming a post-agricultural
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is affirm Vermont but not romanticize it,''
says Craven, who calls his style of filmmaking ``Vermont verismo.''
Although filmed in autumn and a delight to see, ``Stranger in the
Kingdom'' definitely doesn't sentimentalize rural life: Most of the
bad guys are dyed-in-the-wool Vermonters. Mosher's novel was
inspired by an incident that occurred in 1968 in Irasburg, Vt.
(pop. 900), where he lives. After drunken youths fired shotguns at
a black man's house, authorities trumped up an adultery charge to
drive him from town. ``It was the kind of thing that was supposed
to happen in Mississippi but not Vermont,'' says &UR;  &LR; Mosher.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher, has written five novels set in a fictional ``Kingdom
County.'' His description of the county, ``an out of the way and
little known fragment of a much earlier rural America,'' also
describes the kingdom. ``After living here more than 30 years, I'm
not a stranger in the kingdom any more,'' Mosher says, ``but it
took a long time to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes in long hand on yellow legal pads while sitting at a
table in the kitchen of his weathered white frame house. On the
wall is a framed, hand-stitched sampler that reads:

<P>
   Craven operates out of a paper- and props-cluttered office on
the second floor of a former school house in the village of Barnet
(pop. 300), 40 miles south of Irasburg. Tacked to his wall is a
large map of Vermont covered with 100 round yellow stickers; each
represents a Vermont town without a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Christmas, Craven plans to win these towns to
the cause of independent regional filmmaking by showing ``Stranger
in the Kingdom'' in town halls and church basements to audiences
that probably will have driven over miles of washboard dirt roads
to see it. ``We send a postcard to everyone in town,'' says Craven,
who is usually the projectionist, ``and it becomes a community
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they knew of each other by reputation, the two didn't
meet until 1986 when Craven wrote and asked if he could option the
screen rights to some of Mosher's work. The resulting screenplays
have been cowritten by Craven and another Vermont novelist, Don
Bredes, an arrangement that suits Mosher. ``I have input on the
final script and it's been a good collaboration,'' he says. ``I'm
one of the few authors I know of who has had his books made into
movies and liked the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Craven and Mosher say they feel an urgent need to portray
the people and capture the images of rural Vermont now, before they
change drastically or disappear. ``When I first came there were a
lot of small family farms and the French-Canadians were a distinct
group but now the farms are mostly gone and the French-Canadians
largely assimiliated,'' Mosher says. ``And the old horse loggers
and hill farmers and moonshiners and whiskey runners have vanished
like the elms on a thousand New England village greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven says he became interested in film in the early 1970s
while a student at Boston University, where he was active in the
antiwar movement. After graduation, he moved to New York to study
visual arts. ``I was very excited about film but New York was so
competitive, I didn't see how I could get anywhere,'' he says.
``And I wanted to live in a place with a sense of community and
connectedness and where everybody I knew wasn't just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1974 he settled in St. Johnsbury, Vt. ``My first year in
Vermont was the most isolating time in my life,'' Craven remembers,
``but that was good for me.'' The following year he began teaching
at an alternative school in Peacham and founded Catamount Arts, an
arts organization that ran a theater and coffeehouse and sponsored
concerts and appearances by performers such as Johnny Cash and
Peter, Paul and Mary. He founded his filmmaking company, Kingdom
County Productions, in 1991.

   Mosher discovered the Northeast Kingdom in 1964 when he and his
wife, Phillis, both fresh out of the University of Vermont's
graduate school of education, were looking for teaching jobs and
chose a school in a small town in the kingdom because the fishing
was so good. He describes the kingdom he came to then as: ``a
remote enclave of narrow glacial lakes and north running rivers,
thickly forested mountains, half forgotten hamlets, and high hill
farms home to some of the most fiercely independent individualists
left on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosher is a pretty fierce individualist himself. Instead of
suffering in silence, like most writers, when he gets a rejection
letter from an editor, or a newspaper or magazine runs a review
critical of one of his books, he nails them to the front of his
garage and blasts away with a shotgun. ``The wall of my garage has
a lot of holes in it,'' he concedes, ``but I haven't had to shoot
at it much lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get a teaching job because of his vocal opposition to
the war, in 1969 Mosher went to work in the woods for $8 a day
hauling logs for a larger-than-life local character named Jake
Blodgett, the model for Noel Lord, the protagonist of Mosher's
novel ``Where the Rivers Flow North.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake was an old rumrunner and wildcat logger but he had a
heart of gold,'' Mosher recalls, ``and I named my son after him.''
In the film ``Where the Rivers Flow North'' that Craven made in
1994, Lord was played with great gusto by veteran actor Rip Torn.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming, Craven says, it was Mosher who saved the day
by persuading a reluctant Torn _ a method actor who is also an
ardent fly fisherman _ to appear in a key scene. ``Rip is from
Texas and a thorny character and he didn't want to be shown in a
bathtub, half-naked and looking vulnerable,'' recalls Craven, ``but
he admired Howard as a writer and outdoorsman in the Hemingway mode
and he was able to get him to do the scene when I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the well-known Hollywood actors appearing in ``Stranger in
the Kingdom'' _ which had a budget of $1.8 million, minuscule by
Hollywood standards _ are Martin Sheen, Ernie Hudson, and Henry
Gibson. Most of the actors worked for scale, Craven says, attracted
by the opportunity to play larger roles than they can get in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 extras, residents of Chelsea, Vt., where most scenes
were filmed, worked for free. Sheen, who portrays an oily
prosecuting attorney, also donated his time. ``It requires
generosity and community involvement like that for a film like this
to get made,'' Craven says.

GAY PRIEST A FINALIST TO BECOME BISHOP OF NEWARK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Rev. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, an openly gay
priest, became a finalist to become the next bishop of Newark,
Barbara Harris, a friend and the Episcopal Church's first woman
bishop, made a point of showing him her hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked to me about how much it costs to be the first,''
Robinson, 50, canon to the bishop of New Hampshire, told an
Episcopal forum two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's warnings could come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   If elected by the Newark diocese Saturday, Robinson would become
the first openly homosexual bishop of the 2.5 million-member
Episcopal Church in America. He is considered by church officials
and other observers to be the top contender among six finalists to
succeed the Rt. Rev. John S. Spong.
</P>
<P>
   His candidacy is already causing an uproar in a denomination
embroiled over the issue of homosexuality. While the national
church has not forbidden the ordination of openly gay priests, and
several dioceses have been doing so for several years,
conservatives have heatedly opposed it. The issue will be debated
this summer at an international Anglican conference.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson declined to be interviewed, saying the finalists for
the Newark position had agreed not to speak with the media until
after a new bishop is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its relative small size compared to other Protestant
denominations, the influence of the Episcopal Church in America,
known for its many affluent and socially prominent parishioners,
far exceeds its numbers, and the church's positions on social
issues are closely followed.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Robinson becoming bishop is anathema to
Episcopal conservatives, who could still block his election after
Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is very clear: Is the Epsicopal Church prepared to
elevate a practicing homosexual to the rank of bishop?'' said the
Rev. Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians United, a
traditionalist evangelical group that claims 34,000 members
nationwide. ``The issue isn't whether he's likable or capable. The
issue is that the Scriptures clearly condemn homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Robinson was married with two daughters before he acknowledged
his homosexuality, according to documents he gave to the Newark
diocese.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Asked by the nominating committee in Newark to describe what
risks he had taken for his faith, Robinson wrote: ``I answered
God's call to acknowledge myself as a gay man. Risking the loss of
my children and the exercise of my ordained ministry in the church
was the biggest risk I've ever taken, but it left me with two
unshakable things: my integrity and my God.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced from his wife, &UR;  &LR; Robinson lives in Weare, N.H., with
Mark Andrew, a program manager for the New Hampshire Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   While those who know Robinson say he is not a crusader for gay
rights, he is well aware that his desire to be a bishop makes him a
public target. His supporters say he is courageously testing the
church's tolerance; Robinson brought Andrew along during a visit to
the Newark diocese two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene is one of the most prepared people in the country to
become a bishop,'' said Kim Byham, a member of the Newark
nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under church rules, even if Robinson wins approval from the
diocese of Newark he must receive a majority of votes from the
house of bishops and the standing committees of the nation's
dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, approval from the bishops and the standing committees
is a rubber stamp. A diocese's choice for bishop has never been
rejected by the national church. But Robinson's case promises to be
anything but usual. Still bitter over Harris's election as bishop
in the diocese of Massachusetts, many conservatives have vowed a
national lobbying effort against him.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Newark comes at an awkward time for the church; in
July, Anglican bishops from around the world will gather in England
for meetings they hold every 10 years. Many of the bishops have
chastised the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism,
for straying too far from Christian tenets by permitting the
ordination of women and homosexuals. There are currently eight
women among the 200 &UR;  &LR; bishops, and more than 100 openly gay
Episcopal priests nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's election would further antagonize conservative
Anglican bishops, some of whom have suggested the American church
should no longer be considered part of the worldwide communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``His consecration would be a further indication that the
Episcopal Church has abandoned traditional standards of Christine
doctrine,'' said the Rev. Sam Edwards, executive director of the
Episcopal Synod of America, another traditionalist organization
with a national membership list of about 20,000. ``If he is openly
professing his homosexuality and advocating the goodness of that
lifestyle, it would be absolutely unacceptable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some national church officials acknowledged that the timing of
the international Anglican bishops' meeting will make it difficult
for Robinson to receive approval from the national house of bishops
and the standing committees.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a priest for 25 years, is widely praised both in New
Hampshire and across the country as a talented administrator,
gifted pastor, and skilled mediator. His homosexuality was not a
factor in his being named a finalist, Byham stressed, adding that
all the finalists are committed to gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never known Gene to overexploit his sexual
orientation,'' said Bishop Walter Righter, who lives in New
Hampshire and was cleared two years ago of heresy charges for
ordaining a gay man when Righter served under Spong. The diocese of
Newark is among the most liberal; Spong has been an outspoken
advocate for the ordination of women and gays, and the blessing of
same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At a May 15 news conference in Newark after the announcement of
the finalists, Robinson told reporters: ``I think the best thing I
could do for gay and lesbian Christians would not be to be a gay
bishop, but to be a good bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part,'' said the Rev. Edward Rodman, canon to the
bishop of Massachusetts, ``is that he is such a good guy and so
competent that it would be shame if it just came down to the issue
of his homosexuality.''

NEW HEALTH ADS LINK SMOKING TO SEXUAL FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State health officials have unveiled a vivid new
advertising campaign advising young people to quit smoking to
improve their sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the public health effort is an ad featuring a
handsome man who lights up a cigarette that goes limp in his mouth,
prompting ridicule from the woman with whom he has been flirting.
</P>
<P>
   The tagline reads, ``Cigarettes. Still think they're sexy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not certain men will stop smoking to save their lungs or
their hearts,'' said Carla Agar, spokeswoman for the Department of
Health Services. ``Maybe they'll stop to save their sex lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another television commercial focuses on the dangers of
secondhand smoke. Agar said she hoped it would ``set off warning
bells'' in the minds of young parents.
</P>
<P>
   The camera flashes on a young boy on a baseball field, three
little girls whispering, an infant being bathed. ``Some of the
heaviest smokers are children,'' the narrator says. ``Of course the
smoke they inhale is from someone else's cigarette. Smoke a pack a
day at home ... your kid inhales 50 packs a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are part of this year's $22 million anti-smoking
education effort, funded by the Tobacco Tax Initiative that was
approved by voters in 1988. The advertisements target people ages
18 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at that against what the tobacco industry
spends, its a drop in the bucket,'' Agar said. ``They spend $5.1
billion marketing their deadly products nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising had drawn criticism from some anti-tobacco
interests who contend the state has toned down its message so as
not to offend tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanton Glantz, a member of the committee established by the
state legislature to oversee the public health campaign, said he
was unhappy with the ad review process set up by Gov. Pete Wilson
in 1994. Since then, according to Glantz, the input of his
committee has been ignored and all ads must be approved by Health
and Welfare Secretary Sandra Smoley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they ran the old campaign, smoking was going down. With
the new ads, since '94, smoking has been going up,'' he said. ``I
think they're committed to running a weak campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Agar defends the state's efforts, saying California is at the
forefront of anti-smoking education and has the second lowest rate
of adult smoking in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest we've been anything other than hard-hitting, and
controversial, flies in the face of reality,'' she said. ``We
depict a woman who smokes a cigarette through her throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent critic of the state's campaign said he was
encouraged by the latest messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are some of the most effective ads out in a
while,'' said David Shields of the American Nonsmokers' Rights
Foundation.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 65th anniversary of the signing of the 21st
Amendment and the repeal of Prohibition. America's grand social
experiment with the prohibition of alcohol failed, and instead we
remember the period as one of bootleggers, speakeasies, flappers,
and gangsters. America's hotels were affected in many ways by this
period. Historic Hotels of America, an association of 127 hotels
that are at least 50 years old and have maintained their historic
integrity, architecture, and ambience, have many stories from this
period. At the Lafayette Hotel in Marietta, Ohio, many staff were
suspicious of Skinny, a young bellhop who seemed to be living above
his means. How successful he was became clear after a flood (the
hotel is right on the Ohio River, and to this day has markers
indicating the height of the flood waters, including one that is
well above the lobby) that sent pint bottles of moonshine floating
up the main staircase of the hotel. Skinny, who operated the
elevator, apparently was also selling the bottles during his ups
and downs. When discovered, Skinny was fired, but reportedly
rehired moths later. Things were different at the Red Lion Inn in
Stockbridge. The inn, which was dry for more than 100 years, began
selling liquor with the passing of Prohibition. Many guests were
not happy with this. One wrote, ``As you have gone into the rum
business, I shall not come to your hotel anymore.'' Another noted
that the change was revolting to old regulars and that she had seen
a lot of ``cheap'' people at the inn. Staying at a Historic Hotel,
you can share in these stories. For a copy of a member listing
booklet, send $3 to Historic Hotels of America, National Trust for
Historic Preservation, 1785 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC
20036; or call 800-678-8946 for reservations.

SEA, SAND AND HISTORY MEET ON NORMANDY'S CALVADOS COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONFLEUR, France _ On a sunny summer day, this snug little port
on Normandy's Calvados Coast is a swirl of movement and activity,
filled with cheerful sounds and sensual aromas.
</P>
<P>
   Yachts bob in the boat basin, and flocks of cawing seagulls
circle fishing boats unloading their catches. Crowds of casually
dressed people promenade alonq the quays and meander through the
narrow streets. A buzz of animated conversation rises and falls
from sidewalk cafes along the waterfront. The air is filled with a
strong, salty smell of the sea flavored by cooking scents emanating
from Honfleur's many seafood restaurants, the Sole Normande of one
blending deliciously with the Coquille St. Jacques of another.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically situated at the mouth of the Seine River, Honfleur
in the Middle Ages was a base for the Vikings, or ``Northmen,'' who
colonized Normandy and for whom it is named. But the town's glory
days were in the 17th century, when a hardy breed of Norman
mariners, many from Honfleur, explored almost every corner of the
world and gave France an overseas empire in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1608, for instance, Samuel de Champlain set sail from
Honfleur to found Quebec in the wilds of Canada. Today, a visitor
sitting at a cafe table _ a glass of wine in hand, perhaps _ and
contemplating the delightful place Champlain left behind might well
ask: ``Why on earth would Sam want to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   About 60 miles long as the seagull flies the Calvados Coast _
the curving coastline between the mouths of the Seine and Vire
rivers _ is a necklace of beach resorts and yachting ports. Only
about a two-hour drive from Paris via the A13, a high-speed toll
road that resembles an American interstate highway, this is the
most convenient place for Parisians to savor summer at the seaside.
They do, and in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The Calvados Coast is noted for broad, sandy beaches, often with
high cliffs behind them, that have been attracting vacationers
since the mid-19th century. It was on these same wide beaches that
the allied forces landed on June 6, 1944 _ D-Day _ to begin the
liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany. Many traces of the D-Day
invasion remain, from massive bunkers, gun emplacements, and
wrecked landing craft to poignant military cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Artists long have been drawn to the area and found Honfleur
particularly appealing because of its antiquity and distinctive
architecture. Reflecting the Norse ancestry of the Normans, some
Honfleur buildings look like stone and slate versions of the
steep-roofed, wooden-stave churches of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unusual buildings is 15th-century St.
Catherine's Church, which is made entirely of wood, a very rare
thing in France. During the reconstruction of Honfleur after the
devastating Hundred Years War, the story goes, highly skilled local
shipyard workers built it as a temporary church in the only way
they knew how: like a ship. St. Catherine's has two naves, the roof
of each shaped like an inverted ship's hull.
</P>
<P>
   Honfleur became an important artists colony in the late 19th
century, and many of the Impressionist painters, including Claude
Monet, lived and worked in the town. But the artist most closely
associated with Honfleur is Eugene Boudin. Son of a local harbor
pilot and a master of the seascape, Boudin encouraged fellow
painters to come to his beloved Normandy. The Eugene Boudin Museum
in town is devoted largely to the so-called Honfleur School of art;
Boudin and his friends, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its proximity to Paris, the eastern part of the
Calvados Coast _ the so-called ``Flowery Coast,'' from Honfleur to
Cabourg _ is the most fashionable. Trouville, an old fishing port
with a fine beach, became a tony resort in 1852, when a casino was
built. Its posher neighbor Deauville, which has an equally splendid
beach, was founded a few years later and modeled after England's
then ultra fashionable Brighton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Besides beaches that in summer are forests of bright red and
yellow beach umbrellas, both Deauville and Trouville have wide
boardwalks and many old hotels and villas. But Deauville is
definitely the fancier and more resorty of the two _ ``The Monte
Carlo of the North,'' it likes to be called _ with a large and
elegant casino, a health spa specializing in sea water therapy, and
a race track.
</P>
<P>
   West of Deauville are several smaller resorts _ Bionville,
Villers-sur-Mer, Houlgate _ quiet, family-oriented places with good
beaches. Cabourg, beyond Houlgate, is a well-preserved, high
Victorian resort that looks attractive but has a reputation for
stuffiness. The invasion beaches are all to the west of the Orne
River. Because of the width of the Orne at its mouth, the coastal
road goes inland and crosses the river, and the Caen Canal that
parallels it, at Benouville, where some of the fiercest D-day
fighting occurred.
</P>
<P>
   To secure the east flank of the landing area, British
paratroopers were dropped onto Benouville the night before the
landings and captured the bridges. They held them, despite repeated
German counterattacks, until relief arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Now known as the Pegasus Bridge (the mythological winged horse
was the emblem of the British airborne forces), the canal bridge is
the scene of a seasonal sound and light show, ``The Night it All
Began.'' There is a small museum nearby and also Cafe Pegasus,
where the paratroopers set up their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe boasts that it was ``the first building in France to be
liberated.'' Still grateful, the management serves free drinks to
any British veterans of the battle who stop by.
</P>
<P>
   Ouistreham, at the mouth of the Orne on the west bank, is where
the car ferry from Portsmouth, England, disembarks. You can tell
because there are signs, in English, warning arriving
Brits:``FRANCE _ Keep Right!''
</P>
<P>
   Ouistreham was a key position in the system of coastal defenses
the Germans called ``The Atlantic Wall.'' Near the terminal is a
massive five-story-high concrete bunker, formerly a German
artillery observation post and now a museum, the bunker tells the
little-known story of the Atlantic Wall: an enormous construction
project on which more than two million people, many of them slave
laborers, worked for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ouistreham are the British Commonwealth forces landing
beaches: Sword, Juno (where the Canadians came ashore), and Gold.
There are a lot of memorials to individual units along the coast
road here, often incorporating old tanks or artillery pieces. Also
sadly numerous are signs pointing to the allied forces military
cemeteries in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy landings caught the Germans completely by surprise
because they took place on open beaches where there were no ports
with facilities for unloading supplies and reinforcements, an
essential requirement for a successeful invasion. The allies'
secret weapon was ``the mulberry harbor'': steel breakwaters towed
across from England in prefabricated sections, bolted together, and
sunk off the landing beaches to create temporary ports.
</P>
<P>
   Arromanches, a typical Calvados Coast beach resort, was right in
the middle of the landing area. And, it still has a D-Day view:
Vestiges of its mulberry harbor, ``Port Winston,'' have survived
war and weather. In the two weeks after D-Day, 2.5 million men and
half a million vehicles were landed at Arromanches. An Embarkation
Museum, with a glass wall looking directly out at the rusty but
sturdy remains of the breakwater, uses a large diorama, a mockup of
a mulberry harbor, a film of the actual landings, and multilingual
lecturers to explain how it was done.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Calvados,'' by the way, is a corruption of
``Salvador,'' the name of a Spanish galleon wrecked in a storm and
beached _ like a section of mulberry harbor _ off Arromanches
centuries ago. A landmark for mariners, in time the name of the
wreck came to be applied to all the coast here. Also, by extension,
to the famous _ and famously potent _ local apple brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Omaha Beach, where American forces suffered their heaviest
casualties, shows surprisingly few traces of the fighting, other
than scattered monuments to units that fought there. Shortly after
it was completed, the mulberry harbor serving Omaha Beach was
demolished by a violent storm, cutting off support to the troops on
shore. Faced with fierce defensive resistance as they tried to push
inland, many GIs were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The American military cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer is on a
bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. It's a beautiful, terribly moving
place that no American traveling in Normandy should fail to visit
if at all possible. There are 9,386 graves (four of them of women),
each in a long row and marked with an identical white stone cross
or Star of David. In a memorial, beside a reflecting pool, is a
22-foot-high bronze statue depicting ``The Spirit of American Youth
Rising from the Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   A path leads down from the cemetery to the landing beach.
Because of the abundance of shellfish, this stretch of coastline is
known as ``The Mother of Pearl Coast.'' And today on Omaha Beach,
once littered with artillery shells, there are almost always people
walking barefoot along the water's edge looking for seashells.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW TOWN SQUARE, Pa.: ... good meal.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk was of the ship's remarkable speed, and a report of
icebergs on its course. Strangely, Dick's father had experienced an
iceberg-steamship head-to-head joust in 1879 aboard the Arizona. He
wasn't too concerned. Then passengers and crew worked together to
stanch the leaking hull with the cargo of cotton. But it was
``inconceivable'' the Titanic could be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses were awakened in their portside cabin at 11:45 by
``merely a jar. The ship seemed to tremble slightly. The engines
were no longer throbbing. We were not excited, but felt something
had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning of the clash, they saw the only immediate evidence _ a
sailor exhibiting a bucket of ice as a souvenir. ``There was no
panic, some confusion. The band was playing lively tunes. Even if
the improbable happened and she did sink, she would float for 12 or
15 hours,'' they assumed, and ``any number of ships would stand by
to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Eureka. The steamer California came so close ``our worries were
over. But ... she serenely sailed by into the darkness.'' Distress
rockets were interpreted as celebrational fireworks for the maiden
voyage. No one was in the wireless room to hear the Titanic's
``CQD!'' signal (the predecessor to SOS).
</P>
<P>
   Father and son, with lifebelts beneath heavy fur coats, explored
the brightly lighted decks, ``although the listing made the going a
little hard.'' Harder were the ``harrowing scenes enacted when
wives were forced to leave husbands, for the order had been women
and children first.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of the insufficient number of lifeboats gone at 1:45
a.m., Dick and his father were gripped by ``a peculiar feeling,
wandering, knowing that all means of escape seemed cut off.
Everything was very still but cheerful under the circumstances. The
band was out on the deck now, still playing. It was a beautiful
night, the water full of phosphorus sparkling. A man who may have
cracked under the strain wore a high hat, wanted to save it. We
smiled, it was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But the situation turned ominous. In their wandering ``I heard
the crack of a revolver'' (possibly the suicide of first officer
Murdock, who, by some later, and disputed, accounts, had ignored
the lookout's sighting of the fatal iceberg).
</P>
<P>
   Only two decks of the gargantuan liner remained above water.
Suddenly the deck beneath them was awash. Dick knew it was time to
get away, to swim for it. He yelled to his father: ``Quick! Jump!
He started toward me just as I saw one of the four great funnels
come crashing down on top of him. For a moment I stood transfixed.
Then I jumped to the rail, about 15 feet above the rising water,
climbed over and jumped clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed I would never come up. The shock of the cold water
was quite bad. As soon as I came to the surface, with `suction' in
the back of my mind, I started swimming with all my might.'' His
life, almost snuffed by the collapsing funnel, now hung on this, a
100-or-so-yard freestyle away from the disintegrating, plunging
Titanic. Perhaps more of a flailstyle because Dick was rather
sartorially encumbered _ though maybe no more so than Worth, the
Kentucky Derby winner that year, would have been if carrying a
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   It was like swimming inside a refrigerator, and Dick, hardly
dressed for speed, may have set the the world record for a sprint
through 29-degree water in a bathing costume of trousers, shirt,
sweater, raccoon coat, shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kicked off the shoes but could not get out of my coat. In my
struggle I turned toward the ship as she was about to sink. An
extraordinary sight. As the bow went under, the stern lifted higher
and higher, then pivoted slowly over my head. Had it come down then
I would have been crushed. Looking straight up I saw the three
propellers and rudder outlined against the clear sky. She slid into
the ocean. No suction. No noise. Two or three big waves.
Stillness.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. ``Then came the horror _ the cries of 1,600 people
struggling in ice cold water. At times it grew into a roar, then
dying down. You seemed to hear groups, even individuals. Here and
there from some unfortunate came some oath, groans, a supplication
_ and there was nothing to do. Their cries grew weaker and weaker.
Presently everything was quiet, the ocean calm _ a deathly
stillness.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a small group holding to something, he swam there,
``fortunate enough to get a little place to hang onto, and threw
off my coat at last.'' His haven materialized as a ``collapsible
boat'' that had washed off the ship. Its canvas sides had indeed
collapsed, but the wooden bottom floated just below the surface, a
platform of salvation. As many as 30 in a changing cast had clung
with him. But after six hours and the arrival of the rescuing
Carpathia, ``only 13 of us were picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   They prayed, sang for a bit, tried to cheer each other up,
wondered if a ship would come in time, considered attempting to
bail out the boat with a hat. But the man wearing it refused its
use, saying, ``I'd catch cold in the night air.'' As a mother and
daughter drifted off, dead, ``We watched with prayers on our
lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-awaited dawn and deliverance came at last, ``a beautiful,
sparkling morning looking down on a group of heartbroken,
bedraggled humanity _ all that was left of the greatest ocean
steamer ever built. As my eyes swept the horizon I had my first
sight of icebergs. Five or six. The irony was that with the morning
sun on their gleaming and sparkling whiteness, they made a
beautiful, never-to-be-forgotten picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ youth, athletic fitness, guts, providence, luck? _
Dick endured. The warmth of the coming summer must have seemed
impossibly beyond reach as he hung almost paralyzed from a panel of
wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always most satisfying playing for my country,'' he
told me in a phone conversation in 1966, two years before his
death, and long before I learned of his Titanic adventure. ``The
gold medal, of course, was great fun.'' That was his 1924 Olympic
triumph alongside Bostonian Hazel Wightman in the mixed, two
old-ies-but-goodies, she 37, he 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sprained an ankle badly in the semis, and told Hazel I
probably should default, and we'd settle for the silver. Nonsense,
she replied. She told me to stay at the net and she'd cover
everything else. I didn't move much, but,'' Williams recalled
gallantly, ``Hazel ran everywhere and won the match and the medals
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   You might be surprised to learn that his Olympic gold was not in
swimming.

   HEART-YOUNG-ATHLETES (Undated) For many students, sports
physicals are a necessary nuisance to participate in sanctioned
school athletics. But too often the exams are cursory. They lack
the scope to detect a leading killer of young athletes: sudden
cardiac death, which takes 15 to 20 lives a year, according to the
American Heart Association. Could more thorough physical exams save
some young lives? That question has sparked a national debate in
the medical community over whether sports physicals should have
mandatory guidelines for cardiovascular screening. GRAPHIC

A TRUE TITANIC SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW TOWN SQUARE, Pa. _ No, she hasn't seen ``Titanic,'' and Sue
Williams has no intention of doing so. She knows the story, and
knows that her man's story _ miraculously true _ is far better than
the ones made up for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack Dawson) couldn't hang on in the
refrigerated North Atlantic that ghastly April night 86 years ago,
depicted in the award-winning flick, but her man, Dick Williams,
did. DiCaprio, the movie's hero, went under, and was last seen
wearing an iron mask.
</P>
<P>
   Almost too late in getting off at the Titanic's last stop,
Williams wasn't identified as one of those frightened, freezing,
and floundering in the North Atlantic in the film. They were all
extras, anyway. But 21-year-old Richard Norris Williams II _ Sue,
his widow, says he preferred just plain Dick _ was actually there,
his life ebbing away in the terribly big chill. Unmentioned in
Hollywood and literary accounts of the compelling sunken subject of
1912, his dreadful night's tale was amazingly improbable: of nearly
losing his life, then his legs _ yet five months later racing to
the quarter-finals of his US Tennis Championships debut at Newport,
R.I., earning a number two national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been a horrible experience,'' Sue Williams is
saying, sitting in the living room of her attractively decorated
and furnished home in New Town Square, a leafy Philadelphia suburb.
``But Dick never talked about it. His father died right in front of
him, crushed by the collapsing funnel, and Dick _ an only child _
was very close to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   A memento remains, a watercol-or of the Titanic painted by a
young boy, grandson Quincy Williams, hanging in a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how Dick felt about that, but he loved Quincy,
and so we put it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she did read the memoir of the tragedy that Williams
wrote for his family, and graciously has permitted me to quote from
it. She is charming and witty, handling her 90 years very well. Her
lively blue eyes express much amusement as she tells about the only
tennis tournament she ever won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the mixed doubles title of a small club we belonged to,
and I played with Dick. The woman of the team we beat was furious.
She told me I was one of the worst players ever.'' Sue laughs and
says, ``And she was probably right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Williams, who died 30 years ago, was one of the best, a
resident saint since 1957 in the International Tennis Hall of Fame
at Newport, R.I. Credentials: A world top-10 luminary seven times
between 1914 and 1925, he took time out for World War I in which,
as a US artilleryman at the front, he was decorated by both his own
and the French government. He was number five the last year, at age
34, won the US singles title in 1914 and 1916, doubles at Boston's
Longwood Cricket Club (with Vinnie Richards) in 1925-'26 and helped
the US win six Davis Cups as player or captain.
</P>
<P>
   However, personal accomplishments weren't things he dwelled on.
``Not long after we were married,'' Sue says, ``Dick remarked that
he was tired of all the trophies around the house. He packed up 162
of them, had them melted down, and ordered one tray made, right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   She exhibits the extraordinary bauble, engraved with signatures
(from correspondence) of all the great players of his time,
including the greatest, Bill Tilden, and first US champ Dick Sears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did keep the US singles and doubles trophies, and, over
there, his prize for winning the Wimbledon doubles'' in 1920, with
Chuck Garland. ``But,'' she says, chuckling, ``look at it.'' The
fine sterling tray is as scarred and scratched-up as an aging
hubcap. He casually used it for a carving platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He truly played for the fun of it, not tangible rewards,''
says another visitor, grandson Quincy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial score of his 1916 US title win over Bill Johnston
(4-6, 6-4, 0-6, 6-2, 6-4, at Forest Hills) tells much about his
all-or-nothing approach, a daring style that made the likable
6-footer immensely popular. A dashing presentation and shotmaking
artistry meant more than merely winning a match as he nervelessly
shot for winners whatever the situation. After the Titanic and the
slaughterhouse of war, tennis must have seemed a lark.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh how close Williams came to never striking another ball.
While others clinging with him to a submerged liferaft slipped away
in death _ ``they didn't drown, they froze,'' he recalled _ Dick
hung in. For six hours, until rescued by the steamer Carpathia as
one of the slim, lucky minority, the alumni of the Big T. Of the
1,677 in the water, only 42 lived.
</P>
<P>
   By then, his legs were frozen stiffer than Republican resistance
to campaign finance reform, and a physician on board ``cheerfully
advised'' immediate amputation, to fight hypothermia and defend
against the expected onset of gangrene.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Williams vetoed that medical judgment and delivered
the gutsiest performance of a long sporting career. Somehow getting
to his feet _ ``As I tried to stand it was like thousands of
needles going through my legs'' _ he began to lurch and trudge.
Half-dead man walking, he forced himself to step out and away from
the surgeon's crippling blades. ``I tramped the decks constantly
even through the nights, getting up every two hours to walk some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Dick Williams was in circulation again. In three
months, he hit the US tennis scene running on those recently
petrified pins. Virtually springing from ice water to boiling
shotmaking and electrifying achievements, Dick won his American
bow, the Pennsylvania Grass tourney at Philadelphia's Merion
Cricket Club, beating Tilden along the way.
</P>
<P>
   He was brilliant, pure, and uninhibited, a college boy with
close-cropped chestnut hair succeeding spectacularly also in a
higher league. Immediately after capturing the national
intercollegiate title for Harvard in 1913, he was instrumental in
the US seizure of the Davis Cup from Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A voyage that started out at Cherbourg as fun for young Dick on
the brand-new, supposedly invulnerable Titanic became anything but.
He had grown up and become an exceptional player in Switzerland, a
climate recommended as beneficial to the delicate health of his
father, Philadelphia attorney Duane Williams. Father and son were
traveling to the United States to enroll Dick in the class of 1916
at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Fateful luck, measles for Dick, delayed their journey. Thus, the
Titanic's unveiling became an option they selected ``because of its
reputation for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so big, so queenly, four city blocks long,'' Williams
wrote. ``She felt very safe and sound.'' Seated at the captain's
table for the ship's ``elaborate'' last supper, Sunday night, April
14, ``all of us had the human weakness to overindulge.'' Later, in
the water during his blackest night, he would think, ``I'm darned
lucky I had such a good meal.''

``BILL OF RIGHTS'' FOR PATIENTS BADLY NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The health insurance industry has declared war on legislative
efforts in Congress aimed at restoring consumer confidence in,
ironically, the health insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans enrolled in managed health care plans
such as HMOs has grown from 13 percent in 1987 to 75 percent today
_ or 138 million out of 185 million with private health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the percentage of consumers who believe that
insurance plans often compromise the quality of health care to save
money has risen to 80 percent, according to some polls.
</P>
<P>
   This obvious lack of consumer confidence in managed care is
directly related to the restrictions the plans place on both
doctors and patients, often at the expense of the sacred
doctor-patient relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Some managed care plans, for example, have gag rules that
prevent doctors from telling patients about services that are not
covered, or from ``making referrals to the specialists they
consider most appropriate to treat a patient's condition,'' surveys
show.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans also place physicians at financial risk for
recommending costly, but necessary, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have become so restrictive that more than 2,000 physicians
from across the nation signed a manifesto that said: ``Physicians
and nurses are being prodded by threats and bribes to abdicate
allegiance to patients, and to shun the sickest, who may be
unprofitable. Some of us risk being fired or `delisted' for giving,
or even discussing, expensive services, and many are offered
bonuses for minimizing care.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation called The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, would provide doctors and nurses with
protection against such retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the bill provides more rights to patients in
need of costly but vital referrals to physicians who are not in
managed care plans. This consumer ``bill of rights'' has been under
increasing attack from conservative Republican senators as well as
from lobbyists for corporate interests and the health insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For example, the deceptively named Health Benefits Coalition,
which consists of about two dozen chief executives from the
Washington-based Business Roundtable, recently began a major
lobbying effort aimed at scuttling the Kennedy bill.
</P>
<P>
   The group ostensibly argues that providing such protections and
rights to doctors and patients would raise the cost of managed
health care and place an unfair burden on businesses providing
their employees with such insurance. They argue that the
free-market system, with no federal regulations, is the way to
improve quality in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP senators realize these arguments do not match the
strength of the Kennedy bill, which is reflected in polls saying
that 90 percent of US consumers see a need for regulation of health
insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Senator Alfonse D'Amato is pushing his own
legislation designed to replace, rather than destroy, the Kennedy
bill. The New York Republican's bill replicates only a section of
Kennedy's measure, specifically a provision for 48-hour hospital
stays for women with mastectomies and coverage of reconstructive
breast surgey after a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato recently attacked supporters of Kennedy's bill for
delaying D'Amato's. Kennedy, in turn, is demanding a vote on his
more comprehensive legislation.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been suggesting that Kennedy, by not supporting
D'Amato's bill, is basically anti-woman, a charge that is as
ludicrous as D'Amato's attempt to portray himself as a women's
rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   One thing consumers have that gives them a chance against this
health industry Goliath is Kennedy himself, who &UR;  &LR; proved to be more
than a match for corporate giants who unsuccessfully fought his
minimum wage bill.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry knows that the next rock in Kennedy's
political slingshot, his Patients' Bill of Rights, is pointed right
at them.

IT'S SHOW AND TELL TIME ON CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   June is the time for show and tell at area colleges and
universities. At Harvard Business School, a sparkling little
exhibition opened yesterday, ``Options Pricing in Theory and
Practice,'' celebrating professor Robert Merton's Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   At Northeastern University they are emphasizing Mikhail
Gorbachev's connection with the school (he'll give the commencement
address). At Boston College this month, a series of enormous
canvases by painters known collectively as the Bogside Artists will
trace the evolution of the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Norman Leventhal's
maps of Boston are on display.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the exhibition of the maps is a story. And behind the
story is a moral.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the Depression year of 1933, when
15-year-old Leventhal was admitted to Harvard College along with 40
or 50 other graduates of Boston Latin School. Tuition was $400.
With a sister at Simmons College and an older brother at MIT,
Leventhal was $100 short. He applied for a scholarship but didn't
get it.
</P>
<P>
   So for a year, he worked. When he went back, however, he was
still $100 short. The answer on the scholarship was still no. Then
the Dorchester native walked the 2-mile stretch of Massachusetts
Avenue that separates Harvard from MIT, and checked with the
director of admissions there. This time a stipend was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal graduated in 1938 with a degree in civil architecture.
During World War II, he worked as a naval architect at the Boston
Navy Yard, and afterward, with his brother Robert, he went into
real estate development. They prospered, and in due course pulled
off a series of civic-minded triumphs: Center Plaza across from
City Hall, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Rowes Wharf, One Post Office
Square, South Station, and the little green park in Post Office
Square that now bears Leventhal's name.
</P>
<P>
   When last year he sold Beacon Properties to Chicago real estate
magnate Sam Zell, it was for $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal is hardly the only person _ student or faculty _ to
have made his way to MIT after being discouraged by faint support
at Harvard. Several of the most celebrated Cambridge scholars of
the 20th century made their way to Kendall Square after Harvard
failed to find them a permanent place: the applied mathematician
Norbert Wiener, the economist Paul Samuelson, the linguist Noam
Chomsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were each of these fugitives fleeing from the mild but
stubborn anti-Semitism that Harvard shared with other elite
institutions until the 1950s. MIT's very first hire, after all, was
a chemistry professor Harvard had passed over in favor of physicist
Willard Gibbs. A few years later Harvard hired back the chemist,
Charles Eliot, to be its president.
</P>
<P>
   In this way all citizens of Boston have benefited from the
subtle meritocratic rivalry that MIT has posed to Harvard. Attempts
by Harvard to simply acquire MIT twice were thwarted in the early
years of the 20th century _ once by the MIT faculty, which refused
to go along with the deal its administrators had negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Harvard drew the proper moral from such defections. In
the 1950s and '60s, it shed many of its complacencies and local
prejudices and transformed itself from a regional institution to a
thoroughly national one.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and '90s, it has mounted a similar campaign to
become the world's first truly global university. As the Globe's
Dan Golden and John Yemma reported Sunday, some 250 people now
labor in Harvard's development office, raising funds to support the
university's enormous overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are some whose omnivorous attention has been
attracted by the collection of 400-odd maps of historical interest
that were assembled over the years by Leventhal.
</P>
<P>
   His maps are extraordinary by any definition. They include
several early depictions of the New World, and a series of maps of
Boston that may be the premier collection in the world. (A handsome
volume devoted to them is scheduled to be published next year as
``Mapping Boston.'') Besides Harvard, the Library of Congress has
pursued a gift of the collection, as has MIT and the Boston Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old Leventhal has promised to announce a decision
soon.

A HEARTBEAT AWAY: SUDDEN DEATH BECAUSE OF HEART FAILURE XXX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH HEART-RYAN and HEART-MORRELL)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Pennington desperately wanted to play football and no one,
not even his doctor, thought the 13-year-old's asthma would get in
the way. But the condition masked a congenital heart problem that
killed the teenager on his first day of fall practice in Caldwell,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Western Washington University's Duke Wallenborn lived to play
basketball, and did so, despite being diagnosed as a child with a
heart problem known as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. But his
heart condition caught up with him, and took his life in his junior
year of college at the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State University's Hayward ``Spud'' Harris, 21, was
an imposing presence on the football field, an All-State lineman
from Lakewood's Lakes High School. But his life suddenly was cut
short on his first day of fall drills. Horrified teammates watched
him slump over on the field of an apparent heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   All three succumbed to sudden cardiac death, which takes the
life of one young athlete in every 200,000 _ 15 to 20 a year _
according to the American Heart Association. Only violent head and
spinal injuries cause more deaths among young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But the trio shared something more: Each had passed a standard
physical exam and was cleared to play a strenuous sport.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are statistics in an ongoing debate about whether a
sports physical should include the most effective tools to spot a
potentially fatal heart problem: an electrocardiogram (ECG), the
most common test of a person's cardiac system, or an
echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to evaluate a heart's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict centers on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _Whether testing could prevent athletes from placing themselves
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether it would cost too much and who would pay.
</P>
<P>
   _Whether it actually would save lives.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study suggests tests could be performed in a
large-scale program for as little as $10 per athlete through
competitive bidding, while other estimates place the cost at much
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a way to detect it ... what is a life worth?''
asked Tom Wallenborn, Duke's father. He said his son sometimes had
spells in which his heart would race, but was told by doctors he
was in no danger playing sports. He died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he went to college, I took him in to a cardiologist
just to make sure, because I figured playing ball at the college
level would be more vigorous and I just wanted to make sure
everything was all right,'' said Wallenborn, of Vancouver, Wash.
``That's when it was labeled Wolff-Parkinson-White and the doctor
told me and Duke that it was a non-life-threatening situation. So
with that clean bill of health, we sent him on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Rice, who tracks sports injuries involving young
athletes, will never forget hearing about Harris' death in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many years it has been, but why do I remember
Spud Harris? Because he dropped dead on the campus just a couple
days after he had his physical,'' said Rice, a national expert on
sports injuries and young athletes. ``When that happens, you stand
up straight and say, `What can we do to prevent it? This is really
unbelievable.'''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent deaths of Washington state high school students
participating in sports both occurred in 1992:
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 14-year-old Clarissa Erickson, a freshman at R.A.
Long High School in Longview died after a three-mile, cross-country
race. A coroner's report showed she had a rare heart defect that
wasn't detected in a physical.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, Stacey Olson, 17, died of heart failure at Liberty
High School near Spokane after collapsing during a gym class _ 50
feet from where his twin brother, Tracey, had died of a heart
problem in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Washington and many other states advise parents that
sports physicals should include a detailed family medical history,
one of the most valuable resources a physician has to determine the
risk of heart problems. Doctors also are supposed to perform a
blood-pressure test and listen to the heart for signs of murmurs or
other problems. A stress test is optional, but most states advise
that it be done.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Edwards, Pennington's mother, said her son's physical in
the summer of 1993 lasted only minutes. He did that August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even had to ask that they do a blood test, or it wouldn't
have been done,'' Edwards said. ``The doctor looked at him with a
stethoscope, he looked at his tonsils ... and then he pretty much
released him.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Pennington been tested with an echocardiogram, Edwards
believes, her son's congenital heart problem would have been
detected. Instead, it wasn't found until his autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had done an `echo' on Jason, he would still be alive
today,'' Edwards contends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such cases, a 1996 panel put together by the American
Heart Association determined that running every young athlete
through advanced heart testing during a sports physical would be
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which included one of the nation's leading experts in
sudden deaths, Dr. Barry J. Maron of the Minneapolis Heart
Institute, estimated that the tests would cost an average of $600
per athlete, and that they wouldn't save many lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at $500 per (test), it would theoretically cost $250,000
to detect even one previously undiagnosed case,'' the panel wrote,
because of the odds of an athlete having a potentially fatal heart
defect.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, the cost
of an ECG, an echocardiogram and related tests can cost up to
$2,000, said cardiologist Dr. James French.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to do the groundwork before such tests are
performed _ a full physical involving a stress test and treadmill
test, combined with an extensive family history.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any history of problems such as fainting spells,
abnormal heart beats, shortness of breath or a family history of
heart disease, French advised parents not to wait to get their
child's sports physical done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the signs of (heart) diseases don't happen when
you're sitting quietly waiting for the physical to begin,'' he
said. ``A lot of the things that cause the problems have to be
provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the most comprehensive way to detect
potential problems is to use an ECG or an echocardiogram. But the
main issue is the cost of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this cardiac screening with an ECG can be accomplished for
$10 per athlete and has to be done only once during a four-year
high school career, the task becomes manageable,'' wrote Rice,
former director of the Athletic Health Care System at the
University of Washington, who for years has studied and tracked
sports injuries among young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, currently at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in New
Jersey, was responding to a study published in the September 1997
issue of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. The study
screened 5,615 athletes in Nevada schools to determine the
effectiveness of an ECG as part of a full physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   While the study found no specific cases of the most common fatal
heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 582 students were
discovered with other heart abnormalities after answering a family
history questionnaire, taking a blood-pressure test and having an
ECG screening. Of those, the ECG detected 146 students with
abnormal heart beats, heart wave abnormalities and other
irregularities. Sixteen students were not approved to play sports
and were referred for further testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the objective is to reduce the number of nontraumatic
sudden deaths on the high school playing fields, then we suggest
performing an ECG once in the athletic career of a high school
athlete,'' concluded the Nevada study headed by Dr. Colin M.
Fuller, the Sierra Nevada Cardiology Associates and the Sierra
Heart Institute, all of Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ECG tests can be performed by a cardiac technician without
a physician being present at the time,'' the study said. ``The ECGs
can be computer interpreted and over-read by a qualified physician
off-site ... and the authors estimate that a cost of $10 per ECG,
including technical and professional fees, is a reasonable
estimation.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, Rice suggests doing a study
involving 120,000 young athletes to put them through full heart
examinations to determine the true cost and effectiveness of such
examinations on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to work it with many thousands of people
to have big enough numbers to let things show up statistically,''
Rice said. ``Plus, it's the issue of finite health-care resources.
In other words, you have to think of how much money is spent doing
all these false tests, and all these people inconvenienced, to find
what maybe is 10 people a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted, ``When a kid drops dead playing sports, that's
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Maron said he realizes that the death of a young athlete
``strikes to the core of our sensibilities.'' But he stands by
recommendations made by the Heart Association panel and believes
there is no practical way to do extensive, cost-effective testing
on a large-scale basis.
</P>
<P>
   In its recommendations to the Heart Association, Maron's panel
looked at 158 sudden deaths nationwide among young athletes between
the years 1985 and 1995. Of those, 134 were linked to heart
problems, and nearly all had passed routine physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found one common factor: almost all the deaths
occurred during or after intense exercise. But more than 20
different heart disorders were found in the deaths. Maron said he
doubts that performing specific heart tests during physicals would
have caught many more cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are rare diseases, so they are going to be uncommon and
you have a lot of athletes,'' Maron said. ``So the numerator is
small, the denominator is large, the tests are expensive, at least
at retail value ... and it's not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cost could be reduced from the Heart Association
panel's estimate of $600 per athlete to $10, Maron asks who would
pay for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you made it $1, I think there would be some situations
where that would be too much,'' he said. ``If you're talking about
broad-based screening, you're talking about everybody.'' That
includes the estimated 4 million high school-age athletes, the
500,000 college-age athletes and about 5,000 professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Maron said, ``we are stuck'' with the standard
physical and family medical history as the best way to detect early
warning signs of heart disease and sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Maron said he hopes the screening guidelines
developed by his panel have helped physicians around the country
become more aware of the dangers of heart disease in young
athletes. But he warns: ``Don't assume that clearance by history
and physical screening excludes all forms of heart disease that
might be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smaha, director of athletic medicine at WSU, was on the
field in 1979 when Harris suddenly died. Smaha performed
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but could not revive the 270-pound
lineman. Harris was the second person he had to try to revive in
his first two years at WSU.
</P>
<P>
   The other one, a former Cougar basketball player, had a heart
attack but was rushed to the hospital after manual CPR and placed
on a defibrilator, which restored the rhythm of his heart by
applying a brief, high-energy electric shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked out of there with no brain damage and sends me a
Christmas card every year,'' Smaha said. ``That was the good one.
The other one was Spud. And quite frankly, I was on top of him
within 30 seconds. ... But he was basically gone at that time and
we didn't realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rice, Smaha is haunted by Harris' death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you've had this kind of thing happen at
Washington State and it's right in front of you there, it makes you
take a second look and second-guess how you do things,'' Smaha
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Athletic Trainers Association, like the American
Heart Association, has studied the issue of whether an ECG should
be performed on college athletes. To Smaha, finding heart disease
that can cause sudden death is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times people have conditions that you are not going to
find doing all these tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he said, the first warning sign comes with a heart
attack. Or someone just suddenly dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's sheer luck that people are caught, said
cardiologist Dr. Dan Doornik, a former Seahawk and Washington State
running back.
</P>
<P>
   The unlucky ones are athletes like Duke Wallenborn, who suffered
a heart attack in his sleep the day after a game and only days
before he was scheduled to see a specialist about the possibility
of heart surgery to correct his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew something was wrong since he was probably 3 years old
when he came in one day and his heart was beating fast,'' father
Tom Wallenborn said. ``At that time, which was the early 1970s, no
one really knew what the problem was and said that he would
probably outgrow it. It never seemed to slow him down. When it
would happen, he'd just sit down and in two or three minutes it
would go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallenborn said his son's heart began racing more frequently
during his last basketball season at Western, but the condition was
not limited to the basketball court. He still questions whether his
son should have been cleared by doctors to continue playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is so frustrating and questionable,'' Wallenborn
said. ``That he had this his whole life and then we find a way to
take care of the problem, but it's too late.''

   SPEEDING THE NET &QC; 
The Inside Story of Netscape and How It Challenged Microsoft &QC; 
By Joshua Quittner and Michelle Slatalla &QC; 
Atlantic Monthly Press, 323 pp., $25 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. should be dead by now. Well,
comatose, at least.
</P>
<P>
   This brash little start-up made its mark with Navigator, the
most popular software for cruising the Internet. It introduced
millions of people to on-line life. And when Netscape stock went
public, the company's value soared to $4.4 billion in a single day
_ a record that stunned Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Netscape, its performance also stunned the
titans at Microsoft Corp. Bill Gates and his notoriously
competitive lieutenants had no intention of allowing this upstart
company to undermine the Microsoft empire. They responded with a
relentless counterattack that seemed likely to drive Netscape to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't happened. Netscape may be bleeding cash and losing
market share, but the Netscape story is far from over. Which
explains the unfinished tone of ``Speeding the Net,'' a breezy and
fast-paced history of the company. The book, by veteran computer
writers Joshua Quittner and Michelle Slatalla (he's familiar from
his work at Time, she from hers for The New York Times), is short
on deep analysis of the company and the industry, and it presents
little new information. But it does serve up a lucid, readable
overview of the computer industry's fiercest competitive rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It begins, in classic computer-industry style, with a couple of
kids. One of them, Marc Andreessen, has since become a living
legend, obscuring the role of his equally important colleague, Eric
Bina. In 1992, Andreessen and Bina, then students at the University
of Illinois, began hacking up an Internet browser that would
display pictures as well as text. The result was Mosaic, the first
popular Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   After Andreessen graduated, in 1993, his work came to the
attention of Jim Clark, physicist and cofounder of Silicon Graphics
Inc. Clark, in search of new worlds to conquer, met with Andreessen
and began dreaming up ways to make money in the fledgling Internet
business. As with the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in the 1930s,
the two men knew they wanted to start a business, but not what the
business would actually do. They batted around a host of ideas
before settling on building a better browser.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the original Mosaic team, that's what they did.
Netscape released Navigator in 1994. For the first time since
Microsoft's Windows 3.0 hit the market, in 1990, somebody had
produced a computer program that set the world on fire. Within
weeks of its release, millions of people around the world had
become loyal Netscape users.
</P>
<P>
   By August 1995, when Netscape stock went public, Microsoft was
gearing up to strike back. The company would license the original
Mosaic software made by Andreessen and Bina, and use it as the
basis for a much better browser built right into the Windows
operating system at no extra charge. It was a strategy well suited
to devastate Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But was it illegal, as federal and state antitrust regulators
are now contending in their suit against Microsoft? Some
information in the book tends to vindicate Microsoft. Quittner and
Slatalla show that Microsoft executives launched a plan to add
Internet browsing to Windows 95 back in the spring of 1994, before
Netscape's founding. This jibes nicely with Microsoft's assertion
that the built-in browser was simply a logical product improvement,
not an illegal effort to crush a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is also likely to be popular at the Justice
Department. It features some of those notorious Microsoft internal
documents that frankly discuss using the linkage between operating
system and browser as a way to destroy Netscape's core business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Microsoft had grown accustomed to competing against firms
like IBM, Lotus Development Corp., and Apple Computer Inc. _
companies whose repeated blunders paved the way for Microsoft's
dominance. Not this time. While Microsoft's onslaught devastated
Netscape's market share in browsers, Netscape has fought back with
courage and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken its share of flak for urging the Justice
Department to investigate Microsoft: Cynical folks like me have
accused them of being crybabies. But there's no denying that the
gambit has worked, with a big assist from the arrogant moguls of
Microsoft. Netscape has bought itself some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's trying to transform itself into an Internet media
company. Its Netcenter Web site is already one of the Internet's
most popular. Now Netscape is adding a host of news, information,
and Internet search features to attract millions of regular
visitors, as well as millions in advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Netscape matched Microsoft's browser giveaway
strategy, it's even giving away the underlying ``source code'' used
to write its browsing software. This has made Netscape the darling
of hard-core techies, and the leader of a fledgling movement to
expand the use of ``open source'' software as an alternative to the
Microsoft empire.
</P>
<P>
   But will the new strategy work? Quittner and Slatalla, for all
their skills in telling the story thus far, are as much in the dark
as the rest of us.

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a 24-year-old sophomore guard for the Seattle
Pacific University basketball team, Ryan Sowards is fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Not because he was able to pursue a professional baseball career
in the minor leagues and still return to his game of passion,
collegiate basketball. And not because he averaged 12.7 points a
game and started 24 of 30 games last season after not playing
basketball for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Sowards is fortunate he's still healthy and able to play sports
at all. He lives with a condition, supraventricular tachycardia,
that causes rapid heartbeats. The condition is similar to the
irregular heart beat experienced by former Seattle SuperSonics
forward Terry Cummings, who has had a long and successful NBA
career despite his ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a little circus going on inside my heart,''
Sowards said. ``It's like my heart skips a beat and the next beat
is really hard. I've had it for so long that it's very easy to tell
when it starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Supraventricular tachycardia can cause palpitations, dizziness,
light-headedness or unconsciousness. In some cases, it can lead to
death unless medical help is provided immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Sowards remembers the day he knew something was wrong. He was
pitching a Little League baseball game when he started to feel
faint and noticed his heart racing. A doctor at the game
recommended that he be checked thoroughly. Doctors at University
Hospital in Seattle discovered his condition and ultimately treated
it with medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, you pretty much think you're invincible and
nothing is going to happen to you,'' Sowards said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he knows his heart inside and out. He said his condition is
caused by his A-V node, which sends electrical current to the
heart, causing it to beat. He had a leak on one side of the node,
so the heart would beat with a faster rhythm to compensate for the
irregular flow of current.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm having an episode and my heart is racing, I'm not
supposed to play. I should sit out until I can get it under control
or stop it,'' Sowards said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a sophomore at Bothell High School, Sowards had
heart surgery to correct the problem by cauterizing the leak.
Within a week after leaving the hospital, he scored 28 points in a
basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   But despite surgery, the condition remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the operating table for six to eight hours, and (the
heart defect) was in too difficult of a spot for them to fix it,''
Sowards said. ``But the doctors were able to figure out what kind
of medications stimulated and reduced it ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Few people know what Sowards has gone through to continue his
athletic career. For almost four years, he pursued baseball at
Walla Walla Community College and for the Los Angeles Dodgers farm
system as a pitcher and catcher before he decided to return to SPU
and reclaim his basketball eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough road, and it's taken a while to get back
into the swing of things,'' Sowards said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, he leaves his heart condition in the
past.

 (WITH HEART-YOUNG-ATHLETES and HEART-MORRELL)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Chuck Morrell watched his beloved Washington State Cougars
prepare for their first Rose Bowl in 67 years, he was grateful he
had lived long enough to see one of his dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   But the 60-year-old Morrell, who set the record for WSU's
longest run from scrimmage (87 yards in 1958), wasn't at the Los
Angeles Coliseum just to relive old glories.
</P>
<P>
   After a career as a screenwriter and Hollywood producer, Morrell
was on a mission to bring attention to one of the most frightening
foes some young athletes face: sudden death caused by heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being lucky to be alive doesn't mean much to me any more.
I want to do something about it,'' Morrell said of a malady that
takes about one life in every 200,000 young athletes each year.
</P>
<P>
   Morrell is more than familiar with heart disease. In 1991, he
lost his twin brother, Gary, a longtime Seattle broadcaster and
sports announcer, because of a condition known as Hypertrophic
Cardiomyopathy (HCM). Gary's two sons died of sudden heart failure
at ages 12 and 14. Morrell's mother, Virginia, died of heart
failure at 54, and his half-sister died in her sleep at age 3.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Morrell is still around to tell his story is
because of a heart transplant in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As he looked out onto the football field in California on New
Year's Day, Morrell wondered how many other young athletes could be
hiding the same ticking time bomb he had _ HCM _ without knowing
it.
</P>
<P>
   With him was his brother's grandson, Tyler, who was diagnosed
with HCM last year at age 11, and has an automatic cardiac
defibrilator surgically implanted into the chest muscle to
stimulate his heart when an irregular heartbeat occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day and age, we had no idea what was going on,'' Morrell
said. `` ... But we haven't advanced much farther and that's why
I'm trying to do what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrell, who has appeared in films such as ``The Sting,'' and TV
shows such as ``Ironside,'' ``Banacek'' and ``McCloud,'' is
producing a documentary film to spread the word to young athletes
and their parents. He hopes to complete the film by the end of the
year with an eye toward broadcast on a cable network, such as the
Learning Channel. He still is seeking funding.
</P>
<P>
   He considers sudden death from heart failure to be a public
health problem that has gone virtually unrecognized since the days
he played college sports.
</P>
<P>
   The script of his documentary, ``Without Warning,'' begins with
Morrell recalling his 87-yard run, which he figures would have been
a touchdown if not for his hidden heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had started on our own 3-yard line and fell to the ground on
their 10-yard line,'' Morrell recalled. ``No one tackled me. I just
ran out of gas. I tripped over the line marker. I fell on my ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Morrell feels lucky that his actual heart failure didn't
occur until later in life and that he lived to see the Cougars
return to glory. So, now he's more determined than ever to
publicize sudden death in young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know anything about it,'' Morrell said.
``People always used to laugh at me when we were doing dummy
scrimmages, because you were supposed to run eight yards or so and
then turn around to come back to the huddle. Well, I used to always
run another 50 yards just because I wanted to do it. With my
condition, I could have died in a moment's notice, but we didn't
know it then.''
</P>
<P>
   His own personal struggle with heart disease now gives Morrell's
life a renewed purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``But there has to be some reason for
it.''

TRADITIONAL BRIDAL WHITE GIVES WAY TO COLOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here come the brides, all dressed in ... yellow? Blue? Green?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. This spring, many brides are shunning the almost
sacred white wedding gown in favor of radical colors like ice blue,
mint green, soft pink, lavender, and even sherbet orange.
</P>
<P>
   No, these aren't just second-time brides. They're modern brides,
women who consider fashion and personal style more important than
old-fashioned societal rules and symbolism. They think white gowns
all look the same, don't flatter their complexion, or aren't flashy
and memorable enough to justify the average $500 to $2,500 price
tag. Their role models aren't society matrons but celebrities like
Elizabeth Taylor (who wore a yellow gown in her most recent
marriage, to Larry Fortensky in 1991).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nontraditional,'' says Christine Perkins of Back Bay, who
chose for her wedding a yellow gown she saw on a movie star in
InStyle magazine. Says Perkins, a brown-eyed blonde of 32, ``When I
put white on, it makes me look washed out. Yellow brings out my
skin tone.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, colorful wedding gowns aren't for everyone (white
and ivory remain the clear favorites, retailers report). Some
traditionalists maintain that the new color concept is almost
sacrilegious, since custom links white symbolically with virginity.
``This trend is a total reflection on the family and how we view
family,'' says LeRoy Attles, pastor of St. Paul AME Church in
Cambridge. ``The whole notion of marriage is invaded now. People
live together before they're married or they don't get married.
It's almost a mockery to put on a white dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari Thurer, a psychology professor and authority on cultural
studies at Boston University, says many women are more motivated by
magazines and TV shows than social conventions. ``The whole social
construction of marriage, weddings, and romance is very
disconnected from religious sources. People would rather be
copycats of models and celebrities. They like to mimic their
lifestyles,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Other women might use a colorful gown ``as a mechanism for
rebellion or to be exhibitionist or to take the hinge off a
controlling mother,'' Thurer says. ``Outrageousness is in. But
there are very individual reasons for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some brides concede that the decision to break protocol isn't
easy. Rather than face clucking tongues before the wedding, they'd
prefer to surprise everybody. ``I didn't tell my mom. I told her I
don't want to show her,'' says Perkins. ``And I didn't tell the
priest either. I didn't want to shock him. My family is very
traditional,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Harrison, 31, of Johnston, R.I., also hasn't told her
fiance about her gown, for their upcoming wedding Sept. 27: a gold
lace dress (with ivory satin showing underneath). ``He's very
conservative,'' she says. ``Once in a while, I get a little
nervous. `Oh my God. Is this too much? Everyone else is going with
white.' It's definitely not a traditional wedding gown. But you
know, you only live once.''
</P>
<P>
   The white gown is certainly the most identifiable aspect of
American weddings. Many young women grow up dreaming about the day
they'll wear all white. But some women today report that when the
time came to actually try on white-dress samples, the uniformity of
it all gave them the blahs. They wanted something more exciting and
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want an ordinary gown,'' says Harrison. ``When you
look at people's photo albums, all the gowns look the same. They
have puffy sleeves, beads, and, of course, white fabric.'' Harrison
believes that with her gold gown, ``at least people will notice it.
It has a lot of style to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Litchfield of Hamilton chose a pink gown for her big day
last month. ``White is too stark. It's too much of a contrast
against my skin,'' says Litchfield, 26. ``The pink gives the dress
a lot of character, a lot of life.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase the impact of their colored dresses, some brides are
asking their bridesmaids for the unheard of _ to wear white.
``Bridesmaids' dresses are looking more bridal,'' says Yolanda
Cellucci, owner of Yolanda's boutique in Waltham, which is
showcasing only ice-blue wedding gowns in its windows. ``They have
to wear white or ivory so the bride stands out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in some countries, like India and China, many brides
wouldn't even consider white. The color of choice there is red.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over color isn't so new in the United States either.
American brides in the 1800s wore the best dress they owned, and it
was typically black or blue, says Sandra Newman, a professor of
pattern design at Lasell College in Newton and a wedding-gown
designer herself. ``It was usually a dark color because you
couldn't get light colors clean,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``White (a tradition popularized in England by Queen Victoria in
the early 1800s) was for the rich, who didn't care if they only
wore the dress once,'' Newman says. By the early 1900s, more
American women were wearing white ``to show off how rich they
were,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, colors like pink and mint green have appeared
occasionally in bridal stores (particularly in the 1950s, early
1960s, and even in the late 1980s). But never with such variety,
retailers say. And they often weren't selected by first-time
brides.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the design house Christian Dior plans to introduce
something not for the fainthearted: a chocolate-brown wedding
dress. New York designer Angel Sanchez plans to introduce in his
bridal collection this fall dresses in light brown, silver, and
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for something different,'' Sanchez says.
``This is one of the most important moments in a woman's life.
White is so plain. I find young people are open to different
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, mothers seem supportive of the trend, at least in some
families. Some of these moms wore pink themselves, some 30 years
ago. Marie D'Eramo of Melrose actually pushed her daughter Kristen
D'Eramo Gerety to choose a colored gown for her wedding in October
1996. ``Twenty-eight years ago, I had a white gown with gold
beading all over it,'' says D'Eramo. ``And when the church lights
hit the beads, it was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen, 26, took her mother's advice and bought a similar gown.
``Everyone loved it,'' she says. ``They made such a big deal over
it.'' Says D'Eramo, ``If you're going to spend that much on a
dress, it might as well be remembered.''

SUDDEN DEATH BECAUSE OF RARE HEART PROBLEMS HAS STOLEN YOUNG
ATHLETES LIVES) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH HEART-RYAN and HEART-MORRELL)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Pennington desperately wanted to play football and no one,
not even his doctor, thought the 13-year-old's asthma would get in
the way. But the condition masked a congenital heart problem that
killed the teenager on his first day of fall practice in Caldwell,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Western Washington University's Duke Wallenborn lived to play
basketball, and did so, despite being diagnosed as a child with a
heart problem known as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. But his
heart condition caught up with him, and took his life in his junior
year of college at the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State University's Hayward ``Spud'' Harris, 21, was
an imposing presence on the football field, an All-State lineman
from Lakewood's Lakes High School. But his life suddenly was cut
short on his first day of fall drills. Horrified teammates watched
him slump over on the field of an apparent heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   All three succumbed to sudden cardiac death, which takes the
life of one young athlete in every 200,000 _ 15 to 20 a year _
according to the American Heart Association. Only violent head and
spinal injuries cause more deaths among young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But the trio shared something more: Each had passed a standard
physical exam and was cleared to play a strenuous sport.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are statistics in an ongoing debate about whether a
sports physical should include the most effective tools to spot a
potentially fatal heart problem: an electrocardiogram (ECG), the
most common test of a person's cardiac system, or an
echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to evaluate a heart's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict centers on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _Whether testing could prevent athletes from placing themselves
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether it would cost too much and who would pay.
</P>
<P>
   _Whether it actually would save lives.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study suggests tests could be performed in a
large-scale program for as little as $10 per athlete through
competitive bidding, while other estimates place the cost at much
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a way to detect it ... what is a life worth?''
asked Tom Wallenborn, Duke's father. He said his son sometimes had
spells in which his heart would race, but was told by doctors he
was in no danger playing sports. He died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he went to college, I took him in to a cardiologist
just to make sure, because I figured playing ball at the college
level would be more vigorous and I just wanted to make sure
everything was all right,'' said Wallenborn, of Vancouver, Wash.
``That's when it was labeled Wolff-Parkinson-White and the doctor
told me and Duke that it was a non-life-threatening situation. So
with that clean bill of health, we sent him on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Rice, who tracks sports injuries involving young
athletes, will never forget hearing about Harris' death in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many years it has been, but why do I remember
Spud Harris? Because he dropped dead on the campus just a couple
days after he had his physical,'' said Rice, a national expert on
sports injuries and young athletes. ``When that happens, you stand
up straight and say, `What can we do to prevent it? This is really
unbelievable.'''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent deaths of Washington state high school students
participating in sports both occurred in 1992:
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 14-year-old Clarissa Erickson, a freshman at R.A.
Long High School in Longview died after a three-mile, cross-country
race. A coroner's report showed she had a rare heart defect that
wasn't detected in a physical.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, Stacey Olson, 17, died of heart failure at Liberty
High School near Spokane after collapsing during a gym class _ 50
feet from where his twin brother, Tracey, had died of a heart
problem in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Washington and many other states advise parents that
sports physicals should include a detailed family medical history,
one of the most valuable resources a physician has to determine the
risk of heart problems. Doctors also are supposed to perform a
blood-pressure test and listen to the heart for signs of murmurs or
other problems. A stress test is optional, but most states advise
that it be done.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Edwards, Pennington's mother, said her son's physical in
the summer of 1993 lasted only minutes. He did that August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even had to ask that they do a blood test, or it wouldn't
have been done,'' Edwards said. ``The doctor looked at him with a
stethoscope, he looked at his tonsils ... and then he pretty much
released him.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Pennington been tested with an echocardiogram, Edwards
believes, her son's congenital heart problem would have been
detected. Instead, it wasn't found until his autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had done an `echo' on Jason, he would still be alive
today,'' Edwards contends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such cases, a 1996 panel put together by the American
Heart Association determined that running every young athlete
through advanced heart testing during a sports physical would be
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which included one of the nation's leading experts in
sudden deaths, Dr. Barry J. Maron of the Minneapolis Heart
Institute, estimated that the tests would cost an average of $600
per athlete, and that they wouldn't save many lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at $500 per (test), it would theoretically cost $250,000
to detect even one previously undiagnosed case,'' the panel wrote,
because of the odds of an athlete having a potentially fatal heart
defect.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, the cost
of an ECG, an echocardiogram and related tests can cost up to
$2,000, said cardiologist Dr. James French.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to do the groundwork before such tests are
performed _ a full physical involving a stress test and treadmill
test, combined with an extensive family history.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any history of problems such as fainting spells,
abnormal heart beats, shortness of breath or a family history of
heart disease, French advised parents not to wait to get their
child's sports physical done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the signs of (heart) diseases don't happen when
you're sitting quietly waiting for the physical to begin,'' he
said. ``A lot of the things that cause the problems have to be
provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the most comprehensive way to detect
potential problems is to use an ECG or an echocardiogram. But the
main issue is the cost of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this cardiac screening with an ECG can be accomplished for
$10 per athlete and has to be done only once during a four-year
high school career, the task becomes manageable,'' wrote Rice,
former director of the Athletic Health Care System at the
University of Washington, who for years has studied and tracked
sports injuries among young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, currently at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in New
Jersey, was responding to a study published in the September 1997
issue of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. The study
screened 5,615 athletes in Nevada schools to determine the
effectiveness of an ECG as part of a full physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   While the study found no specific cases of the most common fatal
heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 582 students were
discovered with other heart abnormalities after answering a family
history questionnaire, taking a blood-pressure test and having an
ECG screening. Of those, the ECG detected 146 students with
abnormal heart beats, heart wave abnormalities and other
irregularities. Sixteen students were not approved to play sports
and were referred for further testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the objective is to reduce the number of nontraumatic
sudden deaths on the high school playing fields, then we suggest
performing an ECG once in the athletic career of a high school
athlete,'' concluded the Nevada study headed by Dr. Colin M.
Fuller, the Sierra Nevada Cardiology Associates and the Sierra
Heart Institute, all of Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ECG tests can be performed by a cardiac technician without
a physician being present at the time,'' the study said. ``The ECGs
can be computer interpreted and over-read by a qualified physician
off-site ... and the authors estimate that a cost of $10 per ECG,
including technical and professional fees, is a reasonable
estimation.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, Rice suggests doing a study
involving 120,000 young athletes to put them through full heart
examinations to determine the true cost and effectiveness of such
examinations on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to work it with many thousands of people
to have big enough numbers to let things show up statistically,''
Rice said. ``Plus, it's the issue of finite health-care resources.
In other words, you have to think of how much money is spent doing
all these false tests, and all these people inconvenienced, to find
what maybe is 10 people a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted, ``When a kid drops dead playing sports, that's
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Maron said he realizes that the death of a young athlete
``strikes to the core of our sensibilities.'' But he stands by
recommendations made by the Heart Association panel and believes
there is no practical way to do extensive, cost-effective testing
on a large-scale basis.
</P>
<P>
   In its recommendations to the Heart Association, Maron's panel
looked at 158 sudden deaths nationwide among young athletes between
the years 1985 and 1995. Of those, 134 were linked to heart
problems, and nearly all had passed routine physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found one common factor: almost all the deaths
occurred during or after intense exercise. But more than 20
different heart disorders were found in the deaths. Maron said he
doubts that performing specific heart tests during physicals would
have caught many more cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are rare diseases, so they are going to be uncommon and
you have a lot of athletes,'' Maron said. ``So the numerator is
small, the denominator is large, the tests are expensive, at least
at retail value ... and it's not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cost could be reduced from the Heart Association
panel's estimate of $600 per athlete to $10, Maron asks who would
pay for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you made it $1, I think there would be some situations
where that would be too much,'' he said. ``If you're talking about
broad-based screening, you're talking about everybody.'' That
includes the estimated 4 million high school-age athletes, the
500,000 college-age athletes and about 5,000 professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Maron said, ``we are stuck'' with the standard
physical and family medical history as the best way to detect early
warning signs of heart disease and sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Maron said he hopes the screening guidelines
developed by his panel have helped physicians around the country
become more aware of the dangers of heart disease in young
athletes. But he warns: ``Don't assume that clearance by history
and physical screening excludes all forms of heart disease that
might be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smaha, director of athletic medicine at WSU, was on the
field in 1979 when Harris suddenly died. Smaha performed
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but could not revive the 270-pound
lineman. Harris was the second person he had to try to revive in
his first two years at WSU.
</P>
<P>
   The other one, a former Cougar basketball player, had a heart
attack but was rushed to the hospital after manual CPR and placed
on a defibrilator, which restored the rhythm of his heart by
applying a brief, high-energy electric shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked out of there with no brain damage and sends me a
Christmas card every year,'' Smaha said. ``That was the good one.
The other one was Spud. And quite frankly, I was on top of him
within 30 seconds. ... But he was basically gone at that time and
we didn't realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rice, Smaha is haunted by Harris' death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you've had this kind of thing happen at
Washington State and it's right in front of you there, it makes you
take a second look and second-guess how you do things,'' Smaha
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Athletic Trainers Association, like the American
Heart Association, has studied the issue of whether an ECG should
be performed on college athletes. To Smaha, finding heart disease
that can cause sudden death is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times people have conditions that you are not going to
find doing all these tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he said, the first warning sign comes with a heart
attack. Or someone just suddenly dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's sheer luck that people are caught, said
cardiologist Dr. Dan Doornik, a former Seahawk and Washington State
running back.
</P>
<P>
   The unlucky ones are athletes like Duke Wallenborn, who suffered
a heart attack in his sleep the day after a game and only days
before he was scheduled to see a specialist about the possibility
of heart surgery to correct his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew something was wrong since he was probably 3 years old
when he came in one day and his heart was beating fast,'' father
Tom Wallenborn said. ``At that time, which was the early 1970s, no
one really knew what the problem was and said that he would
probably outgrow it. It never seemed to slow him down. When it
would happen, he'd just sit down and in two or three minutes it
would go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallenborn said his son's heart began racing more frequently
during his last basketball season at Western, but the condition was
not limited to the basketball court. He still questions whether his
son should have been cleared by doctors to continue playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is so frustrating and questionable,'' Wallenborn
said. ``That he had this his whole life and then we find a way to
take care of the problem, but it's too late.''

TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICT BARS VALEDICTORIAN FROM SPEAKING

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERRVILLE, Texas _ Tivy High School valedictorian Josh Walther
saw humor in calling on the two lowest-ranking members of his class
to replace him at the podium during commencement exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I have to do more work and give a speech?'' he
planned on telling the Class of '98. ``I wasn't the one slacking
the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   But school officials weren't amused and vowed to have the police
remove the straight-A student from the stage if he insisted on
delivering the farewell address as written.
</P>
<P>
   ``It infringed on the rights of those lower-level kids not to be
humiliated in public,'' said Tivy Principal James Chase. ``We
weren't trying to tell him what to say, just `Please leave that
part out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side budged during a week of negotiations, so Walther
sat silently as diplomas were handed out Friday to 247 classmates,
some of whom chanted, ``Let Josh speak!''
</P>
<P>
   The class salutatorian, Sally Graham, did deliver her speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair at all,'' Walther said Monday. ``They didn't
have the right to tell me I couldn't speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode not only tarnished Walther's final days of high
school, but also has raised questions about the authority school
officials wield over student expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly violates the spirit of free speech,'' said Jay
Jacobson, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the government creates a public forum, such as always
offering the valedictorian an opportunity to speak, they ought not
be allowed to censor that speech because they do not like the
content,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase and Rolinda Schmidt, president of the school board in this
South Texas city, said the district could censor student speech
under its policy concerning ``school-sponsored publications.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy says district employees may exercise control over
style and content of student speech ``so long as their actions are
reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical (teaching) concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase cited the section of the policy on speech that ``does not
meet the standards of the professional employees who supervise the
production of the publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he didn't recognize Walther's opening remarks as humor,
Chase said: ``You've got to hunt for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After referring to the low-ranking students, Walther's speech
went on to point out that even the lowest-ranking medical students
still are called ``doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson questioned both Chase's sense of humor and the
applicability of the district policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do I disagree with the interpretation of their
policy, but if their interpretation is correct, it may very well
run afoul of constitutional principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walther's father lobbied Chase, Schmidt and Superintendent Mark
Jackson to let his son's speech be made, uncut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really a disgrace that students aren't given the
right to freedom of speech,'' said Bob Walther, 48.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt supported Chase's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel there were parts of it that were appropriate for
the audience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Walther, who plans to study zoology at Texas A&AMP;M
University, finally got to deliver the 10-minute speech Saturday at
his home, before his family and a few friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' his father said.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The recent nuclear tests in the South Asian subcontinent have
shaken the international community. Their consequences are much
more than just the start of a regional nuclear-arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are already saying that nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament is now a lost cause. That may turn out to be true,
but only if the policy makers of major powers confine themselves to
short-term reaction, without drawing appropriate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the suggestions being made in the wake of the tests
could lead to exactly the wrong conclusions. Some see them as a
pretext for refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and even abandoning negotiations on reducing and eliminating
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that by their recent actions India
and Pakistan have not strengthened their security. To the contrary,
by launching the mechanism of mutual threats they have added a
strong element of unpredictability to the already difficult
security equation in the subcontinent. Any perceived gain in status
or ``clout'' too is a delusion. The euphoria will pass, but the
angry global reaction will continue to cause both countries serious
problems, not only international but domestic as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one must recognize the validity of much of the
criticism directed at the five nuclear powers, particularly the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has long been obvious that the Non-Proliferation
Treaty is bound to be shaky unless there is real movement toward
nuclear disarmament. Yet, of late both the United States and Russia
have been making it increasingly clear that they intend to rely for
their defense on nuclear weapons, advanced delivery systems and
anti-ballistic missiles. As was to be expected, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to lock in the
status quo or to increase the treaty's credibility and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face the truth today: That status quo has now been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions offer no solution. Indeed, as we have seen,
they can cause resentment and bitterness and make the situation
even more difficult. Nevertheless, the international community
cannot afford to ignore the contempt with which it has been treated
by New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is to seek constructive courses of
action, primarily within the United Nations. Only a serious,
no-nonsense dialogue can persuade India and Pakistan that they must
cease the nuclear escalation and adhere to non-proliferation and
comprehensive test ban treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the other nuclear powers too must do a lot. It can no longer
be business as usual. They must act concretely to prove that they
are serious about nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   I would also urge greater attention to the problem of nuclear
delivery systems. The United States and Russia are observing the
treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range missiles that
President Reagan and I signed in 1987. Negotiations should now
begin on enlarging this treaty to include other countries, since
missiles with a range of about 300 miles to 3,500 miles are
particularly dangerous on a regional level.
</P>
<P>
   I want to recall what happened in 1991, when the United States
and the Soviet Union agreed, on the basis of an informal
arrangement, to drastically reduce their arsenals of tactical
nuclear weapons. Similar steps today, taken unilaterally, without
engaging in protracted negotiations, would go a long way toward
normalizing the situation and persuading people that world leaders
are capable of acting to assure their security.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I have to put the actions of India and Pakistan within
the overall context of the world's post-Cold War evolution. It has
been adversely affected by the mistaken conclusion that one side
won the Cold War and thus secured for itself the right to
unconstrained leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intentions were, things went wrong. Over the past
years, all kinds of things have been tried _ but little or nothing
was ever done to strengthen the United Nations, or to coordinate on
a regular and systematic basis the nuclear policies of the existing
powers and seriously consult with the threshold states.
</P>
<P>
   It should now be clear that in this as in other matters, one
power center is simply not capable of being the sole decision-maker
and regulator. This is a lesson to be learned if we are to have
fewer unpleasant surprises in the future.

WHY LOIS PINES IS GETTING A PASS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems some people take an instant dislike to Lois Pines, the
state senator running for attorney general. However, that's
understandable because in our fast-paced world it simply saves
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pines reeks of ambition the way your pants smell of dry-cleaning
fluid after one-hour martinizing. That's not necessarily a bad
thing, either, because in politics people don't move forward unless
they can look in the mirror each morning and say to themselves,
``You are the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, Pines apparently got furious after finding
out that a few people in the business community had contributed to
her primary opponent, Tom Reilly, the district attorney for
Middlesex County. According to news reports, she got on the phone
and threatened to drop the hammer if she was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are two views of this behavior: (1) It's no big deal;
all politicians regularly do this in an attempt to raise money
quickly with the aim of shutting an opponent off from potential
revenue sources in order to win a huge victory. (2) It's extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pines is in the Legislature. She wants to be attorney general.
And it appears she gives bad-phone to some who choose to contribute
to Reilly, leaving them with an implied threat of retribution
ringing in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the old double standard arrives. No, not the
tired, lame, and obvious difference in sex, but, rather, the zip
code and ideological double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Pines is a huge liberal. She lives in Newton, socialist
sister-city to the world. Her voting record makes Karl Marx look
like Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody knows that liberals do good works. Liberals are
cool. Conservatives are morons. So it doesn't matter when a Lois
Pines comes off sounding like Jackie Presser of the Teamsters
during a phone conversation because she's a liberal darling and
liberals mean well.
</P>
<P>
   But if you substitute a name like Flaherty, Murphy, Kelly, or
Flynn, exchange her trim figure for a 44-inch waist, complete with
beet-red face, attribute the character with pro-life views and a
house in South Boston, Malden, or Billerica, why you can almost
hear the sound of sirens and handcuffs being attached. At a
minimum, such rude behavior would be sure to attract the interest
of the current attorney general, who has a foolish history of
hauling politicians to court on evidence a whole lot flimsier than
the words out of Pines's own mouth.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lois Pines gave us the bottle bill. She loves busing
and whales and low-income housing _ as long as it's located 57
nautical miles from her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She is a charter member of the ``We're better than you crew''
that figures government is a tool to make the rest of us conform to
codes of behavior that liberals can often ignore because of escape
hatches like affluence or geography. She's the kind of process
liberal so beloved by editorial writers, the kind who would haul a
Kip Kinkel into court in order to charge him with failure to
display a license rather than indict him for the murder of his
parents along with a couple of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff like that _ multiple homicides _ is actually viewed by
many well-meaning liberals as inappropriate behavior. But not
following regulations? Not having a license? Not recycling? That's
big stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pines threatens others with revenge because they toss
money to Reilly rather than to her, it's OK. The same way it was OK
when Hillary Clinton decided to ignore the law as she conducted her
very own hearings into health-care policy. If the cause is liberal
enough, or correct enough, bad behavior is excused, condoned, and,
sometimes, ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But let some poor stooge just to the right of center make a
threatening phone call to a businessman and the howls would be loud
enough to wake up Helen Keller. I mean, there have been more than a
couple of saps hauled in front of a grand jury for doing less than
Pines supposedly did out of a simple fit of pique.
</P>
<P>
   However, she gets a base on balls because she's a liberal, lives
in Newton, presents an attractive picture, and certainly couldn't
be guilty of being no better than one of the boys. After all, she
means well, and in our goofy, liberal state, any end justifies the
means.

KEEPING SCORE FORBIDDEN IN A POLITICALL CORRECT WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention, soccer moms! Heads up, soccer dads! The Massachusetts
Youth Soccer Association has hit upon a scheme to make your child
enjoy athletics more than ever: tournaments without scores.
</P>
<P>
   No joke. In officially sanctioned youth soccer tournaments in
Massachusetts, it is now forbidden to keep score. There are no
winners and losers. No standings. No playoffs. No champions.
Trophies may not be awarded unless they are awarded to every player
on every team.
</P>
<P>
   This ``non-results oriented competition,'' says Dean Conway, the
head coach of the Soccer Association, will give kids ``more
opportunity to develop all-around soccer smartness'' and will
``enhance natural, intrinsic competition.'' Run tournaments that
nobody can win, he writes in the state's youth soccer newspaper,
and all kinds of terrific things will happen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Less skilled players will get more playing time.... Bigger
kids who develop early will spend more time gaining skill. ...
Coaches will be able to spend less time plotting how to win (and)
should be less inclined to yell instructions during the game for
fear of their players making mistakes.'' Perhaps best of all,
``parents will cheer for all the kids at a game,'' enabling the
young players to ``see adults as positive and supportive and not as
contentious and narrow-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's rule now applies to all players under 10. Next
year it will be expanded to kids 12 and younger. And while the rule
is mandatory only in tournament play, the heat is already on to
extend it to all youth soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   This is political correctness run amok. But in Massachusetts,
what else is new? This is the state, after all, where Harvard
University's Undergraduate Council passed a resolution abolishing
the term ``freshman.'' (Demeaning to women.) This is the state
where Attorney General Scott Harshbarger banned his employees from
putting up Christmas decorations that hinted at _ well, Christmas.
(Bad for diversity.) This is the state that did away, on
``sensitivity'' grounds, with the witty Massachusetts Turnpike
logo, a Pilgrim's hat with an arrow through it. (Offensive to
Indians.)
</P>
<P>
   So who can be surprised that scores and standings in youth
soccer are now on the hit list?
</P>
<P>
   ``When one team wins,'' the Soccer Association's president,
Steve Koerpers, declares, ``everyone else is a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Marxism may be discredited worldwide but not on Massachusetts
soccer fields: Win, lose, or draw, every team gets the same reward.
Namely, no reward. Good players equal bad players, hard workers
equal lazy slugs. Why put any effort into improving your game if
all you get in the end is _ nothing? Even the Soviet Empire didn't
apply its spirit-shredding philosophy to sports. (Socialism was
glorious, but not as glorious as winning Olympic medals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with winning?'' asks Maury Carroll, founder of
one of the Bay State's largest youth tournaments, the Tufts Soccer
Bowl. ``That's the whole point of team sports.'' With playoffs and
championships now verboten, much of the electricity has gone out of
his tournament. ``The kids come in, play three games, have a
handshake, that's it,'' he says. ``They walk out with such an empty
feeling. They say, `That's all?'''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a lot of 9- and 10-year-olds evaded the rule by
competing in the under-11 bracket. Next year, that loophole will be
closed. Traveling to tournaments out of state is no longer an
option for these kids, either. The association will not sign the
roster of any team playing in a ``results-oriented'' tournament
anywhere. (That sign-off is needed for insurance coverage.) Which
means, moms and dads, that your little soccer champ isn't going to
the big Fourth of July tournament in Bristol, R.I. Or anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   When one team wins, everyone else is a loser. There, in a
nutshell, is the ethos of the left _ no one must be allowed to win
lest anyone be allowed to lose. That notion is at the heart of the
welfare state and at the root of affirmative action. It is the
foundation of modern ``multiculturalism,'' which insists that every
culture is as valuable as every other culture and therefore none
may be celebrated unless all are celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Whom does Massachusetts Youth Soccer Association think it is
fooling? Whether scores are posted or suppressed, every player
knows if his team won or lost. ``Nobody was keeping score'' at the
Holliston Memorial Day tournament, says volunteer coach Bill
Laberis. ``Except the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   What Laberis and every other coach understands is that it isn't
important simply to teach boys and girls how to win. They also need
the experience of losing. Running around a field and kicking balls
toward a goal are the least part of the youth soccer experience _
far less important than learning about working hard, about striving
for improvement, about the drive for achievement, about picking
themselves up from a loss and determining to do better next time.
What the Soccer Association says to players who lose a round is,
``Hey, don't worry _ it doesn't mean anything anyway.'' That is the
worst message a young athlete can hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Battle of Waterloo,'' the Duke of Wellington said, ``was
won on the playing fields of Eton.'' But that was before the virus
of political correctness was set loose. In a PC world, nothing
would have been won on the playing fields of Eton. Nothing would
have been lost. And nothing would have been learned.

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COPPER-RIVER-SALMON (Seattle) _ The Gulf of Alaska was tossing
up waves of 20 feet or more and the winds roared to 40 miles an
hour, but the storm did not deter the fleet in pursuit of what is
arguably the world's best-tasting fish _ Copper River salmon _ on
their first run of the season. Why all the fuss? A string of
restaurants and fish vendors from Puget Sound to Long Island Sound,
from Miami to Los Angeles, swear that there is no other fish that
gets people quite like this first wild salmon of the season. By Tim
Egan.

   UPSCALE-RESTAURANT-TRINKETS (New York) _ The prix fixe dinner at
Lutece includes three courses of the restaurant's specialties. It's
$65, wine, tax and tip not included. The Limoges plates aren't
included either, but they are, in fact, for sale ($185 for a
five-piece setting). So are the wine glasses and the linen
tablecloth. Of course there are already plenty of theme-park
restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood where you
can order a burger with a T-shirt on the side. But in the last
couple of years, more sophisticated establishments have been
following suit, taking their own kind of refined commercialism to
the top tier of Manhattan's restaurants. By Suzanne Hamlin.

<P>
   FRANCE-PASTRY-CHEF (Paris) _ Except for a few late-nighters
stumbling home, the Avenue des Champs-Elysees was eerily still. But
inside Laduree, a tea room, pastry shop and restaurant, everything
was astir. It was 6 in the morning, and Pierre Herme, the premier
pastry chef in Paris, was taking the first of many rounds through
the place. To the French, Herme has achieved the stature of the
legendary pastry chef Gaston Lenotre. And since last September he
has taken charge of one of Paris's most beloved tea salons and
pastry shops. By Amanda Hesser.

ACCEPTING THE NEW DEAL DID CONSERVATIVES A LOT OF GOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Barry Goldwater died, it was automatic for the
TV people to reach for the famous ad from the 1964 presidential
campaign, showing the little girl counting daisy petals before the
announcer counted down to a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But I was surprised that no one showed another ad from Lyndon
Johnson's successful creative destroyers that year, featuring a
pair of hands ripping up a Social Security card.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad is part of our Cold War historical memories. The
other one, though, played with concepts and emotions that are hot
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad about the Bomb, foreshadowing the disgusting trends of
the next 30-plus years, the technique was to imply what not even
LBJ's hardball players dared directly allege _ that Goldwater would
produce a nuclear war. In the ad about Social Security,
foreshadowing another disgusting trend of outright distortion, the
explicit claim was made that Goldwater would ruin Social Security
and produce ``the end of widows' pensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ad, however, was made at least plausible _ and certainly
devastating because of its continual repetition in news coverage _
by Goldwater's own deserved reputation as a fundamentally
impulsive, even lazy, conservative with an equally deserved
reputation for shooting from the hip.
</P>
<P>
   He had said to reporters that the commander of NATO should have
authority to use tactical nuclear weapons, had opposed the treaty
banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and was himself the origin
of the interesting strategic doctrine of ``lobbing one'' into the
men's room of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Of more relevance to today's politics, he had also said to
reporters in Concord during the New Hampshire primary campaign in
'64 (which he lost to write-in Henry Cabot Lodge) that
contributions to Social Security should be voluntary and that if an
individual could make out better on his own, he should be free to
do so, but that if he prefers to have ``the government do it,''
fine.
</P>
<P>
   As his meticulous biographer and former aide Lee Edwards has
written, there was context for that answer _ Goldwater statements
going back several years. He had called Social Security
inadequately if not fraudulently funded, likely to become the major
tax ahead of the levy on income for most workers, and had called
for ``voluntary'' contributions on a phased-in basis so as not to
hurt anyone in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, however, never fully explained what he meant by
``voluntary,'' which left him open to doubts about his intentions.
Indeed, he validated those doubts a decade after his presidential
campaign, as Edwards also discloses. Following his reelection as
senator despite the Watergate landslide for the Democrats in 1974,
Goldwater wrote to his longtime adviser, the eminent conservative
economist Milton Friedman, that he thought the moment had come to
``advocate an end to Social Security,'' an idea Friedman quickly
got him to deep-six.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is that deep down, Goldwater's gut conservatism
did not accept, politically or substantively, the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Today's conservatives, having moved beyond that point
intellectually as well as politically, are in a much stronger
position. That is because they are seeking change by focusing on
the dangers to the system unless change occurs and by focusing on
the rate of return a worker can expect today from Social Security
compared with the return from the system they envision.
</P>
<P>
   What was called ``voluntary'' in Goldwater's day is now called
``privatization,'' only it really isn't. The typical proposal would
retain the tax on payroll that finances survivors' and disability
benefits; it would then give new workers the option of directing
the remaining eight percent of payroll (split with the employer) to
a ``personal'' retirement account that could be invested instead of
just placed in US Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to criticize this idea on a variety of fronts,
beginning with risk, but it is not possible to argue fairly that it
is a plan to ruin Social Security or threaten vulnerable retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The reason conservatism is strong today is not that Goldwater
paved the way so much as that conservatives learned from his huge
mistakes and made peace with FDR _ none more dramatically than an
old Democrat and Roosevelt-lover named Ronald Reagan.

   NAQOURA, Lebanon _ The sound of missiles pounding a nearby
village rumbled like distant thunder last week inside the
Israeli-occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli helicopters retaliated against the hit-and-run Hezbollah
guerrillas as part of an intense week of fighting that was part of
a gradual, two-month escalation of attacks by the Iranian-backed
Islamic militants.

   United Nations observers in this city just north of the Israeli
border say Hezbollah carried out more attacks in April and May than
in any comparable period in 12 years. The attacks maintained
pressure on Israel as it searches for a way to pull its troops back
from what has become known here as Israel's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after Israel carved out a nine-mile swath inside
southern Lebanon to protects its citizens in northern Israel from
cross-border attacks, fighters and civilians on all sides inside
the ``security zone'' hear a lot these days about proposals for
peace. But the battle rages on.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night, two Israeli soldiers were killed and two
were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded. The day before, two
members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army were killed and five
wounded. Two Lebanese civilians were also seriously wounded later
the same day in artillery exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a Lebanese civilian was killed and another wounded
from Israeli fire, raising to 11 the number of civilians killed and
to 36 the number wounded in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting intensified after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government last month ``officially adopted'' UN
Security Council Resolution 425, the 1978 resolution that called
for Israel to ``withdraw forthwith'' from Lebanon. But Netanyahu
attached a set of conditions to any withdrawal, and 1,500 Israeli
troops are still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming into a routine of keeping the pot boiling, but
not tipping it over,'' said Timur Goksel, chief political adviser
of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. He
added that while Hezbollah has intensified attacks dramatically,
the number of casualties in the past two months has been relatively
low.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine Israeli soldiers were killed last year, the highest
in any year since the zone was established. So far this year, eight
Israeli soldiers have been killed. But the number of mortar
attacks, which are closely monitored by the UN, exceeded 100 in
April and 90 in May. The totals are higher than any month since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel says the increase in attacks and relative decline in
casualties indicates a need by Hezbollah to maintain pressure on
Israeli forces without crossing a line that will galvanize Israel
to rescind its offer to pull out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel adds that Hezbollah's attacks may also have a broader
political motive. With the guerrilla operation trying to transform
itself into a more mainstream political force, it used its military
wing against Israel while campaigning for the first local elections
in 35 years on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   If that was indeed the plan, it worked. Hezbollah won wide
support in its strongholds south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reasons, the point is there's too much lead
flying right now, and it can very quickly get out of control. All
of these diplomatic scenarios can be overtaken by events very
rapidly,'' warned Goksel. ``There's a real opportunity to end the
conflict here, but if both sides don't focus it will be lost just
like all the other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its offer to live up to the 1978 UN resolution, Israeli
units continue fighting to hold the swath of land in southern
Lebanon to protect citizens from cross-border attacks. The Israelis
say they will abide by the UN resolution if security guarantees,
including a disarming of Hezbollah, are carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Israel increased over the weekend. On Saturday,
President Jacques Chirac of France, while visiting Beirut for a
Francophone mayors' conference, said Israel ``must withdraw from
Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425 and without any
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government and Hezbollah leaders say that if Israel
really wants to live up to Resolution 425, which requires that
Israel ``withdraw forthwith,'' then it should simply withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, Hezbollah's military commander for the
south, said in an interview with The Boston Globe, ``If Netanyahu
had the true intention of withdrawing, I don't think anyone would
stop him. The Israelis knew the way in, so certainly they know the
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leaders have been noted for conducting interviews
while members clutching Katyusha rockets stand in the background.
But last week, Kaouk, wrapped in the black robe and turban of the
Shiite clerical hierarchy, offered a reporter fruit drinks as a
small army of stylishly dressed advisers scurried in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah seems to have gone slick. It is highly organized and
increasingly sophisticated. It closely monitors the US and Israeli
media to gauge what it sees as a tide of public sentiment pulling
against Israeli involvement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not stop while they try to come up with a solution for
their own exit,'' Kaouk said of Israel. ``We will be the winners
here ultimately because we are fighting for our land and we have
the approval of our people that what we are doing is right. The
Israelis are not even able to convince their own people that what
they are doing is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nizar Hamzi, a professor of political science at American
University in Beirut, said, ``I think the Israeli offer has to be
viewed as a dramatic development. I think it will work in the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence may emerge from signs in Iran, however subtle,
that the key financial and political backers of Hezbollah are
willing to explore all possibilites.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he cited a letter from the Iranian government to
the US Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, promising that
Iran would not interfere if Hezbollah wants to negotiate with
Israel over a withdrawal. Hamzi also characterized as ``important
and encouraging'' recent promises by Hezbollah leaders not to take
control of southern Lebanon if Israel pulls back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Israeli intitiative has been rejected by the Lebanese
government and, more importantly, by its neighbor, Syria, which
stations 35,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in the Arab world and in Israel have viewed the
Netanyahu government's offer as a ploy to defuse criticism of his
perceived intransigence in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
It is also viewed as a way to isolate Syria by stripping it of its
only bargaining chip with Israel in talks over the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy general in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yoav
Biran, insisted that the Israeli offer is genuine. ``It is not an
exercise in public relations and it's not aimed at scoring
points,'' he maintained last week. ``We want 425, but as a package,
and if you want 425 to be implemented you have to accept it as a
package'' that includes guarantees of security for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We don't want to leave Lebanon in order to come back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Israel's concerns is the fate of the 2,500 members of the
South Lebanon Army and their families, who are regarded by militant
factions of Hezbollah as collaborators with a sworn enemy of
Lebanon. The South Lebanon Army fights with the Israelis against
Hezbollah. Although Hezbollah leaders have introduced a law that
would offer amnesty to South Lebanon Army members who turn
themselves in, the Israelis fear a blood bath.
</P>
<P>
   South Lebanon Army Sergeant Ali Sebleini, 34, says he joined the
pro-Israeli forces out of economic necessity. The $450 a month
salary he earns as a soldier in Israeli uniform provides for his
six children, ages 7 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have no choice,'' he said. ``You just have to keep
good relations and keep your own family safe. That is my priority.
My heart is clean. I didn't kill anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebleini explained that his job consists largely of walking the
roads looking for Hezbollah-planted road bombs typically hidden in
fiberglass painted to look like rocks and aimed at Israeli
transports. ``I'm just trying to get by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200,000 people who live in the zone and each
day dodge the shelling and mortar exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon in a sleepy farming village, Israeli
forces were shelling a nearby hillside. The bombs exploding two
miles away shook the ground. Birds in the trees scattered. A cow
tensed and looked out of the corner of its eye toward the six
echoing thuds in the hills. A minute passed, and there was quiet
again. The birds' chirping returned. The cow went back to its hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, there's shelling along here,'' farmer Naim Hamzieh
said in the village of Kfar Rouman, a few hundred yards from the
forward positions of the Israeli army that overlook his fields.
``And then you reporters come in and out and nothing changes. I've
lost family and friends. I've lost a dozen cows. How long can we go
on like this?''

CLERICAL ERROR PUTS TEXAS MASS MURDERER IN PRISON TRUSTY JOB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct lede to minimum-security prison camp sted of
in charge of youths.) 
 
By JOHN MAKEIG 
and MATT SCHWARTZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A clerk's error left longtime inmate Elmer Wayne
Henley, serving a life sentence in the killings of 27 youths in the
Houston area, as a trusty in a minimum-security prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system spokesman David Nunnelee said that Henley, 42, was
a trusty at the Coffield Unit boot camp near Palestine, Texas, from
April 15 until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned there based only on his prison identification
number by someone unfamiliar with his history, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Henley's career as trusty ended hurriedly once Coffield Unit
Warden Kevin Moore learned the convicted multiple murderer had the
assignment. Henley now is back inside the maximum-security prison
unit, adjacent to the trusty camp, working as a ``unit artist,''
meaning he paints signs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
called it an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a mistake is made by our personnel, I become
concerned,'' Polunsky said. ``I wouldn't describe it as systematic
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding that, there has been, from what I can see, a
slight breach in the policies and procedures in the division. And
that calls for a review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said he asked Texas Department of Criminal Justice
officials to investigate the incident and make necessary changes to
procedures to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Henley qualified for trusty status, he said, TDCJ
policies prohibit inmates convicted of dangerous crimes from being
placed in positions with less security from which they could
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said Henley was transferred to a facility adjacent to
the Coffield Unit that housed adult inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnelee said prison files suggest that Henley has been an ideal
inmate during his 24 years and nine months in custody, with only
two infractions on his record. In 1986, he got in trouble for
fighting with another inmate and in 1973 he was written up for
failing to obey a posted order.
</P>
<P>
   Henley is serving six concurrent life sentences for his role in
the torture-slayings of 27 youths in the Houston area in 1973 when
he was a teen-ager. His co-defendant, David Owen Brooks, also is
serving a life sentence in four of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Corll, 33, was the primary culprit in the killings. Henley
shot Corll six times _ in self-defense, he told authorities _
before calling police and confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite his record as a good inmate, Henley has been
passed over for parole numerous times. Nunnelee said Henley has
accumulated 73 years of good-time credit toward parole, but it
remains doubtful he will ever be freed. Henley's next review for
parole will be in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henley's name is pretty much synonymous with mass murder,''
said Andy Kahan, the mayor's advocate for crime victims. ``Even if
it was a clerical error, the minute you yell out `Elmer Wayne
Henley,' that should raise some eyebrows. Anything that involves
Elmer Wayne Henley draws notice and attention, even the name. Even
when the transfer comes across your desk, you take notice of the
name.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wondered why it took two weeks for officials to
realize the error but _ like Polunsky _ Kahan stopped well short of
criticizing TDCJ procedures. ``I don't know if you can say there is
a problem,'' Kahan said. ``You're dealing with 140,000 inmates on a
daily basis. Clerical errors do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an inmate named Steven Jay Russell won a
special needs parole to a South Texas nursing home after duping
prison doctors and parole officials into believing he was
terminally ill with AIDS. Once there, Russell had someone call the
facility posing as a doctor authorizing special treatment at a
Houston hospital, from which the inmate escaped. He was later
captured in Dallas, but slipped free after feigning a heart attack
and being taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky drew a distinction between Russell and Henley's cases,
noting that Henley ``was never outside the fence at all. He was
under supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Russell escaped from TDCJ's Estelle Unit near
Huntsville, posing as a doctor after he used a green marker to
color his white prison uniform.

WILL LEBANON PROVE TO BE ISRAEL'S VIETNAM?

<P>
   ZARIT, Israel _ An army of flies buzzed around a sticky bottle
of soda inside a bunker as Captain Hanan Iserovich, only 24 years
old, talked about the mission he would be sending 20 men out on.
</P>
<P>
   At this army post on the edge of the ``security zone,'' the
conversation quickly turned to comparisons with Vietnam, as it
often does about Israel's involvement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comparisons don't work,'' Iserovich said. ``Vietnam was
far from home for Americans. This is so close we can see what we're
guarding. You can hear the chickens at the farms on this side. You
can see the lights of Haifa at night.''
</P>
<P>
   But one way in which the comparison with Vietnam appears valid
is the sense that Israelis tire of their young men dying in a war
in Lebanon. Public pressure mounts for an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Iserovich insisted that he does not allow himself or his men to
be distracted by such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah doesn't give us a rest, so there is no time to think
or to debate,'' he said. ``It's a war over here, so of course you
don't like to hear the hysterical voices out there. But OK. It's
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside his bunker office, 20 young men from a company in
the Nahal brigade prepared for a three-day mission inside the
9-mile-wide swath of land in south Lebanon occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With the hammering, industrial beat of ``trance'' music blaring
in the background, the soldiers got ready by their own rituals.
</P>
<P>
   They slapped together kosher salami sadwiches and stuffed drab
green backpacks with junk food, like Kit Kat bars, Frosted Flakes,
chocolate syrup, peanuts, butterscotch candies, and tiny tinned
rations of pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the sugar buzz to stay awake in there,'' said a
20-year-old infantryman named Avna.
</P>
<P>
   They cleaned machine guns, polished scopes, and tested
night-vision equipment. They carefully placed black tape over watch
faces and whistles. Anything that shines can make them targets.
</P>
<P>
   When they were ready, faces in black-and-green camouflage, the
music was turned off. The troops had been transformed from
teenagers to trained fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just after sunset and in complete silence, they walked
down a hillside to a barbed-wire fence stretching into the darkness
marking the border with Lebanon and the beginning of the security
zone. They entered through a huge white electronic gate into what
the soldiers simply call ``inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, just 70 yards inside the zone and only a few
hills away from where they entered, two fellow soldiers from a
different unit were killed by a Hezbollah-planted roadside bomb
hidden inside a fiberglass fake rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go inside, you have to forget about outside,'' said a
19-year-old sharpshooter with a rifle accurate up to 800 yards.
``You can't get distracted, not by anything. You stay focused. If
you don't, that's how you die.''

ACCEPTING THE NEW DEAL DID CONSERVATIVES A LOT OF GOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Barry Goldwater died, it was automatic for the
TV people to reach for the famous ad from the 1964 presidential
campaign, showing the little girl counting daisy petals before the
announcer counted down to a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But I was surprised that no one showed another ad from Lyndon
Johnson's successful creative destroyers that year, featuring a
pair of hands ripping up a Social Security card.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad is part of our Cold War historical memories. The
other one, though, played with concepts and emotions that are hot
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad about the Bomb, foreshadowing the disgusting trends of
the next 30-plus years, the technique was to imply what not even
LBJ's hardball players dared directly allege _ that Goldwater would
produce a nuclear war. In the ad about Social Security,
foreshadowing another disgusting trend of outright distortion, the
explicit claim was made that Goldwater would ruin Social Security
and produce ``the end of widows' pensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ad, however, was made at least plausible _ and certainly
devastating because of its continual repetition in news coverage _
by Goldwater's own deserved reputation as a fundamentally
impulsive, even lazy, conservative with an equally deserved
reputation for shooting from the hip.
</P>
<P>
   He had said to reporters that the commander of NATO should have
authority to use tactical nuclear weapons, had opposed the treaty
banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and was himself the origin
of the interesting strategic doctrine of ``lobbing one'' into the
men's room of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Of more relevance to today's politics, he had also said to
reporters in Concord during the New Hampshire primary campaign in
'64 (which he lost to write-in Henry Cabot Lodge) that
contributions to Social Security should be voluntary and that if an
individual could make out better on his own, he should be free to
do so, but that if he prefers to have ``the government do it,''
fine.
</P>
<P>
   As his meticulous biographer and former aide Lee Edwards has
written, there was context for that answer _ Goldwater statements
going back several years. He had called Social Security
inadequately if not fraudulently funded, likely to become the major
tax ahead of the levy on income for most workers, and had called
for ``voluntary'' contributions on a phased-in basis so as not to
hurt anyone in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, however, never fully explained what he meant by
``voluntary,'' which left him open to doubts about his intentions.
Indeed, he validated those doubts a decade after his presidential
campaign, as Edwards also discloses. Following his reelection as
senator despite the Watergate landslide for the Democrats in 1974,
Goldwater wrote to his longtime adviser, the eminent conservative
economist Milton Friedman, that he thought the moment had come to
``advocate an end to Social Security,'' an idea Friedman quickly
got him to deep-six.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is that deep down, Goldwater's gut conservatism
did not accept, politically or substantively, the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Today's conservatives, having moved beyond that point
intellectually as well as politically, are in a much stronger
position. That is because they are seeking change by focusing on
the dangers to the system unless change occurs and by focusing on
the rate of return a worker can expect today from Social Security
compared with the return from the system they envision.
</P>
<P>
   What was called ``voluntary'' in Goldwater's day is now called
``privatization,'' only it really isn't. The typical proposal would
retain the tax on payroll that finances survivors' and disability
benefits; it would then give new workers the option of directing
the remaining eight percent of payroll (split with the employer) to
a ``personal'' retirement account that could be invested instead of
just placed in US Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to criticize this idea on a variety of fronts,
beginning with risk, but it is not possible to argue fairly that it
is a plan to ruin Social Security or threaten vulnerable retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The reason conservatism is strong today is not that Goldwater
paved the way so much as that conservatives learned from his huge
mistakes and made peace with FDR _ none more dramatically than an
old Democrat and Roosevelt-lover named Ronald Reagan.

   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ A local beverage company in the heart of
Siberia may have lost its senses, but not its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the production and marketing might of Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. in this remote part Russia, the firm named its brand
Crazy Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it is a joke to go against Coca-Cola. So we
called ours `Crazy Cola' in order to laugh at ourselves,'' said
Yevgenia Kuznetsova, president of Pikra, a Siberian beer and
soft-drinks manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Even crazier, she added, Crazy Cola is showing a slight profit
18 months after it was introduced, finding a small niche in a
domestic market increasingly keen to buy Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's thirst for domination of the international
soft-drink market extends even to this desolate part of the world.
A new, $40 million Coca-Cola bottling plant, one of four opened in
Russia last year, stands at the edge of Krasnoyarsk, a regional
capital in Siberia, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   According to company figures, Pikra soft drinks _ including
Crazy Cola, lemonade, mineral water and other products _ held a 58
percent share of the market in Siberia in 1997 compared with 23
percent for Pepsi and 18 percent for Coca-Cola. The company did not
disclose how the colas compare in head-to-head sales.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to cite specific market data, Coca-Cola officials
acknowledge that they sold little of their product in Krasnoyarsk
before opening their local bottling facility, one of two in vast,
sparsely populated Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   In just a year, all that has changed, they said. ``In Siberia,
we are now Number One,'' claimed Coca-Cola spokesman Alexander
Chernov in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was long dominated by Pepsi-Cola, which cut a rare deal
with Soviet officials during the Cold War and gained a lock on the
massive market in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola entered Russia a decade later and, after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, became the most popular soft-drink throughout
Russia. It now has 12 bottling plants across Russia and claims a
more than 2-1 lead over nearest rival, Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pikra, a state-run beer producer in Soviet times and
now a private company, slipped into a corner of this battlefield
with the launch of Crazy Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Crazy Cola all face some discouraging facts
about doing business in deepest Russia, however.
</P>
<P>
   At least six months of the year in Siberia, one of the chief
distribution problems is getting the cola to market before it
freezes solid.
</P>
<P>
   And, added Kuznetsova: ``Remember in this territory there are
more trees than people. And trees don't drink cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Pikra was until 1995 the local bottler for Pepsi. The
partnership was mutually terminated in the face of Coca-Cola's
growing share of the Russian market and Pikra's desire to branch
out into soft-drink production.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need to give Coke a distinctly Russian
signature, Coca-Cola earlier this year introduced its first
television advertisements specifically for Russians, breaking with
the tradition of importing American TV ads to its international
markets. The series of 60-second commercials adapted a traditional
Russian fairy tale into a modern-day love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has past when Russians would seek out and buy
anything with foreign labels. Now, Russians tend to buy Russian
products and things with a Russian flavor,'' said Kuznetsova.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another local entry in the cola wars. A widely
popular soccer club in Moscow, Spartak, announced last week that it
would begin marketing its own cola.
</P>
<P>
   American and other Western producers are increasingly sensitive
to a potential backlash in the Russian market. American candy giant
Mars Inc. found itself the target of communist and nationalist
politicians who denounced the ``invasion'' by Western popular
culture following a TV ad blitz for their popular Snickers candy
bars.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Coca-Cola plans a public-relations blitz of its own to
publicize a newly signed deal with the city of Moscow: Coke will be
the exclusive cola of Moscow's famous Gorky Park.
</P>
<P>
   In Siberia, Kuznetsova suggests that Coca-Cola is gaining in the
market, but at a cost. The soft-drink giant is also losing money,
she says, as a result of aggressive promotions, product giveaways
and distribution of refrigeration display cases free to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never tried to fight them and we never will. We respect
them as a huge international company,'' Kuznetsova said of
Coca-Cola. ``We just follow our own path and try to find our piece
of the market.''

   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ A local beverage company in the heart of
Siberia may have lost its senses, but not its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the production and marketing might of Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. in this remote part Russia, the firm named its brand
Crazy Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it is a joke to go against Coca-Cola. So we
called ours `Crazy Cola' in order to laugh at ourselves,'' said
Yevgenia Kuznetsova, president of Pikra, a Siberian beer and
soft-drinks manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Even crazier, she added, Crazy Cola is showing a slight profit
18 months after it was introduced, finding a small niche in a
domestic market increasingly keen to buy Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's thirst for domination of the international
soft-drink market extends even to this desolate part of the world.
A new, $40 million Coca-Cola bottling plant, one of four opened in
Russia last year, stands at the edge of Krasnoyarsk, a regional
capital in Siberia, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   According to company figures, Pikra soft drinks _ including
Crazy Cola, lemonade, mineral water and other products _ held a 58
percent share of the market in Siberia in 1997 compared with 23
percent for Pepsi and 18 percent for Coca-Cola. The company did not
disclose how the colas compare in head-to-head sales.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to cite specific market data, Coca-Cola officials
acknowledge that they sold little of their product in Krasnoyarsk
before opening their local bottling facility, one of two in vast,
sparsely populated Siberia.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``It's a phase!'' Gena Rowlands snaps at the notion that she may
be at height of her 50-year acting career. She's lived through
enough ups and downs to know better than to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a phase,'' she adds, smiling drolly. ``I see most
things happening in 10- to 12-year increments. And when you've been
around as long as I have, you begin to see things more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-60s, Rowlands is a legend in the film world. But
as a woman she's not so easy to classify.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred, worldly and streetwise at the same time, she manages
to be both a lady and a real broad _ an American Jeanne Moreau. In
fact, Rowlands has long been a popular icon in Europe, while she's
had more of a cult following at home.
</P>
<P>
   But even if her current renaissance is just a phase, it looks
like it will be a long one. She filmed three movies this year, a
thick pile of scripts arrives at her home every day _ and Sharon
Stone pays the questionable tribute of remaking ``Gloria,'' one of
the best films Rowlands made with her late husband, writer-director
John Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes (who died of liver cancer in 1989) had a bit of a
revival of his own last fall, when his last unproduced script,
``She's So Lovely,'' was directed by the couple's son, Nick
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nick also directed his mother two years ago in ``Unhook The
Stars,'' a movie he wrote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an orange and claret Todd Oldham velvet robe and tightly
clutching her first coffee of the morning, Rowlands pads out of her
bedroom in the same Hollywood Hills home where Cassavetes shot the
movies ``Faces'' (1968), ``Opening Night'' (1977) and ``Love
Streams'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, her longtime makeup artist sits ready to
transform her for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' she says, reiterating one of her oft-quoted lines, ``I
do look like a goldfish without my makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   With her live-in boyfriend, Bob Forrest, standing close by,
Rowlands immediately begins reminiscing about Cassavetes, the man
whom she credits for her success as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My late husband made a lot of great pictures,'' she says. ``It
was a very creative time we were working in. That was followed by a
not-so-creative time, which I think we're still in. So people look
back with nostalgia. I think some of the magic of that time rubbed
off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the makeup artist works, Rowlands' thin red mouth becomes
more pronounced, her platinum bob gains a healthy pouf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour was never my game,'' says the actress, who still
possesses her famously cool looks. ``I just hate that thing about
beauty. There's always someone out there better looking or worse
looking. Beauty and glamour are not real things. To depend on them
is very hard for anyone, but particularly hard for attractive
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the photo session, Rowlands brings out pictures
that were taken on the set of ``Paulie,'' the film in which she
plays a woman who forms a bond with a talking parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen different birds were used to play Paulie, as well as
several animatronic copies created by special-effects wizard Stan
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animated bird was very dear,'' Rowlands says. ``You forget
he's animated. But there was one live bird they used primarily _
and, well, I fell in love. It was unrequited, of course, but that
doesn't make it any less passionate!''
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent film ``Hope Floats,'' Rowlands plays a
taxidermist who's a constant source of embarrassment to her young
daughter, Sandra Bullock. Harry Connick Jr. plays Bullock's
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a studio picture, but it reads like an independent
picture because it's an examination of love,'' Rowlands says.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls dancing with Connick between takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had tornadoes in Austin and some terrible
weather,'' she says, ``it might have been the happiest set I've
ever been on.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is not something one generally associates with Gena
Rowlands _ at least not onscreen. In most of her movies, she has
specialized in melancholy or madness, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've had terrifying times of unhappiness,'' she
says. ``After John died, there were years of crippling insanity. I
couldn't work. But I've finally reconciled by realizing I had him
through all the good years. Nobody has everything all the time.
Yes, it's nine years ago this week that he died. And I have to say
I'm very happy. I adore my three children _ Nick, 39, and daughters
Alexandra and Zoe, both in their 20s. I have a lot of friends and a
lot of work.'' (Her third upcoming film is ``The Mighty,'' which
costars Sharon Stone.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands grew up in a small Wisconsin town, where her father was
a liberal politician. Her childhood wasn't entirely idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a grandmother who didn't like me much,'' she says. ``I
only stopped blaming that on myself when I figured out she didn't
like my mother much, either. Nothing I did pleased her. And I was a
sickly kid, so that compounded things.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided early in her teens that she wanted to be an actress.
But after high school, she tried to put that goal aside and had a
brief, dispiriting stint at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little breakdown, actually,'' she says. ``Now they'd
call it a `depression.' But we didn't have that word then. My
parents immediately understood _ they knew I was just in the wrong
place. So my mother took me to New York when I was 20 so I could
try to become an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young adult, Rowlands says, she was ``terribly, terribly
serious _ as you can only be at that age. That's the nice thing
about getting older; you get somewhat lighter. We should all be
born old and finally return to our mother's wombs.''
</P>
<P>
   When she enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in
Manhattan, Rowland immediately noticed the brooding, intensely
handsome John Cassavetes _ but she did her best to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Wisconsin, all I knew was that I didn't want to
get married or have children,'' she remembers. ``I assumed it
ruined your career. So I was desperate not to fall in love. I said
all the things people say _ only I meant them! Then one day I saw
John talking to someone and I thought _ `Oh, no!' And whenever I
saw him, I'd head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she performed in a production of Archibald MacLeish's
``Dangerous Corners,'' Cassavetes came backstage to seek her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a very beautiful red dress on,'' Rowlands recalls
wistfully. ``I resisted him as long as I could.'' Which wasn't very
long: They married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Rowlands worked in the theater in the evenings, Cassavetes
formed an improvisational group with some fellow actors and began
working on what became his first film, ``Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   While his films are considered classics now, Cassavetes and his
troupe were vilified at the time for dealing so directly with such
subjects as alcoholism, infidelity and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attacked us wildly,'' Rowlands says. ``They were not
used to having their emotions so engaged or seeing anything so
intimate on screen. John's films weren't particularly sexual _ they
were all about love. People felt exposed. But years later, women
started coming up to me crying about ``A Woman Under the
Influence.'' They said it was a catharsis for them. And men
admitted it was something they'd never understood.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands is still close with many of the actors who appeared in
Cassavetes' films, including Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Seymour
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sociable,'' she says. ``I never have been. But we
revealed ourselves through acting, and we often made fools of
ourselves. That created bonds. Acting is endlessly fascinating _ if
you expose yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rowlands admits that she can still wake up profoundly
depressed _ ``I have great variations in moods,'' is how she puts
it _ but she tries to channel it all into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `What'll it be today? Let's do something with this.'
For me, acting heals. To put one foot in front of another when
you're in an awful mood _ that kind of pressure is so good. I never
found acting scary. I found it an immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has now worked with many other directors _ Woody
Allen on ``Another Woman,'' Lasse Halstrom on ``Once Around'' and
``Something to Talk About'' _ it's clear that she'll always
consider her partnership with Cassavetes to be her most precious
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's not the type to retreat into a nostalgic haze. In
fact, the older she gets, the more she feels the need to reinvent
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you new energy and keeps life exciting _ and most of
all, bearable,'' she says. ``I realized that after John died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to change your baggage and your opinion
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain age,'' she adds, ``you realize that you must be
reincarnated throughout your life. You certainly don't have to wait
until you die.''

   ``It's a phase!'' Gena Rowlands snaps at the notion that she may
be at height of her 50-year acting career. She's lived through
enough ups and downs to know better than to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a phase,'' she adds, smiling drolly. ``I see most
things happening in 10- to 12-year increments. And when you've been
around as long as I have, you begin to see things more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-60s, Rowlands is a legend in the film world. But
as a woman she's not so easy to classify.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred, worldly and streetwise at the same time, she manages
to be both a lady and a real broad _ an American Jeanne Moreau. In
fact, Rowlands has long been a popular icon in Europe, while she's
had more of a cult following at home.
</P>
<P>
   But even if her current renaissance is just a phase, it looks
like it will be a long one. She filmed three movies this year, a
thick pile of scripts arrives at her home every day _ and Sharon
Stone pays the questionable tribute of remaking ``Gloria,'' one of
the best films Rowlands made with her late husband, writer-director
John Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes (who died of liver cancer in 1989) had a bit of a
revival of his own last fall, when his last unproduced script,
``She's So Lovely,'' was directed by the couple's son, Nick
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nick also directed his mother two years ago in ``Unhook The
Stars,'' a movie he wrote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an orange and claret Todd Oldham velvet robe and tightly
clutching her first coffee of the morning, Rowlands pads out of her
bedroom in the same Hollywood Hills home where Cassavetes shot the
movies ``Faces'' (1968), ``Opening Night'' (1977) and ``Love
Streams'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, her longtime makeup artist sits ready to
transform her for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' she says, reiterating one of her oft-quoted lines, ``I
do look like a goldfish without my makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   With her live-in boyfriend, Bob Forrest, standing close by,
Rowlands immediately begins reminiscing about Cassavetes, the man
whom she credits for her success as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My late husband made a lot of great pictures,'' she says. ``It
was a very creative time we were working in. That was followed by a
not-so-creative time, which I think we're still in. So people look
back with nostalgia. I think some of the magic of that time rubbed
off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the makeup artist works, Rowlands' thin red mouth becomes
more pronounced, her platinum bob gains a healthy pouf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour was never my game,'' says the actress, who still
possesses her famously cool looks. ``I just hate that thing about
beauty. There's always someone out there better looking or worse
looking. Beauty and glamour are not real things. To depend on them
is very hard for anyone, but particularly hard for attractive
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the photo session, Rowlands brings out pictures
that were taken on the set of ``Paulie,'' the film in which she
plays a woman who forms a bond with a talking parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen different birds were used to play Paulie, as well as
several animatronic copies created by special-effects wizard Stan
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animated bird was very dear,'' Rowlands says. ``You forget
he's animated. But there was one live bird they used primarily _
and, well, I fell in love. It was unrequited, of course, but that
doesn't make it any less passionate!''
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent film ``Hope Floats,'' Rowlands plays a
taxidermist who's a constant source of embarrassment to her young
daughter, Sandra Bullock. Harry Connick Jr. plays Bullock's
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a studio picture, but it reads like an independent
picture because it's an examination of love,'' Rowlands says.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls dancing with Connick between takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had tornadoes in Austin and some terrible
weather,'' she says, ``it might have been the happiest set I've
ever been on.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is not something one generally associates with Gena
Rowlands _ at least not onscreen. In most of her movies, she has
specialized in melancholy or madness, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've had terrifying times of unhappiness,'' she
says. ``After John died, there were years of crippling insanity. I
couldn't work. But I've finally reconciled by realizing I had him
through all the good years. Nobody has everything all the time.
Yes, it's nine years ago this week that he died. And I have to say
I'm very happy. I adore my three children _ Nick, 39, and daughters
Alexandra and Zoe, both in their 20s. I have a lot of friends and a
lot of work.'' (Her third upcoming film is ``The Mighty,'' which
costars Sharon Stone.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands grew up in a small Wisconsin town, where her father was
a liberal politician. Her childhood wasn't entirely idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a grandmother who didn't like me much,'' she says. ``I
only stopped blaming that on myself when I figured out she didn't
like my mother much, either. Nothing I did pleased her. And I was a
sickly kid, so that compounded things.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided early in her teens that she wanted to be an actress.
But after high school, she tried to put that goal aside and had a
brief, dispiriting stint at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little breakdown, actually,'' she says. ``Now they'd
call it a `depression.' But we didn't have that word then. My
parents immediately understood _ they knew I was just in the wrong
place. So my mother took me to New York when I was 20 so I could
try to become an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young adult, Rowlands says, she was ``terribly, terribly
serious _ as you can only be at that age. That's the nice thing
about getting older; you get somewhat lighter. We should all be
born old and finally return to our mother's wombs.''
</P>
<P>
   When she enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in
Manhattan, Rowland immediately noticed the brooding, intensely
handsome John Cassavetes _ but she did her best to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Wisconsin, all I knew was that I didn't want to
get married or have children,'' she remembers. ``I assumed it
ruined your career. So I was desperate not to fall in love. I said
all the things people say _ only I meant them! Then one day I saw
John talking to someone and I thought _ `Oh, no!' And whenever I
saw him, I'd head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she performed in a production of Archibald MacLeish's
``Dangerous Corners,'' Cassavetes came backstage to seek her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a very beautiful red dress on,'' Rowlands recalls
wistfully. ``I resisted him as long as I could.'' Which wasn't very
long: They married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Rowlands worked in the theater in the evenings, Cassavetes
formed an improvisational group with some fellow actors and began
working on what became his first film, ``Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   While his films are considered classics now, Cassavetes and his
troupe were vilified at the time for dealing so directly with such
subjects as alcoholism, infidelity and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attacked us wildly,'' Rowlands says. ``They were not
used to having their emotions so engaged or seeing anything so
intimate on screen. John's films weren't particularly sexual _ they
were all about love. People felt exposed. But years later, women
started coming up to me crying about ``A Woman Under the
Influence.'' They said it was a catharsis for them. And men
admitted it was something they'd never understood.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands is still close with many of the actors who appeared in
Cassavetes' films, including Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Seymour
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sociable,'' she says. ``I never have been. But we
revealed ourselves through acting, and we often made fools of
ourselves. That created bonds. Acting is endlessly fascinating _ if
you expose yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rowlands admits that she can still wake up profoundly
depressed _ ``I have great variations in moods,'' is how she puts
it _ but she tries to channel it all into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `What'll it be today? Let's do something with this.'
For me, acting heals. To put one foot in front of another when
you're in an awful mood _ that kind of pressure is so good. I never
found acting scary. I found it an immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has now worked with many other directors _ Woody
Allen on ``Another Woman,'' Lasse Halstrom on ``Once Around'' and
``Something to Talk About'' _ it's clear that she'll always
consider her partnership with Cassavetes to be her most precious
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's not the type to retreat into a nostalgic haze. In
fact, the older she gets, the more she feels the need to reinvent
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you new energy and keeps life exciting _ and most of
all, bearable,'' she says. ``I realized that after John died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to change your baggage and your opinion
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain age,'' she adds, ``you realize that you must be
reincarnated throughout your life. You certainly don't have to wait
until you die.''

   COPPER-RIVER-SALMON (Seattle) _ The Gulf of Alaska was tossing
up waves of 20 feet or more and the winds roared to 40 miles an
hour, but the storm did not deter the fleet in pursuit of what is
arguably the world's best-tasting fish _ Copper River salmon _ on
their first run of the season. Why all the fuss? A string of
restaurants and fish vendors from Puget Sound to Long Island Sound,
from Miami to Los Angeles, swear that there is no other fish that
gets people quite like this first wild salmon of the season. By Tim

   UPSCALE-RESTAURANT-TRINKETS (New York) _ The prix fixe dinner at
Lutece includes three courses of the restaurant's specialties. It's
$65, wine, tax and tip not included. The Limoges plates aren't
included either, but they are, in fact, for sale ($185 for a
five-piece setting). So are the wine glasses and the linen
tablecloth. Of course there are already plenty of theme-park
restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood where you
can order a burger with a T-shirt on the side. But in the last
couple of years, more sophisticated establishments have been

A BULGING X-FILES GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you have a tough enough time every Sunday night
unraveling the complex threads of a vast government-alien
conspiracy involving shadowy figures with mysterious powers bent on
subjugating the world, just wait until you try the X-Files
interactive computer adventure game.
</P>
<P>
   All seven CD-ROMs of it.
</P>
<P>
   The massive X-Files game is out there, or at least it will be in
a few days, arriving in stores a week or so ahead of the theatrical
release of ``The X-Files'' movie and about three weeks after the
end of the smash television show's fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the game as a way to get your X fix all summer.
</P>
<P>
   With an 800-page script that has numerous possible endings,
depending on your choices and attitudes, and takes 30 to 40 hours
to play through each time, there's enough to keep a game Xer, or X
gamer, occupied until the new season starts in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a game with seven CDs is just insane,'' said Bill
Paris, a video-game writer and columnist for Next Generation and
PlayStation magazines. ``That's a new one on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the game, which is being billed as another
episode of the show, is staggering compared to other games on the
market, which seldom need more than two or three CD-ROMs to contain
all their elements, said Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And the space has been well-used. After three years of work,
they've come up with a computer game every bit as distinctive and
engaging as the show upon which it is based. May the movie be as
good.
</P>
<P>
   The game's excellence isn't a total surprise, given the
involvement of many of the talents _ on both sides of the camera _
who have made the show a smash hit for five years.
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their roles as Fox
Mulder and Dana Sculley, the pair of FBI agents who investigate
paranormal X-file cases against a paranoiac backdrop of dark
government conspiracy with aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Show creator Chris Carter, writer/co-creator Frank Spotnitz,
photography director Jon Joffin and music director Mark Snow also
had a hand in the production, said associate producer Luke Letizia.
</P>
<P>
   The game also includes such well-known supporting characters as
Assistant Director Skinner and the loopy Lone Gunmen, the three
technophiliac oddballs who help Mulder from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the game is set somewhere between the show's third
and fourth seasons, it even includes some long-dead characters,
including ``X,'' the undercover operative who before his own
untimely assassination sometimes fed information to Mulder, said
Letizia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they really do have the real people in there is
a great boost,'' said Paris. ``The problem someone like LucasArts
has with their (`Star Wars' movie-based game) licenses is that they
just put generic actors in those roles.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different from the TV show or movie, of course, is that
in the game, the player controls the story's outcome through
decisions and interactions with other characters.
</P>
<P>
   The use of software called VirtualCinema 3.0 makes a big
difference in the way the game plays, creating an experience far
better than older games that use full-motion video to tell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   The technology easily handles the demands of displaying
high-quality video and audio while allowing players to click on
clues, keep track of their equipment and work through the game's
complex story line.
</P>
<P>
   The use of high-quality, letterboxed digital video shot
specially for the game makes a big difference, too. It just looks
good, as sleek and dark and atmospheric as the Sunday night shows.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the game's producers shot more than 40 hours of video
over seven weeks in Seattle last fall in between Vancouver shoots
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was eventually edited down to just four hours of
footage, still a huge amount by computer-game standards, Letizia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The game starts as a player's character, young FBI agent Craig
Willmore, is summoned to the bureau director's office and asked to
locate the missing Sculley and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading out on the road in search of the pair, Agent
Willmore gathers a variety of gear, including a Nokia cellular
phone with a menu of built-in ``numbers'' for key sources, and a
Newton 2000 personal digital assistant to navigate locations and
access field notes.
</P>
<P>
   The player also can log into the Intelligence Network Gateway, a
computer system that provides still more information needed to
track down Mulder and Sculley and help solve the case they have
been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes many delightful touches, including in-joke
props that refer to various ``X-Files'' episodes, such as a book of
Mulder's by Jose Chung, the goofy character played by Charles
Nelson Reilly in a particularly hilarious episode.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, among the many preferences you can modify in the
game are the beam and brightness of the player's flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be `The X-Files' without flashlights, so you can
adjust that,'' Letizia said.
</P>
<P>
   At many points in the game, the player is asked how to interact
with other characters, with a choice of attitudes such as
``funny,'' ``indifferent'' or ``paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How you make those decisions affects how they (the other
characters) react,'' Letizia said. ``They may give you extra
assistance, or throw you off (the trail).''
</P>
<P>
   Really inappropriate or stupid behavior brings rebukes from
other characters, or even leaves your character dead. Game over.
Willmore on a slab. Restart.
</P>
<P>
   And because Fox expects the game to attract wide interest, it
has included ``artificial intuition,'' sort of the computer
equivalent of saying ``warmer, warmer'' when looking for clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we put it in is there are a lot of `X-Files' fans
out there who aren't gamers,'' said Letizia. ``Hard-core gamers can
turn it off if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Letizia said the game normally should take 30 to 40 hours to
complete. And because the story branches in significantly different
ways, it is possible to play the game repeatedly and have a
different experience each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several different endings,'' Letizia said. ``So
there's definitely replayability.''
</P>
<P>
   The game shouldn't be confused with the recently released
X-Files Unrestricted Access CD-ROM, however.
</P>
<P>
   That title, though attractively wrought, is designed to be
something of an interactive encyclopedia of all things X. But it is
no game, appealing mostly to hard-core fans who want to decorate
their computers with ``X-Files'' wallpaper, parse through script
synopses or check out a Web site for episode updates.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files game, however, should appeal to a much broader
crowd, something Fox is counting on with a suggested retail price
of $54.95, only slightly higher than most computer games, even
though it contains so many CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the game's heavy use of video and demanding
technology, it requires at least a 603e PowerPC Macintosh or
Pentium 120 MHz PC to run.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials are mum about how much they spent to create the
game but said they are proud of the way it looks and plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think the overall project really sets the bar for
full-motion video games. We wanted to produce a first-class title,
so we put a lot of resources into it,'' Letizia said. ``But it's
not like `Titanic`.''

TASTY INSPIRATION FROM AN EASYGOING SOURCE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dips like grilled eggplant and tomato, a smoky white bean spread
with roasted garlic and basil, an olive and tomato tapenade, and a
fava bean spread set the stage for warm-weather cocktail
gatherings. And for inspired lunches and dinners there are clams
steamed in beer, cold red pepper and fennel soup with summer herbs,
sizzling Thai beef salad, curried vichyssoise, smoked turkey and
avocado sandwiches with tangy corn relish, seared loin of tuna with
wasabi mayonnaise, and a salad of sugar snap peas with mint.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sort of recipes that are the mainstays of ``Pamela
Morgan's Flavors,'' by Ms. Morgan and Michael McLaughlan (Viking,
$29.95). This easygoing book is based on the food prepared at
Flavors, a stylish catering shop in the Flatiron district. Ms.
Morgan, its owner, once worked at the Silver Palate, as did her
co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Some recipes are fairly complicated, calling for ingredients to
be grilled or smoked or combined with other recipes that must first
be prepared. But none demand great technical expertise, not even
the delicious chicken with herbed goat cheese under the skin, which
requires a roasted garlic puree to be made and for the chicken to
be smoked on a grill as well as oven roasted. Like shelling and
peeling a pound of fava beans for a dip, it is time-consuming but
worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a number of dishes can be prepared in advance or
conveniently take advantage of leftovers. And though some recipes
call for high-quality ingredients, others call for packaged items
like canned tuna, granola, frozen berries and prepared mayonnaise,
barbecue sauce and olive tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   Though summer comes to mind for many of the recipes _ and there
are more suggested menus for spring and summer than for other
seasons _ there are many dishes more suitable for cold-weather
parties, like casseroles, creamy potato and parsnip gratin, and
filet of beef with rosemary-fig chutney.
</P>

   Here's the dope: In some forms, the hemp plant ain't so bad for
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's jampacked with essential fatty acids and amino
acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty fare ranging from
soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even lip balm.

   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.

<P>
   Here's the dope: The hemp plant, also known as cannabis sativa
or marijuana, is one of the best moisturizers around.
</P>
<P>
   The evil weed is, in fact, jam-packed with essential fatty acids
and amino acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty fare
ranging from soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even
lip balm.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp seeds can be pressed to produce a protein-rich oil that is
particularly well suited to dry skin.
</P>
<P>
   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.
It's virtually drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the two plants are different varieties of
the same species, industrial hemp is cultivated for its seeds and
stalks, which are used to make everything from textiles and paint
to margarine and paper products.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in addition to being incredibly versatile, hemp
saves trees, prompting such eco-correct celebrities as Peter Fonda
and Woody Harrelson to sing the herb's praises.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson is regularly spotted wearing hemp outfits. Last year
he even commissioned Giorgio Armani to design a deluxe hemp tux for
the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make anything out of this stuff,'' raved the actor.
``And it's non-psychoactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch is that the Controlled Substances Act, passed in
1970, made it illegal to grow marijuana in the United States, and
hemp companies are forced to source the fiber overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, a bumper crop of hemp beauty
brands has sprouted around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The earth-friendly products are sold in alternative fashion
boutiques, environmental stores and hemp shops, such as Planet Hemp
in New York's SoHo district, Frankel Bros. Hemp Outfitters in San
Francisco and Hemp in the Hollow in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to make a meal of it, The Galaxy Global
Eatery in New York stocks a cabinet of hemp cosmetics and a full
menu of hemp delicacies (including hemp burgers, which actually
taste better than they sound).
</P>
<P>
   Most hemp beauty lines have heady, aromatic fragrances _ not
recommended for those who dislike perfume. The packaging often has
a homemade feel, with boxes made of hemp or bamboo paper.
</P>
<P>
   Body Dope, a provocatively named line of shampoos, conditioners,
soaps, massage oils and lip balms from the Berkeley-based Two Star
Dog, is one of the best sellers at Planet Hemp, according to John
Powell, the store's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are worried about the name,'' he says, ``their
resistance is overcome when they try the products.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent handmade hemp soaps, such as Hempola's
hand-cut bars and All Around The World's cleansing soaps, which
contain high levels of essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange dark brown soap from Virgin Body Care
called Dirty Dan's that gently exfoliates skin with a blend of corn
meal, pumice and crushed hemp seed.
</P>
<P>
   Parched hands will benefit from an application of Sun Dog's hand
cake, a superstrength emollient packaged in a metal tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of hair care, Alterna has a new line called Enzyme
therapy that is sold only in salons. The products are formulated
with hemp seed oil and each is packaged with a tiny packet of seeds
roped to its neck. Sterilized hemp seeds, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to miss out on a natural-ingredient trend, Body Shop is
introducing a line of hemp products this summer. The company
intends to make the most of the herb's rich and varied history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written
on hemp paper,'' a spokeswoman says. ``We intend to recycle that
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that in your pipe and smoke it. &QL;

   Harrelson is regularly spotted wearing hemp outfits. Last year
he even commissioned Giorgio Armani to design a deluxe hemp tux for
the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make anything out of this stuff,'' raved the actor.
``And it's non-psychoactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch is that the Controlled Substances Act, passed in
1970, made it illegal to grow marijuana in the United States, and
hemp companies are forced to source the fiber overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, a bumper crop of hemp beauty
brands has sprouted around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The earth-friendly products are sold in alternative fashion
boutiques, environmental stores and hemp shops, such as Planet Hemp
in New York's SoHo district, Frankel Bros. Hemp Outfitters in San
Francisco and Hemp in the Hollow in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to make a meal of it, The Galaxy Global
Eatery in New York stocks a cabinet of hemp cosmetics and a full
menu of hemp delicacies (including hemp burgers, which actually
taste better than they sound).
</P>
<P>
   Most hemp beauty lines have heady, aromatic fragrances _ not
recommended for those who dislike perfume. The packaging often has
a homemade feel, with boxes made of hemp or bamboo paper.
</P>
<P>
   Body Dope, a provocatively named line of shampoos, conditioners,
soaps, massage oils and lip balms from the Berkeley-based Two Star
Dog, is one of the best sellers at Planet Hemp, according to John
Powell, the store's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are worried about the name,'' he says, ``their
resistance is overcome when they try the products.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent handmade hemp soaps, such as Hempola's
hand-cut bars and All Around The World's cleansing soaps, which
contain high levels of essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange dark brown soap from Virgin Body Care
called Dirty Dan's that gently exfoliates skin with a blend of corn
meal, pumice and crushed hemp seed.
</P>
<P>
   Parched hands will benefit from an application of Sun Dog's hand
cake, a superstrength emollient packaged in a metal tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of hair care, Alterna has a new line called Enzyme
therapy that is sold only in salons. The products are formulated
with hemp seed oil and each is packaged with a tiny packet of seeds
roped to its neck. Sterilized hemp seeds, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to miss out on a natural-ingredient trend, Body Shop is
introducing a line of hemp products this summer. The company
intends to make the most of the herb's rich and varied history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written
on hemp paper,'' a spokeswoman says. ``We intend to recycle that
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that in your pipe and smoke it. &QL;

THE ESSENCE OF SHRIMP  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The juices that foods exude as they're cooking are often lost in
the shuffle, especially when that shuffle takes place on the grill.
For years I never realized that one of the greatest assets of my
spicy grilled shrimp was just sputtering away on those hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I planned to produce this dish, however, it rained
so hard I was forced to resort to the broiler. It was then that I
remembered why broiled shrimp are so desirable: you get to savor
the juices, the essences, produced by the shrimp itself. This is
also true of shrimp that are sauteed, roasted or, for that matter,
steamed in aluminum foil or poached in a stew.
</P>
<P>
   Normally I serve spicy grilled shrimp on the skewers I cook them
on. But given the presence of the liquid and the time of year, the
dish cried for a bed of greens. Not wanting to overwhelm delicately
flavored greens with the spiced shrimp, I used a mixture of arugula
and lettuce, with a generous amount of mint, and dressed it with
olive oil and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   You can take this dish in many directions. The shrimp can be
grilled instead of broiled, and the salad can be eliminated. With
its lively flavor and lovely color _ contributed by paprika _ the
shrimp also make a great starter or finger food. The salad can be
seasoned with cilantro, parsley, basil, chervil or dill, in roughly
the same amount as the mint. Vinegar can replace the lemon juice,
or peanut oil can be substituted for olive oil. Finally, a
tablespoon or two of soy or fish sauce can be added to the salad
before tossing it, and lime juice can sit in for lemon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPICY SHRIMP SALAD WITH MINT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 20 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds shrimp in the 15-to-30-a-pound range, peeled (deveined,
if you like)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon cayenne, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   30 to 40 mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   6 cups arugula and other greens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat broiler; adjust the rack, moving it as close to the
heat source as possible. Place a large ovenproof skillet or
thick-bottomed roasting pan on the stove over low heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the shrimp with garlic, salt, cayenne, paprika, half
the olive oil and the 2 teaspoons of lemon juice; stir to blend.
Turn heat under the skillet to high.
</P>
<P>
   3. When skillet smokes, toss in shrimp. Shake the pan once or
twice to distribute them evenly, then immediately place skillet in
the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mince about one-third of the mint, and set aside. Tear
remaining leaves, and toss them with the arugula. Stir remaining
olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   5. The shrimp are done when opaque, usually 3 to 4 minutes. Use
a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate; it is fine if they
cool for a moment. Add shrimp juices to olive oil-lemon juice
mixture, and stir. Dress the greens with this mixture, and toss; if
the greens seem dry, add a little more olive oil or lemon juice, or
both. Place greens on a platter, and arrange shrimp on top or
around them; garnish shrimp with the remaining minced mint.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

TURN THE PAGE ON SUMMER DAYS WITH COOL NEW BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Here come the months of summer, when in theory you
dig your toes into the sand and pay attention to all those books
you've ignored for too long. This is a partial list of titles that
are in stores now, or will be before the pavement starts to
sizzle. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Novels good for you: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cities of the Plain'' by Cormac McCarthy (Knopf, $24). The
third novel in McCarthy's ``Border Trilogy'' brings together John
Grady Cole, the young protagonist of ``All the Pretty Horses,'' and
Billy Parham, hero of ``The Crossing,'' in a fina l story of the
West as it once was and never will be again. John Grady again falls
in love with a Mexican girl, but unlike the aristocratic young
woman of ``All the Pretty Horses,'' this one is a prostitute with
an evil pimp, and nothing good can co me of it. Like the previous
books, this has adventure, romance, stoicism, the sadness of one
era giving way to another and, ultimately, violence as only Cormac
McCarthy can portray it.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Widow for One Year'' by John Irving (Random House, $2
7.95). This book is full of writers, and although it's sometimes
bizarre and self-indulgent (in 537 pages, there's room for that),
it's Irving's best since ``The World According to Garp.'' Told in
three parts is the story of Ruth Cole, who was con ceived by her
wounded parents as a replacement for two brothers killed in a
ghastly automobile accident. The tragedy of a lost child _ indeed,
of lost boys _ is something Irving has grappled with before, but in
building upon its ramifications for Ru th he creates a sympathetic
tale. Someone once said that we tell stories to exorcise our
terrifying lives. Perhaps because he believes that, Irving tells
his stories fiercely and with considerable bravado. As Barbara
Kingsolver wrote for the Washing ton Post, ``His characters can
beguile us onto thin ice and persuade us to dance there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Freedomland'' by Richard Price (Broadway, $25). Screenwriter
Price (``Sea of Love,'' ``The Color of Money'') places this novel
in the same New Jersey setting as his last, ``Clockers,'' but
borrows its premise from the terrible South Carolina case of Susan
Smith and her murdered little boys. A White woman appears, bloodied
and stunned, in a hospital emergency room and announces that a
Black man ha s stolen her car with her young son in the back seat.
Her claim launches a search, both for the boy and for the truth, by
two characters with very different motivations: a reporter in
pursuit of the story, and the decent police detective who must co
ntend with festering racial tensions and threatened violence in the
projects near where the carjacking occurred. This novel is big,
cinematic and provocative, both a mystery and a reflection of the
great racial divide in this country, and the hope lessness that it
breeds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
These will endure: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ ``The Time of Our Time'' by Norman Mailer (Random House, $39.50).
Fifty years and 1,300 pages of Norman Mailer, edited by Norman
Mailer. Includes excerpts from novels and major nonfiction works s
uch as ``The Executioner's Song,'' as well as poems, interviews and
odd writings that seem to be dropped here out of nowhere. There's
no accounting for the mix (except to say that the editor's ego is
no small thing), but it's worth wading throughthe silly stuff to
get to Mailer at his best.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Know This Much Is True'' by Wally Lamb
(ReganHarperCollins, $27.50). Lamb's first novel, ``She's Come
Undone,'' got the nod from Oprah Winfrey's book club. We wonder if
Oprah will read this one . It is 897 pages long, enough to send
many readers staggering off in search of more manageable books. But
while this could have been shorter, it has much to recommend it. It
is a sad but also darkly funny family saga told through the eyes of
a be leaguered soul named Dominick Birdsey, identical twin of
Thomas, a paranoid schizophrenic. Dominick looks back on how their
family's past made him and his brother what they are. His love for
Thomas and his sense of responsibility toward him are at o dds with
his resentment over his brother's hold on his life. It's an
affecting story, proof that good things come in big packages, too. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trashy novels: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ ``Belladonna'' by Karen Moline (Warner, $25). Harold Robbins
meets ``The Story of O.''
</P>
<P>
   An innocent young woman goes to London in 1935 and is kidnapped
by a secret sex club, auctioned to the highest bidder and subjected
to years of raunchy treatment before she escapes and seeks revenge.
This is deeply trashy, and it's selling like ice
</P>
<P>
   cream in July.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Student Body'' by Jane Harvard (Villard, $23). Harold
Robbins meets higher education. A Harvard University student,
covering a story for the Harvard Crimson, stumbles upon a student
prostitution ring and embarks on an in vestigation that involves
sex, sex and much more sex. This was co-written, badly, by four
Harvard graduates who wanted to make money to pay off their student
loans. Their intentions were good, but their book is . . . (begin
ital) trashy. (end ital) We suspect that Harvard is more crimson
than usual. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nonfiction &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ ``Here But Not Here'' by Lillian Ross (Random House, $25). Ross,
longtime writer for the ``New Yorker,'' offers a worshipful account
of her affair with the magazine's editor, W illiam Shawn. The two
took an apartment together in 1958 with the full knowledge of
Shawn's wife, Cecille (with whom he continued to live a half-mile
away), and shared it until Shawn's death in 1992. There are some
behind-the-scenes stories about th e magazine, with mention of
friends like Joseph Mitchell and A.J. Liebling, and some of the
celebrities Ross interviewed in the old days (John Huston, Ernest
Hemingway). But mostly she writes about Shawn, her relationship
with him, her early attem pts to separate from him, and her
devotion to him when she realized she could not leave. She loved
him very much, and still does.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Monk Swimming'' by Malachy McCourt (Hyperion, $23.95).
Frank McCourt (``Angela's Ashes'') sent for his younger
</P>
<P>
   brother, Malachy, three years after he himself came to the
United States. In Ireland, Malachy had left school at 13 and was
considered, he writes, ``a dunce, doomed, (begin itals) doomed (end
itals) to mendicancy, criminality, or worse, manual labo r to the
end of my natural days.'' In America, he drank a lot, played hard
and became an actor. This memoir of the first decade in his new
life is true Irish storytelling _ ribald, raucous and funny.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tender at the Bone'' by Ruth Reichl (Ran dom House, $23).
Reichl has a flair for storytelling and admits to making ``minor
adjustments of fact'' because she finds it preferable to boring her
audience. That makes for a pretty engaging memoir. Since Reichl is
the restaurant critic for the Ne w York Times, you'll be surprised
to know that she comes from a family of non-cooking women,
including her mother, who was a manic-depressive. We hear about
them early in the book, and about how food became young Ruth's way
of making herself feel important, but the real pleasure comes
later, when she begins her education (with several mentors) in the
world of international food and the restaurants that serve it. She
reaches only young adulthood here _ her adventures on behalf of the
Times wi ll have to wait for future installments. But she includes
many recipes, and, in the tradition of restaurant critics, remains
incognito: There is no author photo anywhere. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other fiction &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ ``My Heart Laid Bare'' by Joyce Carol Oates (Dutton, $ 26.95). A
historical novel that follows a family of con artists from Colonial
times to the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Murder on Deck!'' edited by Rosemary Herbert (Oxford, $25).

Conan Doyle, Wi lliam Faulkner, Ellery Queen, Gabriel Garcia
Marquez and others.

   An adorable little pig with a penchant for pancakes, and an emu
that longs to be someone else are among this month's new offerings
for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Light summer novels and an inspirational book for girls in early
adolescence are on tap for older children. &QL;

 &UR; EDWARD THE EMU &QL; 
 &UR; Sheena Knowles; illust rated by Rod Clement (HarperTrophy, $6.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward the emu was sick of the zoo, / There was nowhere to go,
there was nothing to do, / And compared to the seals that lived
right next door, / Well being an emu was frankly a bore.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward
</P>
<P>
   tries out life as a seal, a lion and a snake before discovering
that being an emu isn't so bad, especially when there's a new girl

<P>
   Ahhhh, motherhood . . . cooing babies who sleep through the
night, toddlers who love potty training, relaxing restaurant meals
in the company of admiring strangers, preschoolers who can't wa it
to leave home for their classrooms. Think again. With a shift in
perspective, reality can be wonderful, too. It's tranquil at 3
a.m., the word ``no'' isn't so bad if Junior's second favorite word
is ``mama,'' picnics are better than restaurants , and parting is
sweetened by reunion. This is an ideal gift for new mothers.
Preschoolers also will enjoy the jokes. For ages 3-6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; IF YOU GIVE A PIG A PANCAKE &QL; 
 &UR; Laura Numeroff; illustrated by Felicia Bond (HarperCollins, $14.95)

<P>
   ``If you g ive a pig a pancake, she'll want some syrup to go
with it. You'll give her some of your favorite maple syrup. She'll
probably get all sticky, so she'll want to take a bath. She'll ask
you for some bubbles. When you give her the bubbles, she'll proba
bly ask you for a toy. . .''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning of it all. A mischievous pig with
all the whims of a toddler keeps a little girl very, very busy.

birthday party for the two draws
</P>
<P>
   them back together, with each surprising the other with the
ideal present. For ages 4-8. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Gulf of Alaska was tossing up waves of 20 feet or
more and the winds roared to 40 miles an hour, but the storm did
not deter the fleet in pursuit of what is arguably the world's
best-tasting fish _ Copper River salmon _ on their first run of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles on May 15, anxious
chefs clicked on to Web sites and called fishermen on cell phones.
Forget the weather. The chefs wanted to know how the fish looked.
Then, ``Bulletin! Bulletin! Six kings landed!'' flashed on computer
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Cavanaugh, a seafood buyer for the Thriftway supermarket
chain in Seattle, had the salmon hoisted directly from the boat
into a rented helicopter to take it to a waiting jet in the Alaskan
port of Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he airlifted it 1,500 miles south to Seattle. Looking as
if he had just won the Powerball lottery, he displayed his 500
pounds of Copper River king salmon to reporters at 5 a.m. _ 10
hours after they were yanked from the Alaskan seas. Cavanaugh's
catch was sold out by mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the fuss? After all, the world is full of farm-raised
Atlantic salmon, available year-round. And there is certainly no
shortage of Alaskan wild salmon: from now until October, about 150
million salmon will be harvested from the Last Frontier State.
</P>
<P>
   But Copper River fish are different. A string of restaurants and
fish vendors from Puget Sound to Long Island Sound, from Miami to
Los Angeles swear that there is no other fish that gets people
quite like this first wild salmon of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, grilling the first Copper River
fillets on the barbecue is a seasonal ritual, like roasting spring
lamb. For the restaurants and grocery stores that compete to bring
home the first fish, by a matter of minutes, it is an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Copper River's bounty will be available until
August. But the best-tasting of these fish, connoisseurs say, are
the early-running ones, which are available until mid-June.
Fishermen harvest the salmon for 24 hours at a time about twice a
week on average, according to the dictates of Alaskan state fish
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Copper River salmon are rich in oil, firm in flesh, almost nutty
in taste. They are high in omega-3, fatty acids that have been
shown to have certain health benefits. They are hardy, having
bulked up for the river journey of nearly 300 miles to icy
headwaters in the Wrangell Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And they are smart, which gives fishermen more respect for them
and gives diners something to brag about. The flesh, especially of
the king variety, is so red and rich that most people prefer to
drink red wine _ typically an Oregon pinot noir _ as an
accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of this quite explains the fever that builds at this
time every year, when Copper River salmon start to mass outside the
mouth of their spawning stream, about 200 miles southeast of
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   O taste and see, say the disciples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go nuts over this fish,'' said Rick Moonen, the executive
chef at Oceana in Manhattan. Barely 24 hours after the season
opened, Moonen had Copper River salmon on plates at his restaurant.
Soon after, he was going from table to table, talking about the
salmon's journey, their sex lives and the setting in which they
come to spawn and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get people so psyched about it that (italics)they(end
italics) end up talking about the sex life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As fish sex lives go, that of Copper River salmon is noble but
prosaic: after a few years at sea, they dodge ice chunks and
sharp-eyed eagles and fight the gravitational torrent of the river
to find a little home in the gravel hundreds of miles upstream,
near the very place of their birth. Then, they spawn and die.
Fishermen catch them just before they head for the sex-and-death
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 years ago, barely anyone except for fishermen and people
who look closely at canning labels had any idea what Copper River
salmon was all about. Most of the fish caught in the waters near
the mouth of the river were canned, some even sold as pet food. In
tough years, fishermen would be lucky to sell a few extra fish to a
handful of Alaskan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of how a fish became a phenomenon is usually traced
to Jon Rowley, a Seattle broker of salmon, oysters and other briny
commodities. His story, as with most Alaska fish narratives, begins
in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley and a few of his Alaskan fishing buddies were sitting in
a bar in Seattle, in 1982. ``I was aware of the superiority of the
fish,'' he said. How? ``By tasting it.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked his fishermen friends if they would be willing to try
to bring the salmon into harbor in good shape, to be sold fresh. At
the time, he said, most of these fish were caught quickly, pressed
into holds of boats, mixed with bilge water, and then sloshed
around at sea. The flesh was mush when the boats came into port, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I could handle the marketing if they just learned how
to treat the fish right once they got them on board,'' he said. The
fish, caught in long volleyball-like gill nets, had to be bled
immediately upon landing, and then iced.
</P>
<P>
   The key to preserving flavor and texture, explained Rowley, in
perhaps more detail than most people want to hear, ``is to get them
on ice just before they go into rigor mortis, and then to eat them
just as they are coming out of rigor.''
</P>
<P>
   The first year, 1983, Rowley marketed 300 pounds of fish. It was
sold in a handful of Seattle restaurants. ``It was clear,
immediately, that we had something world class,'' he said. ``There
was so much excitement, there was energy. People were talking about
this salmon like nothing they had ever tasted before.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, more fishermen tried selling fresh Copper River
salmon. By the 1990s, virtually the entire Cordova fleet _ more
than 500 fishing boats _ was following the bleeding and icing
techniques in order to sell to the fresh market.
</P>
<P>
   It required much more than a change in attitude: boats had to be
overhauled, costing thousands of dollars, and deckhands had to be
taught to treat the fish with respect. But it had its rewards. Fish
that brought a boat owner barely 30 cents a pound from canneries
were drawing six times that amount, if handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley says he ``carried the gospel'' of Copper River from city
to city, though he says he has never made much money from it. Other
West Coast cities picked up on the competition. It was like trying
to be the one to bring the first Beaujolais nouveau into town.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket chains, including giants like Safeway, got into the
frenzy. Now, chains in the midwest, long known as a seafood desert,
run advertisements proclaiming their first-of-the-season Alaskan
salmon, just a few days removed from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got off the phone to Julia Child,'' said Rowley,
between fish-brokering chores in his office in Seattle. ``She's
going to take a 10-inch-long chunk of Copper River king and roast
it.''

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; L.A. NOIR &QL; 
 &UR; James Ellroy (Mysterious, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This is what comes with success _ your old books get new
attention. Ellroy has had much success in recent years with his
novel ``American Tabloid''; his memoir, ``My Dark Places''; and
with the film version of
</P>
<P>
   his earlier book, ``L.A. Confidential.'' The three novels
published here were written in the early 1980s. They feature Los
Angeles homicide Detective Lloyd Hopkins, who is prone to violence,
cheats on his wife, and has what his partner calls ``th e supreme
police intellect.'' In other words, Hopkins solves crimes. In
``Blood on the Moon,'' he goes after a serial sex killer. In
``Because the Night,'' he uncovers a link between a multiple murder
and the disappearance of a heroic cop. In ``Suic ide Hill,'' he
finds corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department in the
aftermath of a kidnapping. Ellroy wrote the first book in 1980,
then read Thomas Harris' ``Red Dragon'' and decided that it was
``the greatest suspense novel ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   He was inspired to write two more books because, he says, he
``wanted another shot at making Lloyd Hopkins as great a character
as Thomas Harris' Will Graham.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ROLLING STONE: The Complete Covers 1967-1997 &QL; 
 &UR; (Abrams, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   There ar e some things we would like to forget. One of them is
that Tiny Tim appeared on the cover of ``Rolling Stone.'' So did
David Cassidy, Karen and Richard Carpenter, the women of ``Melrose
Place,'' O.J. Simpson (with a story called ``The Juice: A Man f or
All Seasons'') and, in 1971, Tricia Nixon, all blond and beatific,
three years before her father appeared on the cover under the words
``The Quitter.'' But there ends the bad news. Every other cover in
this book _ and there are 30 years' worth _ is just great;
irresistible, in fact. Collectively, they are a record of the most
memorable personalities of three decades, many of whom were shrewd
enough to collaborate with ``Rolling Stone'' photographers
(including Annie Leibovitz, Richard Ave don and Herb Ritts) in
manipulating their own public images. Of those who turn up more
than once, Mick Jagger is the record-holder with 19 covers. It's
great fun, introduced by the magazine's founder, Jann S. Wenner. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SPOILED &QL; 
 &UR; Nicols Fox (Pen guin, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to know any of this? Can you afford not to?
Journalist Fox became curious about food-borne diseases in 1993,
when several children on the West Coast died after eating fast-food
hamburgers. She began with a mental sc enario right out of a
science-fiction novel: Could genetic researchers be creating new
strains of bacteria that will contaminate our food supply, harming
thousands of people? Her research taught her something more
disturbing _ that pathogens indeed could infiltrate our foods, but,
Fox says, ``not by intentional manipulation on the part of a few
malevolent or careless scientists, but by unintentional and
uncoordinated shifts in our relationship to what we eat.'' This is
the sobering story of a system out of balance, ``of change,'' Fox
says, ``and the doors it opens to disease.'' She ends with a few
suggestions for cooking and eating safely in your home. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TREASURES OF THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME &QL; 
 &UR; John Thorn (Villard, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   Her e are Christy Mathewson's Bible and his checkers. Shoeless
Joe's shoes. The ball that Cy Young pitched for his 500th win on
July 1, 1910 (on his way to his immortal record, 511). A ticket
stub from the Lou Gehrig memorial on July 4, 1941, and the sh
ooting script for ``Pride of the Yankees.'' A letter written by
John F. Kennedy asking for Jackie Robinson's support in the 1960
presidential campaign (Robinson backed Richard Nixon). The bat with
which Willie Mays got his 3,000th hit, the glove he used to make
``The Catch.'' There are lots of elegant photographs here, lots of
wonderful stuff, but no captions. What were they thinking? You must
look for everything in Thorn's text, which is a nuisance, and later
you must squint as you try to r ead a minuscule reproduction of the
letter from the Mayo Clinic that ended Gehrig's career, or the
polite note written by Babe Ruth to Yankee general manager George
Weiss thanking him for the ceremony that marked his farewell to the
game. It's a han dsome book, but more frustrating than it should
be. With a sweet foreword by Ted Williams. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ROME: Oxford Archaeological Guides &QL; 
 &UR; Amanda Claridge (Oxford, $17.95)
</P>
<P>
   This handsome (if decidedly formal in tone) guide begins with a
historical overview of ancient Rome and a glossary of building
materials and techniques, architectural orders and major public
works. Claridge proceeds through the city's major archaeological
sites, offering maps, diagrams, historical background, travel
advice
</P>
<P>
   and museum information. Included are the Roman Forum; the Upper
Via Sacra; the Palatine; the Imperial Forums; the Campus Martius;
the Capitoline hill; Circus Flaminius to Circus Maximus; the
Colosseum valley and Esquiline hill; the Caelian hill and
</P>
<P>
   the Via Appia. This is one of four new books in a series.
Available are archaeological guides to Scotland, Spain and the Holy
Land. Future books will cover Egypt, western Turkey, southern
France, England, Crete, Greece, Ireland and North Africa. &QL;

 SEATTLE: roast it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Seattle, restaurants like Ray's Boathouse _ one of the first
restaurants to offer the salmon, in the 1980s _ will usually grill
the fish over alder-wood, or sear it and then bake it to serve with
a pinot noir sauce. Rowley prefers to put a touch of olive oil on
both sides of a fillet, and sear it in a hot pan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he bakes it for about 20 minutes at 280 degrees. The
process, not unlike cooking a steak, preserves the juices inside.
As side dishes, he prefers wild Northwest morels and Yakima Valley
asparagus. And he favors the obligatory Oregon pinot noir for the
accompanying wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like shuffling cards,'' he said. ``The pinot has all the
flavors of Oregon fruit, the mushrooms have all the taste of the
wild forest, the salmon are the essence of the cold waters of the
Copper River _ all mixing together.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Moonen of Oceana says the handling of the fish
makes all the difference. ``I can get fresh salmon from the Fulton
fish market, but it's generally abused,'' he said. ``Now, I have
the kings sent directly from Cordova to me in New York. I don't
take any chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm fish purveyors have not taken this run of the wild
kings lying down. The farmers say they have struggled to improve
the flavor and texture of Atlantic salmon, raised in pens. Last
year, for the first time, there were more farm-raised salmon sold
worldwide _ better than 825,000 tons _ than fresh wild salmon, the
overwhelming majority of which comes from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   But fish from pens and cement ponds are salmon without a story,
the Alaskans say. Consider the Copper River Delta. At 700,000
acres, it is the largest wetlands on the Pacific coast of North
America. More than 235 species of birds _ from trumpeter swans to
bald eagles to horned puffins _ nest in the delta.
</P>
<P>
   The marine waters are home to killer whales, Steller sea lions,
sea otters. On shore, moose, grizzly bears and wolves are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the salmon. Five species of wild Pacific
salmon _ the small pinks, the bigger sockeyes or reds, the
medium-size coho or silver, the late-running chums, and the
majestic kings or chinook _ are caught off Alaska's shore. The two
prized Copper River fish are the reds and the kings.
</P>
<P>
   The State of Alaska estimates that this year fishermen will net
about 50,000 Copper River kings and nearly two million reds. The
kings, which can reach 45 pounds, are the thickest, and tend to be
the richest. They are marbled with layers of fat and oil, the
better to protect them on the long journey to the spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova, the home port of most Copper River fishermen, is on
Prince William Sound, not far from the oil port of Valdez. When the
Exxon Valdez hit a reef in 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of
crude oil into the sound, the Cordova fishermen were among the most
angry, and the most diligent in putting up floating barriers that
kept the oil from coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River salmon runs were untouched by the spill, but
the market for Alaskan fresh salmon was badly hurt, as people
associated the state with one of the worst environmental
catastrophes of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Alaska fresh salmon are sold around the world, though none
have quite obtained the snob appeal of Copper River. Yukon River
kings, Bristol Bay sockeyes and coho from southeast Alaska are all
quite good _ when fresh and well handled _ and are abundant
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have tried to protect their catch by insisting on
labels, much as wine growers did more than a century ago in France
and Italy. But substitutes and fakes _ advertised as Copper River
fish _ still find their way to market, the fishermen say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much have to trust the restaurant and the fish
vendor,'' said Cheri Shaw, the director of Cordova District
Fishermen United, which promotes Copper river fish for about 250
boats. They are leading the effort to try to trademark the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season, it's easy to tell you're getting the real
thing, because no fresh fish has been caught yet,'' she said.
``Later in the season, you just have to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shaw, who lives in a town that is to salmon what Haut-Medoc
is to wine, prefers her Copper River fish cooked on the grill, with
garlic, salt and pepper. And she drinks French Bordeaux with her
fish _ another indication, perhaps, of how well the Cordova fishing
fleet is doing these days.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley is justly proud of the journey Copper River fish have
taken from barroom dream to high cuisine. He sees the Copper River
banners flapping in the wind outside supermarkets up and down the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He chuckles over the way restaurants in humid Houston can tout
fish that is two days removed from swimming next to a glacier. He
enjoys the helicopter rentals and general frenzy of the
competition. But nothing beats the simple pleasure, he said, of
indulging in a taste of the Alaskan spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it is,'' he said. ``It's a taste of the season.'' &QL;

   GRILLED COPPER RIVER KING SALMON FILLET Adapted from Ray's
Boathouse, Seattle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 6-ounce Copper River king salmon fillets
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Pinot noir sauce (recipe follows). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a grill using mesquite or charcoal coals. When coals
are hot, brush flesh side of fillets with olive oil and place
flesh-side down on the grill. Allow the bars of the grill to sear
the fish (it will take only a few moments), then use spatulas to
give the fillets a quarter-turn; this sears crisscross lines on the
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   2. Brush skin side of fillets with olive oil. Turn the fillets
and grill just until the center of the fish begins to look less
transparent, about 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of
the fish. Serve with pinot noir sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

CAN A RASPBERRY REALLY HURT A COW?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wash., Ohio)   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To date, no vegetables have filed any of the so-called veggie
libel lawsuits. The only cases so far have been brought on behalf
of cattle, eggs, lawns and emus.
</P>
<P>
   Food disparagement laws, as they are more formally known, are
intended to protect perishable agricultural products from false and
disparaging statements and to make it easier for growers and
distributors to sue anyone who says anything bad about their
products.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of the veggie libel suits is the one brought by
Texas cattlemen in federal court against Oprah Winfrey, who swore
off hamburgers on the air after a segment about mad cow disease.
They blamed the comment for a drop in cattle prices. The cattlemen
lost, but are appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, such suits sound silly. The lawn suit, for
example, involved a Texas agricultural agent who issued a report
critical of the sod made by a particular company. The case was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that emu ranchers would sue Honda for casting
aspersions on emus in a commercial may make most people smile. But
this is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to repeal the food disparagement laws that exist in
13 states and to discourage other states from enacting them, 26
organizations have formed the Foodspeak Coalition, with
headquarters in Washington. They include not only groups associated
with First Amendment advocacy, like the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Society of Professional Journalists, but also the
Humane Society, the United Farm Workers, Public Citizen and the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Collins, director of the coalition, said no other
industry benefits from such laws, which grew out of a lawsuit
brought by Washington State apple growers in 1989 against CBS over
a ``60 Minutes'' segment. The apple growers charged that the
program had defamed their product when it said the apples were
unsafe to eat because they had been sprayed with Alar, a chemical
used in fruit ripening. The apple market dropped sharply, and the
growers sued.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was dismissed by a federal judge, who said it violated
no existing law. The response of agribusiness was to present state
legislatures with the draft of a model act and to lobby hard for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws did not spring up spontaneously,'' said David
Bederman, a professor of law at Emory University in Atlanta and an
expert in food libel issues. ``It's a classic instance of big
business seeking to insulate itself from criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Kelly, assistant director of news services for the
American Farm Bureau, a lobbying group, said that even though he
supports free speech, such laws are needed because ``reckless
comments'' have hurt producers and shouldn't be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, countered that the First Amendment protects even those who
say things that are not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If false statements were prohibited by law, there would not be
a politician who would escape a lawsuit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oprah Winfrey case, the judge ruled that live cattle were
not a perishable agricultural product and so did not fit the Texas
law. The judge added that even if beef on the hoof were covered,
she did not believe that the statements made on the show were
disparaging or knowingly false.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas court decision is of no comfort to the Public
Interest Research Group chapter in Ohio, which sued Buckeye Egg
Farm of Cronton, Ohio, for consumer fraud for rewashing and
repackaging eggs after the expiration date and redating them. In
announcing the suit, Amy Simpson, the state director, said, ``We
have no idea how many, if any, have been made ill from these
eggs.'' Buckeye sued the group, claiming that statement hurt its
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simpson said she considered Buckeye's suit ``a form of
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger King, the lawyer for Buckeye Farm, maintained, ``You have
to balance the harm that media sound bites can have on agricultural
producers.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, technicalities have prevented a true test case of these
state laws from going to a jury. ``Frankly, I don't think this is a
good test case,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   To the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the object of such suits
is not money. ``It is to send a chilling message to millions of
people,'' he said, ``that they better keep their opinions to
themselves.''

APPALACHIAN TALE WEAVES FACT, FICTION  
 
THE BALLAD OF FRANKIE SILVER
</HEADLINE>
  Sharyn McCrumb (Dutton, $23.95) 
 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUE DOERFLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1833 in Mitchell County, N.C., Frankie Silver was hanged for
killing her husband, who by all accounts, was not the best husband.
She went to the grave with a secret, a mystery that people have
tried to figure out for years hence.
</P>
<P>
   Was she really guilty? Was she shielding someone else who
committed the crime? What did her father not want her to tell when
he shouted at her, ``Die with it in you, Frankie,'' when she
attempted to talk at the gallows?
</P>
<P>
   The mountain girl became a legend, one that Sharyn McCrumb has
taken and woven into a colorful intrigue of fact, fiction, history
and the present in ``The Ballad of Frankie Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian lore is a specialty of McCrumb, who lives in a small
town in the
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains but grew up in North Carolina,
where her ancestors had lived since 1790. Her great-grandfathers
were circuit preachers in North Carolina's Smoky Mountains, riding
over the mountains to preach in a different church each
</P>
<P>
   Sunday. McCrumb grew up hearing stories, legends and folklore of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on her expertise, the author, known for her mysteries
featuring forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson and
science-fiction satires featuring Jay Omega, b egan an Appalachian
series with the publication of ``If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O''
in 1990. ``Frankie Silver'' is the fifth in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My books are like Appalachian quilts,'' McCrumb says. ``I take
brightly colored scraps of legends , ballads and fragments of rural
life and local tragedy and I piece them together into a complex
whole that tells not only a story but also a deeper truth about the
culture of the mountain South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie Silver'' is told in alternating voi ces, with McCrumb
drawing a parallel between the Silver legend and a fictional,
modern-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Sheriff Spencer Arrowood is invited to witness the
execution of a man named Fate Harkryder, who was convicted of
killing some hikers alon g the Appalachian Trail 20 years before.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation leaves him pensive: At the time of the
conviction, he was convinced of the man's guilt. Now, he's not so
sure, remembering a comment of the former sheriff, ``These
mountains have produced
</P>
<P>
   only two murder cases that make me wonder about justice: Frankie
Silver and Fate Harkryder.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrowood investigates both events, determined to discover the
truth. What he discovers leaves him with a sense of completion but
not justice. The en ding leaves much cause for thought on the part
of the reader.
</P>
<P>
   McCrumb became interested as a child in the legend of Frankie
Silver and decided to pursue it for a novel in 1992, when she
visited Charlie Silver's grave site in Kona, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Vag uely connected to the Silver family through ancestral
marriages, McCrumb spent a lot of time researching historical
events, old newspaper articles and collections of old letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began researching the life and death of Frankie Silver,
I
</P>
<P>
   thought I was looking into a fascinating riddle concerning a
long-ago murder on the frontier. . .,'' McCrumb writes in the book.
But as she looked into the story, she found the situation really
was about the poor versus the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conclude d that Frankie Silver had much to tell us about
equal justice under the law, and that not much has changed since
she went to her death on a bright July afternoon 164 years ago.'' &QL;

A LUSTY PALE ALE WITH A LONG FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The initials IPA may be the most mysterious three
letters in the world of beer. The letters, which appear on every
label of Bass, stand for India Pale Ale, and they designate a style
of beer that is neither pale nor Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was developed for the Indian export market in the
English brewing city of Burton-on-Trent, whose copper- or
russet-colored ales were pale by comparison with brown ale or
porter.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that the beer would survive the long sea voyage
without souring, it was brewed to a high alcohol content, as much
as 9 percent by volume, and heavily hopped. Full-bodied, dry and
refreshing, India pale ale gained favor all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland Brewery, which is located on Union Square West and
recently opened an outpost in midtown (1285 Avenue of the Americas,
at 51st Street), makes a particularly fine example of the style,
which it has dubbed Indiana Pale Ale.
</P>
<P>
   Most American pale ales, trying to clone the very hoppy, flowery
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, wind up with an excessively bitter drink
lacking in body and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland's brewmaster, Jim Migliorini, has brought all the
right elements into balance, creating a clean, coppery ale, with an
assertive hoppy bite; a rich, malty flavor, and a long, lingering
finish with hazelnut overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Sold at $4.75 a pint, it combines the thirst-quenching qualities
of a German or Czech lager with the mouth-filling flavor of good
British beer. Not a bad deal.

WHERE AIRLINES LEARN SAFETY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BETSY WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 40 trainers and teachers in the airline industry went to a
Federal Aviation Administration safety workshop in Oklahoma City
last month, their concerns ranged from whether eating too many
poppy-seed bagels would cause them to fail random drug tests (not
the new tests, said Dr. Dennis Canfield, a toxicology instructor),
to how to get passengers out of a sinking or burning plane fastest.
</P>
<P>
   These flight attendants also discussed the problem of difficult
passengers, and the participants floated in a swimming pool
designed for testing water-survival equipment and techniques for
the rare occasions when they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   American and Canadian airline employees must undergo periodic
retraining in all phases of cabin procedure, so the videotapes and
news films of planes sinking, skidding off the runway or bursting
into flames did not alarm the students. But the class, at the Civil
Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, was not calm when the
instructor showed tapes of tests with electronically wired crash
dummies mounted on sleds in the laboratory downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   These tapes were run in stop-motion to demonstrate the effect of
a crash on 170-pound adults in airline seats, and on children in
various types of safety seats and harnesses that have subsequently
been disapproved for use on airlines. When the dummies flailed,
struck the airline seat in front, slid down and out of a belt or
flew right off the seat, the airline employees gasped. This was not
something they had seen unless they had experienced extreme
turbulence or been through a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Such events _ and, for that matter, evacuations _ are rarities.
Federal figures show that from Jan. 1, 1996, to June 1, 1998, there
were seven evacuations from planes of the major U.S. airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the anomaly that children under 2 are the only
passengers not required by law to be restrained in seats for
takeoff and landing, Van Gowdy, team coordinator of biodynamics
research at the institute, told the class: ``Everybody sitting on
that airplane should have an equivalent level of protection. If I
could do one thing in my career, it would be to get children off
the laps of adults during takeoff and landing.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory part of the FAA, which has so far rejected
appeals to keep children under 2 from riding in adults' laps, where
they cannot be belted in, has been gathering comments on this issue
since February. It may propose a rule on this later, Alison
Duquette, a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, said. Agency
spokesmen say letters opposing a rule assert that buying a ticket
for a young child raises the cost of air travel for a family. When
urged to enact a rule, the agency has said it might mean parents
would decide it is cheaper to travel by car, which is less safe
than air travel.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day cabin-safety workshops are offered free a few times
a year to instructors of flight attendants, trainers, union
representatives and other people involved in aircraft cabin safety.
I went to observe and participate in the evacuation drills, joining
employees from Air Canada, America West, American, American Eagle,
Boeing, British Airways, Continental, Delta, United, US Airways,
UPS Airlines, Westjet of Canada, two flight attendants' unions and
some smaller organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Donell W. Pollard, cabin-safety-program manager of the FAA, who
designed the workshops, said the goal is free exchange of
information, and the air was thick with insider talk. For example,
instructors noted the intense training they give on how to shout
instructions in an emergency. This sort of repetition means that
automatic responses kick in.
</P>
<P>
   A vital element in these orders is the avoiding of negative
terms: attendants are taught to say, ``Release your seat belt and
come this way,'' not, ``Unfasten your seat belt,'' because of the
possibility that the ``un'' syllable will be lost. ``Leave your
baggage behind'' is preferred over ``Don't take your baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said they wished they got better attention from the
passengers while giving safety instructions, but the teachers said
passengers who thought they knew everything were probably still
picking up information subconsciously. One problem often cited was
the instinct of passengers to exit the way they came in, even in an
emergency; few passengers turn to use an exit behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pollard listed 10 topics for discussion by small student
groups, ranging from evacuations and cabin fires to problems with
carry-on bags, passenger interference with crew members and
``passenger seat-belt discipline.'' Many of these problems are part
of an FAA safety drive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was frequent consideration of how to
eliminate excess carry-on bags and the resulting choked aisles and
heavily laden bins. The participants agreed that getting excess
bags checked before boarding worked better than trying to carry
bags out through the narrow aisles later. But the trainers said
that the gate agents pushed the problem down the line to the flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of several airlines mentioned new, tighter rules on
carry-ons. Ms. Pollard said that the agency was pleased at these
voluntary steps, but added that it was the many exceptions to the
limiting of passengers to one or two carry-on bags ``that get us
into trouble.'' Right now, the federal regulation says only that
airlines must create rules to get luggage ``properly stowed''
before takeoff and have these rules approved by the agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pollard said a surprising number of passengers wrote the
agency to request industrywide carry-on rules to keep ``too many
and too large'' bags out of the cabin. ``We still may write a
regulation,'' she said, ``but it will take three to five years.''
Meantime, according to participants in the workshop, more than one
airline is asking designers for bigger luggage bins in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Two exercises were carried out, one an evacuation down a slide
to the ground from a fuselage filled with theatrical smoke, and the
other a jump from a shortened wing into water while wearing a life
vest.
</P>
<P>
   For the first, we were told to wear lace-up shoes and
long-sleeved shirts in natural fibers. There was no speed
requirement, as there is when research on new slides or other
equipment is carried out. We walked in heavy smoke to the rear, up
and down steps built in the fuselage, then up the aisle, which
inclined upward. Vertigo gave several of us a sense that the
fuselage was unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   At the emergency exit, we were to fold our arms and jump out
onto the slide, landing on our backsides and sliding down. Having
done this nine years ago, I did not find it difficult, and slid
easily. A videotape showed uneven results. A synthetic shirt
created a sort of mat burn on one student's back. Several others
flung themselves out too far. Some followed the previous student
too closely and they clumped at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants have the authority to remove passengers from
the exit row to assure that everyone sitting there is able to open
a door and get out quickly. As guidance for this, Dr. G.A. McLean,
a researcher at the institute, summarized work on why passengers do
or do not get out the exit in a survivable crash, defined as one in
which the passengers do not all die of injuries. Shown on a grid,
age appears as the major factor in a passenger's ability to get
out, with an older passenger less likely to escape than a younger
one. This has even more impact than the width of the escape aisle,
McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   The next factor is weight, with the heavy doing less well than
the light; then gender, with men holding the advantage. Height was
also considered, but any differences were negligible in using the
overwing exit.
</P>
<P>
   The students discussed tactful ways of transferring passengers.
One suggestion: ``It is not that you are in the way; I am trying to
be sure you get out safely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the water evacuation, I stood in a small-plane fuselage
wearing clothes, running shoes and an inflatable life vest. The
student behind me said, ``Just inflate one half.'' On the wing, I
pulled one of the two devices, it inflated and I jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pollard said later that an airline could give this
half-a-vest order or not, depending on several things, including
the type of life jacket. Where this is recommended, it is to keep
passengers from being too bulky as they exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out foot, head, foot,'' the voice from behind said. I
avoided conking my head this way. In the water, I inflated the
other half of the jacket and we all struggled into a life raft,
which sustained us until a plug got knocked out and we all went
back into the water. The instructor said that was not part of the
test.
</P>
<P>
   After we flung off our vests, the seat-cushion exercise was most
valuable. We were told that swimming in ocean water while waiting
for rescue speeds the loss of body heat, bringing on hypothermia.
As we bobbed around embracing our cushions, we emulated a videotape
we had watched, joining ourselves into clusters by facing each
other and reaching around the facing person's cushion. Then we put
someone between the two cushions, and so on. Soon we had a big
cluster, and floated upright easily. Research indicates body heat
is better preserved this way. I could also see it would be a good
way to hold up a child or old person.

WHAT'S GREEN AND HAS STRIPES? A ZEBRA TOMATO

<P>
   Take heart, all ye who harbor a taste for green tomatoes. No
longer do you need to wish in secret that the sun will dim and the
winds will blow, so that regular tomatoes will not ripen but will
fall to the ground prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   No longer must your hankerings for fried green tomatoes leave
you dependent on the unkindness of nature.
</P>
<P>
   The zebra tomato has arrived, and it will remain on shelves as
long as the sun shines in Southern California and Mexico, where
tons of this green heirloom variety are now being grown.
</P>
<P>
   They are available in Manhattan at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the
Americas (Ninth Street); Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince
Street), and Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street),
and by mail through Culinary Specialty Produce, (908) 789-4700.
</P>
<P>
   And these zebras are lookers. Their skins can be green on green,
or tawny with green stripes. The fruit is smallish and can be round
or plum-shaped; the insides are firm, pulpy and chewy, finely
balanced between acid and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the zebras are fully realized adults, not striplings
harvested before their time, they taste more mellow than sharp and
are firm without being hard.
</P>
<P>
   A cornmeal dusting and some bubbling hot olive oil do wonderful
things to slices of zebra. The tomatoes make delicious preserves
and pickle nicely.
</P>
<P>
   In exotic recipes, like Vietnamese chicken salad, thinly sliced
strips of zebra pulp can take the place of green papaya. A touch of
sugar and a splash of vinegar or lemon let the cook exaggerate the
zebras' naturally mild sweet and sour taste.
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek the juicy succulence of most heirloom tomatoes
might find zebras lacking. They don't squirt or lend themselves to
poetic recollections of Grandmother's garden.
</P>
<P>
   No, zebras are self-possessed. Their natural firmness allows
them to hold up well in the wok, saute pan, oven or grill. They may
not be juicy, but they are cool. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The kinds of people we don't like
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a group of us who get together regularly to discuss the
events of the world, the price of watermelons and whether it'll
ever rain again in our lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, we talk about the kinds of people we don't
like.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the foundation of lasting friendship, to have like
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And there isn't a bigot among us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a thing in this world against such-and-such kind
of people,'' one fellow allowed. ``Fact is, I've only known one of
them. I didn't like him, but _''
</P>
<P>
   That's as good an example as any as to the level of our
enlightenment on the brotherhood of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Here's the story I wanted to recount, as shared by
one of the group. I'll try as best I can to tell it in much the
same words as he did:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was back in college,'' he began. ``A bunch of us roomed
in a big ol' house. The rooms were so large that most all of us had
a roommate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for this one fellow. He was one of those typical (fill
in the blank as to your own dislikes). About all he and the rest of
us ever could agree on was that he and the rest of us couldn't get
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about his alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every evening he'd wind that clock _ crrrank, crrank, crrank.
Next he'd drag the chair he kept by his bed over to the closet on
the far side of his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd climb up on the chair, take the alarm clock and place it
on the highest shelf way back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he'd move the chair back across the room. Finally, he was
ready for bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the next morning, 6 a.m., that clock would start ringing
_ and it would ring and it would ring and it would ring. By the
time he got up, moved the chair to the closet, climbed up on the
chair, found the clock and turned off the alarm, everybody in the
house would be awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him one time why he didn't keep the clock by his bed.
He said if he did he'd just reach over, turn it off and go back to
sleep. Hiding the clock in the closet was the only way he could
guarantee he'd get up on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to him that there were other people trying
to sleep. That's the kind of person he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until years later did I ever hear what became of him. It
turned out he was a professor of sociology in a big university. I
read about him in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was back in the early 1960s. Science had come out with
some kind of pill that could lighten the skin. As a result, he
predicted that there soon wouldn't be any black people left, that
all of them would want to take a pill to make themselves white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, `He hasn't changed one bit.' ``
</P>
<P>
   So it is that late in life I've come to understand that it's not
so much racial differences as it is cultural peculiarities that
tend to divide us.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares what color another fellow is, just so long as he
thinks, acts, votes and believes the same as we do?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on our upbringing. We like people who are like we are.
</P>
<P>
   And there isn't a bigot among us.

FOR THE ADVENTUROUS, OBSCURE LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a true wine enthusiast, the letters ABC have one meaning:
Anything But Chardonnay. It's a polite way of indicating that a
strident minority is bored with America's favorite white wine and
is looking for something new and different.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it doesn't take much time in a liquor store to
discover that plenty of wine fans feel the same about the popular
reds _ cabernet sauvignon, zinfandel and yes, even merlot.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of substitutes, of course: pinot noir is on a
roll; the Rhone grapes _ syrah, mourvedre, grenache _ are popular;
white grapes like pinot blanc, pinot gris and that flashy newcomer
viognier are all welcome at most people's tables. Even the
much-maligned riesling has its champions.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, however, this list is tame stuff. To the true
adventurer, it offers little. Fortunately, there is another wine
world out there, a place where genuine rarities exist, where there
are wines guaranteed to vanquish enological ennui. And it's open to
anyone with a bit of imagination and some pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   Beauzeau is a wine that's not a household name (perhaps with
good reason). This red, a blend of zinfandel, petite sirah,
grenache, carignan, valdiguie and charbono, was introduced recently
by Beaulieu Vineyards, one of California's most respected wine
producers. And, yes, it's pronounced the way you think, and, yes,
the winery coyly acknowledges that the name is a joke. Sort of. The
wine isn't half bad, but what bozo thought up the name? (It brings
to mind a California wine produced some years back by a fellow
whose winery was going through hard times. He called it ``Chateau
Cache Flowe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Many other off-the-beaten-path choices are quite serious. Les
Vineux, for example, is an intensely sweet wine that an Oregon
vintner, Andrew Rich, makes from frozen gewuerztraminer grapes. The
grapes are frozen after picking so that the water in them turns to
ice and can be separated from the thick, sugary pulp. This
remaining, highly concentrated juice, is then fermented.
</P>
<P>
   Rarer still is a true ice wine. The Germans and the Alsatians
make it when conditions permit. One is produced now and then in New
York State, from the vidal grape. Vidal is a hybrid, a cross
between native American varieties and a European grape known as
trebbiano in Italy and ugni blanc in France. As in northern Europe,
the grapes for this wine hang on the vine long after the regular
harvest until they are literally frozen by winter temperatures. The
wine produced from this icy process also has a sweet taste.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Valley wine maker Philip Togni makes another dark,
sweet wine he calls Ca' Togni, from a rare grape known as the black
muscat of Alexandria. In the 17th century, when many of the great
vineyards of Europe were still swamps or cattle pastures, the
world's most-prized wine was Constantia, from Cape Town. Constantia
is once again produced in the vineyards of the Western Cape but no
one is sure how closely it resembles its ancestor. Togni thinks his
Ca' Togni, of which he makes very little, is close to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Some rare wines turn up unexpectedly. When Joe Heitz started
Heitz Cellars in the Napa Valley back in 1961, he found vines on
his new property, which turned out to be grignolino, an Italian
grape probably planted years before by an immigrant farmer. To this
day, the rose wine Heitz continues to produce from those vines has
a small but loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   Some lesser-known wines have been here all along. The early
settlers in California were casual about naming the vines they
brought with them from the old country. Mourvedre, an important
grape in Chateauneuf-du-Pape in France, they called mataro. Durif,
another little-known French grape, became petite sirah, and the
muscadet grape, from the western reaches of the Loire Valley,
became pinot blanc. Some growers have reverted to the original
names. A few wineries have made durif wines, and world-famous Ridge
Vineyards regularly produces a mataro. Zinfandel, a grape whose
origins were a mystery for a century, has been traced back to Italy
where it was called primitivo and to Croatia where it was _ and
still is _ known as plavac mali. There is some speculation in all
this; nevertheless, several California wineries have produced
primitivos that only a scientist could distinguish from zinfandel.
But even America's adventurous wine makers will go only so far. At
this point, there have been no California plavac malis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are some wine oddities that have remained obscure
for good reasons. Take, for example, the mission grape, the first
wine grape introduced in this country. Some months ago, in Los
Angeles, I sampled wine made from this variety for the first and, I
hope, last time. The mission grape arrived in California in the
late 17th century from Spain by way of Mexico. Its name comes, of
course, from the Franciscan and Jesuit missions where it was first
planted. For well over a century, it was the principal U.S. wine
grape. Zinfandel and other more refined varieties eventually edged
it aside, but there are still hundreds of acres of missions planted
in California and there are still people who drink the wine made
from it.
</P>
<P>
   But then plenty of people enjoy wine made from the Concord grape
whose bouquet reminded the English wine writer Jancis Robinson of
the smell of ``a wet, cheap fur coat.'' Concord is still grown in
New York State and Washington State. Where fine wines are
concerned, concord and mission grapes are obsolete. I picture their
dull, clumsy wines favored by people who still use typewriters and
drive DeSotos.

`STUDS LONIGAN' AUTHOR SCORES OTHER WORKS AS THE BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of necessity, I am preparing to unload a few hundred (thousand?)
books. I'll retain those that are lifetime friends and by various
means will discard others that have outworn their welcome or
usefulness. But what should I do with ``Judith'' and ``Olive and
Mary Ann''?
</P>
<P>
   Should I keep them because the author gave them to me? After
all, the author was James T. Farrell, not an insignificant figure
in the pageant of American literature. But both novels _ which he
didn't inscribe _ seem inconsequential; I read them dutifully soon
after their presentation, but now have only fuzzy recall of what I
read.
</P>
<P>
   The author, though, rated them among his very best work. Surely
the author was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   James Thomas Farrell (1904-1979) was a fallen star when I met
with him in his rather shabby Manhattan apartment, about a year
before he died. He had agreed somewhat grudgingly to the
appointment I requested, and he was gruffly distant at the start.
But I broke through to him through the device of baseball talk.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell was one of baseball's foremost fans, an eternal student
and scholar of the game; and he was quite surprised that I could
keep up with him. When he made reference to a completely forgotten
player who he once thought was the greatest he'd ever seen, I
blurted ``Charlie Hollocher'' before he had identified by name that
idol of his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   So we talked some baseball, and he invited me to attend a game
at Yankee Stadium with him; he was proud of his lifetime pass. It
might have happened, but Jim Farrell died before another season
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Once he was relaxed, I pressed him to talk about his books. I
expressed admiration for the Studs Lonigan trilogy, which he
dismissed as ``apprentice work,'' contending that his mature
performances occurred much later. It is typical of authors to
disparage work they know as secure in reputation, and to defend and
champion their failures.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell wrote ``Young Lonigan'' at age 25, three years before it
saw publication. ``Gas House McGinty,'' written even earlier, was
published next, in 1933, while Farrell was at work on ``The Young
Manhood of Studs Lonigan.'' It appeared in 1934, and ``Judgment
Day'' completed the trilogy a year later. Farrell's reputation was
made when the Modern Library issued ``Studs Lonigan'' complete.
</P>
<P>
   It's still formidable, more than the sum of its parts. The
pulsating narrative of life on Chicago's South Side in the early
decades of this century reveals Farrell as the premier disciple of
Dreiserian naturalism. With its keen portraiture of
lower-middle-class Irish-American Catholics, ``Studs Lonigan'' is a
sweeping entertainment, now even more notable as a period piece;
but social tragedy is its stunning resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The character of goggle-eyed, baseball-obsessed Danny O'Neill is
in the background of the Lonigan books. Danny, representing Farrell
himself, moved to the forefront of a tetralogy issued from 1936 to
1943. The titles are ``A World I Never Made,'' ``No Star Is Lost,''
``Father and Son'' and ``My Days of Anger.'' Accorded mild praise
at the time, they were forgotten by the time Farrell added an
O'Neill postscript _ ``The Face of Time'' _ in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote and wrote and wrote some more _ novels throughout the
'60s and '70s, including a series focused on Eddie Ryan and other
tales centered on Ryan's friends. Farrell said his every character
was based on some person he had known. ``The Death of Nora Ryan''
(1978) was an honorable swan song, but we may not have read the
last of James T. Farrell _ his apartment was strewn with
unpublished manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studs'' unarguably is Farrell's monument, but ``My Baseball
Diary'' (1957) is a charmer for those of us who love the game. I
wish I could have had more time with him, and maybe I'll hold onto
his obscure books.

FETZER VINEYARDS CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1994 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fetzer Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 1994 Barrel Select. North
Coast. About $13.
</P>
<P>
   For consistent quality at a reasonable price, year after year,
it's hard to beat Fetzer's Barrel Selected line of wines. This
rich, flavorful 1994 cabernet is an excellent example. The
appellation is North Coast because the grapes come from vineyards
in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties. After fermentation, the new
wine remained in contact with the grape skins for two additional
weeks to gain extra color and richness. About 12 percent of the
blend is what the winery calls a special cabernet from Howell
Mountain in Napa County that was aged separately in American oak.
There's quite a bit of oak here, but then this is a fairly big wine
_ almost 14 percent alcohol _ and it handles the oak component
well. Everything is in balance.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prix fixe dinner at Lutece includes three courses
of the restaurant's specialties like smoked codfish with white
truffle oil, black bass with lobster sauce and pineapple
mille-feuille. It's $65, wine, tax and tip not included.
</P>
<P>
   The signature deep-blue and white Limoges plates aren't included
either, but they are, in fact, for sale ($185 for a five-piece
setting).
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying them. Designed for the restaurant's
executive chef, Eberhard Mueller, thechina is, Mueller said, ``the
highest quality, up to the standards of Lutece.'' And with a phone
call to Bergdorf Goodman, they can be yours.
</P>
<P>
   So can the logo-embossed silver wine coaster on the table at
Jean Georges; the restaurant has ordered a shipment to sell for $55
each. And at Aureole, there's an ash-wood box specially designed by
the architect Michael Graves _ $75 by itself, or $175 filled with
foods from the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   New York, of course, has plenty of theme-park restaurants like
the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, where you can order a
burger with a T-shirt on the side. But in the last couple of years,
more sophisticated establishments have been following suit, with
their own kind of refined commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, there's nothing so crass as a price tag in
sight. Often, it's a matter of asking if the pretty tableware is
for sale. Other times, one's shopping antennae must be up _ putting
two and two together upon spying a display case that looks as
though it would be right at home in a hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   At La Caravelle, the French grande dame on West 55th Street,
diners who must wait a minute for a table can scrutinize the Chanel
watches on display in a locked glass case. Interested buyers are
directed to the Chanel boutique, two blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing exercise in mutual image-buffing, the restaurant
is periodically represented by a little table and menu in Chanel's
window. And Thursday during lunch, models wearing Chanel's fall
line will saunter through the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties declined to be specific about exactly who pays whom
for what, but they agreed that the arrangement benefits both
equally. (In a further celebration of consumerism, the shelves in
La Caravelle's foyer that used to store men's hats is now a
decorative tableau of shopping bags from Saks Fifth Avenue,
Tiffany's and the like.)
</P>
<P>
   At Aureole, the Michael Graves box is discreetly displayed on a
pedestal next to a stack of cookbooks written by the chef and
co-owner Charlie Palmer. The dessert menu advises customers that a
maple Shaker box packed with a quarter-pound of the restaurant's
chocolates and some petits fours is available for $45. ``We don't
push it, but we sell about four a day,'' said Vincent Santoro, the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the teddy bears at the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teddy bears at Rainbow are the most popular purchase at
the restaurant,'' said Robyn Massey, the director of public
relations for the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the designer of the waiters' uniforms, the costumed
bears, at $65, $75 and $85, include Rhonda the Cigarette Girl Bear,
outfitted in a black satin dress and wearing a perky pink pillbox
hat. The bear's outfit is identical with that of the real cigarette
girl (also, by the way, named Rhonda _ Rhonda Muziani), who roams
through the dining room with a tray full of bears looking for
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We substituted bears for cigarettes when the no-smoking laws
went into effect,'' Ms. Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whiteman, a co-owner of the Rainbow Room, sighed
slightly at the mention of the daily stuffed animal parade through
the restaurant, one of the world's most famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's an almost inevitable kind of brand marketing that is
happening all over the country now,'' said Whiteman, who as a
partner in the Joseph Baum &AMP; Michael Whiteman Co. is also an
international restaurant consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if many restaurants make substantial amounts of money
selling merchandise, but it's great advertising,'' he said. ``A
restaurant souvenir is a permanent extension of the restaurant
experience. If you buy a plate and take it home, you'll remember
the experience every time you use it. If you give it to a friend,
so will they.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room's silver-rimmed Art Deco dinner plates,
designed by Milton Glaser and made by Tiffany, are $30 a pair.
Sterling-and-enamel cuff links and stickpins are also for sale in
the display case by the cigar counter.
</P>
<P>
   Dale DeGroff, Rainbow's legendary bartender, is in the process
of designing a martini kit _ shaker, stirrer and glasses in a case
_ to add to the merchandise, which recently went on sale through
the restaurant's website (www.rainbowroom.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Monkey Bar is just getting into the act. On Monday, Hermes
china arrived at the restaurant very quietly _ for dessert. The
Hermes Africa pattern _ a subtle Noah's ark design that includes
monkeys _ has had a new desert designed especially to go on it, a
pastry, pineapple sorbet and rice pudding confection that fits both
the design and the mood of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who remark on the dish, which costs $98 and goes
safely into both microwave ovens and dishwashers, will be given a
brochure about the entire pattern, which can be purchased from the
Hermes shop a few blocks away, on East 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which will receive no compensation for acting as
an Hermes showcase, stands to benefit by the company it keeps.
``It's a great marriage with Hermes,'' said Tony Masiello, the
manager. ``It cements our classic style.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs were on to the retail phenomenon early. The
``21'' Club, which has always sold cigarette lighters and umbrellas
imprinted with its symbol, now also sells aprons, toy trains,
baseballs _ even T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Sirio Maccioni accommodated his customers at the old Le Cirque
with Villeroy &AMP; Boche china and oversize Italian-made Burgundy
glasses for at least a decade. But restaurants do not have the room
to keep much stock on hand, he said, so small quantities have to be
ordering continually, which is frankly a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six years, we did over a half million dollars' worth of
business _ but not really for a profit,'' Maccioni said.
</P>
<P>
   At the new Le Cirque 2000 on Madison Avenue, diners have have
already asked to buy the crystal and the china, designed by Adam
Tihanymade and made by Bernardaud with its circus motifs. But
arrangements with the French company for retail orders is taking
time, Maccioni said, adding that ``early next year,'' the china and
glassware will be for sale, along with the small individual silver
drip espresso pots and _ most popular _ the elongated silver sorbet
servers designed by Ricciarelli, the Florentine silversmith.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it will be on display in a glass case, at the top of
the entrance stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some items are available at restaurants and nowhere else. Take
the silver holders for mineral water bottles that are greatly
admired on the tables of Jean Georges. They will go right in the
glass case, next to Vongerichten's new cookbook. So will the silver
wine coasters. (The shipment is expected in August.)
</P>
<P>
   For napkin rings, there's no place like Jo Jo, another
Vongerichten restaurant. The wide, brightly colored acrylic napkin
rings, in use at the bistro since it opened in 1991, are finally
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always wanted to buy them,'' said Lois Friedman,
manager of Jo Jo. Designed by a New York artist exclusively for the
restaurant (she would not say who), this season's versions come in
four translucent pastels. Since they're already on the tables, and
the foyer at the restaurant is notoriously tiny, there will be no
display case.
</P>
<P>
   Selling them to customers makes even more sense on the balance
sheet than it seems. Ms. Friedman said the napkin rings, although
closely watched and swiftly retrieved by eagle-eyed waiters, have
shown a remarkable tendency to make their way out the door.

LAMB NECK IS NOT JUST FOR THE KITCHEN STAFF ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the sixth of eight columns by Daniel Boulud, the chef and
owner of Restaurant Daniel, in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.)  
 (HLW)  
 By DANIEL BOULUD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was a young cook in France, it was common for
the butcher to give the kitchen staff the lamb neck. He would take
the cut, considered too humble to serve to the restaurant's guests,
and slice it so that each piece had some of the firm, chewy meat
and the flavor-giving bones. We would roast the lamb with garlic,
dried fennel, and herbs, and, to a cook, the crew would love it.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when lusty flavor is so much in demand, the neck of
the lamb is as welcome in the dining room as it was in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   At my restaurant, I serve the neck as part of ``an epigram of
lamb,'' a dish that uses many parts: the neck and shoulder are
boned, stuffed, and braised; the rack and saddle are marinated and
roasted; and the leg is studded with garlic and herbs, and given a
long, juicy roast. This time, I decided to create a special dish
for this underappreciated cut.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of all possible worlds, you would have your butcher
reserve a whole neck, which is about a foot long and looks a little
like an oxtail. He would bone and butterfly it so that you could
stuff it with savory ground pork, roll and tie it, and then braise
it.
</P>
<P>
   But necks can be hard to come by. If you can't get one, use a
boned and butterflied shoulder. (You can also skip the stuffing and
just braise lamb shanks.)
</P>
<P>
   To get the most from the neck, which is a relatively tough cut,
I brown the meat first and then braise it slowly in white wine with
a lot of carrots, Texas onions, and fresh fennel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the lamb emerges from the oven, the vegetables,
nourished by the cooking juices, have softened and sweetened, in
the style of the classic beef dish, boeuf aux carottes.
</P>
<P>
   And like so many rustic dishes, this one proves what good cooks
have always known: The poorest cuts can produce the richest
flavors. You've just got to treat them right.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED LAMB NECK WITH SPRING CARROTS, ONIONS, AND FENNEL
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 3 hours
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   3 large white mushrooms, cut into \-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 slice stale or oven-dried crustless white bread, cut into
\-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   { pound ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lamb neck, about 10 to 12 inches long, bone removed
lengthwise, meat deveined and butterflied, so that it lays flat and
is { inch thick (or 1 lamb shoulder, cut in the same manner)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   12 medium carrots (preferably California), peeled and cut
diagonally into {-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   6 Texas or Vidalia onions, trimmed and cut in half from root to
top
</P>
<P>
   1 fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into {-inch wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle dry white wine, preferably chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   1. In medium saute pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of
the olive oil. Add onion, and cook, stirring, until it is
translucent, about 4 minutes. Add mushrooms, and salt and pepper to
taste. Saute until mushrooms are just tender. Finely chop 1 clove
garlic. Add it to pan with half of the chopped thyme; saute 2
minutes. Stir in bread cubes and parsley; saute 1 minute. Remove
pan from heat, and allow to cool. Add chopped basil, ground pork,
and salt and pepper to taste. Knead mixture by hand to blend well,
and set aside in a cool place.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place lamb on work surface, and
season with salt and pepper. Spoon stuffing down center of meat,
forming cylinder. Roll meat firmly around stuffing, shaping it into
a roast. Tie roast with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals, to
secure stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place large deep roasting pan over medium-high heat, and add
remaining olive oil. Slip lamb into pan, and sear it, turning
frequently, until well browned all over. Add 2 tablespoons of the
butter, and baste lamb with combined pan fats. Roast lamb in oven
for 15 minutes, basting regularly. Give lamb a quarter turn, and
roast for 15 more minutes. Remove pan from oven, and carefully pour
off accumulated fat. Slice remaining garlic cloves, and add to pan
with remaining thyme, 2 tablespoons butter, carrots, onions,
fennel, and salt and pepper to taste. Continue roasting for 20
minutes, turning and basting the meat and stirring the vegetables
twice during this time. Add wine; if vegetables brown too quickly,
reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Braise meat and vegetables
for an additional 1{ hours, turning and basting every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, transfer roast to cutting board, and remove
strings. Cut roast into 8 pieces. Arrange lamb on warm serving
platter, top with vegetables, and keep warm. Pour pan juices into
saucepan, and boil until reduced to 1 cup. Pour juices over lamb
and vegetables, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

   Marshall McLuhan, the 1960s media critic, looked at television

of last year's cruise. The Internet is looking less like McLuhan's
homogenized global village than a network of electronic villages,
each one crying, ``I am.'' And the only plugged-in melting pot in
sight is at Diana's Kitchen. &QL;

   ``Do you like really good cheese?'' Ricki Carroll asks at
www.cheesemaking.com, site of the New England Cheesemaking Supply
Co. in Ashfield, Mass. ``Well, we think that you haven't tasted
really good cheese until you've tasted fresh homemade cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   But once you've tasted your own fresh-made cheese, she warns,
you can never go back to cheese from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Heed this siren song at your own peril. Ms. Carroll studied the
cheesemaker's art in Britain, France and the Netherlands and has
taught it for 20 years. Click on Cheesemaking 101 for a foretaste.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that novices try making a soft, spreadable
fromage blanc (starter kit, $17). Soft cheeses can be made almost
immediately. Hard cheeses take longer to learn and need aging. For
hard cheeses, she sells the Wheeler cheese press _ at $211, the top
of Ms. Carroll's line _ made for her in Devon, England.
</P>
<P>
   She will put those who become really serious _ buying a herd of
sheep, for instance _ in touch with her own suppliers. &QL;

   Here are three restaurant-review sites that cater to the
undecided New York diner-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passport to New York Restaurants'' (Passport Press, $10.95) is
by Peter D. and Amy Meltzer and John F. Mariani, food and wine
critics who visit restaurants anonymously, pay for their meals and
write pithily.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is searchable at
http://newyork.digitalcity.com/passport. The site, like the current
edition of the guide, the 12th, limits itself to 500 restaurants.
Click on categories like Romance, Cheap Eats, Fun Spots for Kids
and Grand Celebration to narrow the search.
</P>
<P>
   Steven A. Shaw, a lawyer, has eaten his way through New York
restaurants for years, especially the French ones, and he gives
reviews of more than 200 and opinions about every bite at
www.shaw-review.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cuisine Net (www.cuisinenet.com) offers survey-based reviews not
only for New York, but also for Atlanta, Chicago, Miami,
Washington, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and
Portland, Ore. For New York, the site lists 1,455 restaurants,
based on 3,753 surveys filled out by online visitors, said Kian-Lam
Kho, founder and president of Cuisine Net.
</P>
<P>
   It took some searching to find one restaurant reviewed by all
three, but Chanterelle in TriBeCa met the test. Cuisine Net writes:
``Mention Chanterelle to anyone who's been there and here's what
you'll hear: `Oh, I love Chanterelle,' said in a voice laced with
longing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw begins: ``Mention Chanterelle and a lot of people go `ooh'
and `ah!' I do not agree.'' Touche.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuisine Net review is the only one of the three with a
photograph. The review is short, calling the service at the
restaurant whip-smart and the food extraordinary, with a rating of
8.3 out of 10 (the average of 17 surveys).
</P>
<P>
   The Passport review rates the food a little higher, 4.5 out of
5, names dishes (like the signature seafood sausage) and calls the
seasonal menus ``original and enticing.'' But it warns the
prospective patron, ``The tranquillity of the dining experience may
be shattered by the astonishing prices'' _ $75 to $89 a person,
without wine.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw writes that Chanterelle was better years ago, when his
mother-in-law gave him a birthday gift certificate. He has found
that the waiters can be grouchy and thinks the room is too big and
unattractive, but he loves the grilled seafood sausage appetizer.
He recommends three other places in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Reading all three of these reviewers gives prospective diners a
more useful composite picture than any one alone can. And all three
welcome online reactions. Shaw, especially, says he loves feedback.

CRACKED CHEESECAKE SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LINDA AMSTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When I bake cheesecake, cracks appear on the surface. Why is
that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to ``The Joy of Cooking'' and
author of ``The Birthday Cake Book,'' says cracks on the surface of
a cheesecake may result from excess air in the mixture (which makes
it rise and then fall like a souffle), high temperature, overbaking
or cooling too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of cheesecake, and the kind you want also
affects whether or not it cracks. One is a smooth, evenly-baked
custard with a comparatively soft crust and no cracks. The other is
a dense, creamy custard with deeper flavor, a crisper crust, and a
crack or two.
</P>
<P>
   For the smooth style of dessert, use a recipe that calls for
putting the cake pan in a hot water bath in the oven. Hot water
acts as insulation and almost invariably keeps the cake from
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   For the creamy style of cheesecake, use a recipe that calls for
baking at a high temperature for about 15 minutes, then finishes
the cooking at a very low temperature. Cracks often appear on this
type of cheesecake, but they are easily, and deliciously, disguised
by a glaze and fruit slices, traditionally strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Since cheesecakes are tricky, only use recipes from sources you
trust, and follow them to the letter.

SAY IT AIN'T SO, PAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fisk Rubber Co. used to employ an advertising logo featuring
a sleepy little boy, in one-piece pajamas, yawning, holding a
candle in one hand and with an old-fashioned automobile tire over
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The copy with the illustration asked simply, ``Time to
Re-tire?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. It is. And I am. So this is by way of a valedictory
message.
</P>
<P>
   An early photograph of me (I was about 2 1/2) shows me posed at
an upright Underwood typewriter in a cluttered newspaper office.
That long-ago snapshot was taken by my father, Tom Truly, and that
newspaper office was where he was city editor, in Wichita Falls,
Texas. His father, whom I never knew, also was a newspaperman.
Before the turn of the century he cruised Runnels County in a
buggy, jotting down news items in a little notebook. My mother was
in this business, too.
</P>
<P>
   You will notice that I called my father, who died in 1959, a
newspaperman. He would have been amused to have been called a
journalist. ``Journalist'' is a high-toned word that leads people
to attend professional journalism conferences and drink wine
instead of beer. Everything considered, I would rather be recalled
as a newspaperman. Anyway, the best ``journalists'' I have known
over a semi-pro and professional print career of 40-odd years have
been newspapermen. And, to be politically incorrect, some of those
excellent newspapermen were women.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unforgettable moments. As when Cope Routh, an
old-school police reporter, came into the office in Midland, Texas,
years ago with the verdict from a trial he was covering. ``The
jury,'' he announced, ``said it wasn't rape because when he and she
went through the hotel lobby and upstairs to their room, she was
the one carrying the case of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Now I will be an ex-newspaperman instead of an old
newspaperman. I remember a joke about an old newspaperman who had
to get a second job, because there wasn't much money in old
newspapers. It's true, there wasn't. I suppose the big advantage
about being called journalists instead of newspapermen is that the
pay gradually improved, even if the spelling didn't.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know when it's time to retire? I could say it's when
you realize you have shoes older than most of your co-workers. But
that's not really true.
</P>
<P>
   I'm retiring because it's a good time to go. Because there are
other things I want to do, even though I have enjoyed most of what
I've been doing. Because I look forward to not waking to an alarm
clock. Because it gets discouraging interviewing aspiring
politicians. And even more discouraging interviewing established
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am fascinated with what American antiques tell us
about our heritage. Because I enjoy the hunt through Pennsylvania
or Maine for the wily pewter cupboard or the elusive Windsor
settee. Because I like to explore America and there isn't enough
time if your editorial-writing job means you are spending 48 weeks
a year thinking high-minded thoughts about great issues. There are
a jillion reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it's because there are other things I want to do
before I admit that my get-up-and-go has gotten up and went. I've
already spent two lifetimes in this business _ one as a sports
writer and one over here on the editorial pages. That's plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as I sit here in my rocker watching my co-workers, I
wish I had those younger journalists' feel for technology. I also
wish they had the experience of editing with soft-lead pencils and
glue pots and venturing into an inky composing room filled with
turtles, chases, Linotypes and hungover printers. See, when I
started working on newspapers in the 1950s the technology _ and the
printers _ had barely changed since the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   In most ways newspapers are better now than when I started.
Certainly most papers (including this one) are now more reflective
of the entire communities they endeavor to serve. In other ways
they may be less good than they used to be. I take neither the
credit nor the blame for any of that.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left is to say, ``Thirty,'' which is pre-computer,
``Gimme rewrite,'' cigarette-butts-mashed-on-wooden-floors
newspaper talk for that's all there is, folks. Everything
considered, it's been fun.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW AT ZABAR'S
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, when Louis Zabar opened his little Upper West Side deli
and appetizing shop _ as smoked-fish counters were called in those
days _ New Yorkers were not eating goat cheese on crisp baguettes,
sprinkling balsamic vinegar on organic mesclun salads, or buying
barbecued Chilean sea bass for supper or packages of sushi for
picnics in the park. But as tastes in food have broadened, so has
Zabar's, which has grown to 18,000 square feet on two floors at
Broadway and 80th Street and now employs third-generation members
of the family (and occasionally some fourth-generation teen-agers
to help out during holiday seasons).
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the produce department expanded from a few items
to a new all-organic display near the bread counter, with assorted
greens, vegetables, and fruit (mesclun, $8.99 a pound; asparagus,
$3.59 a pound; and strawberries, $2.99 a pint). Sushi, $2.98 to
$8.40 a box, is made for Zabar's and delivered daily. The cheese
department, which now fills the aisles at the store's main
entrance, has become easier to navigate. A refrigerator case of
kosher foods offers fresh meats and chicken for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chef for the past 20 years, Boris Bassin, saw the need for
a lot of these changes,'' said Ann Zabar, whose father, Saul, owns
Zabar's with his brother Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bassin's goals has been to expand prepared foods. Now,
nearly 200 dishes are available at the service counter and 200 more
are packaged for self-service. Everything from excellent rotisserie
chickens and pot pies to portions of dilled salmon ready to go into
the microwave oven can be picked up without taking a number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw more of a demand for ready-to-eat and ready-to-reheat
meals,'' Ms. Zabar said. The family also plans to redo the cafe to
add more self-service items.
</P>
<P>
   Only the smoked-fish counter, the soul of Zabar's, seems to have
remained virtually unchanged, with some of the same deft slicers
still at work behind it. Except now _ in addition to smoked,
kippered, pickled, and marinated salmon _ fresh salmon steaks, at
$5.99 a pound, are also available.
</P>
<P>
   HOT STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Spiciness that barely tantalizes one asbestos palate may make
another person gasp. When it comes to flavor, heat is relative, and
the common ``mild,'' ``medium,'' and ``hot'' designations on sauces
are often too vague. Thus, Tim and Wendy Eidson, who own a
mail-order spicy food company, Mo Hotta-Mo Betta, now have all
their sauces tested in a laboratory. In their catalog, each sauce
is accompanied by a Scoville rating, which measures capsaicins (the
compound responsible for the heat in peppers) in parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 hot sauces have ratings, from 50 for Tamrindo Bay
Pepper Sauce ($4.50 for 5 ounces) to 89,560 for Mad Dog Inferno
sauce ($6.95 for 5 ounces). A rating of more than 5,000 is
considered superhot. Then there is the Mo Hotta-Mo Betta Habanero
Powder ($6.50 for 1.6 ounces), which delivers 427,000 Scoville heat
units. Sprinkle it grain by grain.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes personalized labels for hot sauces (your
photo, or for Father's Day, Dad's photo) that rate from 380
(cayenne garlic) to 5,470 (red savina habanero). These are $80 to
$100 for 12 bottles, depending on the label. For information or a
catalog: (800) 462-3220.
</P>
<P>
   AMISH MARKET EAST
</P>
<P>
   The Amish Market, 731 Ninth Avenue (48th Street), has opened a
spacious new store at 240 East 45th Street. Like the West Side
market, it is well stocked with cheeses, packaged foods,
condiments, olives in bulk, and produce. Notable are the olive
oils, especially commendable Greek brands like Minos from Crete for
$8.95 a liter. Browsing in this store can easily turn into grazing,
what with tasting samples of olives, nuggets of cheese, bread, and
pastry.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish, by the way, have nothing to do with these markets.
They have a stand at Columbus Circle for produce and baked goods.
You'll know them by their black hats.

HOUSE PLANS VOTE ON SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Text of amendment at bottom of story) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping for a little less violence and a lot more
prayer in public schools, House Republicans have scheduled a vote
Thursday on a constitji%X9al amendment protecting student-led
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the proposed Religious Freedom Amendment is
little more than an election-year nod to Christian conservatives.
The House vote _ the first of its kind in 27 years _ comes less
than a month after Republican leaders publicly assured Christian
activists that conservative causes would move to the top of the
congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, sponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook,
R-Okla., declares that ``the people's right to pray and to
recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on public
property, including schools, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also prohibit requiring any person ``to join
in prayer or other religious activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters acknowledge that they will have a hard time getting
the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional change, but the
vote will give conservative groups new ammunition for the November
elections. A similar amendment fell 28 votes short of Housed
approval in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key issue to religious conservatives going into this
election cycle,'' said Randy Tate, the Christian Coalition's
executive director. ``We're working it hard. We're pulling out
every stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has budgeted more than $500,000 for radio ads
promoting the amendment and distributed more than 2 million church
bulletins on the topic last Sunday. Tate said the lobbying effort
is aimed at 50 undecided House members, but he declined to name
them.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas characterized the vote as a
test of whether lawmakers believe in ``one nation under God'' and
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools are filled with drugs and violence. It's time we
made room for a little prayer instead,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused House leaders of playing politics with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is trying to use this as a political
wedge issue,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, who is leading the
effort to defeat the proposal. ``It is unconscionable to try to
amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our nation's history
for the purpose of a 30-second campaign commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the amendment is needed to counter a trend that
began with the Supreme Court's landmark 1963 ruling prohibiting
school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings. The court concluded
that such prayers violate the First Amendment's prohibition against
a government-imposed religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a prayer is not establishing an official religion. It
is simply a prayer,'' said Istook, a 1967 graduate of Castleberry
High School in River Oaks. ``Those who don't want to hear something
are being permitted to censor other people. That is the standard
that we have today. It's intolerance in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Istook and his supporters also want to roll back court rulings
that restrict religious expression in public parks and
government-owned buildings. Conservative groups have assembled a
host of anecdotes to support their argument that Americans are
being denied the right to follow their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school student in St. Louis said he was ordered
not to say grace before eating lunch. In New Caney, Texas, two high
school students went to court to win the right to display rosary
beads. In Columbia, Mo., a nurse at a university hospital said she
was fired for wearing a cross on her uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only interference with freedom of religion, it's
interference with freedom of speech,'' Istook said. ``It is not
neutrality. It is placing religion at an artificial and
state-created disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the amendment is unnecessary and divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are math exams, there will be prayer in
public schools,'' said Edwards, whose district includes Baylor
University in Waco, the nation's leading Baptist college. ``We
already have a religious freedom amendment. It's the First
Amendment in the Bill of Rights, and it's worked well for over 200
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also question Istook's assurances that students would
not be coerced to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would essentially allow the tyranny of the majority to
establish a religion for a particular school,'' said Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. ``The people in the minority religion can just sit
over to the side and be suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in Istook's amendment that would make it
illegal to ``deny equal access to a (government) benefit on account
of religion.'' The proposal is intended to let religious-based
social service organizations receive federal funding, but opponents
say the change would be a major departure from the traditional
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our founding fathers made it absolutely clear that they wanted
a wall of separation between church and state,'' Edwards said.
``The best way to protect religion is to keep the government's
tentacles away.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The text of the proposed Religious Freedom Amendment
</P>
<P>
   ``To secure the people's right to acknowledge God according to
the dictates of conscience: Neither the United States nor any State
shall establish any official religion, but the people's right to
pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or
traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be
infringed. Neither the United States nor any state shall require
any person to join in prayer or other religious activity, prescribe
school prayers, discriminate against religion, or deny equal access
to a benefit on account of religion.''

WHEN IT FEELS ALL THE WORLD LIKE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday June 9)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens to a lot of us on vacation. We start reading the
housing ads, just pretending, we say, only comparing real estate
prices. But there lurks a small fantasy about living in this
current place of our dreams.
</P>
<P>
   You're sitting in a cabin beside a creek in the Sierras and a
meadow loaded with wild flowers and thinking this would be a great
place to write novels and have a yellow dog.
</P>
<P>
   Or walking down a street in New York and thinking I walk fast
enough to keep up with this crowd. We'll sell the cars, learn the
subway and buy theater tickets with the savings.
</P>
<P>
   One night my husband and I completely remodeled an old garage
that sits across the street from a terrace cafe in a tiny town in
Italy. As the night and the Chianti wore on we scribbled our design
for a work/live studio. We'd bring over the family, telecommute to
California.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind I move several times a year, almost as many times as
I leave town. I wonder if the tourist who is sitting on Main Street
Sebastopol is dreaming about being a local, considering how to turn
that office supply store into a brasserie, become friends with the
guy who drives around with a rooster, sign up for a goddess
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   When I lived in Southern California and visited Northern
California I pictured how it would be to move here. We would take
our jugs to the friendly neighborhood winemaker and fill up from
his barrels. We'd drive into San Francisco every weekend. We'd jog
on the beach before work and take our visitors up in a hot air
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   After a good 20 years of living here, minus a few away, I get
into San Francisco an average of once a month and get near the
Pacific maybe twice that. I've never gone up in a balloon, although
every spring when they begin their whispered rise above the valley
I vow this will be the year. And I quickly learned there is no
dipping your jug into anyone's barrel, although there is a nearby
winery that lets you buy a jug and fill it up with a respectable
red from a hose from their tank.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the dream, but even the amended version
undoubtedly appeals to the Wine Country visitor who wistfully
watches the Saturday regulars pop into the tasting room and be
greeted by name.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into an acquaintance at the market who'd spent the morning
at the beach with her dog. It's her favorite place to escape, she
said, and she often thinks of moving there. She fancies a little
art colony next to the dunes, but on the other hand, she wonders
where she would go for solace if the beach was outside her door.
Would she feel the need to drive into town to get away?
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco I sometimes tour open houses like a prospective
tenant. I like the tall beauties with a bay window at which I
picture having a candlelight dinner while watching the Asian
freighters glide under the bridge. I imagine waking up to cable car
clanging and walking out the door to my choice of ethnic
restaurants, but then I think of the frigid summers that demand you
wear wool socks with your sandals. A city resident who likes to
flee up my way reminds me that on Divisadero she can't go out and
water her vegetable garden in her pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The city kicks me into another gear, but if I lived there would
I begin to consider the pace annoying and tell the cable cars to
shut up?
</P>
<P>
   When I visit my sister in New England I imagine a summer place
on a tiny no-name island off Crane's Beach where we would sit on
the grass, chase fireflies and chew on lobster claws. But then you
have to deal with the midgies who swarm in at twilight, and those
old cottages don't have any heat.
</P>
<P>
   When I visit friends up in the Gold Country I want a dollhouse
Victorian within easy walking to a bar that plays country music. I
don't even like country music, but the ambience is seductive.
</P>
<P>
   One daughter briefly worked at a coffee house in Venice Beach.
She had to go to cafe latte school and learn how to bark orders in
precision. She lasted less than a week because she said if she
continued working there, she'd end up avoiding coffee houses. And
then where would she go to find refuge and write in her journal.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of any place I haven't visited that I didn't
consider moving to. And that includes Detroit, Kansas and Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I once drove from Georgia to Massachusetts and
did serious thinking about relocating to the Blue Ridge Mountains,
Georgetown, Mount Kisco, N.Y., and Olde Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the part about how do you make money and
which cats can tolerate the move and how will you gather the
relatives at Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   With any luck I'm going to Prague and Indianapolis this summer.
I'll let you know what it costs to rent a turret. Or a charming old
silo that might convert into an antique store.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Except for a few late-nighters stumbling home, the
Avenue des Champs-Elysees was eerily still. But inside Laduree, a
tea room, pastry shop and restaurant, everything was astir. It was
6 in the morning, and Pierre Herme, the premier pastry chef in
Paris, was taking the first of many rounds through the place _ a
marbled, gilded, palatial space that looks as if it came from
Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   He passed from the kitchen to the pastry kitchen to the shop,
his eyes scanning like radar. When an apprentice dropped a glass,
he raised his brow and stared him down, but said nothing. He is
quiet. Everyone in his presence is quiet. And to everyone,
including the head pastry chef, who has been with him for years, he
is Monsieur Herme.
</P>
<P>
   To the French, Monsieur Herme has achieved the stature of the
legendary pastry chef Gaston Lenotre. And since last September he
has taken charge of one of Paris' most beloved tea salons and
pastry shops, Laduree, whose newest site on the Champs-Elysees is
wedged among hulking commercial giants like Planet Hollywood, the
Disney Store and a Virgin Megastore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big move for Herme. He had reigned over the pastry
kitchens at the fabled Paris gourmet store Fauchon for more than a
decade. But at 36, it was time to have a place of his own, where he
could point his creative arm in all directions, from dainty
pastries to elaborate cakes to plated desserts.
</P>
<P>
   A day with Herme _ a large, baby-faced man who always dresses in
black _ passed amid dizzying activity, most of it away from the
kitchens. He seems to be in motion even when sitting still. At one
point, he had a cell phone in one ear, an ordinary phone in the
other, and was speaking French in one, English in the other. When
he hung up, he scratched two lines off a list, and said with a rare
laugh: ``Ah, yes, Mondays are the calmest days.'' And then he began
dialing again.
</P>
<P>
   Herme rose to the top of his profession at a similar juggernaut
pace, adding reputable pastry kitchens to his resume as quickly as
he now goes through his list of phone messages. By 14, he was
working at Lenotre, then hailed as the top pastry shop in France.
By 19, he was a sous-chef there. But fame did not arrive until he
became the head pastry chef at Fauchon. There, with the help of a
graphic designer, Yann Pennors, he created the Cherry on the Cake.
Like the work of a pop art sculptor, it was a sleek-looking
milk-chocolate cake shaped like an oversize slice and topped with a
glazed cherry as shiny as a candied apple. It was an instant
success, and it is credited with starting a milk chocolate revival
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Herme's greater achievement is less quantifiable. In France,
pastry has a long and highly codified tradition. Pastry chefs are
taught the fundamentals and the classics, often more as formulas
than as models. But Herme approaches pastry as a creative chef
would approach any dish. Rather than following formulas, he
reworked recipes to achieve the best flavor; in his pastries,
doughs and desserts, he changed the proportions of salt, sugar or
butter and sometimes broke all the rules and used herbs, spices and
pepper for seasoning. He serves pistachio waffles with a liquid
yellow raisin jelly that is infused with saffron; his coconut loaf
cake contains what would have once been unthinkable _ ground
coriander.
</P>
<P>
   Herme is a stickler for high quality ingredients. And at
Laduree, his searches for the best ingredients have become almost
obsessive. The 1,200 pounds of butter used each week arrive
directly from a dairy in Charente, so the butter is as fresh as
possible, retaining all its original perfumes and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   He has chocolate specially manufactured in Venezuela from single
varieties of cocoa bean (lesser mortals use blends). Fleur de sel,
the finest and most expensive salt on the market, seasons most of
his doughs. Even the jelly to glaze fruit tarts is specially made
for each kind of tart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such devotion to specialty ingredients, his pastries
cost what similar pastries do in other shops around the city. A
vanilla millefeuille or napoleon is about $5.
</P>
<P>
   But ingredients aren't everything. ``It's how they're used as
well,'' Herme said.
</P>
<P>
   For him, sensibility is just as important. Which is why, even
with the heightened flavors of his ingredients, his work is marked
by subtlety. You could easily polish off one of his croissants
without noticing how thin and crispy the outer layer is, or how
fine the butter tastes. In his kouign-amann, a traditional
brioche-like pastry from Brittany, the crust crackles with sugar
and the dough is yeasty. But there is something incredibly earthy
about it. A small addition of buckwheat flour makes the difference.
</P>
<P>
   His plated desserts have the same depth _ and minimalism. They
do not tower on the plate. Nor do they sparkle with gold leaf or
lie coated in cocoa. In his gourmandise, a scoop of pistachio
parfait rests atop a scattering of strawberries in a creamy pool of
coconut milk and tapioca pearls. But the pistachio parfait is so
intense that it is almost spicy, the strawberries are fragrant with
basil, and the combination of fruit and coconut brings immediately
to mind that orange-and-coconut picnic favorite, ambrosia. It is a
smart, carefully constructed dessert without an ounce of
pretension. Or a mint sprig.
</P>
<P>
   ``The know-how and the method are traditional,'' he said,
sitting in his sparsely decorated office, with its bare walls and
plain antiques, a world away from the gilded dining rooms. ``I just
reinterpret the traditional. But to do this, you really have to
understand a dish.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As with other artists, his work has become increasingly personal
over the years. ``I began working with the textures and the
alliance of textures,'' he said. ``It's less and less marked by
technique.''
</P>
<P>
   What has remained constant is the emphasis of taste over looks _
and the absence of anything that is pure garnish. ``There is
nothing on the plate for esthetic purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herme, who makes regular trips to the United States, laments
that many American pastry chefs are caught up in the visuals.
``They make skyscrapers on the plate, with all these little things
around it that have no taste and no relation to the dish,'' he
said, flipping through a copy of Pastry Art &AMP; Design magazine,
pointing to example after example. Then he slapped his finger down
on a page and grimaced. ``Oh, and that mint leaf,'' he said. ``It's
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he suggested, American pastry is going through the same
growing pains French pastry did a decade ago. The measure of a
pastry chef's expertise then were great pulled-sugar pieces and
carvings that were for show, not for eating. ``It's the public who
has to want subtlety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herme has at times liked what he saw. He distinctly recalls a
chocolate tart with raspberries and port made by Bill Yosses, the
pastry chef at Bouley Bakery, as the best dessert he ever ate in
the United States. Yosses, he said, ``works really hard on the
flavors, and there is nothing useless on the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Herme works more like a Renaissance painter. He
maintains his vision but relies on a team of alter egos to carry it
out. His method for creating new desserts, though, seems more
scientific than free flowing. He writes the recipe down, sketches
what it should look like or how to construct it, and notes how it
can be stored. Then his pastry chefs go to work.
</P>
<P>
   This system gives him time for other projects. Herme regularly
appears on French television (a team from the show ``Zone
Interdite'' on Channel M6 was at Laduree on this day) and in food
magazines, and he has published cookbooks in Spanish and French. In
the fall, his first book in English, ``Desserts by Pierre Herme,''
will be published by Little, Brown. He said it would have ``a
French spirit with American ingredients.'' A second book, on
chocolate, is in the works. Meanwhile, he and his wife, Frederick
Grasser, are putting together a pastry book for children.
</P>
<P>
   The books will surely introduce him, and his chocolate-cherry
cake, to many Americans. But his influence is already visible in
New York. His pineapple carpaccio, a signature dessert, can be
tasted in many variations at restaurants like Destinee.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't he want to publish in the United States just to lay
claim to his creations? When asked, France's master of
millefeuille, its king of croquembouche, suddenly turned shy and
said: ``Knowing that I may have inspired someone doesn't bother me
at all. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT LOAF CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Desserts by Pierre Herme''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar, plus 2{ tablespoons sugar for syrup
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups unsweetened finely grated dried coconut, plus extra for
the pan (at health-food and specialty stores)
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons (4{ ounces) unsalted butter, plus extra for
buttering the pan, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   \ cup powdered milk
</P>
<P>
   } cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white rum.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare simple syrup by combining 1/3 cup of sugar with 6
tablespoons of water in a small saucepan. Place over medium heat,
and bring to a boil. Immediately set aside to cool to room
temperature (only \ cup of syrup will be needed).
</P>
<P>
   2. In the bowl of a food processor, combine 1{ cups of coconut
with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Pulse until the coconut is pulverized,
but still powdery and dry. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Center a rack in the oven, and heat to 350 degrees. Butter an
8{-by-4{-by-2{-inch loaf pan, dust the interior with the extra
grated coconut, and tap out the excess. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sift together the flour, coriander, and baking powder. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter at
medium-high speed until creamy, then slowly add the remaining
sugar. While beating, add eggs one at a time, scraping down the
sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce mixer speed to low. One at a
time, add the 1{ cups of coconut and sugar, powdered milk, and
whole milk, beating only until each addition is incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   6. Divide the flour mixture into two batches, and, with a rubber
spatula, gently fold in first one batch and then the other; the
batter should be smooth and thick. Immediately spoon the batter
into the prepared pan. Place the pan on two baking sheets, one on
top of the other, or on one insulated baking sheet. Bake until the
cake is golden brown and split down the center, about 70 to 80
minutes. To test whether the cake is done, insert a long thin knife
into the center; it should come out dry and crumb-free. If the cake
appears to be browning too quickly, cover loosely with a foil tent
after the first 30 minutes of baking.
</P>
<P>
   7. Place cooling rack over a sheet of wax paper. Remove the cake
from the oven, release it from the pan and position it right side
up on the rack. While it is still hot, combine \ cup simple syrup
with the rum and \ cup water. With a pastry brush, apply the
mixture over the top and sides of the cake. To serve, cut the cake
into thin slices and, if desired, toast them lightly. Yield: one
loaf cake (8 servings).

HOUSE PLANS VOTE ON SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Text of amendment at bottom of story) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping for a little less violence and a lot more
prayer in public schools, House Republicans have scheduled a vote
Thursday on a constitutional amendment protecting student-led
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the proposed Religious Freedom Amendment is
little more than an election-year nod to Christian conservatives.
The House vote _ the first of its kind in 27 years _ comes less
than a month after Republican leaders publicly assured Christian
activists that conservative causes would move to the top of the
congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, sponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook,
R-Okla., declares that ``the people's right to pray and to
recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on public
property, including schools, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also prohibit requiring any person ``to join
in prayer or other religious activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters acknowledge that they will have a hard time getting
the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional change, but the
vote will give conservative groups new ammunition for the November
elections. A similar amendment fell 28 votes short of Housed
approval in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key issue to religious conservatives going into this
election cycle,'' said Randy Tate, the Christian Coalition's
executive director. ``We're working it hard. We're pulling out
every stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has budgeted more than $500,000 for radio ads
promoting the amendment and distributed more than 2 million church
bulletins on the topic last Sunday. Tate said the lobbying effort
is aimed at 50 undecided House members, but he declined to name
them.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas characterized the vote as a
test of whether lawmakers believe in ``one nation under God'' and
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools are filled with drugs and violence. It's time we
made room for a little prayer instead,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused House leaders of playing politics with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is trying to use this as a political
wedge issue,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, who is leading the
effort to defeat the proposal. ``It is unconscionable to try to
amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our nation's history
for the purpose of a 30-second campaign commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the amendment is needed to counter a trend that
began with the Supreme Court's landmark 1963 ruling prohibiting
school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings. The court concluded
that such prayers violate the First Amendment's prohibition against
a government-imposed religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a prayer is not establishing an official religion. It
is simply a prayer,'' said Istook, a 1967 graduate of Castleberry
High School in River Oaks. ``Those who don't want to hear something
are being permitted to censor other people. That is the standard
that we have today. It's intolerance in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Istook and his supporters also want to roll back court rulings
that restrict religious expression in public parks and
government-owned buildings. Conservative groups have assembled a
host of anecdotes to support their argument that Americans are
being denied the right to follow their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school student in St. Louis said he was ordered
not to say grace before eating lunch. In New Caney, Texas, two high
school students went to court to win the right to display rosary
beads. In Columbia, Mo., a nurse at a`ugiversity hospital said she
was fired for wearing a cross on her uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only interference with freedom of religion, it's
interference with freedom of speech,'' Istook said. ``It is not
neutrality. It is placing religion at an artificial and
state-created disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the amendment is unnecessary and divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are math exams, there will be prayer in
public schools,'' said Edwards, whose district includes Baylor
University in Waco, the nation's leading Baptist college. ``We
already have a religious freedom amendment. It's the First
Amendment in the Bill of Rights, and it's worked well for over 200
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also question Istook's assurances that students would
not be coerced to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would essentially allow the tyranny of the majority to
establish a religion for a particular school,'' said Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. ``The people in the minority religion can just sit
over to the side and be suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in Istook's amendment that would make it
illegal to ``deny equal access to a (government) benefit on account
of religion.'' The proposal is intended to let religious-based
social service organizations receive federal funding, but opponents
say the change would be a major departure from the traditional
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our founding fathers made it absolutely clear that they wanted
a wall of separation between church and state,'' Edwards said.
``The best way to protect religion is to keep the government's
tentacles away.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The text of the proposed Religious Freedom Amen2%ent
</P>
<P>
   ``To secure the people's right to acknowledge God according to
the dictates of conscience: Neither the United States nor any State
shall establish any official religion, but the people's right to
pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or
traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be
infringed. Neither the United States nor any state shall require
any person to join in prayer or other religious activity, prescribe
school prayers, discriminate against religion, or deny equal access
to a benefit on account of religion.''

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE stories  &LR;  CHICAGO-THEATER (Chicago) _ Even though the
second-largest, after New York, Chicago's theater community is
probably the nation's most tightly knit, arguably its most
adventurous and almost certainly its most important incubator of
young talent. By Bruce Weber. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON-PLAYS (New York) _ There were occasions during
the recent New York theater season, which is celebrated by the
presentation of Sunday night's Tony Awards, when the gasp sound
flew out of audiences who had achieved a rapt, respectful communion
with what was happening on the stages before them. The inspirations
for these abrupt responses, which are surely more gratifying to
actors than even standing ovations, are wildly varied and, taken
out of context, unremarkable. By Ben Brantley. (To come). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``Godzilla''; ``Almost
Heroes''; ``The Truman Show'' and ``I Got the Hook-Up.'' (To come).
</P>
<P>
   BALZAC-FILMS (Undated) _ Suddenly, movie makers are landing on
Planet Balzac. On Friday, two films on the French writer Honore de
Balzax, representing two extremes of his oeuvre, are opening. One
is ``Passion in the Desert,'' an impressionistic allegory that has
been adapted by the American director Lavinia Currier for her first
feature from an eight-page short story of 1830. The other is a new
adaptation of ``Cousin Bette,'' the sprawling 1847 drama of manners
that is one of Balzac's best-known novels; this movie is the first
to be directed by the Tony-winning theater director Des McAnuff
(``Big River,'' ``The Who's `Tommy' ''). By Jean Nathan. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   COMDEN-GREEN-FILMS (New York) _ Eight MGM musicals with Betty
Comden and Adolp Green screenplays or lyrics _ the earliest is from
1947, the latest from 1960 _ will be shown at the Film Forum
starting Friday and running through June 25, and the series gleams
with their powers of invention. By Nora Sayre. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE  &LR;  AMERICAN-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ One of the most
significant accomplishments of the American Dance Festival in its
65-year history has been its shedding light on the rich but often
little-known contributions of black choreographers to American
modern dance. The festival, in Durham, N.C., will continue the
programming this Thursday through Sunday with ``Masterpieces of the
Black Tradition.'' By Jennifer Dunning. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   SCHORER-DANCE (New York) _ At 5-feet-2-inches tall, Suki Schorer
perches precariously on a ballet barre, giving her the maximum

</P>
<P>
   ARIANNA-OPERA (New York) _ ``Arianna,'' which will be given its
first American performance Sunday by the Opera Theater of St.
Louis, is not exactly a new work and not exactly an old one. Quite
who wrote it is also in doubt. According to the title page of the
score, it is a ``lost opera by Claudio Monteverdi ... composed
again by Alexander Goehr,'' the English composer who, now 65, has
steadily been gaining a reputation for music at once serious and
playful, beautiful and quirky, as this is. By Paul Griffiths. (To
come).
</P>
<P>
   HEADLINE-OPERA (Undated) _ The fad for headline opera, a genre
that began so promisingly in 1987 with John Adams' ``Nixon in
China'' and fizzled last year with Michael Daugherty's ``Jackie
O,'' seems to have passed. Breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that
we have been spared operas based on O.J., Tonya and Paula. Yet a
new recording of ``Harvey Milk'' (Teldec 0630-15856-2; two CDs),
with music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie, shows
that the attempt to link the opera house to the nightly news may
have been a missed opportunity rather than a cynical marketing
strategy. By David Schiff. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   BRAHMS-BIO (Undated) _ Some biographers see clearly. They keep
their affections in tow and tell the unpleasant facts. Jan
Swafford's ``Johannes Brahms'' (Alfred A. Knopf) does this, at
least to a point. What Swafford writes about Brahms and the people
around him rarely flinches from the fact that the great German
composer was in many ways not a nice man at all. By Bernard
Holland. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;  KURT-COURTNEY-FILM (Undated) _ Courtney Love has a
genius for alienating people. That's one indisputable fact that
emerges in ``Kurt and Courtney,'' the documentary by Nick
Bloomfield that opened on Friday. Ex-boyfriends, ex-employees,
acquaintances and even Ms. Love's father are more than happy to say
nasty things about her. By Jon Pareles. (To come).
</P>
<P>
   MILES-DAVIS-WEBSITE (Undated) _ Computers speak in many
different voices, but the one coming out of the PC on Bret
Primack's desk is likely to startle even the most jaded of Web
surfers. Low, amused and overcareful, it sounds suspiciously like a
man who has just taken a good-sized shot of heroin, and not without
reason: the speaker is Charlie Parker, jazz's best-known junkie.
``I had the pleasure to meet Miles for the first time in St. Louis
when he was a youngster,'' says the digitized Parker, referring to
Miles Davis, the subject of www.milesdavis.com, an interactive Web
site designed by Primack that opened for public viewing two weeks
ago. By Terry Teachout. (To come).

   &UR; ART  &LR;  CARICATURE-ART (Washington) _ The National Portrait
Gallery's current exhibition in Washington, ``Celebrity Caricature
in America,'' with 229 drawings, paintings and artifacts on view
through Aug. 23 trace the rise of a new, formally playful approach
to caricature that flowered in the years between the two world
wars. By Art Spiegelman. (To come).

   BERLIN-ART (Undated) _ For Berlin's latest incarnation as

works. By Michael Z. Wise. (To come).

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MORE-TALES-TV (Undated) _ As you might guess from the title,
``More Tales'' (to be shown Sunday night and Monday night at 9) is
the follow-up to ``Armistead Maupin's `Tales of the City.' ''
Although award-winning and hugely popular when broadcast on PBS in
1994, the original series included enough casual drug use, fleeting
nudity and happy same-sex relationships to provoke the
by-now-predictable bomb and assassination threats from religious
groups. ``More Tales'' is based on the second of the best-selling
series of novels that Armistead Maupin began writing in 1976 as a
daily column for The San Francisco Chronicle. By Stephen McCauley.
(To come).

<P>
   KENNEDY-TV (Undated) _ The Discovery Channel's three-hour
special ``Robert F. Kennedy: A Memoir'' (beginning Sunday night at
8), based on Jack Newfield's 1969 book, is about politics, of
course. It's about the Senate racket hearings, the civil rights
movement, presidential campaigns, power plays and the Vietnam War.
But the personal side of Kennedy, who was assassinated in Los
Angeles 30 years ago (June 5, 1968), comes across with just as much
impact. By Anita Gates. (To come).

   SEINFELD-SCRIPTS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ As they say on television,
stay tuned: On June 18, little more than a month after the
quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the
way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on
``M-A-S-H,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page
script with all the ``alrights.'' Christie's East estimates that
the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000. By

   HOUSTON _ What do you get when you cross classical opera with a
contemporary rock concert? You get Carmen in a rhinestone-studded
bustier belting out the Habanera into a headset microphone.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's Houston Grand Opera's answer. In an effort to
reach a broader (read younger, hipper) audience in the kinds of
outdoor sites more likely to reverberate with the sounds of Bono
than Bizet, the opera company has designed a portable, multimedia
stage like those used by touring rock bands. And it has created a
flashy production to match.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it presented ``Carmen'' outdoors at the Cynthia Woods
Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands, a suburb 27 miles north of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing a Tina Turner hairdo and stomping spike-heeled go-go
boots, Carmen, sung by the mezzo-soprano Suzanna Guzman (who got
her start singing in a rock band called Apricot Brandy), met her
tragic fate on the troupe's new $1.3 million Multimedia Modular
Stage. A 50,000-pound steel-and-plexiglass Erector Set, the stage
takes two days to assemble into a 5,559-square-foot multitiered
space with platforms that rise and fall on four hydraulic lifts. It
also has five enormous video screens and hundreds of rotating,
colored lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've seen a Rolling Stones concert, you know the
concept,'' said Ken Billington, a Broadway lighting designer who
worked with the set and costume designer Kenneth Foy to come up
with the layout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people attended the performance, which received
mixed reviews. Critics praised the daring new production concept
but found the orchestra sound anemic, because the stage
accommodated just half the usual number of strings. Another
complaint was that the singers were not practiced in the nuances of
performing with live video. (They often had their backs to the
camera.)
</P>
<P>
   Like so many American opera companies, Houston's has been
confronted with declining government grants, almost stagnant
attendance and a graying audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a medium to introduce youth to opera in a
high-impact way,'' said the company's general director, David
Gockley. The high-tech stage was created to make opera more
accessible by taking it, both physically and ideologically, to
members of the MTV generation.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the stage enable productions in the suburbs, far
from the expensive seating and perceived snootiness of the
company's downtown concert hall, but ``it gives us the opportunity
to present opera in a way that appeals to what has become a very
visually engaged society,'' Gockley said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Saturday's performance of ``Carmen,'' lights and smoke
whirled from all directions. Instead of using traditional sets and
backdrops, the technical staff created mood and scene through the
rapid-fire projection of more than 350 images (a bullfight, for
example, or a rising moon) onto three upstage video screens. Two
screens flanking the stage showed live video of the performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rich production, with lots of quick cuts, brash color
and hard angles,'' said Foy. The orchestra was at center stage, as
if it were a rock-and-roll band. The singers pranced around the
musicians, wearing skin-tight leather.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Assaf, whose experience lies in directing and
choreographing music videos and Mick Jagger's 1989-90 solo tours of
Japan and Australia, staged this ``Carmen.'' ``I've never done
opera,'' she said. ``But this isn't your typical opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The amplified voices, while true to the original libretto, sang
in English rather than French.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely offend purists,'' said Patrick J. Smith,
editor of Opera News. Traditionalists may have become inured to
translations of Carmen, because the popular opera has been
subjected to a lot of ``manhandling'' over the years, he said, but
``the whole point of opera is the unamplified voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Billington argues, however, that the point of opera depends on
the place where it is performed. ``When you're playing to thousands
of people on a green, it's not about the natural voice,'' he said.
``It's about huge visual and sound effect.''
</P>
<P>
   During opera's long history, the primacy of the voice has often
given way to other elements of production. In 17th-century Venice,
for instance, audiences packed opera houses not so much to hear
arias but to see spectacles accomplished by intricate stage
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   John Dizikes, author of ``Opera in America: A Cultural History''
(Yale University Press, 1995), said the Houston Grand Opera's
``Carmen'' completed the cycle. ``We've gone back to the
extravaganza,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gockley said he saw the production as a way to attract
people to traditional opera rather than as a revolution in its
presentation. Unlike other Houston opera productions, which have 8
to 10 performances, ``Carmen'' on the traveling stage will have
only 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to plant a seed, so that young people might want to see
more opera indoors under ideal acoustic circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Endowment for the Arts, which along
with private organizations provided financial support for the new
stage, said they hoped there was room for both traditional and
rock-concert-style opera productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be an either-or proposition when the goal here is
a net gain in arts participation,'' said Wayne S. Brown, director
of music and opera at the endowment. ``It's a way to reach new
audiences and remain competitive in this visually oriented
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Following ``Carmen,'' the opera company plans pop-inspired
productions of ``La Boheme,'' ``Rigoletto,'' ``La Traviata'' and
``Madame Butterfly.'' Once this repertory is complete, the company
may pack its stage onto 4 tractor-trailers (the stage for the
Rolling Stones' current ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour requires 15)
and travel around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stadiums and amphitheaters are likely destinations, but ``the
idea behind this new stage is that we can just set up in a
cornfield somewhere,'' Gockley said.

HINDENBURG WAS EXPERIMENT IN LIVE BROADCASTING THAT WASN'T
BROADCAST LIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Was Herb Morrison, the radio reporter who became so emotional
watching the Hindenburg disaster, fired afterward for getting so
upset?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.D., Weehawken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: No, quite the opposite. Morrison became famous when his
report on the May 6, 1937, airship crash was broadcast
coast-to-coast the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the 31-year-old radio reporter was working for WLS
in Chicago. He and an engineer went to the Hindenburg's Lakehurst,
N.J., landing site to experiment with recording a live event.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morrison's ``Oh, the humanity'' eyewitness account was
not aired live, it became the first recorded news report to be
broadcast nationally by the NBC radio network.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter went on to jobs in New York and Pittsburgh before
developing the radio-TV department at West Virginia University in
the 1960s. He died in 1989 at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How could I get in touch with Celine Dion? She has a
beautiful voice and is very sweet.
</P>
<P>
   _ G.D., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Dion in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212. To send e-mail, visit the
singer's World Wide Web site at www.celineonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, who turned 30 on March 30, is a native of Charlemagne,
Quebec, Canada. She's a three-time Grammy winner and has sold more
than 50 million albums.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of diva trivia: Dion didn't speak English until age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the name of Stoney Burke's sidekick who was played
by Warren Oates?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.M., Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oates played Vesper ``Ves'' Painter on the ``Stoney Burke''
TV series, which aired from 1962 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lord portrayed the title character in the modern-day
western about rodeo cowboys. An Internet fan site states, ``Ves
gets most of the good lines.''

`THE SIMPLE LIFE': YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL OUT OF THE CITY ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

 By WILL JOYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How difficult is it to find the simple life these
days? About as difficult as it is to come up with a situation
comedy that's fresh, smoothly paced and cleverly written.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find abundant proof of this in ``The Simple Life,'' a
forgettable new show that CBS is mercilessly sending into the
early-summer void Wednesday night at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this clunker is a reasonable premise that is
made to feel tired from the start. Sara Campbell (Judith Light of
``Who's the Boss?'') plays a Martha Stewart-like figure,
``America's authority on achieving a relaxed, homespun life
style,'' who realizes the many ironies of her situation and decides
to move herself and her television show from Manhattan to a farm in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing her are an assortment of frenetic studio types as well
as her mother, Muriel (Florence Stanley), who is reluctant to leave
Queens, and Sara's daughter (Ashlee Levitch), who vies for
attention by flunking out of college after college.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the not-so-simple virtues of rural ambition and
industry is Luke Barton (Brett Cullen), the foreman of the farm
Sara has purchased. He owns a prize bull, and the tenor of the
humor in ``The Simple Life'' is quickly defined when his first
encounter with Sara turns into a misunderstanding over the term
``stud service.'' (Reinforcing this tone is a desperately contrived
guest appearance by Fran Drescher of ``The Nanny.'')
</P>
<P>
   Cultures proceed to clash predictably as Sara tries to
rediscover herself and her loved ones amid the kitschy empire she
has created.
</P>
<P>
   Running throughout the first episode are echoes of estimable
sitcoms of the past, from ``The Andy Griffith Show'' to ``The
Beverly Hillbillies'' to ``Green Acres' to various ``Lucy''
incarnations. What's especially sad here is how faint those echoes
are and how ill-equipped, despite a perfectly capable cast, ``The
Simple Life'' is to improvise upon them.

`THE PROCESS': GIVING IN FOR PEACE, AND STANDING UP TO YOUR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: publication notes at end of review) 
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the age of diplomacy, when negotiations in Bosnia,
Northern Ireland and the Middle East have eased or ended violence
and changed the world. So it is natural that this also be an age of
instant history books, the records of the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke has recently published an informative and
readable account of his efforts to end the Bosnian war. Now comes
Uri Savir, Israel's chief negotiator, with this record of the talks
starting in Oslo in 1993 and ending in Taba on the Sinai Peninsula
in 1995 with an agreement for Israel to turn most of the occupied
West Bank over to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Can George
Mitchell, the mediator in Northern Ireland, be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   While we wait for Mitchell, Savir has given us plenty to mull
over in ``The Process,'' his detailed, balanced, intelligent and in
places intensely moving chronicle of the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. Savir, who wrote his book in English, has produced a
fine piece of diplomatic history. Embedded in his account is also a
powerful defense of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, attacked as
an act of treason by the Israeli far right and as humiliation and
submission by the Palestinian and other Middle East radicals intent
on destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   Savir's book is also the record of a friendship with a man who
was first introduced to him in Oslo as ``your Enemy No. 1.'' This
enemy-turned-friend is Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, Savir's
Palestinian counterpart (and now speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council). In Savir's portrait of the talks, he and Abu
Ala formed a microcosm of the Palestinian-Israeli relationship, or
at least a microcosm of that part of it that was able to overcome
decades of murderous hostility and produce extraordinary and
unexpected scenes of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his book, for example, Savir describes a meeting
led by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres (having taken over for
the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin) and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
Present were other former enemies: senior Israeli army and security
officials and leaders of Palestinian security and intelligence,
including several men who had served long terms in Israeli prisons.
The meeting was held so that the Palestinian commander, Mohammed
Dahlan, speaking in Arabic, could brief the Israelis on ``how his
people were systematically fighting terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were developing a new routine that signaled a profound
change in the nature of our relationships,'' Savir remarks. Not
long after that, while the senior Israelis were celebrating their
Independence Day, the Palestinian National Council voted 504 to 54
to nullify the articles in its covenant that called for the
destruction of Israel. `` `Who would ever have thought that we'd be
celebrating a PNC decision on Independence Day!' a young colonel
standing near me remarked,'' Savir writes. ``The Palestinian
Council's decision that day was, at last, recognition of our
independence by the most bitter of former enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Savir, of course, is well aware of the precariousness of the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement and the possibility, especially since
Rabin's assassination in November 1995, that it might not hold. He
does not wax sentimental or mawkish in his account, but he does
certainly hold to a vision of the Palestinians, and especially of
Arafat, that is sharply different from that of conservative critics
of the agreement, both in Israel and among American Jews. Whereas
the latter hold to the view that Arafat has not relinquished the
Palestinian dream of destroying Israel, Savir portrays the
Palestinian leaders as sincere in their desire for a workable
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of Arafat are in this sense among the most
gripping in Savir's account. He depicts Arafat as volatile, crafty
and often touchy but also as a skilled and adaptable negotiator
caught between his demands for Palestinian dignity and Israeli
demands for guaranteed security. Arafat could fly into a rage and
threaten to terminate the talks, and then, without explanation,
make the concession that allowed some halted element in the peace
effort to continue.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, for example, the Palestinians had brought the
talks to a stop by demanding that Jewish settlers be removed from
the center of Hebron, a move that the Israeli side found
politically impossible. This was shortly after an Israeli settler,
Baruch Goldstein, had gunned down 31 Arab worshipers inside the
Cave of the Patriarchs, an act of barbarism that, among other
things, forced the Palestinians to stiffen their resolve on the
Hebron issue. When Savir rather lamely suggested that the Red Cross
could serve as an ``international presence'' to help insure
Palestinian security, Arafat exploded. ``Unbelievable!'' he
shouted. ``You want to humiliate me, HUMILIATE me!'' But in the
end, Savir says, Arafat made ``a hard and unpopular decision,''
namely to resume the talks without the removal of the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, Savir gives Peres great credit for staying
the course, especially in the face of what he saw as unreasonable
Israeli hesitation to move forward. On the issue of Hebron for
example, Peres wanted to accede to a Palestinian demand for a
police station in the city center. When an Israeli general objected
on the ground that the settlers would be angry, Peres shouted:
``You want 150,000 Hebronites to remain under our control because
of 400 Jews? There's a limit to arrogance and a limit to
timidity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Process'' is often a complicated book, reflecting the
complexity and occasionally the dry, technical nature of the
negotiations. It ends, necessarily, in uncertainty, with Savir out
of government after the election of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in 1996 and the peace effort mired in distrust and
obstructionism. But it would be hard to imagine a better or clearer
account of how matters got to the present point than the one Savir
provides in this book.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, temperatures at Marquette, Mich., hovered in
the 40s as an unseasonably cool air mass pressed south from Canada.
With a blocking high pressure system near Baffin Island in northern
Canada disrupting the normal west-to-east progression of weather
systems, the cool air mass will hold steady and gradually expand
south and southeastward across the Great Lakes region into the
Northeast states on Wednesday and Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a hot, humid air mass will also hold steady over the
Deep South on Wednesday. The large temperature contrasts between
the tropical and Canadian air masses will energize the jet stream,
with winds at 35,000 feet accelerating to 160 mph. These robust
winds will provide additional lift over the front marking the
battle zone of the two air masses, setting the stage for pockets of
severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Some potent thunderstorms will erupt over the Carolinas and
southern Virginia on Wednesday as building heat and moisture near
the ground combine with cooling at high altitudes to destabilize
the atmosphere. A few of these storms will reach severe levels,
with damaging straight-line winds posing the greatest threat. Large
hail and isolated tornadoes are also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly rains will dampen parts of the Front Range of the
northern Rockies and the bordering western high plains as cool
winds from the east blowing around Canadian high pressure are
forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Farther west, scattered
showers and a few thunderstorms will dot the Great Basin as low
pressure aloft pivots eastward.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TORNADO FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes blazed a destructive trail 60 miles long across
southern New York state on Sunday. Potent thunderstorms, which are
usually less than 30 miles wide, can spawn tornadoes, which, on
average, have diameters on the order of hundreds of yards. A
twister will usually lift off the ground and weaken after
inflicting damage along a path a few miles long. Then a new tornado
can touch down below the thunderstorm, the baton of storminess
having been passed from its older sibling. Until the demise of the
parent storm, an entire family of tornadoes can inflict a long
swath of damage.

SARA LEE DONATING IMPRESSIONIST ART TO 20 U.S. MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., D.C., Miss., Tenn., Ill., Neb., S.C., Texas, Mich.,
La., Fla., Ore., N.C., Va.)   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many American companies, Sara Lee Corp. has amassed an
impressive art collection over the years. But unlike its peers,
Sara Lee will soon be giving away the cream of its Impressionist
paintings and sculptures, some 40 works worth about $100 million.
And in a departure from the usual pattern of arts patronage, the
company is splitting up the collection and spreading the wealth
among 20 museums around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Big institutions, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, to small and
mid-size ones including the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in Laurel,
Miss., and the Dixon Gallery in Memphis, Tenn., will each receive
one work.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute of Chicago, just a few blocks from Sara Lee's
headquarters in the city's Loop, is the exception: it will gain 12
works by Matisse, Braque, Degas, Vuillard, Gauguin and other
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, which will allow Sara Lee to take a sizable tax
deduction, is to be announced Wednesday morning by chief executive
John Bryan at a news conference at the Art Institute with Hillary
Rodham Clinton in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan is a longtime backer of the president and Mrs. Clinton,
whose 50th birthday last October was celebrated with a 300-pound
Sara Lee cake (pumpkin spice with cream cheese filling).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable collection, and to put it in the hands of
the public like this is extraordinary,'' said Judith Jedlicka, the
president of the Business Committee for the Arts, a nonprofit
group. She and other art experts could recall no other corporate
donation of art on this scale or of this quality.
</P>
<P>
   The closest and possibly the only parallel, she said, was a 1986
Enron Corp. gift to a single institution, the Joslyn Art Museum in
Omaha, Neb., of watercolors, prints and archives from an 1832-34
Missouri River journey by Prince Maximilian of Germany, which was
valued at about $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen art spread around like this,'' said James N.
Wood, president and director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
``It's a wonderful list of museums, where the art will really make
a lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum directors who knew of the gift _ some had not yet
been told _ seemed totally surprised, even in Chicago, where Bryan
is a trustee of the Art Institute. ``One had always looked at that
collection enviously,'' Wood said, ``but I was not creative enough
to imagine that this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of Sara Lee's shareholders, whose assets the company's
directors are giving away? Other corporations, including CBS, IBM,
Time-Warner, Alcoa, U.S. Steel and Times-Mirror, have in recent
years decided to dispense with their collections. Mindful of
shareholders' concerns, they put the art on the block and added the
cash to corporate coffers. IBM alone raised $31 million in 1995,
and CBS took in $3.2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan wanted to set a different example, and Sara Lee's
directors agreed. ``No one on the board argued for a sale, and all
the options were presented,'' he said. ``But when one looks at the
data and the opportunity to keep the collection partly together as
a collection and to make a major contribution in other cities, it
wasn't a hard decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said that because of the tax deduction, the cost to the
company was ``very modest _ a few million dollars,'' but declined
to put an exact number on it. ``The cost is the difference between
the after-tax value of the collection if we sold it and the
positive cash flow from the tax deduction we can take,'' he said,
noting that it was impossible to predict how much the art would
fetch if sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a very small amount of difference, we can do something
that has never been done before,'' Bryan said. ``If it's an
inspiration to society at large and to the business community, that
would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee, which owns brands like Hanes hosiery, Jimmy Dean
meats, Bali bras and Coach leather goods as well as baked goods,
has assets worth $12 billion and annual sales of about $20 billion;
its profit was just over $1 billion in its last fiscal year. In an
effort to please Wall Street, Sara Lee last September began
reducing its manufacturing assets and buying back shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different way, this is consistent with that,'' Bryan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several weeks, Bryan began calling the
beneficiaries, beginning with the biggest, and inviting them to
pick from the collection. The Metropolitan selected ``Jean Monet on
his Mechanical Horse,'' an 1872 portrait by Monet of his first son.
``It was a very easy decision,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the
Metropolitan's director. ``Monet adored his child and the figure is
very prominent, not just a figure in a landscape, not the usual
Monet. It's an unforgettable picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery, like the Met, got its first choice: a 1912
Cubist work, ``The Bathers,'' its first painting by Roger de la
Fresnaye. ``Early Cubism is an area we'd like to be able to add to,
and it's an almost impossible marketplace, so this is something
special,'' said museum director Earl Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those works were on the Art Institute's list, but Wood
said he could hardly complain since he was allowed to chose a dozen
works ``that will really have an impact on our collection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no 1920s Matisse still life, and now we will have one
that is a drop-dead painting,'' Wood said, referring to ``Lemons on
a Pewter Plate.'' ``We have a great Fauve Braque from southern
France, and now we will have a great Fauve Braque from the north,
of Antwerp. One of our real problems was '20s Legers, and now we
will have two, which makes us very strong in one of his important
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   In descending order of size, the other museum recipients are
making their choices. Among the possibilities are Pissarro's
``Young Woman Tending Cows,'' Degas' ``Russian Dancer,''
Toulouse-Lautrec's ``Dancer Seated on a Pink Divan,'' and
Giacometti's ``Venetian Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said that the museums were selected because they are in
cities where Sara Lee had a major business presence and because
they already have some late 19th- and early 20th-century European
artworks. ``And we wanted it spread geographically so it would look
like a gift to America, with a little more in the Southeast because
of our strong presence there,'' Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The other museums are the Cincinnati Art Museum; the Columbia
Museum of Art in Columbia, S.C.; the Dallas Museum of Art; the
Detroit Art Institute; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta; the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art; the Minneapolis Institute of Arts;
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Museum of Fine Arts
in Houston; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the New Orleans
Museum of Art; the Norton Gallery of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla.;
the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh; the Portland Art
Museum in Oregon, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these communities, they don't have very many things by
these artists,'' Bryan said. ``They don't have a Giacometti in
Minneapolis or North Carolina. The 10th Giacometti at the Art
Institute is not very exciting, but getting one to North Carolina
is pretty exciting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When those choices are all made, Bryan said a few works would be
given to museums overseas, where Sara Lee also does a lot of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the artworks hang in Sara Lee's 47th-floor executive
offices. Bryan will be losing the Matisse, a Degas, a Pissarro and
a Giacometti.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not the only one who liked working among great works
of art. In 1987, Art and Antiques magazine interviewed a dozen
employees on the subject. ``Most offices are horrible places,''
said Barbara Csakai, who was then an executive assistant but is no
longer with the company. ``But here, it's like a mini-museum. It
affects my mood _ I can't help but like to come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Gettings, then and now an administrative assistant, said
she learned to see merit in some paintings that she did not
understand at first _ like a Leger _ but not others. Referring to
la Fresnaye, she remarked: ``That abstract one, of nude bathers,
that one is an orgy. `Just walk down the hall and take a left at
the orgy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most employees will only learn Wednesday that these artworks
will soon be leaving the company. But Bryan said that Sara Lee
never intended to have an art collection. He started buying the
works in 1980, both to associate the company with quality and as a
tribute to the company's founder, Nathan Cummings, who died in 1985
and once owned all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The company has published a catalog of the collection and
exhibited it several times. ``We've done all the corporate
identification work with it,'' Bryan said. ``Let's let the rest of
the world have a chance to see these paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   He also invoked an effort by the White House to stimulate
programs marking the year 2000, which Mrs. Clinton is expected to
promote at Wednesday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee has plans to wring plenty of good will from the gifts.
Bryan said the company would stage an event in each beneficiary
community to announce them. Before the museums receive the art, the
collection will make a tour to a few museums, as yet unselected,
around the country, concluding at the Art Institute in the spring
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many in the art world say, they will be dreaming of
an even wider impact. ``Hopefully,'' said Ms. Jedlicka, ``other
corporations will pick up on this vision and do likewise.''

THE TUILE: FRAGILE, BUTTERY, AND QUICK TO DISAPPEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Traditionally, the tuile, the French almond cookie,
is a curved concoction of butter, sugar, flour and almonds that is
named after the rounded roof tiles found throughout France. The
cookie bakes flat, and as it comes out of the oven, warm and
pliable, it's wrapped around a rolling pin to give it the shape.
But the tuile from Ceci-Cela is different. ``I make them flat,''
said Laurent Dupal, the chef and co-owner of the patisserie at 55
Spring St., ``because they are very, very fragile'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the world of pastry making, fragility is often a sign of
excellence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ceci-Cela tuile is so buttery, and so delicate, that the
moment you put it into your mouth, and touch it with your tongue,
it begins to crumble into crisp buttery, almond-flavored morsels. A
near-perfect cookie, it can stand alone and be eaten by itself, one
after another until a half-pound box is suddenly empty, or used as
an accompaniment to a simple summer dessert of fresh strawberries,
mangoes or Asian pears.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of its evanescence is to use ``as little flour as
possible,'' Dupal said. ``The way we make them is to whip the
butter and the sugar and make them very light. After that we
incorporate the egg whites, one by one, and then a little bit of
flour, and finally the minced almonds,'' he said. Using a pastry
bag, he squeezes a little ball of cookie dough onto the sheet pan,
and bakes them at 340 to 350 degrees in a regular oven for 8 to 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They melt very slowly and will go flat, flat, flat,'' Dupal
said. Four cookies sell for $1.

     MILLENIUM BUG BUGS GORE
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technology buffs call it the ``millennium bug.''
But for Vice President Al Gore, known for his expertise on
technology, the bug has become a political hornet with a nasty
partisan sting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problems came to the fore Tuesday when Republicans
accused the White House of failing to do enough to avert a
government-wide digital meltdown as the clock strikes midnight on
Dec. 31, 1999 _ just as Gore is expected to be gearing up his
campaign to succeed President Clinton.
</P>

   ``The troubling question is: Why are President Clinton and Vice
President Gore moving so slow, and being so quiet, on an issue that
could have such a serious impact on so many people?'' said Steve
Forbes, an undeclared Republican rival for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too important an issue for the administration to play
politics with. People need to be aware of the risks that lie
ahead.'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Forbes issued a memo to ``members of Congress and
conservative leaders'' on the Year 2000 problem that asked, ``What
has the administration's technology point man, Vice President Al
Gore, been doing for the past five years?''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes cited a report released earlier Tuesday by Rep. Steve
Horn, R-Calif., that ranked federal agencies on how well they were
doing to squash the multibillion-dollar millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's grades ranged from F's for the Energy, Transportation,
State, and Health and Human Services Departments to an A-plus for
the Social Security Administration, which, he said, was already 92
percent compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Horn lowered the government's overall grade to an F from a
D-minus in February, citing ``a disturbing slowdown in the
government's rate of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem arose because many older computer systems use of a
two-digit dating system that assumes 1 and 9 are the first two
digits of the year. Without a fix, these systems will read ``00''
not as 2000 but 1900, which could cause them either to fail or spew
out bad data.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, the chief House watchdog on the Year 2000 problem,
demanded that Clinton make fixing it a top priority. He noted that
Prime Minister Tony Blair had spoken to his own countrymen on the
problem and added, ``We've got to see the same thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn declined, however, to take a swipe at Gore, a fully
computer literate politician who prides himself at having taught
Clinton how to send E-mail from a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress only deals with presidents,'' Horn said, ``The vice
president, under the Constitution, has one role, and that is to
preside over the Senate, and that's historic. And everything else
over the last 40 years, the president gives him the assignment. We
don't tell the vice president what to do. We respectfully request
that the president do something.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Horn demanded that Clinton name a millennium czar.
Shortly afterward, Clinton created a special White House council to
spearhead the governmental efforts to avert widespread computer
problems in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore who recruited John Koskinen, a retired top budget
official who had specialized in crisis management, to lead the
council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having lots of meetings on this problem,'' a Gore
spokesman said. Other officials said Clinton was in fact consulting
with Gore as he prepared to deliver a major statement on the Year
2000 issue. That is expected after the Office of Management and
Budget issues its own quarterly report on the topic, probably
Thursday.

     MILLENIUM BUG BUGS GORE
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technology buffs call it the ``millennium bug.''
But for Vice President Al Gore, known for his expertise on
technology, the bug has become a political hornet with a nasty
partisan sting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problems came to the fore Tuesday when Republicans
accused the White House of failing to do enough to avert a
government-wide digital meltdown as the clock strikes midnight on
Dec. 31, 1999 _ just as Gore is expected to be gearing up his
campaign to succeed President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troubling question is: Why are President Clinton and Vice

 &HT;    Dolphins throw tough questions toward Green
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ It's a scary place Yatil Green finds himself these
days, and he can't quite get past the fear.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway, which he admits. And maybe not ever, which he
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Has the surgical scar running along his right knee left a
psychological scar? It happens all the time in sports, you know,
and Green knows it, too, now.
</P>
<P>
   He's the kid wide receiver who came out of the University of
Miami all big and strong and fast, but maybe not so tough. That
maybe-not-so-tough part was a enough of a factor to drop Green so
far down the 1997 NFL draft list that he was still available when
the Dolphins' turn came up with the 15th selection.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, trying to decide whether huge
potential was worth significant risk, told Green on the phone
before making the official announcement of his pick: ``Yatil, I
don't want any groin pulls or hamstring pulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Green promised.
</P>
<P>
   And then on July 17 of his first training camp last summer, he
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. What would
have been Green's rookie season was lost.
</P>
<P>
   So there he sat at his cubicle in the Dolphins' training
facility ready for the light-contact drills run as part of a
quarterback school mini-camp.
</P>
<P>
   Green doesn't know what to think. He only knows what he knows.
And what he knows is he's ``not as fast as I used to be.'' He
expects that speed to return, but mentions how his knee doesn't
flex the way it used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're fast and you're comfortable, you feel your heel
hit you in the butt when you run,'' Green said. ``I don't have
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped speaking and looked at the floor, perhaps dreaming of
the time when he can once again give himself a good and literal
butt-kicking. But when might that be? Questions about Green's
fragility have resurfaced, despite in-house reports that he was
dedicated to the rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, Green was considered one of the possible
answers to the Dolphins' offensive problems. Now, he's a question.
A big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was 100 percent to me,'' Johnson said after
the practice session. ``He didn't pull back from anything. We'll
have to wait and see. We've got to see him do something first. He's
doing it in shorts. Let's see him do it in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who says he always gets his message across, was sending
an obvious one. There'll be no parades for Green.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Dolphins and their head coach understand how much they
need a receiver with Green's speed and size. But they're preaching
toughness (yes, again) as an underpinning for what they hope will
produce an effective running game, and toughness is something Green
must demonstrate to them now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Green ran all the patterns in Monday's heat. He made some clean
cuts, and slipped on some others. He made some catches, and missed
some others. He just missed running under a long ball down the
right sideline against defensive pressure, but caught one deep on
the opposite side a full stride ahead of his pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he had re-discovered the old confidence and
swagger, Green was disarmingly honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' he said, and stopped for a full snapcount. ``Not
exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's stuck in that scary place.
</P>
<P>
   And if he doesn't escape, the Dolphins might be stuck in one of
their own.

NEW BRAHMS BIOGRAPHY LENDS AID AND COMFORT TO A BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7)  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Biographers end up as advocates. They can't help it.
The years spent reconstructing the lives of others, seeing through
their eyes, thinking their thoughts, turn the writer into a sibling
by adoption, a loyal part of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Some biographers see clearly. They keep their affections in tow
and tell the unpleasant facts. Jan Swafford's ``Johannes Brahms''
(Alfred A. Knopf) does this, at least to a point. What Swafford
writes about Brahms and the people around him rarely flinches from
the fact that the great German composer was in many ways not a nice
man at all.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms, it seems, enjoyed denigrating his equals and humiliating
his inferiors. He reveled in Germany's renascent militarism; and
though he denounced anti-Semitism, one speculates uneasily about
what his politics might have been had he lived 50 or 60 years
later. (He was born in 1833 and died in 1897). Brahms' attitude
toward women exceeded even the misogynies of his times. The several
loves of his life sooner or later found themselves brusquely
dumped; even his lifelong object of affection, the humorless,
fanatic, and devoted Clara Schumann, felt the effects of his bad
manners and tactlessness, mingled as they were with sincere
demonstrations of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms had his assets. He was basically modest and immune to
wealth and luxury, though both were his for the asking. He was
loyal to his family and endlessly generous to them. He had his
convivial side and happily ate and drank his way through life. He
liked children, but never married.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the subject of what Brahms didn't like that Swafford
gives me trouble. Liszt, Wagner, and Bruckner lead the list, and
our biographer misses no opportunity to tell us what Brahms and
company thought about the Music of the Future.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Brahms on Liszt's ``Christus'': ``incredibly boring,
stupid and absurd.'' A Brahms friend, Theodor Billroth, on Liszt's
symphonic poems: ``toilet paper music.'' Clara Schumann on Wagner's
``Tristan und Isolde'': ``the most repulsive thing I ever saw or
heard in my life.'' Brahms on Bruckner: ``As to his piety _ that's
his business, it's nothing to me. But this thrashing around is
disgusting to me, completely repugnant. He has no conception of a
musical logic, no idea of an orderly musical structure.''
</P>
<P>
   On it goes, one insult following another: ``Judas Iscariot,''
``old mountebank,'' ``garish and overripe,'' ``too Lisztian for
comfort.'' Strong stuff, though ``strong'' might not be enough of a
word. There is a touch of hysteria in these criticisms; they smell
ever so slightly of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms was a continuer. His music begins in the past and draws
its virtues into the present. The Music of the Future cut old ties
and looked ahead. It also threatened to engulf Brahms' sober,
craft-oriented style of composition. He knew it and fought back.
Granted, the Wagnerian side was just as vicious. (See Cosima
Wagner's diaries.)
</P>
<P>
   Why such sectarian virulence in so expansive an age? Music seems
to breed in its creators the worst kinds of insecurity, and I don't
think that Swafford, himself a composer, quite takes into account
the venom and envy by which classical musicians _ big and small,
ancient and modern _ seem universally infected.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he is a professional recorder of other
people's thoughts, and scrupulously so. Occasionally, however, he
speaks for himself: ``In sheer ambition, tenacity of purpose, and
power of expression, what Brahms achieved in the 44 minutes of the
C minor Symphony rivals Wagner's achievement in the 12 hours of the
`Ring.' '' Swafford adopts the bellicose partisanship of his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Such cheerleading is fine, but one looks in vain for a few words
from the defense. If you are to cite Joseph Joachim describing
Liszt's performing style (``shameless grandstanding in performance
_ the grimacing and fainting, the suffering-Christ act''), might
you not also mention the utter stillness at the keyboard that so
many remembered of Liszt, as if, they said, he were not playing at
all?
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to report on how repulsive Clara Schumann found
``Tristan und Isolde,'' could we not also know that in the view of
more than a few, ``Tristan'' dwarfs in power and imagination
anything Brahms ever wrote? Is Bruckner to be described only in
terms of his garish behavior and not for the opening pages of the
Seventh Symphony, which represent Romantic art at its apogee?
</P>
<P>
   Swafford's silence in the face of these appalling attacks can
only signal complicitous assent. Such silence weakens his book.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Liszt wrote bad music: show-business bad. So did Brahms,
although his failures took the form of aridity (born naturally of
his faultless musical logic). Could not Swafford at least mention
Liszt's heavenly minor-major shift halfway into ``La Vallee
d'Obermann,'' the extraordinary generosity of the ``Transcendental
Etudes,'' the bleak, near-atonal explorations of the last pieces,
and ``The Fountains at the Villa d'Este,'' which is Impressionism's
ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   In allowing his cast of characters to poke fun at Liszt's
grandness without fear of contradiction, Swafford robs of us of
Liszt's magnanimity, his unselfishness, his astonishing grasp of
music and the dignity with which he lived a difficult life. Liszt
accepted the insults of Brahms, Clara Schumann and Joachim with
genuine forbearance, making all three of them look small in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms planned his posterity, not only by destroying his
failures but also by belittling his contemporaries. As
concertgoers, we are all marked by him. For like Brahms, we take
comfort in the past and fear the future.

 &HT;    Gilkey pleads no contest to Florida DUI charge
 &HT;    By Scott Cech
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ On Monday, June 1, the New York Mets
outfielder who denied to police he was too drunk to drive in March
pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the
influence.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced Bernard Gilkey, 31,
to a year of probation and 50 hours of community service. His
license was suspended for six months and he must attend DUI classes
and pay $250 plus court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was not in court when his attorney, Richard Kibbey,
entered the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey said his client decided to plea no contest to the charges
because there was no videotape of his arrest, meaning the case
would boil down to his word against that of the two police
officers. He also didn't want to interrupt his ball playing for a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a phenomenal season right now,'' Kibbey said. ``He
wants to focus his energies towards what he does best.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing reporters soon after his arrest, Gilkey said he'd had
``a couple of beers'' on his way home but denied his driving was
impaired. He was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I want to make, yes, I did make a mistake, and the
mistake probably, most definitely, was driving after having a
couple of beers,'' Gilkey said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dropped a charge of driving with license suspended.
A charge of failing to drive within a single lane was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3 Port St. Lucie police pulled over Gilkey's leased
1998 Cadillac at 1:30 a.m. _ half an hour past his curfew. Police
said the ballplayer was driving westbound at about 55 mph on Port
St. Lucie Boulevard, where the limit is 40 mph. Gilkey slammed on
his brakes and had to swerve to avoid a concrete median when
officers behind him turned on their blue lights, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Maycen wrote in his report that Gilkey smelled like
alcohol and ``seemed to be confused'' when Maycen pulled him over.

 &HT;    `Cavalcade of rookies' bestows 10-2 win on Cubs
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was tough not to feel bad for Ryan Dempster. He
made his first major-league start under the lights on a beautiful
late-spring evening at Wrigley Field, and he wasn't around long
enough to enjoy the ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster, whose last start was a Class AA victory against the
New Haven Ravens on May 13, couldn't quite make the adjustment to
big-league hitting and the Chicago Cubs. He gave up two homers,
three walks and hit a batter before he could record his second out
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted three batters into the second before Marlins manager
Jim Leyland pulled him, and the Cubs went on to a 10-2 victory
before 25,538. Dempster was the sixth Marlin to make his
major-league debut and seventh rookie to start a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to set the `Wows' from playing at Wrigley apart from
what I have to do,'' Dempster said. ``It's frustrating. I told
myself to get ahead of the hitters. I didn't and it cost me. I'm
not too happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst part was Dempster entered the game with a
gaudy 31.50 ERA _ and it actually went up. He got the original
inflated number from his only two relief appearances, in which he
gave up seven runs in two innings. He threw 41 pitches against
Chicago, of which 20 were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It started off well, as Dempster struck out Brant Brown to begin
the game. He then walked Mickey Morandini. Sammy Sosa, playing in
his first game after missing the last three games with a swollen
thumb, homered over left center. Dempster then walked Mark Grace,
and Henry Rodriguez homered to right to give the Cubs a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blauser then walked, and Dempster hit Jose Hernandez with a
pitch. But Sandy Martinez struck out and starter Jeremi Gonzalez
grounded to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate walking a guy after a home run because people might
think you pitch scared,'' Dempster said. ``My confidence isn't
wavering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Brown led off with a double to left. Cliff Floyd
leaped to catch the ball, but it got lost in the vines that cover
the wall and Floyd came down empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini then singled to right, scoring Brown. Sosa was
Dempster's final batter, and this time, he struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I pitched him a little better than the first time,
obviously,'' Dempster said.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Darensbourg came in for the Marlins and got Grace to ground
into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan fell behind, he made some mistakes in bad spots to guys
that can hurt you,'' Marlins pitching coach Rich Dubee said. ``In
the second, it didn't look like he was going to get himself
righted.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida could do little against Gonzalez. He faced the minimum
through four. The only base runner was Craig Counsell, who walked
in the third. But he was erased when Darensbourg grounded into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins finally got to Gonzalez in the fifth. Todd Zeile hit
his first homer as a Marlin, to left field. He did it wearing his
old uniform number, 27. He asked first baseman Derrek Lee Sunday if
he could have the number he'd worn since high school, and Lee
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd followed Zeile with a double, and scored on Ryan Jackson's
single. The hit increased Jackson's hitting streak to seven games
and made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs ahead 7-2 in the eighth, Sosa hit his second homer
of the game off Oscar Henriquez, a three-run shot to left. The
crowd chanted, Sam-mee, Sam-mee, until he came out of the dugout
for a curtain call. It was the third time Sosa homered twice in a
game in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster was still watching the game from the dugout. As soon as
the game ended, he had to think of his next start Sunday _ against
the New York Yankees, the best team in baseball, at Yankee Stadium.

 &HT;    Gailey is exactly what Cowboys need
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Chan Gailey once was turned down by Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has never been a head coach in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey ran the wishbone as coach of Division II Troy State.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, they don't make offensive geniuses like they used to.
However, this 46-year-old relatively obscure quarterback guru could
make the offensively puny Dallas Cowboys a Super Bowl contender
again faster than you say ``field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever package these offensive magicians come in _ and
this one comes in a thoughtful, red-haired package with no ego
attached _ Gailey seems to be exactly what the Cowboys need.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator
wasn't Jerry Jones' first choice in mid-February, almost two months
after a 6-10 season ended and Terry Donahue was seriously courted.
It appears clear he was the right one.
</P>
<P>
   What's most curious after 10 successful years in the NFL but
only two as a coordinator is that this Georgia native wasn't
scooped up before now. His name had appeared on several short
lists, including that of the St. Louis Rams before they lulled Dick
Vermeil out of retirement. Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher pushed aside
offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt after the 1996 Super Bowl for
fear of losing Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was that astute. Six years ago, when Baylor's Grant
Teaff retired after the 1992 season, the Waco school brought in
this serious man with the innovative mind for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned me down,'' Gailey said Monday during the Cowboys'
publicity stop in Austin, Texas. ``I knew I wasn't going to get the
job when I was there for a day and a half and interviewed with
everybody but the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was one of about 50 coaches Jones checked out to be Barry
Switzer's successor. Jerry's son, Stephen, the Cowboys' salary
capologist, said his father called him before the Steelers'
first-round playoff game and told him to pay particular attention
to Pittsburgh because he was considering Gailey and defensive
coordinator Jim Haslett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just amazing what he accomplished with Kordell Stewart
in his first year as a quarterback,'' Stephen Jones said. ``My
respect for Chan just grows day by day. He's so focused and
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   That intensity is obvious. As Jerry Jones addressed the media,
Gailey listened hard. He measured his boss' every word, an obvious
student of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones has been positively gushing about Gailey's
contagious enthusiasm. He and a recharged Michael Irvin talked X's
and O's for 2 1/2 hours during a trip to Mexico City, where Dallas
will play an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's infusion of energy and fresh ideas reminded Jones of
his initial season with the Cowboys in 1989 when he spied defensive
end Ed ``Too Tall'' Jones intently taking notes during a chalk-talk
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turns out Too Tall said he was taking notes for the first
time,'' Jones related. ``Before, the Cowboys never changed things,
and Too Tall said they used to have a problem staying awake.''
</P>
<P>
   Note-taking is definitely in this off-season. Gailey's exotic
formations with four and five wideouts at a time have served as a
dramatic wake-up call to a franchise that had gone stale. No longer
will the 20th-ranked offense consist of Emmitt Smith's dives
between the tackles, Troy Aikman incompletions because Irvin is
double-covered and a Richie Cunningham field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks transplant Chris Warren should light a fire under Smith
and prove to be a valuable pass receiver and third-down rusher.
Ernie Mills could return to the form he showed in Pittsburgh before
catching just 11 passes with Carolina last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Deion Sanders figures to be more than a big decoy, once he
recovers from ankle surgery, if Gailey has anything to say about
it. The Steelers ran more than they passed, but Gailey likes to
throw, and he has a future Hall of Fame quarterback to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So will Aikman line up at receiver like Stewart used to?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never,'' Gailey said. ``And never say always.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has put in the shotgun formation for almost exclusive use
on third down and in the two-minute offense, but this is no shotgun
arrangement between him and Jones. Jones is sold on Gailey, and so
are the players. Of the team's 51 players under contract, 49 have
not missed a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were embarrassed by 6-10,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   In every sense of the word, Gailey is the anti-Switzer. He has
changed everything from meeting times to coaching staff. He won't
hire an offensive coordinator and will call all the plays. He
hasn't kept one offensive play from the previous regime's playbook,
not that that took much thought.
</P>
<P>
   He's labeled as a disciplinarian, but not a single Cowboy has
tested that trait. In fact, Gailey raved about the responsibility
and maturity level of his new team and calls the work ethic of the
veterans ``the biggest surprise'' since he came on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Chan has ever had to raise his voice,'' Stephen
said. ``The players are confident what he's saying is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has not mandated a bunch of rules designed to gauge
the players' commitment. He has brought much-needed and, to this
point, universally accepted change.
</P>
<P>
   Why, even Jones has been so entranced at staff meetings, he
hasn't even offered any play suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Gailey said, smiling. ``I don't have a Jerry
section (in the playbook), but we can have one if he wants one.''

 &HT;    `Cavalcade of rookies' bestows 10-2 win on Cubs
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was tough not to feel bad for Ryan Dempster. He
made his first major-league start under the lights on a beautiful
late-spring evening at Wrigley Field, and he wasn't around long
enough to enjoy the ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster, whose last start was a Class AA victory against the
New Haven Ravens on May 13, couldn't quite make the adjustment to
big-league hitting and the Chicago Cubs. He gave up two homers,
three walks and hit a batter before he could record his second out
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted three batters into the second before Marlins manager
Jim Leyland pulled him, and the Cubs went on to a 10-2 victory
before 25,538. Dempster was the sixth Marlin to make his
major-league debut and seventh rookie to start a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to set the `Wows' from playing at Wrigley apart from
what I have to do,'' Dempster said. ``It's frustrating. I told
myself to get ahead of the hitters. I didn't and it cost me. I'm
not too happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst part was Dempster entered the game with a
gaudy 31.50 ERA _ and it actually went up. He got the original
inflated number from his only two relief appearances, in which he
gave up seven runs in two innings. He threw 41 pitches against
Chicago, of which 20 were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It started off well, as Dempster struck out Brant Brown to begin
the game. He then walked Mickey Morandini. Sammy Sosa, playing in
his first game after missing the last three games with a swollen
thumb, homered over left center. Dempster then walked Mark Grace,
and Henry Rodriguez homered to right to give the Cubs a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blauser then walked, and Dempster hit Jose Hernandez with a
pitch. But Sandy Martinez struck out and starter Jeremi Gonzalez
grounded to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate walking a guy after a home run because people might
think you pitch scared,'' Dempster said. ``My confidence isn't
wavering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Brown led off with a double to left. Cliff Floyd
leaped to catch the ball, but it got lost in the vines that cover
the wall and Floyd came down empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini then singled to right, scoring Brown. Sosa was
Dempster's final batter, and this time, he struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I pitched him a little better than the first time,
obviously,'' Dempster said.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Darensbourg came in for the Marlins and got Grace to ground
into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan fell behind, he made some mistakes in bad spots to guys
that can hurt you,'' Marlins pitching coach Rich Dubee said. ``In
the second, it didn't look like he was going to get himself
righted.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida could do little against Gonzalez. He faced the minimum
through four. The only base runner was Craig Counsell, who walked
in the third. But he was erased when Darensbourg grounded into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins finally got to Gonzalez in the fifth. Todd Zeile hit
his first homer as a Marlin, to left field. He did it wearing his
old uniform number, 27. He asked first baseman Derrek Lee Sunday if
he could have the number he'd worn since high school, and Lee
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd followed Zeile with a double, and scored on Ryan Jackson's
single. The hit increased Jackson's hitting streak to seven games
and made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs ahead 7-2 in the eighth, Sosa hit his second homer
of the game off Oscar Henriquez, a three-run shot to left. The
crowd chanted, Sam-mee, Sam-mee, until he came out of the dugout
for a curtain call. It was the third time Sosa homered twice in a
game in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster was still watching the game from the dugout. As soon as
the game ended, he had to think of his next start Sunday _ against
the New York Yankees, the best team in baseball, at Yankee Stadium.

 &HT;    Airport adds flights to Cancan and N.Y.
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Passenger traffic at the Dayton International
Airport got another boost Monday, June 1, when two airlines added
routes to New York City and Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Comair, a commuter airline serving Delta Air Lines Inc., started
a nonstop flight from Dayton to LaGuardia Airport in New York.
Sunworld International Airlines, new to the Dayton airport, started
its inaugural jet service from Dayton to Cancun on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said passenger traffic in April increased
nearly 12 percent to more than 92,000, compared to April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The April passenger traffic increase represents our largest
monthly increase in more than four years,'' airport director Eugene
Conrad Jr. said. ``The first four months of 1998 have already
surpassed the same period of 1997 by 5.6 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comair flight to LaGuardia, offered once per day, is
Dayton's only nonstop to New York and is designed to accommodate
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several discussions with the Dayton airport and Dayton
Chamber of Commerce, and they really wanted to do something for the
businesses and business travelers in Dayton,'' said Merry Meyer,
spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based Comair.
</P>
<P>
   Comair, which flew about 5.4 million people in 1997, already
offers 10 daily flights from Dayton to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passenger traffic and the choices in flights and fares
have sagged at the airport since it lost a USAir hub in 1992. But
Dayton airport officials said five airlines reported at least a 20
percent increase in April compared to last year. US Airways has
been the busiest carrier this year, with 68,064 passengers. Delta
is second, with 64,206.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo volume at the Dayton airport has also been on the rise.
During the first four months of the year, more than 307,000 tons of
freight has been handled, an 8.5 percent increase over the same
period last year. The biggest reason for the cargo increase is the
continued expansion of Emery Worldwide's hub.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's $56 million hub expansion is expected to create about
500 jobs. The project is slated for completion in July 2000.

 &HT;    Netw(at)tch: Internet access, Microsoft top Harvard agenda
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cambridge, Mass. _ The Microsoft antitrust litigation cast a
long shadow over the Harvard International Conference on Internet
and Society held in Cambridge, Mass. May 25 - 29.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's Larry Ellison and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy, who
have never been fans of the software giant, did not hide their glee
over Microsoft's current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the gathering of Internet professionals who came
from as near as Harvard's graduate school and as far away as
Australia had more on their minds than Microsoft. That's good news
for anybody who ever has or ever plans to log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There were discussions of copyright, community and the need to
push harder to wire more people in more countries as the millennium
approaches. Americans tend to think the Net is something uniquely
American -- a toy used to read magazines and browse movie Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson -- known in technology circles as one of the
philosophers of the digital age -- and others made it clear the
Internet isn't just a cool hobby for rich Americans. Their message
was simple: Internet access is as vital as telephone access. Wiring
the poorest citizens in the United States and around the world will
empower them and enable them to tap into wisdom and news from half
a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Boston will be able to diagnose an exotic illness of
a patient in an African village. Eastern European companies will be
able to develop, helped by information and advice from Western
businessmen. Students in remote areas will be able to get an
education from some of the best and the brightest teachers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   None of these scenarios is fantasy. They are possible now if the
world community could find some way to get computers and technical
know-how into the hands of people who can't afford them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one at the four-day conference seemed to know
how to do this, who would pay for it or how long it would take to
close the gap between Internet haves and have-nots. Some academics
pointed to Microsoft's efforts to wire schools and libraries,
although others were just as quick to say Microsoft's interest in
wiring schools is more of an effort to build brand loyalty than to
bring technology to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' said one panelist. ``I don't care why they are
doing it. If they are going to give us the computers and the
training, I'm just gonna take the money and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks were met with applause from a packed auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But every discussion, whether about regulation, content or
society, was colored by the specter of Microsoft. Every speaker
seemed to feel duty-bound to make a witty comment about Microsoft.
Most people tired of the Microsoft jokes and predictable lectures
on monopolies from its competitors. So when Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft executive vice president, began his talk via cybercast
from Redmond, Wash., people were waiting to hear something --
anything, really -- that would make Bill Gates seem more like
Florence Nightingale and less like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer stuck to his script and gave a talk he's given many
times before. He described Microsoft products, hyped the Microsoft
Network and talked about the company's numerous content
partnerships. A speech like that at a conference like this gave the
appearance Microsoft was out of touch with the global community and
more focused on its stock price and market share than anything.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a go-round with the Justice Department might give
Microsoft some of the perspective and vision the people at the
Harvard conference had. But don't place any bets just yet.
</P>

coverage of specific Web sites will resume next Sunday.

 &HT;    Tech Report: 200 CDs, accessible by a touch
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of
compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop
it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to just
tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. One of the key
advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random
access _ the ability to play the track you want without first
listening to a bunch of other stuff. The new Kenwood line means to
take that idea one step further by making the CD player your
storage unit as well.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't
want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes? Each of the
new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in
data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed
categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.). Then if you wake up
Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the
Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the
Motown genre.

   On the other hand, if you want to play DJ for friends dropping
by late some night, you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks
that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to
Percy Sledge. Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded
in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class, ranging from $230
to $500 in list price. The top of the line, the CD-2280M, can play
two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms. For
more information, contact Kenwood USA, Box 22745, Long Beach,
Calif. 90801.

   Burn your own
</P>
<P>
   The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is still illegal, of course, to make those recordings and
sell them without a license from the owner of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections
in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton,
Miles Davis or Brahms would be. Digitization of music is making it
possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put
on disc, or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in
their own CD collections, then rearrange them in the right order,
there are CD recorders. Popular Science in its June issue offers a
primer on recording CDs, with sidelong glances at other formats
like DVD and mini-disc.
</P>
<P>
   But say you want to select from a much larger database than you
have on your shelves. How about choosing from tens of thousands of
songs? Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the company's business is the logic of Internet
commerce: the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will
soon be done over the Net. But the Net is not merely the conduit,
since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many
arrangements that can play to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of Custom Revolutions
(http://www.customdisc.com), consumers are invited to select as
many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library,
which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes
it has licensed. Each 10-track CD costs $18 plus shipping, and
customers are also offered the option of ``personalizing'' the art
for the case. Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of
the tunes before buying, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse
list, leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far. Named by
the company are Buddy Guy, Charlie Parker, Hot Tuna, Jim Croce and
Nat King Cole.

<P>
   Stop and identify
</P>
<P>
   Just how picky are you about phone calls?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a
telemarketer, eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not
to mention the boss. The question is, just how much screening do
you want your machines to do?
</P>
<P>
   And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before
you will deign to pick up your phone?
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, which shows you the caller's number as the phone
rings, is the most obvious option and is available from your local
phone company for a monthly charge. But maybe that is not enough
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of
Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says
``Please enter the four-digit pass code''? If the caller doesn't
have your code, the phone doesn't ring and the call is
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Edge Co. (1-800-732-9976) or visit the
company's site (http://www.edgeco.com).

<P>
   VCR verbal
</P>
<P>
   The videocassette recorder, despite its near-ubiquity in the
homes of America, just might be the least understood of our most
well-used products. You can pop in a movie, but can you actually
record on your VCR? Can you set it to tape something next week?
</P>
<P>
   Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature, an addition to its
VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the
process of recording. It works something like calling an office
voice mail.Bela Lugosi
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $170 to
$250. For more information, visit the Zenith site on the Net

FEUD LEADS TO YANKING COMMERCIALS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC has canceled a deal with MGM studios for a series
of commercials promoting its forthcoming movie ``Dirty Work,'' on
the order of Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC's West Coast division,
because the film stars Norm Macdonald, the one-time anchor of the
``Weekend Update'' segment of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer forced Macdonald off that assignment this season,
citing declining ratings and what he said was a drop off in
quality.
</P>
<P>
   That touched off a nasty feud that had Macdonald appearing on
David Letterman's late-night show on CBS (and he's another former
NBC star with a feud going with Ohlmeyer) and Howard Stern's radio
show on WXRK. Macdonald berated Ohlmeyer for dismissing him, saying
that Ohlmeyer objected to his often vicious barbs about O.J.
Simpson during his ``Update'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer, a friend of Simpson's who stood by him during his
trial and acquittal, has said that had nothing to do with the
decision to remove Macdonald. He pointed to the innumerable
monologue jokes that NBC's biggest late-night star, Jay Leno, has
delivered about Simpson, without drawing any reaction from
Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had just come after me, this would not have happened,''
Ohlmeyer said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ``But he started
going after `Saturday Night Live' and NBC, and that just wasn't
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel the commercials was Ohlmeyer's, a senior
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Rich, president of worldwide marketing for MGM, said, ``We
were certainly surprised by NBC's decision.'' MGM had a contract
with NBC going back to last spring for commercial time to promote
its movies, Rich said in a telephone interview. The studio had also
bought individual ads for ``Dirty Work'' on other NBC shows, Rich
said.
</P>
<P>
   The studio was informed on May 26 that its first commercial for
the film did not run in the previous Saturday's edition of
``Saturday Night Live.'' It was then, Rich said, that NBC informed
MGM that no commercials for Macdonald's movie would appear on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put us in a difficult situation, having to change our media
plan at the 11th hour,'' Rich said. He did not specify how much
money MGM had committed, though he said it ``wasn't pennies.'' He
added that NBC's audience was considered especially good for movie
studios to reach. But he added: ``We had options. We moved the
commercials to Fox and MTV and other places. They were happy to
take our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the timing of the cancellation, which was first reported
by Daily Variety Tuesday, means that NBC will probably lose some
revenue. In June, with the television season over and repeats on
most of the time, the television commercial marketplace is soft.
Many networks are looking for advertisers to buy time.
</P>
<P>
   Rich pointed out that the film's theme carried a certain added
resonance because of Ohlmeyer's decision. ``In the movie, Norm
plays a guy who creates a revenge-for-hire business. This whole
thing is absolutely a revenge move.'' -- &UR; BILL CARTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHILDREN RULE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The most ballyhooed story in children's television this past
broadcast season was ABC's remarkably fast resurgence and
overtaking of Fox, which had been the Saturday morning Nielsen
ratings leader for eight years. ABC's rapid recovery got even more
attention since it took place under the leadership of Geraldine
Laybourne, and she resigned from Disney/ABC last week, to start her
own production company.
</P>
<P>
   But in all the ballyhoo about the two-horse race between ABC and
Fox, most people missed the real story of the children's season:
for the first time a cable network won the Saturday morning
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon _ what else? _ had more 2-to-11-year-old viewers on
Saturday mornings all season than any network, and by a healthy
margin (about 15 percent). This despite the fact that it is
available in only about 75 percent of American homes and it shows
only reruns on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   For the broadcast season (Sept. 22 through May 24), Nickelodeon
had an average of 1.6 million viewers under age 12 (a 4.1 rating),
ABC was second with 1.4 million (3.6) and Fox third with 1.37
million (3.5).
</P>
<P>
   Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president, said
children make no distinction between broadcast and cable networks.
``Because we serve kids every day, they come to us throughout the
week, including Saturday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They also come on weekday evenings, where Nickelodeon has
expanded its children's lineup into the first half-hour of prime
time (8 to 8:30), and will expand it further, to 9 p.m., in the
fall. (After 9, it runs old sitcoms, calling them Nick at Nite.)
</P>
<P>
   The 8 to 9 p.m. hour will have an animated host named ``O'' and
will be called Nickelozone, in keeping with Nickelodeon's branding
strategy. Other time periods the network has branded with an
identity this way include Nick Jr. (for preschoolers), Nicktoons
(Sunday morning cartoons) and, most familiar of all, Snick, short
for Saturday Night Nick.  &UR; --LAWRIE MIFFLIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOP OF THE WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CBS will offer an unusual hourlong special this summer that
documents the efforts of Tom Whittaker, a mountain climber, to
reach the summit of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, who reached the top accompanied only by a CBS
cameraman, Jeff Rhoads, last Wednesday, is the first disabled
person to successfully ascend the world's highest mountain.
Whittaker lost a foot and part of his leg in an automobile accident
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was able to gain exclusive access to Whittaker's climb for
its news magazine program, ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel,''
because it had previously produced a documentary on him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel traveled to Nepal last weekend to interview Whittaker
after the climber's descent from Everest. The interview and the
film of the climb will appear in a special one-hour edition of
``Public Eye,'' either in late July or early August.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, a Welshman, said in a telephone interview from Nepal
Tuesday that the climb ``fulfills a lifelong dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting an hour-long documentary on American television that
focuses on a disabled person is almost as big a coup as climbing
Mount Everest,'' Whittaker said. -- &UR; BILL CARTER &LR;

   PRINT _ Sprint Corp. introduces a new phone network that will
allow users to make multiple calls, receive faxes and use the
internet at high speeds, all at the same time through a single
connection. Sprint said the new network can deliver a voice call at
more than 70 per cent less than existing networks. It can also
provide full-motion video calls and conference calls at a cost less
than that of a long-distance call, Sprint said. (Kanell, Atlanta

   3MOTO _ Motorola and another company announce their alliance to
develop digital signal processors. DSPs are being used in more and
more applications from wireless phones to HDTVs to cable modems to
digital cameras and auto collision warning systems. The market is
expected to grow 35 percent a year through 2002. Moto and its
partner want to grab a part of that market, rather than cede it to
Texas Instruments, which has a 48 percent share. (Gallaga, Austin

   3TI _ Texas Instruments has bet the company on DSPs, a

   DELTA-JAPAN _ ATLANTA _ The number of airline seats flying
nonstop between Atlanta and Tokyo is about to take off. Delta today
starts daily nonstop service between Hartsfield and Narita
airports, joining Japan Airlines on the route. Where will all the
passengers come from? Delta, which has previously flown the route
with a stop in Portland Ore., expects to fill most of its seats
with connecting passengers from around the East who'll appreciate a
more streamlined route. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   DELTA-FLIGHT _ ATLANTA _ Delta's Atlanta-Tokyo nonstop flights
will be in the air between 13 and 14 hours and travel 6,850 miles _
nearly 1,600 miles more than Delta's next-longest route. The flight
will consume 32,000 gallons of fuel and require four pilots, two of

   HOUSING _ A new report issued by Experian, a nationwide
real-estate data collector, suggests that home values are
increasing at their highest rate this decade. Even though
California, which leads the nation in appreciation, is bouncing
back from a time of depressed values, the nationwide average gain
is more than nine percent. Atlanta's rate is just over two percent.

   OHIO-AIRPORT _ Passenger traffic at the Dayton International

   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ In the end, the gathering of Internet
professionals who came from as near as Harvard's graduate school
and as far away as Australia had more on their minds than
Microsoft. That's good news for anybody who ever has or ever plans
to log on to the Internet. There were discussions of copyright,
community and the need to push harder to wire more people in more
countries as the millennium approaches. Americans tend to think the
Net is something uniquely American -- a toy used to read magazines
and browse movie Web sites. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   JUST-FOR-FUN _ ATLANTA _ No matter what portable electronic
device you use, from the smallest personal digital assistant to the
bulkiest laptops, Targus has a carrying case to fit and protect it.
Whether you love them or hate them, there's no denying the Spice
Girls have gained worldwide notoriety. Capitalizing on that

nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of

rock, alternative and rap stars expected to roll in high on the

   STODA-COLUMN _ DAVIE, Fla. _ It's a scary place Yatil Green
finds himself these days, and he can't quite get past the fear. On
July 17 of his first training camp last summer, he tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. What would have been
Green's rookie season was lost. Green doesn't know what to think.
He only knows what he knows. And what he knows is he's ``not as

   GILKEY-DUI _ PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ On Monday, June 1, the New

in March pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of driving
under the influence. St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced
Bernard Gilkey, 31, to a year of probation and 50 hours of
community service. His license was suspended for six months and he
must attend DUI classes and pay $250 plus court costs. Gilkey was

   CUBS-DEMPSTER _ CHICAGO _ It was tough not to feel bad for Ryan
Dempster. He made his first major-league start under the lights on

into the second before Marlins manager Jim Leyland pulled him, and
the Cubs went on to a 10-2 victory before 25,538. Dempster was the
sixth Marlin to make his major-league debut and seventh rookie to
start a game. (Rosenberg, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   BOHLS-COLUMN _ This 46-year-old relatively obscure quarterback
guru could make the offensively puny Dallas Cowboys a Super Bowl

thoughtful, red-haired package with no ego attached _ Gailey seems
to be exactly what the Cowboys need. (Bohls, Austin

Green's rookie season was lost. Green doesn't know what to think.
He only knows what he knows. And what he knows is he's ``not as

Bernard Gilkey, 31, to a year of probation and 50 hours of

into the second before Marlins manager Jim Leyland pulled him, and

thoughtful, red-haired package with no ego attached _ Gailey seems

community and the need to push harder to wire more people in more

   LAREDO TAKES POST IN VERMONT
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Laredo, the violinist and conductor, has been appointed
the artistic adviser of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, based in
Burlington. Laredo, who lives with his wife, the cellist Sharon
Robinson, in Guilford, Vt., is to assume his new post almost
immediately. He will plan the orchestra's summer and winter
programs, starting with the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   His duties will include selecting music, soloists and guest
conductors, and offering guidance for artistic policy. He succeeds
Kate Tamarkin, music director of the orchestra, who is stepping
down at the end of the 1998-99 season.

   EXPANDED FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aiming to add at least 200 films to its celebrated
archive (now 14,000 titles) by 2000, the Museum of Modern Art is in
the midst of a five-year campaign to reach its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the harvest of the previously unannounced drive, called
``200 for 2000,'' will be showcased beginning this month, when
major works by Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, Hal
Hartley, Joel and Ethan Coen, and John Sayles will be presented in
a summer series, ``A View From the Vaults: Recent Acquisitions and
Restorations,'' from June 19 through Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the museum's wish list are films like Preston Sturges'
``Palm Beach Story'' (1942), Nicholas Ray's ``In a Lonely Place''
(1950), John Schlesinger's ``Midnight Cowboy'' (1969), Billy
Wilder's ``Some Like It Hot'' (1959) and Mel Brooks' ``Producers''
(1968).

   TRAJAN TROVE
</P>
<P>
   Italian archeologists drilling near an ancient fresco that was
recently unearthed in Rome have stumbled upon two new treasures: a
striking mosaic and another detailed fresco thought to be 2,000
years old. The discoveries were made at the Trajan Baths in the
city's historic center, near the fresco depicting a bird's-eye view
of the city that was discovered in March.

   TIME HONORED
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Metropolitan Museum of Art is commemorating the
centenary of the death of Edward Burne-Jones. On Thursday, the
museum opens the first American retrospective devoted to the work
of this pre-Raphaelite artist and designer. The exhibition,
``Edward Burne-Jones, Victorian Artist-Dreamer,'' which continues
through Sept. 6, offers what is described as the most comprehensive
assessment of his work.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the show, assembled from museums and private collections
around the world, consists of some 170 paintings, watercolors,
drawings, tapestries, embroideries, stained glass, ceramic tiles,
painted furniture, illustrated books and jewelry. Burne-Jones, who
was born in 1833 in Birmingham, England, was a pupil of Dante
Gabriel Rossetti and a protege of John Ruskin.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly self-taught, Burne-Jones had an abiding interest in
romantic and medieval subjects, particularly the Arthurian legend,
which provided much of the substance and style of his art. He died
on the night of June 16-17, 1898.

TREASURY PRICES SLIP FOLLOWING STRONG HOUSING REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices slipped on Tuesday for the first time
in four sessions amid signs that the economy was still growing at a
brisk clip. Prices were also held down by the prospects of more
corporate and government agency debt coming to market.
</P>
<P>
   A softer dollar and stabilizing stock markets in Asia added to
the downward pressure in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond fell 7/32, to 104 23/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
rose to 5.79 percent, from 5.77 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were hurt by a report that sales of new single-family
homes jumped 5.2 percent in April, to an annual rate of 888,000
units.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was disappointed but not devastated by the
stronger-than-expected home sales data, primarily because the gains
were lopsided, with all areas except the South registering
declines,'' said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corp., in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of the flight-to-safety effects of the Asian
financial crisis quickly dissipated after investors heard the
comments of Robert Parry, the president of the San Francisco
Federal Reserve, who seemed to be playing down the long-term
effects of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the comments that Parry made at a conference in Idaho
raised suspicion among investors that Parry did not think the Asian
crisis would prevent the Fed from raising rates if inflationary
pressures became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are looking cautiously ahead of this Friday's release
of the government report on employment in May. Although some
bullish investors say the jobs report will show only moderate
growth, they are still somewhat nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Competing supply is also a worry for the Treasury market, as
traders brace for up to $15 billion of corporate and agency debt.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Treasury sold $15 billion of 12-day cash-management
bills at an average rate of 5.30 percent. Cash-management bills are
used to meet the Treasury's short-term cash needs, in addition to
its regular schedule of debt sales.

     DEFENSE NOMINEE READY TO TACKLE PROLIFERATION
PROBLEM
 &HT;     By CHRISTI HARLAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Between congenial greetings Tuesday at his Senate
confirmation hearing, Pentagon nominee Hans Mark received solemn
reminders that recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have
added new urgency to his pending job as director of defense
research and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be at the vortex of that problem,'' Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., told Mark during the engineering professor's confirmation
hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, who teaches at the University of Texas in Austin, is
expected to win Senate approval for the job as chief technical
adviser to Defense Secretary William Cohen. The job will include
creation of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which will deal
with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The agency ``will have the charter to go from basic research ...
to actually having groups in the field to deal with things like
nuclear accidents or inspection,'' Mark told the committee. ``I
think that the establishment of this agency will be the most
important thing that I will have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the job was underscored by the nuclear testing
that started in India less than a week after President Clinton
nominated Mark to the Pentagon post May 5. Pakistan responded with
its own weapons tests last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, who began his professional career in the 1950s working on
nuclear weapons, said he agreed to take the Pentagon job because he
wants to help curb the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago, I was very young when I started to work on
nuclear weapons,'' he said. ``I did so because I thought it was
very, very important for the United States to have the technical
leadership'' in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' he said. ``What I'd like to do as I wind
up my career is to bring that same technical expertise that this
country has to bear ... on the control of these weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark's career has included previous presidential appointments as
secretary of the Air Force and as deputy administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He commemorated the
latter post Tuesday by wearing a NASA tie to his confirmation
hearing, where he was introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, and greeted as a well-known and well-liked technical
expert by senators on the committee, which could explain his lack
of nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth time I've gone through this,'' he noted.

FEUD LEADS TO YANKING OF COMMERCIALS; CHILDREN RULE; TOP OF THE
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Bylines follow notebook items) 
(ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC has canceled a deal with MGM studios for a series
of commercials promoting its forthcoming movie ``Dirty Work,'' on
the order of Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC's West Coast division,
because the film stars Norm Macdonald, the one-time anchor of the
``Weekend Update'' segment of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer forced Macdonald off that assignment this season,
citing declining ratings and what he said was a drop off in
quality.
</P>
<P>
   That touched off a nasty feud that had Macdonald appearing on
David Letterman's late-night show on CBS (and he's another former
NBC star with a feud going with Ohlmeyer) and Howard Stern's radio
show on WXRK. Macdonald berated Ohlmeyer for dismissing him, saying
that Ohlmeyer objected to his often vicious barbs about O.J.
Simpson during his ``Update'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer, a friend of Simpson's who stood by him during his
trial and acquittal, has said that had nothing to do with the
decision to remove Macdonald. He pointed to the innumerable
monologue jokes that NBC's biggest late-night star, Jay Leno, has
delivered about Simpson, without drawing any reaction from
Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had just come after me, this would not have happened,''
Ohlmeyer said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ``But he started
going after `Saturday Night Live' and NBC, and that just wasn't
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel the commercials was Ohlmeyer's, a senior
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Rich, president of worldwide marketing for MGM, said, ``We
were certainly surprised by NBC's decision.'' MGM had a contract
with NBC going back to last spring for commercial time to promote
its movies, Rich said in a telephone interview. The studio had also
bought individual ads for ``Dirty Work'' on other NBC shows, Rich
said.
</P>
<P>
   The studio was informed on May 26 that its first commercial for
the film did not run in the previous Saturday's edition of
``Saturday Night Live.'' It was then, Rich said, that NBC informed
MGM that no commercials for Macdonald's movie would appear on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put us in a difficult situation, having to change our media
plan at the 11th hour,'' Rich said. He did not specify how much
money MGM had committed, though he said it ``wasn't pennies.'' He
added that NBC's audience was considered especially good for movie
studios to reach. But he added: ``We had options. We moved the
commercials to Fox and MTV and other places. They were happy to
take our money.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the cancellation, which was first reported by
Daily Variety Tuesday, means that NBC will probably lose some
revenue. In June, with the television season over and repeats on
most of the time, the television commercial marketplace is soft.
Many networks are looking for advertisers to buy time.
</P>
<P>
   Rich pointed out that the film's theme carried a certain added
resonance because of Ohlmeyer's decision. ``In the movie, Norm
plays a guy who creates a revenge-for-hire business. This whole
thing is absolutely a revenge move.''

   CHILDREN RULE
</P>
<P>
   The most ballyhooed story in children's television this past
broadcast season was ABC's remarkably fast resurgence and
overtaking of Fox, which had been the Saturday morning Nielsen
ratings leader for eight years. ABC's rapid recovery got even more
attention since it took place under the leadership of Geraldine
Laybourne, and she resigned from Disney/ABC last week, to start her
own production company.
</P>
<P>
   But in all the ballyhoo about the two-horse race between ABC and
Fox, most people missed the real story of the children's season:
for the first time a cable network won the Saturday morning
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon _ what else? _ had more 2-to-11-year-old viewers on
Saturday mornings all season than any network, and by a healthy
margin (about 15 percent). This despite the fact that it is
available in only about 75 percent of American homes and it shows
only reruns on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   For the broadcast season (Sept. 22 through May 24), Nickelodeon
had an average of 1.6 million viewers under age 12 (a 4.1 rating),
ABC was second with 1.4 million (3.6) and Fox third with 1.37
million (3.5).
</P>
<P>
   Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president, said
children make no distinction between broadcast and cable networks.
``Because we serve kids every day, they come to us throughout the
week, including Saturday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They also come on weekday evenings, where Nickelodeon has
expanded its children's lineup into the first half-hour of prime
time (8 to 8:30), and will expand it further, to 9 p.m., in the
fall. (After 9, it runs old sitcoms, calling them Nick at Nite.)
</P>
<P>
   The 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. hour will have an animated host named ``O''
and will be called Nickelozone, in keeping with Nickelodeon's
branding strategy. Other time periods the network has branded with
an identity this way include Nick Jr. (for preschoolers), Nicktoons
(Sunday morning cartoons) and, most familiar of all, Snick, short
for Saturday Night Nick.

   TOP OF THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   CBS will offer an unusual hourlong special this summer that
documents the efforts of Tom Whittaker, a mountain climber, to
reach the summit of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, who reached the top accompanied only by a CBS
cameraman, Jeff Rhoads, last Wednesday, is the first disabled
person to successfully ascend the world's highest mountain.
Whittaker lost a foot and part of his leg in an automobile accident
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was able to gain exclusive access to Whittaker's climb for
its news magazine program, ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel,''
because it had previously produced a documentary on him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel traveled to Nepal last weekend to interview Whittaker
after the climber's descent from Everest. The interview and the
film of the climb will appear in a special one-hour edition of
``Public Eye,'' either in late July or early August.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, a Welshman, said in a telephone interview from Nepal
Tuesday that the climb ``fulfills a lifelong dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting an hour-long documentary on American television that
focuses on a disabled person is almost as big a coup as climbing
Mount Everest,'' Whittaker said.

SPORTS COLUMN: VENUS' MOM DELIVERS HARD TRUTH  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In theory, this was the match that might have nudged
Martina Hingis closer to accepting Venus Williams as a rival. It
turned out to be the match that forced Williams to accept Hingis as
a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are willing to make sacrifices,'' Williams said
after her 6-3, 6-4 drubbing. ``The top players do it. I'm not
there. She's probably doing it.'' The result brought out a faint
trace of humility from Williams, downright touching from any
teen-ager, much less a teen-age millionaire athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I didn't play as well as I should have,'' Williams
volunteered in her interview after the match. ``I think she played
better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is high respect indeed for a player who exists in her own
private Compton with her sister and her parents, who all seem to
feel that every tournament is Williams versus World. The inner
focus has helped Venus become the seventh-ranked female player in
the world, but it may have dawned on her Tuesday that the
top-ranked player with the fixed smile may also have inner focus,
plus strokes, plus a game plan.
</P>
<P>
   And if Williams missed the point, she had somebody willing to
deliver it to her, right after the match. The messenger was her own
mother, Oracene, who now serves as coach. As she left the court,
Venus displayed a wide smile that seemed to bespeak embarrassment.
She later described her body language to her mother and sister as a
visual version of ``Dude.'' Her mother may not have been so casual
when they met in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it,'' Venus admitted. ``I don't need somebody
soft to pet you, to say you tried. It's true. I didn't try hard
enough. Now I'd like to try the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Venus have liked her mother to whisper some soft things to
her? ``I'm too old for petting,'' she said. ``I just need the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that Hingis outplayed Williams, despite the
Williams service cannonades that are now rocketing into the
guy-stuff 120 miles-per-hour range.
</P>
<P>
   The world is waiting for the next great female rivalry, maybe
even something to approximate Evert and that other Martina back in
the old days. A renovated Monica Seles is back in this Grand Slam
semifinal after the long ordeal of her father's terminal illness,
but Steffi Graf is dropping out of the computer rankings and,
presumably, out of tennis. There is time for a great rivalry that
might stick into the next millennium. Williams is two weeks shy of
18 and Hingis is three months shy of 18, and they walk around each
other with the sense that they _ and we _ will be counting the
notches on their pistols for years to come. Right now it's six for
Hingis and two for Williams, the last two on clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grew up on clay,'' Williams said. ``I grew up on hard
courts. She probably plays better here. I've only played three
times on clay.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed, as Williams sometimes hit off the wrong foot, or with
her long legs splayed, even once playing a lob off her backhand,
but some of the confusion could be allayed to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change your strategy,'' Hingis said. ``Today I did
it better than her.''
</P>
<P>
   All great athletes become control freaks, and these two indulged
in personal forms of gamesmanship _ Hingis with complaints of bad
calls (she won three of four inspections of alleged ball marks by
the chair umpire), Williams with a dash to the players' bathroom
just when Hingis was about to serve for the match.
</P>
<P>
   This is a trend, following the demand for a break from Anna
Kournikova earlier in this tournament, but Williams was not
claiming a natural urgency for the quick rush. She said she had to
change clothing because she had fallen in the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dirty,'' she said. ``I don't like to appear that way. I
had to change my skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was pretty sanguine about the break, perhaps because she
has taken a strategic walk in her time _ two during her upset to
Iva Majoli on these very grounds last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody takes a break, it usually helps me,'' Hingis
explained later. ``She had to walk there. It made her tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. But when Hingis takes a walk, that is the right move to
collect her wits. She has the ability to want it both ways, which
most champions learn at an early age. Williams, who has been
competitive and quick-witted in her short professional career, is
now getting a glimpse of the higher education needed to turn this
into a real rivalry.

EXPERTS URGE CLINTON, GORE TO EXERT LEADERSHIP ON COMPUTER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional experts on the Year 2000 computer
problem urged President Clinton on Tuesday to make it ``a national
priority'' to prevent the potential glitch from shutting down the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Reform and Oversight subcommittee on technology, cautioned against
panic but urged Clinton to give it more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his administration must set priorities if
the conversion is to be successful. ... Now is the time for the
president to designate the Year 2000 problem as a national
priority,'' he said at a press conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on the Year 2000 Problem, warned that it is
already too late to completely fix the nation's computers before
Jan. 1, 2000, and urged the Clinton administration to prepare for
the Year 2000 problem ``like a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that on Jan. 1, 2000, power comes on,
that water continues to run, that the most vital functions of daily
life are completely safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added: ``The only way that's going to get done is
through national leadership, which we haven't seen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Vice President Al Gore, who often leads
administration efforts on high-tech issues, should be the person to
address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett accused Gore of dodging the issue because of
concerns that his chances of becoming president would be damaged by
giving voters the pessimistic news associated with the Year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is both the obvious choice to lead the administration
and a dangerous choice because of his desire to be president,''
Bennett told a conference on the Year 2000 problem at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a non-partisan think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, a Canadian who has been appointed to both the
British and Russian Year 2000 task forces, also urged Gore to
become more involved in the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gore) should stop spending his time trying to put the
Internet in every high school and starting working on a problem
that threatens the entire global economy,'' de Jager told the CSIS
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Lawrence Hass, said both the president
and the vice president were ``fully on top of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spoken to the Cabinet heads ... and are regularly
briefed by their staff,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the glitch will be felt when one computer system
that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with another computer system
that thinks the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Because computers can't think, neither system can understand why
it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to sort out the problem, the
two systems go into the equivalent of shock: The computers and
devices they drive either stop or give out wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's panel gave the federal government an ``F'' grade for its
efforts to resolve the Year 2000 problem with its most important
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The panel flunked the U.S. Department of Transportation, the
State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, Department
of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency
for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration was the government's top
performer, earning an ``A plus'' from the Republican-controlled
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Horn noted that the Social Security Administration's top grade
is no guarantee that benefit checks won't be interrupted, for
example, because checks actually are issued by the Treasury
Department, which was given a ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a potential bottleneck of dramatic proportions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Jager warned that the computer bug could wreak havoc on the
world economy. Even businesses that have fixed their own computers
could face a complete shutdown because of other companies' computer
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when a businessman picks up the phone and there
is no dial tone? Tries to perform a financial transaction with a
bank and can't? Discovers that no supplies will be coming from
South Korea for the next two months? And that many of the companies
that used to buy his products can't anymore because their factories
are shut down?'' de Jager asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that officials at General Motors Corp. told him
that if Jan. 1, 2000 were to occur this weekend, the company would
not be able to produce a single car on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's
North American division, predicted that the Year 2000 problem will
most likely cause a recession as severe as the economic downturn of
1974-1975. That recession was triggered by the Middle East's oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's is no doubt that this will be cause some serious
disturbances in the United States,'' he said. ``The question is how
big will they be? And that will depend on what we do from this
point on.''

GENDER BENDING IN THE VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Jim Bridges tries his darndest, really he does,
to make his clients pretty. But even red lipstick, padded bras,
industrial-strength girdles and false eyelashes can't always
transform an average Joe into a foxy lady.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bridges Boutique in Studio City is one of two shops on
Ventura Boulevard that cater to a cross-dressing clientele, men
whose alter-egos wear skirts and go by names like Lacie, Ginger and
Sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a truck driver,'' Bridges said, pointing to a photo of
a burly fellow in a boa. ``He never drives anywhere without a pair
of heels and a wig under the seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The redhead in the floor-length beaded gown? ``That's Big Mary.
He's a sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   They may have the calves of Clydesdales and the shoulders of
Soviet shot-putters, but the tilt of their head and the come-hither
grin make it obvious they feel more like flirtatious females.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cross-dresser looks in the mirror and sees something
different than the rest of the world,'' Bridges said. ``I have
customers who are 6 feet tall, 200 pounds. They will put on a
slinky little dress and a wig without any makeup and they just get
this gleam in their eyes. They see not a man ... but an attractive
female who is 25- to 30-ish and a size 10 or 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender-bending has been a part of show biz as far back as
Shakespeare. From vaudeville to KISS, from ``Psycho'' to ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' entertainers don
the accouterments of the other sex to shock or make us laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But real-life cross-dressers lament that they are misunderstood,
forced to keep a harmless proclivity in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a bunch of freaks,'' Bridges said. ``They are men
who are trying to express something that is coming directly from
their soul, from their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges found his niche among the hordes of beauty consultants
in Los Angeles 12 years ago when a psychologist friend who ran a
support group for transvestites asked him to give the group some
beauty tips.
</P>
<P>
   Most transvestites, Bridges says, want to ``pass'' for women, so
he steers them away from get-ups that are sure giveaways: clothing
that is too trashy, or at the opposite extreme, frumpy, high-necked
ruffled blouses, long shapeless skirts, big glasses and low-heeled
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `I don't want to hurt your feelings, but you look like
Tootsie'.''
</P>
<P>
   The best chance of creating a convincing female form is wearing
well-tailored, sophisticated dresses, cut especially for men with
wide shoulders, and long sleeves and waist.
</P>
<P>
   He stocks large-size rings and size-14 shoes. High-heeled,
sling-back sandals in clear acrylic minimize foot size better than,
say, a red leather boot. A creatively tied scarf, a mock turtleneck
or choker necklace can disguise an Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   The most requested look? An anchorwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Bra size? 36C.
</P>
<P>
   The most common first-timer response after looking in a mirror?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God. I look like my mother!''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday afternoon, Larry Schulz went into Bridges'
boutique in jeans and a sweat shirt. He came out a blonde in
wide-rimmed black hat, gloves and a red suit.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation took about two hours and what seemed like 2
pounds of cosmetics. ``Beard camouflage,'' a heavy foundation used
to cover scar tissue on burn patients, would prevent Schulz from
suffering ``the Homer Simpson syndrome'' as the night wore on.
</P>
<P>
   A light-colored foundation on the cheekbones, a darker
foundation along the jawbone and two-toned blush contoured and
softened his masculine features.
</P>
<P>
   Next came an ``instant face-lift,'' accomplished by pulling the
skin on his face taut with clear surgical adhesive tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks my female side is younger than my male side,''
said Schulz, a divorced, 40-something North Hollywood man in the
antique restoration business.
</P>
<P>
   The finishing touch was bright red lipstick and ... voila!
</P>
<P>
   For $60, and the tasteful outfit he brought from home, Larry
became Gina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell the gals, `No matter how pretty the eyes are,
it's the lips that make the look,''' Bridges said. ``When the lips
go on, it starts to come to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them make a whole evening of it, starting with a
bubble bath and candles and music.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many cross-dressers, Schulz hid in his mother's closet as a
child and tried on her clothes. Once he came to terms with his
predilection, he found joy in playing dress-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my brighter side,'' Schulz said. ``It's my side that's
softer and gentler. I'm at peace with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He still struggles with stilettos and stubble, but he is in the
process of having his facial hair removed permanently with the help
of his current girlfriend, an electrologist.
</P>
<P>
   You might think one cross-dresser's boutique would meet market
demand. Not so. Down the road in Sherman Oaks, Lydia's TV (that's
short for transvestite) Fashions even rents lockers so men can
discreetly store potentially embarrassing items.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's, which does business with the studios and with thousands
of customers worldwide through its mail-order catalog, is owned by
Kathy and Paul Klink.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met several years ago through a personal ad. She was
a paralegal; he, a former Air Force master sergeant and a veteran
of the Korean and Vietnam wars.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul revealed his peculiar penchant several months into
their romance, a stunned Kathy asked: ``You're gay?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Paul, like most cross-dressers, is straight.
</P>
<P>
   Within the subculture of men who dress like women, there are
divisions. Drag queens are generally gay men who adopt a campy,
hyper-feminine style. Some drag queens are also transsexuals, who
undergo sex-change operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of cross-dressers are heterosexual, said
Richard Docter, a professor of clinical psychology at California
State University, Northridge, who has studied cross-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent are married.
</P>
<P>
   Some men make the transformation as little as a few times a
year. For others, it's several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   But for most men, cross-dressing begins in early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I have to do,'' Paul Klink said. ``This is
something so deeply ingrained in us, we have to satisfy that part
of our being.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Klink considered breaking off her relationship with Paul.
But she was tired of being single, and she loved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the worldliness of a man and the softness of a woman,''
Kathy Klink said. ``Around the house, he is still a man.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep her happy, Paul Klink restricts cross-dressing to
Saturday nights, when a group of cross-dressers and their wives
meet for socializing at ``gender-friendly'' establishments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to makeovers for $60 ($125 with a rental outfit,
padding included), customers can browse through book titles such as
``My Husband Wears My Clothes,'' ``Where Boys Will Become Girls''
and ``Part Time Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about support groups and welcoming churches,
nightclubs and hotels is posted on a bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Larry went out in public as Gina, Bridges
escorted him arm-in-arm to the Queen Mary Show Lounge, the club
next door where female impersonators draw a raucous crowd on
weekend nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first time, it feels like a long walk, like a football
field,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, a bit of booze, the suspension of reality and dim
bar lighting that can have the same effect on a less-than-perfect
face as a sheer dark veil, ``That's when all the magic comes
together,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gina, teetering at the 6-foot mark in heels, turned
heads as she strolled down Ventura Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time I can get by as a woman if I don't talk,''
Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers in cars idling at a red light laughed. They stared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha, ha, ha!'' howled one man, loudly so that Schulz would
hear.
</P>
<P>
   In the sunlight, you noticed her lipstick was feathered and
smudged on her tooth. A bit of face-lift tape protruded from the
wig.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, even Bridges admits that for men with particularly
masculine features _ a large nose, square jaw, wide forehead, broad
shoulders and big hands _ ``no amount of makeup, clothes, hair or
jewelry is going to camouflage that,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   For those clients, Bridges tells them to stop worrying about
``passing'' and instead just try to look good:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may say, `Oh. That's a dude in a dress.' But at
least it will be a great dress.''

THE ONION SEASONED WITH TABLOID HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The humor is sophomoric. OK, make that juvenile at
times.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the articles border on tasteless _ actually, forget
the borders. They are tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   And you'd swear the stories are made up.
</P>
<P>
   But no, we're NOT talking about L.A. Life. We're talking about
the Onion (www.theonion.com), the funniest Web site and humor
magazine to come giggling and snorting down the pike in years.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest, that is, if you don't count the bazillion Gillian
Anderson faux nude sites, which, for purposes of argument, we
won't. But you can think of the Onion as an ``X-Files'' site of its
own, a yuk-filled phenomenon too funny to forget or even adequately
explain.
</P>
<P>
   Witness such recent headlines as ``Gore Reprimanded for Failure
to Look Busy'' or ``New Wonder Drug Enables Users to Get Higher
Than Hell'' or ``Astronomer Discovers Center of Universe: `It's My
Beautiful 9-Year-Old Son,' he says.''
</P>
<P>
   A biting sendup of tabloid-style newspapers, the Onion comes
complete with useless info-graphics, dopey man-on-the-street
interviews, loopily earnest editorials and screaming headlines.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing too sacred or too low for the Onion to parody.
But what makes it so good _ and so laceratingly funny _ is its
dead-on parody of news-writing style _ turgid, uninspired prose so
serious that it has no sense of how silly it is.
</P>
<P>
   Like the editorial that could be the subtext of every
hand-wringing position taken by every newspaper that ever was:
``Somebody Should Do Something About All the Problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the boosterish, if not frighteningly believable business
story reporting ``New Starbucks Opens in Rest Room of Existing
Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to aspire to something that already exists,''
said Onion president and publisher Peter Haise. ``Given the weak
state of newspapers, that seemed like an easy target. We want to be
the only paper left standing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a bunch of old hacks trying to do something
different,'' Haise said. ``A couple of guys started the paper, we
came on to help, from there it just sort of blossomed. It's been a
sweet little evolution. It was just a cruddy little, text-heavy
kind of idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years along, it evolved more fully into a spoof of
the news. In about 1993, the publication added a culture section,
called the A-V Club, with movie, music and other reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd last this long with it,'' said Haise, 30.
``I'm the elder statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Onion, which began 10 years ago as and remains a
free weekly in Madison, Wis., is getting to be a very big
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Its Web site is so popular that it gets about 3 million hits a
month, Haise said. Last fall, the Onion was named ``best written
site'' on the Net in the Cool Site of the Year awards, and was
named to PC Magazine's 100 best sites on the Internet for the
second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also is beginning to attract big-time national
advertisers such as Barnes &AMP; Noble, Sony Music and CD-NOW.
</P>
<P>
   The Onion's hard-copy version is also distributed in three other
markets: Milwaukee, Denver-Boulder and most recently, Chicago,
Haise said. And the company is trying to put together a national
distribution deal on top of the 160,000 local copies and 10,000
subscriptions that go out weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Onion staff signed a six-figure deal with Hyperion Books to
create an offbeat take on the 20th century. The nearly complete
tome, tentatively titled ``Our Dumb Century,'' probably will be
released in the fall, Haise said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also trying to find a company that will sell its
line of goofy greeting cards, and it is using the Web site to sell
a variety of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Onion's brand of satire is going to offend some
people, such as when they ran the story ``Gulf War Syndrome Caused
by Idiots Who Join Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Nation's Stray Dogs Call for Increased Wino Vomit
Production.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Mother Teresa Sent to Hell In Wacky Afterlife Mix-Up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Haise said, ``By the nature of it, it's not humor if
it's not a bit offensive. We're equal-opportunity offenders.''

LEADERSHIP ON COMPUTER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   EXPERTS URGE CLINTON, GORE TO EXERT (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional experts on the Year 2000 computer
problem urged President Clinton on Tuesday to make it ``a national
priority'' to prevent the potential glitch from shutting down the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Reform and Oversight subcommittee on technology, cautioned against
panic but urged Clinton to give it more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his administration must set priorities if
the conversion is to be successful. ... Now is the time for the
president to designate the Year 2000 problem as a national
priority,'' he said at a press conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on the Year 2000 Problem, warned that it is
already too late to completely fix the nation's computers before
Jan. 1, 2000, and urged the Clinton administration to prepare for
the Year 2000 problem ``like a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that on Jan. 1, 2000, power comes on,
that water continues to run, that the most vital functions of daily
life are completely safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added: ``The only way that's going to get done is
through national leadership, which we haven't seen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Vice President Al Gore, who often leads
administration efforts on high-tech issues, should be the person to
address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett accused Gore of dodging the issue because of
concerns that his chances of becoming president would be damaged by
giving voters the pessimistic news associated with the Year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is both the obvious choice to lead the administration
and a dangerous choice because of his desire to be president,''
Bennett told a conference on the Year 2000 problem at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a non-partisan think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, a Canadian who has been appointed to both the
British and Russian Year 2000 task forces, also urged Gore to
become more involved in the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gore) should stop spending his time trying to put the
Internet in every high school and starting working on a problem
that threatens the entire global economy,'' de Jager told the CSIS
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Lawrence Hass, said both the president
and the vice president were ``fully on top of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spoken to the Cabinet heads ... and are regularly
briefed by their staff,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the glitch will be felt when one computer system
that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with another computer system
that thinks the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Because computers can't think, neither system can understand why
it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to sort out the problem, the
two systems go into the equivalent of shock: The computers and
devices they drive either stop or give out wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's panel gave the federal government an ``F'' grade for its
efforts to resolve the Year 2000 problem with its most important
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The panel flunked the U.S. Department of Transportation, the
State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, Department
of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency
for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration was the government's top
performer, earning an ``A plus'' from the Republican-controlled
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Horn noted that the Social Security Administration's top grade
is no guarantee that benefit checks won't be interrupted, for
example, because checks actually are issued by the Treasury
Department, which was given a ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a potential bottleneck of dramatic proportions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Jager warned that the computer bug could wreak havoc on the
world economy. Even businesses that have fixed their own computers
could face a complete shutdown because of other companies' computer
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when a businessman picks up the phone and there
is no dial tone? Tries to perform a financial transaction with a
bank and can't? Discovers that no supplies will be coming from
South Korea for the next two months? And that many of the companies
that used to buy his products can't anymore because their factories
are shut down?'' de Jager asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that officials at General Motors Corp. told him
that if Jan. 1, 2000 were to occur this weekend, the company would
not be able to produce a single car on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's
North American division, predicted that the Year 2000 problem will
most likely cause a recession as severe as the economic downturn of
1974-1975. That recession was triggered by the Middle East's oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's is no doubt that this will be cause some serious
disturbances in the United States,'' he said. ``The question is how
big will they be? And that will depend on what we do from this
point on.''

TOP NEW YORK RESTAURANTS ARE OFFERING CHINA TO GO

 By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prix fixe dinner at Lutece includes three courses
of the restaurant's specialties like smoked codfish with white
truffle oil, black bass with lobster sauce and pineapple
mille-feuille. It's $65, wine, tax and tip not included.
</P>
<P>
   The signature deep-blue and white Limoges plates aren't included
either, but they are, in fact, for sale ($180 for a five-piece
setting).
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying them. Designed for the restaurant's
executive chef, Eberhard Mueller, thechina is, Mueller said, ``the
highest quality, up to the standards of Lutece.'' And with a phone
call to Bergdorf Goodman, it can be yours.
</P>
<P>
   So can the logo-embossed silver wine coaster on the table at
Jean Georges; the restaurant has ordered a shipment to sell for $55
each. And at Aureole, there's an ash-wood box specially designed by
the architect Michael Graves _ $75 by itself, or $175 filled with
foods from the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   New York, of course, has plenty of theme-park restaurants like
the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, where you can order a
burger with a T-shirt on the side. But in the last couple of years,
more sophisticated establishments have been following suit, with
their own kind of refined commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, there's nothing so crass as a price tag in
sight. Often, it's a matter of asking if the pretty tableware is
for sale. Other times, one's shopping antennae must be up _ to put
2 and 2 together upon spying a display case that looks as though it
would be right at home in a hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   At La Caravelle, the French grande dame on West 55th Street,
diners who must wait a minute for a table can scrutinize the Chanel
watches on display in a locked glass case. Interested buyers are
directed to the Chanel boutique, two blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing exercise in mutual image-buffing, the restaurant
is periodically represented by a little table and menu in Chanel's
window. And Thursday during lunch, models wearing Chanel's fall
line will saunter through the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties declined to be specific about exactly who pays whom
for what, but they agreed that the arrangement benefits both
equally. (In a further celebration of consumerism, the shelves in
La Caravelle's foyer which used to store men's hats is now a
decorative tableau of shopping bags from stores like Saks Fifth
Avenue and Tiffany'.)
</P>
<P>
   At Aureole, the Michael Graves box is discreetly displayed on a
pedestal next to a stack of cookbooks written by the chef and
co-owner Charlie Palmer. The dessert menu advises customers that a
maple Shaker box packed with a quarter-pound of the restaurant's
chocolates and some petits fours is available for $45. ``We don't
push it, but we sell about four a day,'' said Vincent Santoro, the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the teddy bears at the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teddy bears at Rainbow are the most popular purchase at
the restaurant,'' said Robyn Massey, the director of public
relations for the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the designer of the waiters' uniforms, the costumed
bears, at $65, $75 and $85, include Rhonda the Cigarette Girl Bear,
outfitted in a black satin dress and wearing a perky pink pillbox
hat. The bear's outfit is identical with that of the real cigarette
girl (also, by the way, named Rhonda _ Rhonda Muziani), who roams
through the dining room with a tray full of bears looking for
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We substituted bears for cigarettes when the no-smoking laws
went into effect,'' Ms. Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whiteman, an wner of the Rainbow Room, sighed slightly
at the mention of the daily stuffed animal parade through the
restaurant, one of the world's most famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's an almost inevitable kind of brand marketing that is
happening all over the country now,'' said Whiteman, who as a
partner in the Joseph Baum &AMP; Michael Whiteman Co. is also an
international restaurant consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if many restaurants make substantial amounts of money
selling merchandise, but it's great advertising,'' he said. ``A
restaurant souvenir is a permanent extension of the restaurant
experience. If you buy a plate and take it home, you'll remember
the experience every time you use it. If you give it to a friend,
so will they.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room's silver-rimmed Art Deco-style dinner plates,
designed by Milton Glaser and made by Tiffany, are $30 a pair.
Sterling-and-enamel cuff links and stickpins are also for sale in
the display case by the cigar counter.
</P>
<P>
   Dale DeGroff, Rainbow's legendary bartender, is in the process
of designing a martini kit _ shaker, stirrer and glasses in a case
_ to add to the merchandise, which recently went on sale through
the restaurant's website (www.rainbowroom.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Monkey Bar is just getting into the act. On Monday, Hermes
china arrived at the restaurant very quietly _ for dessert. The
Hermes Africa pattern _ a subtle Noah's ark design that includes
monkeys _ has had a new desert designed especially to go on it, a
pastry, pineapple sorbet and rice pudding confection called the
Special Premie Hermes Africa Dessert fits both the design and the
mood of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who remark on the dish, which costs $98 and goes
safely into both microwave ovens and dishwashers, will be given a
brochure about the entire pattern, which can be purchased from the
Hermes shop a few blocks away, on East 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which will receive no compensation for acting as
an Hermes showcase, stands to benefit by the company it keeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great marriage with Hermes,'' said Tony Masiello, the
manager. ``It cements our classic style.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs were on to the retail phenomenon early. The
``21'' Club, which has always sold cigarette lighters and umbrellas
imprinted with its symbol, now also sells aprons, toy trains,
baseballs _ even T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Sirio Maccioni accommodated his customers at the old Le Cirque
with Villeroy &AMP; Boche china and oversize Italian-made Burgundy
glasses for at least a decade. But restaurants do not have the room
to keep much stock on hand, he said, so small quantities have to be
ordered continually, which is frankly a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six years, we did over a half million dollars' worth of
business _ but not really for a profit,'' Maccioni said.
</P>
<P>
   At the new Le Cirque 2000 on Madison Avenue, diners have already
asked to buy the crystal and the china, designed by Adam Tihanymade
and made by Bernardaud with its circus motifs. But arrangements
with the French company for retail orders are taking time, Maccioni
said, adding that ``early next year,'' the china and glassware will
be for sale, along with the small individual silver drip espresso
pots and _ most popular _ the elongated silver sorbet servers
designed by Ricciarelli, the Florentine silversmith.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it will be on display in a glass case, at the top of
the entrance stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some items are available at restaurants and nowhere else. Take
the silver holders for mineral water bottles, which are greatly
admired, on the tables of Jean Georges. They will go right in the
glass case, next to a new cookbook written by Jean-Geoges
Vongerichten, the chef at the restaurant and one of its owners. So
will the silver wine coasters. (The shipment is expected in
August.)
</P>
<P>
   For napkin rings, there's no place like Jo Jo, another
Vongerichten restaurant. The wide, brightly colored acrylic napkin
rings, in use at the bistro since it opened in 1991, are finally
for sale, at $15 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always wanted to buy them,'' said Lois Fredman,
manager of Jo Jo. Designed by a New York artist exclusively for the
restaurant (she would not say who), this season's versions come in
four translucent pastels. Since they're already on the tables, and
the foyer at the restaurant is notoriously tiny, there will be no
display case.
</P>
<P>
   Selling them to customers makes even more sense on the balance
sheet than it seems. Ms. Fredman said the napkin rings, although
closely watched and swiftly retrieved by eagle-eyed waiters, have
shown a remarkable tendency to make their way out the door.

`MELROSE' CREATOR HAS HIS WAY WITH `SEX AND THE CITY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; What do you get when you take Darren Star, the
creator of ``Melrose Place,'' and give him the content freedom of
HBO?
</P>
<P>
   Think of an R-rated ``Seinfeld'' from Elaine's perspective and
you'll have a pretty good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Sex and the City,'' an intelligent, provocative
half-hour comedy that explores the mating rituals of four
30-something women who are among New York's social elite. It debuts
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes the smart, observant columnist _ a
self-described ``sexual anthropologist'' _ played by Sarah Jessica
Parker; the promiscuous one (Kim Cattrall); the prudish one
(Kristin Davis); and the jaded one (Cynthia Nixon).
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose is a very fabricated concoction, and I think this is a
little more inside, a little more real,'' Star said. ``I wanted to
go off and do my thing. I wasn't trying to write a hit, I'm just
trying to write something funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more inside'' is the operative phrase here. ``Sex in
the City'' is like watching a baseball game and being able to hear
what the players are talking about during a strategy conference on
the pitcher's mound, only this time the players are women talking
about their relationships with men, who are often being referred to
by a characteristic rather than a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to look at four different types of women in terms
of their own relationships and sexuality and men. It's such a
fertile ground for characters and storytelling. It's sort of when
you get to the simple truth of it, everyone knows tons of
characters like these.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the title fool you, however. This is not the
T-and-A fest you'd expect from the network that brings you dozens
of incarnations of ``Real Sex,'' its nudity-heavy documentary
series that looks at real people having sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only use nudity when it's appropriate,'' Star said. ``When
we have it, it always services the story and the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' is more akin to the network's highly
acclaimed ``The Larry Sanders Show'' _ intelligent, adult
entertainment. And a pay-cable network like HBO is the only place
the show could have worked. Had its content been sanitized to the
point it would have passed through network television's standards
and practices, ``Sex and the City'' would have been a doomed
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not knocking network television,'' Star said. ``There are
some great shows on network television. But for this particular
show, HBO was the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the show's steamy topics: One episode deals
with men who are obsessed with ``dating'' (that's a euphemism)
models and what that means for other women who they won't date.
Another examines what happens when experienced 30-something women
date 20-something men; it includes frank discussion of a specific
sexual variation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents didn't know quite what to make of (the show),''
said Davis, who plays Charlotte, the prudish art dealer. ``But all
my friends love it.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells a story about her 33-year-old manager, who watched the
pilot and couldn't wait to get his hands on the two subsequent
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Star's other creations (``Melrose Place,'' ``Beverly Hills,
90210,'' ``Central Park West''), ``Sex in the City'' includes many
beautiful people in fabulous settings and sticky situations. But
this show, besides being a comedy, has a distinct sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great locations,'' Star said. ``This show has a very
fast pace. We were in as many locations in a half-hour as we were
in for an hour show.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong cast is led by Parker, who has starred in such movies
as ``Honeymoon in Vegas'' and ``L.A. Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who plays Carrie Bradshaw (loosely based on Candace
Bushnell, who writes the ``Sex and the City'' column in the New
York Observer), said that the show was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no plans to do television for a long time,'' she said.
``I was really surprised that I said yes, and said it so quickly.
The subject matter was very provocative and very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of appealing material, working for HBO and getting to
work in New York convinced Parker to join the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that doing HBO is like doing `television' to
these people,'' Star said. ``I think HBO is a big talent magnet in
terms of television. I think talent views it like their ad
campaign: It's not television, it's HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Star and Parker both said that they didn't feel as if
they were making a dozen half-hour television shows. Rather they
approached the project as being 12 short films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted very much to bring a different sensibility to
television,'' Parker said. ``The experience has been just
wonderful. HBO is a great champion and supporter of great
material.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the broadcast networks, HBO can afford to nurture
material. Its economics are based on the fact that quality will
entice subscribers, who in turn pay the bills. Emmy nominations and
Peabody Awards, like those the ``Sanders Show'' received, are more
important in its strategy than ratings. ``As a writer, your basic
mandate is just to do good work,'' Star said. ``That's how they
treat the creative process. It was very liberating to go from a
network to HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   And, they were also able to wait for Parker, something a network
with its rigid schedule couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   The lead actress was interested in the role, but needed time to
1) get married (to ``Godzilla'' star Matthew Broderick) and 2) to
block some time for a movie that never went.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just perfect,'' Star said. ``She was able to be
believable smart because she is smart. She's funny and sympathetic.
She can go out on the edge and people will love her at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who won't work nude, said that she objected to some of
the language written for her character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really important not to be gratuitous with the uses of
language,'' Parker said. ``We had to be really careful ... because
my character is a writer and would use the language, just not say
the `f-word.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And, the creator of ``Melrose Place'' with the freedom of HBO
listened.

REMEMBERING RFK

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was 30 years ago this week that New York Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy was murdered in the pantry of a Los Angeles hotel
shortly after midnight, following a celebration of his California
Democratic presidential primary victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was carrying on in the tradition of his assassinated older
brother, President John F. Kennedy _ campaigning for the White
House as a progressive leader who could end the Vietnam War, calm
racial turmoil and bring new prosperity to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby, as we all called him, was no Jack. Despite the magic
family name, he was not quite up to the monumental expectations
generated by nostalgia and the Camelot legend. The voters were
prepared to reject the presumed inevitability of another Kennedy
presidency, as they would do a decade later when it became Sen.
Edward Kennedy's turn to try.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy belongs now to history, and his myth has been
steadily undermined by recent accounts of his morally unacceptable
personal misbehavior. But in Bobby's time the martyred president
was such an overpowering emotional idol that not even his brother
could compete.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited public record but cleaner private life, Bobby's
reputation has survived in somewhat better shape, remembered by old
allies with undeserved reverence. But an overdue dose of reality
would be historically useful here too.
</P>
<P>
   Before that California primary, Vice President Hubert Humphrey
had already accumulated enough delegates to win the 1968 Democratic
nomination. Humphrey's advisers were so certain of victory they
were debating whether to ask Kennedy to take second spot on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Bobby's untimely death conferred an exaggerated
political glow that he did not enjoy in life, just as a similar
tragedy had done on his assassinated brother. Bobby became a
central figure in the family mythology, second only to Jack.
</P>
<P>
   As his brother's attorney general and as a senator, Bobby was
seen during his lifetime as the heir apparent to a family dynasty
that owed more to his father and fate than to anything he had
achieved on his own. He even owed his Senate seat to President
Lyndon Johnson, with whom he shared a mutual loathing. Kennedy was
losing his 1964 race in New York until the then-popular Johnson
personally campaigned there for him.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring in the shadow of history and the Kennedy giants who
preceded him, Bobby was a fascinating bundle of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   During his presidential campaign, he sought to establish a
viable political identity by championing poor farm workers, black
ghetto families, antiwar demonstrators, mine workers and all kinds
of forgotten causes. He appealed to the young, blacks,
professionals and blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, he could be eloquent and inspiring. His most famous
lines are probably those paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw: ``You
see things and you say, `Why?' But I dream things that never were
and I say, `Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   He could also be the tough-minded pragmatist that, along with
his familiar large Kennedy teeth, earned him the unflattering press
bus moniker ``ruthless rabbit.'' This was, after all, a loyal son
who came to maturity managing his elder, more intellectual
brother's 1960 presidential campaign, sometimes using ugly
political tactics.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked another Kennedy staffer why the future
president relied so much on his younger brother, the aide replied:
``Every candidate needs a hatchet man he can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby also labored as a youth for three years on the staff of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., of irresponsible communist
witch-hunting fame. His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, who was a
McCarthy friend, got him the job. Insofar as this columnist knows,
RFK never publicly disavowed McCarthy's motives.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite clear whether the liberalism of his later years
was an acquired taste designed to get votes or a genuine
philosophical conversion. His record on behalf of civil rights
stretches back through his Justice Department years. But the extent
of his interest in social outreach to help the disadvantaged is
murky.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1966, he opposed the Vietnam War, which Johnson was
then accelerating with bombings and additional troops _ a war that
his brother had previously supported with a gradually increasing
military presence. Bobby's position may have been the result of a
revulsion against the war but also could have been influenced by
his dislike for Johnson, whom he considered an interloper in a
White House that rightfully belonged to a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Johnson and Robert Kennedy came to a head
after Johnson eliminated all his Cabinet members as potential 1994
running mates in order to get rid of the Kennedy-generated pressure
to pick Bobby as his vice president. That gambit stands today as
one of history's more transparent political maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Not until then did Bobby quit the Justice Department to seek the
New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after Johnson declined to run again, Bobby jumped into
the presidential race even though Humphrey and Sen. Eugene
McCarthy, D-Minn., were already running. By further splintering the
party, Bobby's entry into the race increased the odds that the
likely GOP nominee, his brother's former foe Richard Nixon, would
win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby won five presidential primaries, but in losing Oregon he
became the first Kennedy to lose a political race. He was shot when
he was 42. He would have been 72 years old today.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Asian brews excellent for quenching spicy fires
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife's favorite cuisine is Thai, which might explain her
sense of humor. I like spicy food just fine, sometimes even hot
food. But there are limits. So it's good that the friendly people
at Tamarind Thai Cuisine on 14th Street, a wonderful restaurant
recommended to us by dining critic John Kessler, tell you exactly
how hot is hot.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu, one pepper means mild, but with a ``a stimulating
`kick' to lips and tongue.'' Well, OK.
</P>
<P>
   Two peppers ``will set lips and tongue tingling,'' the sensation
spreading ``a hearty glow.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably where I should stop, with two peppers and the
tingling. At three peppers ``the tingly glow is transformed into a
raging fire,'' and at four peppers _ ``for addicts, masochists and
Thai nationals'' _ management advises that you should order Thai
beer and tissues as a precaution. (A further precaution: Tamarind,
which opened in January, has applied for its liquor license but is
not yet serving beer. General manager Eddie Niyomkul says he
expects to be serving Singha, the renowned Thai beer, and Bangkok
Beer by early June.)
</P>
<P>
   The Thai beer I can understand, but what are those tissues for?
Whatever it is, ``management accepts no responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Very well, let me have the Gang Phed _ for now I'm a one-pepper
man _ with an order of Thod-Mun-Pla on the side. And, oh yes, bring
me a Singha when you can.
</P>
<P>
   Gang Phed, as the menu explains, is chicken, beef or pork in
sweet curry paste, with a touch of coconut milk, and Thod-Mun-Pla
is spicy fish cakes marinated with Kaffir lime leaves, string beans
and red curry paste. Tangy but not incendiary. Singha is better
described as opulent, but there's nothing particularly ``Thai''
about it. It's a lager _ beer in a German or Czech style _ that
happens to be brewed in Bangkok by the interestingly named Boon
Rawd Brewing Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Singha, it seems, was created by a German brewmaster in Thailand
in the '30s. Among Asian beers it stands out for its body and
hoppiness _ qualities that make it ideal not only for triple-pepper
Thai dishes but also Hunan and Szechwan cuisine at Chinese
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   No less a judge than Michael Jackson calls it ``an outstanding
pale lager that would attract attention anywhere in the world ... a
wonderfully hoppy, aromatic dry lager, full of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   I've had Singha before, but it surprised me to learn _ in
Jackson's ``New World Guide to Beer'' _ that it's brewed at 40
units of bitterness. By comparison, that's more than three times
the hoppiness of a Budweiser and on a par with the best German and
Czech pilsners. You don't notice the bitterness because the malt
gives the beer such body and balance.
</P>
<P>
   Bangkok Beer is less hoppy and lacks the overall character of a
Singha, but its clean, dry finish suits many Asian dishes _ not
just Thai _ quite well. In many an Asian country, this would be the
star.
</P>
<P>
   When you're choosing an Asian beer, you want to remember that
they aren't ``Asian.'' With a few exceptions, they're pale lagers,
no different in style from those you'd find the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean they're interchangeable _ many are drinkable
but ordinary, a few are excellent. Not every Asian beer can stand
up to a spicy Thai or Szechwan dish. Some don't have to. With
Cantonese cuisine, Tsingtao, less hoppy than Singha but crisp and
drinkable, works well enough.
</P>
<P>
   And with other Asian dishes your taste buds point the way almost
by instinct. Michael Jackson writes of the excellent sushi to be
found in the Japanese city of Sapporo, and it happens that nothing
complements a California roll like the pilsner character of a
bottled Sapporo Draft. Sushi, in fact, is one of those dishes that
bring out the qualities of a true pilsner _ assertive but not
overpowering, full flavored but clean on the finish. It's less
obvious why more Asian countries don't brew ales, whose generally
hoppier character suits spicy dishes. India, after all, is why the
British conceived of India Pale Ale: In the 19th century, beer kept
spoiling on the long ocean voyage to the subcontinent. Brewers
found that extra hops not only retarded spoilage but made for a
more robust ale.
</P>
<P>
   Many an American or English IPA (or even a less hoppy pale ale)
would suit curried dishes better than the Indian lager Golden
Eagle, which is hard to find fresh in the United States. There are
ale styles by the dozen, and not all of them would match Asian
cuisine. But with most Chinese dishes, I want Redhook Rye. Its
slightly tangy, slightly spicy ale character just brings more to
the palate than the unremarkable lager quality of Tsingtao.
</P>
<P>
   And a beer such as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which is no hoppier
than Singha, could stand up to four peppers any day. What's more,
it could complement the milder dishes without taking over the
table.
</P>
<P>
   But dining is a kind of vicarious experience. A good traveler
wants to do as the locals do, and the traveler offered a Singha is
being offered one of the world's best beers.

 &HT;    A shot at beauty: Toxin used to remove wrinkles
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Lisa Randolph was tired of hearing people tell her to
stop frowning.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old had deep lines above her brow, and was
considering having laser resurfacing to erase them.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, she decided to correct the problem one March
afternoon with a quick-and-easy injection of one of the world's
most deadly toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Call it botulism for beauty. Originally harnessed to relax
muscles associated with serious medical conditions such as
swallowing disorders and crossed eyes, Botox _ a diluted, purified
form of the toxin _ is now one of the hottest new weapons against
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, health clubs are offering injections of Botox
for their clients who want other ways to enhance their appearance
besides exercise. And it's become a verb in some places, as in,
``I'm getting Botoxed today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pretty poison'' is being offered by growing numbers by
Atlanta dermatologists and plastic surgeons, who say its safety _
yes, safety _ and uninvasive nature makes it a perfect choice for
many of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rumsey, 47, said he decided to do the procedure after seeing
the change in his wife. ``It softened her whole appearance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already youthful in appearance, Rumsey said he wanted to merely
take out squint and frown lines he had developed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it felt good,'' he said. ``But the whole
thing probably took less than a minute and it really did what it
was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically a very fine needle is used to inject the Botox, with
patients' skin numbed with ice. Usually, they see results within
three to five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautifully simple procedure,'' said Dr. Brian
Maloney of Premier Image Cosmetic and Laser Surgery, who did the
procedure for Randolph. ``And it's extremely benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, about 10 percent of Atlanta plastic surgeons and
dermatologists are offering the injections. But as popularity
spreads, more say they will be offering the service in the coming
months. Doctors don't need special training, but most practice the
technique to avoid injecting it in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Pound III, a plastic surgeon, said he recently reviewed a
videotape on the procedure and will probably start giving the
injections soon. ``I'll try it on my sister,'' he quipped. ``She's
expendable.''
</P>
<P>
   Botox details
</P>
<P>
   At full strength, botulinum toxin _ found in the bulging cans of
spoiled food _ is six million times more toxic than rattlesnake
venom. It kills victims by paralyzing their lungs and suffocating
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, Botox has been stripped of its lethal nature. About a half
of a vial, or ``50 units,'' is typically used for a treatment. To
have a toxic effect, more than 2,000 units would have to be
injected at one time, according to a fact sheet prepared by
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take more than 30 vials just to make someone sick,
and we don't keep more than one or two in the office,'' said Dr.
Edmond Griffin of Dermatology Associates of Atlanta, who has been
offering the injection for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Botox has, however, retained one trait of its evil twin. Like
botulism, it still has the ability to slightly paralyze muscle _
which allows it to eliminate wrinkles by essentially smoothing them
out. The facial muscles are not frozen, but temporarily softened.
Botox works best on crow's feet around the eyes, the frown lines
between the brows and ``surprise'' lines in the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked much better than I expected,'' said Griffin, 52, who
said he got the injections to ease two deep frown lines on his
forehead. And he said, a surprise side effect of the treatment is
that his migraine and tension headaches eased.
</P>
<P>
   And patients say there's another bonus: Some have found after
getting two injections, that the muscles are actually retrained not
to tense, allowing the wrinkles to permanently disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the down side? Well, for starters, the doctor could
inject Botox in the wrong muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really is the biggest complication,'' said Susan
Monteleone-Laird, director of training and development at Cosmetic
Surgery Consultants. The Marietta business screens physicians on
experience and education and offers an private referral service for
patients for a fee. ``If you get someone who is inexperienced, who
either injects it in the wrong muscle or allows it to drift, you
could end up with a droopy eye for a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients are told not to rub the area that receives the
injection to keep that from happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration also is less than thrilled with
the newest use of Botox. Although it has approved its use for such
disorders as eye-tics and cross-eye, called strabismus, the federal
agency takes a dim view of its promotion for wrinkles. And in 1994,
it singled out a doctor's Botox ad to state its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotion of an unapproved use is an egregious example of
promoting a potentially toxic biologic for cosmetic purposes,'' it
wrote in a Federal Registry notice.
</P>
<P>
   And because the drug is relatively new, there is no data on the
potential risks of long -term use.
</P>
<P>
   The injections _ which typically offer a temporary fix for three
to six months _ are also fairly pricey. Usually, the first
injection is between $300 and $400, with follow-up treatments
sometimes costing less. And of course, the treatment is not covered
by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Botox is massive
</P>
<P>
   Botox's advantages for those with wrinkles was an accidental
discovery of Dr. Jean Carruthers, a Vancouver ophthalmologist.
After completing her treatment of a patient with eye tics with
Botox, the patient got upset with Carruthers because the patient's
wrinkles returned.
</P>
<P>
   Carruthers discussed the incident with her husband, a
dermatologist. And in the process, the couple discovered a new
market for the toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Botox is marketed by Allergan Inc., which originally did not buy
the drug to appease vanity. The company, which focuses on eye
problems such as cataracts and glaucoma, merely added Botox to its
battery of medications because its success with eye tics and
crossed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, those treatments make up only a fraction of the $90
million in Botox sales the company made last year. The company will
not disclose how much has been sold for cosmetic use.
</P>
<P>
   The market _ especially as baby boomers seek ways to hold on to
youth _ is massive. And doctors see another advantage: Botox allows
patients who are skittish about doing more invasive procedures get
a taste of what they might look like with a more permanent
solution, such as a face-lift or laser resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, patients and doctors who have had the
injections say they have no intention of giving up their newfound
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to go back'' said Randolph. ``I thought
it was simply great.''

 &HT;    Peanut butter fudge a dream of dishy dessert
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's hardly anything more dreamy than a creamy peanut butter
fudge. And reader Beverly Sell knew the secret ingredient for such
a fudge _ marshmallows. She just needed the rest of the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Turner of Marietta, Ga. responded with a chocolate-peanut
butter version that's simple and simply delicious. For a strictly
peanut butter candy, we turned to a classic Southern cookbook,
``Charleston Receipts,'' a collection of recipes gathered by the
Junior League of Charleston, S.C., in 1950. Sure enough, we found a
recipe for Peanut Butter Fudge Dreams.

 &HT;    A shot at beauty: Toxin used to remove wrinkles
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Lisa Randolph was tired of hearing people tell her to
stop frowning.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old had deep lines above her brow, and was
considering having laser resurfacing to erase them.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, she decided to correct the problem one March
afternoon with a quick-and-easy injection of one of the world's
most deadly toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Call it botulism for beauty. Originally harnessed to relax
muscles associated with serious medical conditions such as
swallowing disorders and crossed eyes, Botox _ a diluted, purified
form of the toxin _ is now one of the hottest new weapons against
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, health clubs are offering injections of Botox
for their clients who want other ways to enhance their appearance
besides exercise. And it's become a verb in some places, as in,
``I'm getting Botoxed today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pretty poison'' is being offered by growing numbers by
Atlanta dermatologists and plastic surgeons, who say its safety _
yes, safety _ and uninvasive nature makes it a perfect choice for
many of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rumsey, 47, said he decided to do the procedure after seeing
the change in his wife. ``It softened her whole appearance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already youthful in appearance, Rumsey said he wanted to merely
take out squint and frown lines he had developed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it felt good,'' he said. ``But the whole
thing probably took less than a minute and it really did what it
was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically a very fine needle is used to inject the Botox, with
patients' skin numbed with ice. Usually, they see results within
three to five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautifully simple procedure,'' said Dr. Brian
Maloney of Premier Image Cosmetic and Laser Surgery, who did the
procedure for Randolph. ``And it's extremely benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, about 10 percent of Atlanta plastic surgeons and
dermatologists are offering the injections. But as popularity
spreads, more say they will be offering the service in the coming
months. Doctors don't need special training, but most practice the
technique to avoid injecting it in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Pound III, a plastic surgeon, said he recently reviewed a
videotape on the procedure and will probably start giving the
injections soon. ``I'll try it on my sister,'' he quipped. ``She's
expendable.''
</P>
<P>
   Botox details
</P>
<P>
   At full strength, botulinum toxin _ found in the bulging cans of
spoiled food _ is six million times more toxic than rattlesnake
venom. It kills victims by paralyzing their lungs and suffocating
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, Botox has been stripped of its lethal nature. About a half
of a vial, or ``50 units,'' is typically used for a treatment. To
have a toxic effect, more than 2,000 units would have to be
injected at one time, according to a fact sheet prepared by
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take more than 30 vials just to make someone sick,
and we don't keep more than one or two in the office,'' said Dr.
Edmond Griffin of Dermatology Associates of Atlanta, who has been
offering the injection for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Botox has, however, retained one trait of its evil twin. Like
botulism, it still has the ability to slightly paralyze muscle _
which allows it to eliminate wrinkles by essentially smoothing them
out. The facial muscles are not frozen, but temporarily softened.
Botox works best on crow's feet around the eyes, the frown lines
between the brows and ``surprise'' lines in the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked much better than I expected,'' said Griffin, 52, who
said he got the injections to ease two deep frown lines on his
forehead. And he said, a surprise side effect of the treatment is
that his migraine and tension headaches eased.
</P>
<P>
   And patients say there's another bonus: Some have found after
getting two injections, that the muscles are actually retrained not
to tense, allowing the wrinkles to permanently disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the down side? Well, for starters, the doctor could
inject Botox in the wrong muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really is the biggest complication,'' said Susan
Monteleone-Laird, director of training and development at Cosmetic
Surgery Consultants. The Marietta business screens physicians on
experience and education and offers an private referral service for
patients for a fee. ``If you get someone who is inexperienced, who
either injects it in the wrong muscle or allows it to drift, you
could end up with a droopy eye for a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients are told not to rub the area that receives the
injection to keep that from happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration also is less than thrilled with
the newest use of Botox. Although it has approved its use for such
disorders as eye-tics and cross-eye, called strabismus, the federal
agency takes a dim view of its promotion for wrinkles. And in 1994,
it singled out a doctor's Botox ad to state its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotion of an unapproved use is an egregious example of
promoting a potentially toxic biologic for cosmetic purposes,'' it
wrote in a Federal Registry notice.
</P>
<P>
   And because the drug is relatively new, there is no data on the
potential risks of long -term use.
</P>
<P>
   The injections _ which typically offer a temporary fix for three
to six months _ are also fairly pricey. Usually, the first
injection is between $300 and $400, with follow-up treatments
sometimes costing less. And of course, the treatment is not covered
by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Botox is massive
</P>
<P>
   Botox's advantages for those with wrinkles was an accidental
discovery of Dr. Jean Carruthers, a Vancouver ophthalmologist.
After completing her treatment of a patient with eye tics with
Botox, the patient got upset with Carruthers because the patient's
wrinkles returned.
</P>
<P>
   Carruthers discussed the incident with her husband, a
dermatologist. And in the process, the couple discovered a new
market for the toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Botox is marketed by Allergan Inc., which originally did not buy
the drug to appease vanity. The company, which focuses on eye
problems such as cataracts and glaucoma, merely added Botox to its
battery of medications because its success with eye tics and
crossed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, those treatments make up only a fraction of the $90
million in Botox sales the company made last year. The company will
not disclose how much has been sold for cosmetic use.
</P>
<P>
   The market _ especially as baby boomers seek ways to hold on to
youth _ is massive. And doctors see another advantage: Botox allows
patients who are skittish about doing more invasive procedures get
a taste of what they might look like with a more permanent
solution, such as a face-lift or laser resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, patients and doctors who have had the
injections say they have no intention of giving up their newfound
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to go back'' said Randolph. ``I thought
it was simply great.''

 &HT;    $10 million in capital improvements made by KSL Recreation to
Lake Lanier Islands.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lake Lanier Islands, Ga.--Our paddleboat sank during a recent
jam-packed weekend escape to one of Atlanta's favorite playgrounds.
But not our spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As my 10-year-old daughter and I were spinning merrily along in
one of those boats you pedal like a bicycle, the darn thing took on
water and starting sinking like the Titanic. The rescue was a scene
right out of Baywatch _ except the drama unfolded on the placid
waters of Lake Sidney Lanier at the Beach and Water Park. Before I
could say glub, glub, a lifeguard zipped over in aher little chase
boat, and soon we were back on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as we left the water park, we saw the upturned Capri
paddleboat on the shore. ``Look, there's the SS Capri,'' said my
husband, John. ``Uh, more like the SOS Capri,'' quipped Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we were able to salve our wounded egos at our
cottage _ one of the new LakeHouses on Lanier _ to relax in its hot
tub and cook burgers on the gas grill on the deck overlooking the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of $10 million in capital improvements made by
California-based KSL Recreation Corp. since it took over ownership
and operation of Lake Lanier Islands from the state last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building the 30 LakeHouses _ another 10 will be
ready for occupancy this weekend and a final 10 by the end of the
month _ KSL has upgraded the 224-room Hilton Resort. The
refurbished entrance includes verdant landscaping and a splashing
fountain. Inside, the lobby has been redecorated in rich purple and
green. The 11,000 square-foot-expansion includes a new grand
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is a 65-passenger excursion boat, the Island Queen,
which offers sunset cruises Saturdays. Outfitted like a luxury
yacht, the Queen has an oak bar and trim and upholstered furniture
groupings around cocktail tables downstairs and tables and chairs
on the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   The most eagerly anticipated addition for the wet set is the
colorful FunDunker, an interactive family attraction at the Beach
and Water Park that promises ``100 ways to get wet.'' The
multilevel maze looks like Tinker Toys meets Lego, with slides,
pipes, spigots, hoses, waterfalls, faucets and valves. After
several delays, the water funhouse is expected to open by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will no doubt love dousing their parents with cold blasts
from jet propulsion sprays, spewing geysers and water troughs. And
what fun it should be when 1,000 gallons of water spills from a
huge bucket perched atop the contraption! Families that spray
together, stay together.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline and her friend Allison Rohan, also 10, managed to drown
their disappointment about missing the FunDunker with numerous
trips down the Chattahoochee Rapids water chutes, both solo and in
tandem tubes. They also spent hours of bobbing in the crashing
breakers of Wildwaves wave pool. I preferred to stretch out on a
towel on the grass next to the sandy beach, slurp lemon ices and
take an occasional dip in the chilly lake to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   Their energy unflagging, the girls wanted to do it all. At the
LakeHouse, they alternately lolled in the bubbling spa and watched
cartoons in their own bedroom with twin beds. They were the first
out the door for horsebacking riding _ a pleasurable hour along
trails that wind through the woods by the lakeshore and provide a
rare glimpse of the islands' wildlife (we saw at least a dozen
deer).
</P>
<P>
   My luck, I got a bull-headed steed named Mocha, who tested me
early and often, veering off the trail into the bush. Sensing my
equestrian experience was limited, he must have decided to liven
things up _ at my expense. (Perhaps he heard I was the one who
couldn't manage to keep a paddleboat afloat.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John played a round of golf at the 18-hole Emerald
Point Golf Course, which boasts 13 holes on the water. No. 2,
completely surrounded by water and accessible only by a bridge, is
the course's signature hole. John wouldn't say how many of his golf
balls now reside on Lanier's murky bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And what would a weekend at Lake Lanier be without taking a boat
out? We spent a few hours on the lake in a small ski boat _ mostly
dodging sailboats and other craft, including those ubiquitous Jet
Skis churning up wakes as they roared across the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite part was kicking back at the house in the pines
above a secluded cove _ hanging out on the large deck in a
green-painted Adirondack chair or in the spa. The steaks we seared
on the grill tasted better than any we've cooked at home. That's
probably because we opted to have Hilton deliver marinated
ready-to-grill meat along with sides and dessert ($25-$40 per
person), though you can BYOS (bring your own steak).
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to start thinking of the spacious yet cozy
rental unit as home. Framed pictures of families posing for
vacation snapshots on the walls provide a homey touch _ the folks
could be your relatives. Turns out they are shots from the family
albums of KSL creative director Dale Moore, a former Disney
imagineer who designed and decorated the wood and rock cottages to
look like Grandma's place at the lake back in the '50s and '60s.
Call his style Faux Granny, but it works. Even if your grandmother
never went near a lake, you'll feel a twinge of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The great room has a sleeper sofa and white wicker chairs,
stacks of Reader's Digest Condensed Books and National Geographics
(just like at Grandma's!), a river rock fireplace and hearth, and
built-in bookshelves with TV and VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is separated from the living area by a rock and oak
bar with stools. The cabinets and six dining room chairs are
painted blue, the rest of the wood furniture white. The
weathered-look dining table as well as the coffee and end tables
were custom made by local craftsmen, who also crafted the massive
carved headboards in the bedrooms, the bedside tables and folding
screens between the dressing area and the bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Star cutouts on the tables and screens complement the celestial
theme in the master bedroom, which is accented with framed prints
featuring sun, moon, stars and angels.
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom has a king-size bed, the second bedroom has
twins, which can be connected to create a king if you prefer. And
with two bathrooms, the houses can easily accommodate two families
(give the kids the sofa bed) or two couples. All the better for
sharing the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Both bedrooms feature braided rugs strewn on unfinished hardwood
floors _ the same throughout the house. So don't worry if you don't
wipe your feet when you come in dripping after a soak in the hot
tub.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you could always get away with murder at Grandma's.

 &HT;    Let Web whisk you to World Cup in France
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you take the NBA championships, the Super Bowl, the Olympics
and possibly the World Series and lumped them all together, you
might have something that comes close to the international frenzy
surrounding World Cup soccer championships.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who know nothing about soccer, the World Cup is
the best place to learn. Every four years, almost every country in
the world, including the United States in recent years, sends its
best players to France in the round robin tournament to see which
country has the best soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have been fought over the outcome of matches. Players who
embarrassed their countries by losing a match have been
assassinated. This is serious stuff.
</P>
<P>
   One way for clueless Americans to bone up on World Cup news is
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to begin your learning adventure is at the official
World Cup Web site (http://www.france98.com). The site is artfully
designed to reflect the global nature of this year's tournament,
which is in France, and is available in French and English. You can
pick up information here about who's playing, the latest news and
team updates.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a souvenir shop where you can purchase official
merchandise direct from France in U.S. dollars. And should you be
inspired enough to go to France to attend the World Cup for
yourself, there's information about tickets and accommodations.
Tickets are mailed out in secure, nonidentifiable packets that
should give you some idea of how coveted tickets are.
</P>
<P>
   Another good place to pick up some background on the World Cup
is the FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) Web
site (http://www.fifa.com). FIFA is the official organizing
committee for the World Cup. Here you can look up the history of
World Cup matches, find out the different venues where games will
be played and read up on the rules and regulations for World Cup
teams and players. Yahoo! has co-opted some FIFA content and offers
up a list of World Cup rankings at
http://soccer.yahoo.com/wc98/rankings.html.
</P>
<P>
   While we Yanks are just getting up to speed on soccer and the
World Cup, the Europeans have been mad about the sport for years.
The British Broadcasting Corporation, known for its staid
journalism and solid reporting, has a bright blue and green Web
site devoted to cup fever (http://www.bbc.co.uk). It's got news.
It's got a calendar. It's got online polls. It's got travel
information. You can also chime in on the debate over Paul
``Gazza'' Gascoigne, who was booted from the English team after
getting drunk in a Spanish hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the football star can send messages to him, listen to an
exclusive interview or read a variety of other articles, including
skyrocketing TV sales in Vietnam so fans can watch the cup or the
threats by Air France to strike during the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, we Yanks are just catching on to soccer, never
mind the World Cup. However, soccer fans in the United States and
around the world are keeping the message boards at CNN/SI
(http://www.cnnsi.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup) active.
With more than 4,000 messages on everything from the Iranian team
to discussions of the sport's top players, This is the place to go
if you want to talk soccer. Meanwhile, ESPN Sportzone
(http://espn.sportzone.com/soccer/worldcup98/) does a great job of
gathering all the pertinent World Cup information into a stylish
and easy-to-navigate package. The site's minimalist design also is
accessible to many soccer fans worldwide who might not have
state-of-the-art computers. ESPN also has the American broadcast
schedule on its site and a profile of the U.S. team.

 &HT;    CNN will spend week on nuclear problems
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN will devote even more resources than usual to an
across-the-board series of specials and reports on nuclear
proliferation the week of June 15, gathered under the heading
``Ground Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, scheduled to be announced soon, calls for a one-hour
special at 10 p.m. EDT, June 16 anchored by Christiane Amanpour and
more than 50 reports throughout the week, touching nearly all CNN
programming, CNN/US President Richard Kaplan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said the overview was prompted by the recent nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan but will not be limited to the current
situation. An upcoming ``NewsStand'' magazine show with
Entertainment Weekly, for example, will look at how Hollywood has
dealt with nuclear fears. A recent taped interview with Fidel
Castro, intended for the September launch of the 24-hour miniseries
``The Cold War,'' will be excerpted for historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where CNN shows what it can really do,'' Kaplan said.
``We have to make more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shows dealing with nuclear bombs will include
``Crossfire,'' ``Burden of Proof'' and ``TalkBack Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground Zero'' is part of Kaplan's ongoing mission to improve
CNN's programming. Although much of the attention inside CNN lately
has been focused on Sunday's launch of ``NewsStand,'' there is also
the constant sound of construction from the new news set being
built for later this year. The 24-hour ``Cold War'' is finished and
the promotion effort will start this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And CNN's ``Perspective'' series of documentaries will start a
new umbrella series called ``Century of Strife'' at 8 p.m. EDT
Sunday. Hosted by James Earl Jones, the free-standing documentaries
will include ``The Kennedys in Crisis'' (Sunday), about John and
Robert Kennedy and the integration of the University of Alabama;
``Assassinated: The Last Days of Kennedy and King'' (June 14 and
June 21; it originally aired on TBS in April), an Oliver Stone
production that does not delve into conspiracy theories; and
``Somalia: Blackhawk Down,'' about the 1993 U.S. involvement in
Somalia.

   NUCLEAR WASTE BILL DEAD: GINGRICH
</P>
<P>
   By Mark D. Preston and Dave Williams
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, JUNE 2 -- A bill calling for construction of an
interim storage site for high-level nuclear waste in the Nevada
desert is dead for this year, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, R-Ga., released a statement late Tuesday afternoon, as
Nevada's two senators argued passionately on the Senate floor
against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I strongly support a legislative resolution to the
nuclear waste issue, it is unlikely that such a bill will make it
past the president's veto to become law this year,'' Gingrich said.
``Because of the crowded calendar and the strong opposition of some
members, I do not expect to schedule floor action this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev., told reporters Monday that he had
received confirmation from Gingrich that the bill was dead.
However, the speaker did not comment publicly on the issue until
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with his colleague, (Rep.) Jim Gibbons, (R-Nev.), John
Ensign has been a forceful and effective voice for the citizens of
Nevada in opposing the nuclear waste bill,'' Gingrich said.

&HT;        NUCLEAR WASTE BILL DEAD: GINGRICH

SPORTS COLUMN: THE KEY TO JORDAN'S FUTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of the Bulls-Jazz NBA finals, a series which some
speculate may be Michael Jordan's Last Finals, Last Games, Last
Dance, (would one of Jordan's last meal then be the Last Repast?)
it would be helpful to consider the circumstances surrounding the
possible grounding of His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the Bulls coach, Phil Jackson, is the key to Jordan's
basketball-playing future. And by extension, the Bulls' management
has been perceived as that which holds the hand that holds the key.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Jordan has said, and then seemingly hedged, that
he would not return to the Bulls, the only team he said he would
consider playing for, if Jackson were not the coach. Jackson was
the bench leader behind all the Bulls' five championships.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan himself has coyly left the impression that he may not go
voluntarily into that good night, and that the Bulls' management,
like the proprietor of a vaudeville stage, might just be applying a
hook, although circumspectly. That is, no Jackson, no Jordan.
Jordan isn't alone in this intimation. Phil Jackson has indirectly
also allowed the idea to metastasize.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has repeatedly stated publicly that this would be his
last season. And why would this be Jackson's last season? Because,
it is generally believed, Bulls' management wants it that way, and
is pushing Jackson out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' Jackson said recently, ``that when I signed this
last contract, Jerry Krause said that this would be my last
season.'' Krause is the vice president in charge of basketball
operations for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Jackson indeed signed a one-year contract _ but he
had been offered a five-year contract, then a two-year contract,
and turned them down for the one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jerry Krause did,'' said Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the
Chicago Bulls, ``was only repeat what Phil Jackson had been saying.
In fact, several times in the last year I've asked Phil if he wants
to come back. And every time he has said to me, no.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Jackson and Krause _ the man who hired Jackson _
no longer have any love lost for each other. ``I'm not really sure
what the problem is,'' said Jackson, ``but I think Krause thinks
I've gotten a big head.'' Krause won't comment on the acrimonious
relationship other than to say, ``I'm going to take the high road _
there's no traffic up there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jackson and Krause speak only when necessary, such as
when deciding and agreeing on a trade, like that of Jason Caffey.
About two years ago Jackson went to Reinsdorf and said the
situation with Krause was becoming untenable. ``Do you think you
can work well enough with Jerry to win a championship?'' asked
Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll leave things as they are,'' decided Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is not wrong in believing that Krause wants him out, and
has compared the situation to the one with the Lakers in the 1980s
in which Jerry West's personality clash with Pat Riley resulted in
Riley's departure as coach. ``But Jerry Reinsdorf is not pushing me
out,'' said Jackson. And, he was asked, if Reinsdorf wants you to
stay, do you think you would be able to stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Jackson, ``Reinsdorf is the bottom line, and
Krause would listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said: ``Phil has done a great job for us, and if he
changes his mind and wants to come back, I'll be open to discussing
it with him, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be necessary to know, among other points, if Jackson
would want to be involved in rebuilding the Bulls, perhaps the
oldest team in the league. Jackson has suggested he would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every seven years the molecular components of the body
change,'' Jackson said, in his Zen-like mode. ``And I've felt that
it's been seven years that I've been the Bulls' coach, and I'm a
changing person.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Jordan, who went from basketball to baseball to basketball
to, well, golf? ``I'm not sure even Michael knows at this time,''
said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But like the ghost of Banquo, the notion hovers that in a matter
of a fortnight Jordan will be gone forever from the hard-court
scene, depriving a city, a nation and large pockets of the rest of
the earth, the moon and the stars the pleasure of his basketball
genius. It is a genius still wondrous though, older and achier, he
is no longer first in flight.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jordan is relying on the Jackson outcome, then it seems
safe to say that the decision is Jackson's, because it is
Reinsdorf's.

WORKING IN THE GARDEN BRINGS AN UNDERSTANDING OF PARABLES

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As a novice gardener, I'm often frustrated with the patches of
land I'm working. My front-yard flower beds and backyard vegetable
plots seem to grow more weeds than a rain forest -- thus turning my
Saturdays into a war on unwanted plants.
 &HT;    Weeding in the warm spring sun I wonder, why do I feel compelled
to sweat while tending little sprouts and shrubs? Only a
nongardener would call gardening fun; we gardeners (even beginning
ones) know gardening is hard work.
 &HT;    So, why garden? Oddly enough, I enjoy it. I find myself thinking
about my flowers and herbs throughout the week -- planning
projects, reading about plants, and mentally tilling the ground. By
week's end, I can't wait to don my gloves and get back to the
garden. There, in the midst of toil, as my baby looks on from her
play yard, I feel connected.
 &HT;    Allen Lacy, a philosopher of gardening, writes, ``A garden,
whether we know it or not, connects us to the world in many strange
and wonderful ways.'' Thus, the garden is not a retreat. Rather, it
is a grounded path to larger understanding.
 &HT;    For me, that includes spirituality.
 &HT;    Many experienced gardeners have written well about the
spirituality of gardening. From Thomas Jefferson to Wendell Berry,
American thinkers have expounded upon the soulfulness of
cultivation. Indeed, Americans have theologized about gardening
almost as long as we have gardened.
 &HT;    When I started this spring, I swore I wouldn't think about
gardening. Others have done it better and more eloquently. Since I
think for a living, I needed something to do with my hands -- not
my head. So, I started to dig. With every shovel, I began to learn
-- and found I couldn't helping thinking -- about dirt.
 &HT;    Dirt does not seem a likely spiritual teacher. I could imagine
waxing rapturous over flowers or herbs. But dirt?
 &HT;    Until this year, I never knew dirt was important. I thought
gardeners bought seeds or those little plants at the nursery and
popped them in the ground. Some Miracle-Gro, some water, some
patience ... picture-perfect garden.
 &HT;    But dirt is the starting place for a good garden. The soil must
be loamy, textured, balanced, rich, and, above all, alive with good
bugs and worms.
 &HT;    I'd never considered whether my dirt was alive. Much to my
dismay, I discovered that mine was hard clay. Alas, no bugs. Under
my vegetable plot, I found the remnants of an old patio -- complete
with plastic tarp and bricks. My garden wasn't loamy, it was
gloomy.
 &HT;    Undaunted, my husband and I worked that spot. We dug and hoed
and turned the earth. We added soil conditioners, compost and good
dirt. A month later, we were still digging.
 &HT;    While struggling with the clay, I recalled Jesus' agricultural
parables. One came to mind with particular force: ``A sower went
out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell on the path and was
trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on the rock; and as
it grew, it withered for lack of moisture. Some fell among thorns,
and the thorns choked it. Some fell into good soil, and when it
grew, it produced a hundredfold.''
 &HT;    Growing up in the city, stories about sowing seeds never made
much sense, so I trusted my minister's interpretation of the
passage. Those who accepted God's word were like the seed sown on
good soil; those who believed in Jesus would grow and bear fruit.
If you happened to be good soil, you were lucky. If not, too bad. I
called it ``chips fall where they may'' theology.
 &HT;    This spring, much to my surprise, I learned soil can be changed.
Good soil does not usually just happen; it results from hard work.
When I reread Jesus' words, I almost heard the crowd laughing,
``Good soil? In Palestine?!'' The folks who followed Jesus -- many
of them farmers -- got it. In order for the seed to grow, the soil
must first be worked.
 &HT;    Jesus said, ``If you want to hear God's word, dig. Turn over the
dirt, till, hoe, add manure. Dig, dig, and dig. Only then, once
your soul is loamy, textured, balanced, rich, and crawling with
good bugs can you hear.''
 &HT;    Standing inches deep in mud, I understood. The seed of God's
word was not condemnation. Rather, the seed was a promise. If we do
our part working our lives into good soil, God's word will grow and
bear fruit.
 &HT;    And so does the garden. Now, three months later, we're
harvesting our first beans and lettuce. The flowers are blooming
and the herbs get bigger every day. Every fistful of dirt yields
earthworms. What was dead lives. It has been quite a rebirth.

WHITE HOUSE PLANS STRATEGY SESSION ON HORMEL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration will host a White House
strategy session Thursday to devise ways to pressure Republican
leaders to allow a Senate vote on the ambassadorial nomination of
gay rights advocate James C. Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Some 60 people _ including leaders of civil rights groups,
senior administration officials and a bipartisan group of senators
_ are expected to attend the session and explore ways of getting
Senate action on Hormel's nomination to be ambassador to
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an effort by the administration to communicate to a broad
cross section of America's civil rights community leadership about
what's already been done and what still needs to be done in order
to get Mr. Hormel confirmed,'' said Richard Socarides, special
assistant to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has refused to bring
Hormel's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote, saying it would
take too much time. Hormel's nomination was approved 16 to 2 in
November by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but it has
since been blocked from a floor vote by conservatives including
Sens. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Robert
C. Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The senators say Hormel's gay activism makes him an
inappropriate choice for the job because Luxembourg is a
predominantly Catholic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization which
Hormel founded, called the White House meeting ``a clear
demonstration of the administration's support of Jim Hormel and a
clear bipartisan show of that support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, who is in Washington this week to meet with senators and
State Department officials about his stalled nomination, has
observed an unwritten rule of nominee etiquette by not speaking
publicly about the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Socarides said he believes support for Hormel is growing
among civil rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most of these groups oppose discrimination where
ever they find it,'' Socarides said. ``People are coming to see
this more and more as an issue of basic fairness. Here's an
individual who is obviously qualified who is being discriminated
against only because he is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 64, is a San Francisco philanthropist, Democratic Party
donor, former dean at the University of Chicago Law School and heir
to the Hormel meat packing fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Senate liberal, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has
been a vocal supporter of Hormel's, has pledged to offer a
nonbinding Senate resolution in an attempt to pressure Lott to
bring the nomination up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone has said he will attach the resolution to a major bill
after the Senate finishes work on pending tobacco legislation.

FILMMAKERS' NEXT LITERARY STOP: BALZAC TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7)  
 (bl)  
 By JEAN NATHAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the French writer Honore de Balzac died of caffeine
poisoning in 1850 at the age of 51 _ he was said to have consumed
on the order of four dozen cups of coffee a day _ he had produced
more than 100 major works, predominantly novels, all in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just coffee that fueled this prodigious output; it
was also genius. (In a clear case of professional envy, Robert
Louis Stevenson qualified the use of that word by pronouncing
Balzac ``an inarticulate Shakespeare.'')
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's aim was to chronicle what he famously termed ``La
Comedie Humaine,'' and to this task he brought a superlative
storytelling ability, a wicked sense of humor and a gift for
sensitive character depiction, as well as a great deal of
compassion for human beings in all their imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   Although this ``galley slave to pen and ink,'' as Balzac
described himself, was also called a ``Napoleon of letters'' and
has consistently been seen as a great writer, he has not been read
widely in recent years. And except for a ``Masterpiece Theater''
production of ``Cousin Bette'' in the late 1970s and the 1994 movie
``Colonel Chabert,'' starring Gerard Depardieu, his work hasn't
been mined much by filmmakers, a fact that Balzac scholars explain
in part by pointing to a mistaken notion that the many parts of
``La Comedie Humaine'' need to be regarded as an interrelated
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, movie makers are landing on Planet Balzac.
Friday, two films, representing two extremes of his oeuvre, are
opening.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Passion in the Desert,'' an impressionistic allegory
that has been adapted by American director Lavinia Currier for her
first feature from a short story of 1830. The other is a new
adaptation of ``Cousin Bette,'' the sprawling 1847 drama of manners
that is one of Balzac's best-known novels; this movie is the first
to be directed by Tony-winning theater director Des McAnuff (``Big
River,'' ``The Who's `Tommy''').
</P>
<P>
   ``Balzac is a great source of stories for the cinema,'' said
McAnuff. ``Maybe we're just arriving at him now because it required
other astronauts going ahead with other great literary works to get
us here.''
</P>
<P>
   From the scholarly camp, Graham Robb, a British writer whose
Balzac biography was published to acclaim in 1994, put it this way:
``Maybe the movie makers have just run out of Jane Austens and
Henry Jameses. In Britain, publishers are saying people are reading
19th-century novels again, and 19th-century novels are a small
pool. Balzac, sooner or later, was bound to be rediscovered. In
this matter, one evokes chaos theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In its original form, ``Passion in the Desert'' is a story
within a story within a story. In 1798, Napoleon failed to strike
further at the British when he sent his troops into Egypt. In the
aftermath of that campaign, he had wild animals sent back from
Africa to Paris. They eventually formed the core of a zoo at the
Jardin des Plantes, but first these exotic creatures were in a
circus started by one M. Martin. The acts involving lions
especially caused a stir, and it was rumored that M. Martin was
able to hypnotize the animals and that he even had sex with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balzac story, a couple leaves M. Martin's circus with the
woman expressing disbelief at the spectacle. The man with her
argues that it is quite possible to tame wild animals, and he
proceeds to tell her a story that he heard from a soldier recently
returned from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier had been captured by Arabs, then had escaped and
lived in bliss under a date palm tree with a female leopard as his
companion. Their idyll had ended when, in a misunderstanding, the
leopard attacked him, forcing the soldier to kill her in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Currier's ``Passion,'' starring British actor Ben Daniels
and a leopard named Mowgli, the year is still 1798, but Paris and
the circus have been excised. The action begins as a regiment of
French soldiers, including a young captain named Augustin Robert
(Daniels), escort the artist Jean-Michel Venture de Paradis (played
by French actor Michel Piccoli in a gripping cameo) across the
Sahara. Venture has been commissioned by Napoleon to make a visual
record of Egypt's monuments and landscapes, as well as of the
soldiers in battle. The captain and the artist are separated from
the rest of the regiment after a skirmish with Mameluke warriors,
and are thrown off course by a sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin decides they must separate so that he, on horseback,
can seek help more quickly. But soon his horse dies, and he wanders
alone until he comes upon the ruins of an ancient city. There it
turns out that he is sharing digs with a leopard, and a sort of
romantic relationship ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the viewer is drawn slowly, almost hypnotically into
the otherworldliness and general delirium of the desert _ and into
the world of a dangerous animal. Ms. Currier's movie, which was
filmed in Jordan and Utah, becomes a lyrical but virtually wordless
meditation on man's capacity for transformation.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the farthest cry from ``Cousin Bette,'' a ``Bonfire
of the Vanities''-like account that takes place between 1838 and
1846 in Paris. At its center is Bette Fischer, a bitter, homely
seamstress and poor relation to the aristocratic Hulot family who
is bent on vengeance for the way she has been treated. Turning on
issues of class, financial power and sex, the story feels highly
contemporary in tone.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``Cousin Bette'' stars Jessica Lange as Bette; Hugh
Laurie as the bankrupt, philandering Hulot; Bob Hoskins as Crevel,
Hulot's chief rival, and Elisabeth Shue as Jenny Cadine, a
dance-hall performer and mistress to Hulot and Crevel who helps
Bette bring about their ruination. Geraldine Chaplin makes a brief
appearance as Hulot's long-suffering wife, Adeline.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Currier needed to invent whole strains of narrative to
fill out a Balzac story, Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr, the
scriptwriters for ``Cousin Bette,'' had to find ways to contract a
Balzac saga. Toward this end, they lopped off plot lines and
characters too numerous to mention. ``You could write five more
movies based on `Cousin Bette,' and each one would be completely
different,'' said Ms. Siefert.

     INTERNET GOSSIP TAKES ON REAL JOURNALISTS AT
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB
 &HT;     By BOB DART 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Matt Drudge, the controversial cyberspace scoop
snoop, defended his Internet dishing Tuesday against charges of
heresy from the pious practitioners of mainstream journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is a hunger for unedited information,'' the
publisher of the Drudge Report (http://www.drudgereport.com) told
members of the National Press Club at a luncheon featuring more
hostility than hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering an era vibrating with the din of small voices.
Every citizen can be a reporter, can take on the powers that be,''
said Drudge. He boasted that the Drudge Report was visited 6
million times by computer users last month. ``The Net gives as much
voice to a ... computer geek like me as to a CEO or speaker of the
House. We all become equal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Drudge has been credited with breaking some big stories _
most notably that Newsweek had spiked the initial blockbuster about
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky _ he has also been attacked
for posting rumors and gossip amid the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Some Press Club members had voiced displeasure at Drudge's
invitation to speak, and that was reflected in his acidic
introduction by President Doug Harbrecht, Washington editor of
Business Week magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drudge's methods are suspect in the eyes of most
journalists,'' Harbrecht said. ``Like a channel catfish, he mucks
through the hoaxes, conspiracies and half-truths posted online in
pursuit of fodder for his Web site. That can have unpleasant
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Drudge is facing a libel suit from White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Harbrecht conceded, however, that Drudge ``is on the cutting
edge of a revolution in our business and everyone in our business
knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge's own reporting makes up only a small part of his Web
site. Mostly, the Drudge Report provides hyperlinks to wire
services, columnists, newspapers and other information sources. He
reports mostly on movies, TV, the news media and political
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge said he still works out of a $600-a-month apartment in
Hollywood _ ``and I do mean Hollywood, not Beverly Hills, not the
Palisades, no 90210 for this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a Maryland suburb of the nation's capital and
moved to California after high school. Drudge had no formal
training in journalism. He worked in a CBS gift shop and found that
he could pick up inside information by eavesdropping on executives'
conversations and digging through office trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   After his father bought him a computer, Drudge began to post his
gleanings on an Internet site. Over several years, visitors to his
site grew from three or four buddies to millions of online fans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge said he has yet to make a penny from his Web site, which
is free and carries no advertising. However, he said he has sold a
column to some publications and has a TV show in the works.
</P>
<P>
   At the Press Club, questions for Drudge were mostly harsh. Asked
how much of his report he makes up, he replied none _ and
admonished the audience for not being tough on Clinton at White
House press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The line between gossip and news is sometimes hazy, Drudge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All truths begin as hearsay, as far as I'm concerned. And some
of the best news stories start in gossip,'' he said. ``At what
point does it become news?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real journalists pride themselves on getting it first and
right,'' Harbrecht said. Drudge responded with a list of major
newspapers, magazines and network newscasts that had settled libel
cases, admitted that reporters had made up stories or had retracted
news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He protested that ``a lot of the stuff I do is serious stuff.
... Not everything I do is gossip or bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Harbrecht gave Drudge a book titled ``Reliable
Sources,'' and thanked him ``for coming to the lion's den.''

 UNDATED: Ms. Siefert.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The process of bringing ``Passion in the Desert'' to the screen
began 10 years ago when Virginia Warner, one of Ms. Currier's
cousins, ``put a little-known and very atypical story by Balzac
into my hands,'' the 40-year-old filmmaker said recently.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ms. Currier, who had majored in comparative
religion at Harvard University and then pursued an acting career in
France, had directed only one 50-minute film for television,
``Heart of the Garden.'' She conceived ``a 30-minute dreamlike film
of this encounter between a man and a leopard _ I saw it as a dance
or a completely silent film.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work. Neither did an effort to bring the story into
contemporary times. Later, she took another stab, going back to the
text and trying to expand it in a way that would be true to Balzac.
The version that eventually became the film, produced by Fine Line,
was completed with help from a friend and poet, Martin Edmunds.
</P>
<P>
   Like her counterparts on ``Cousin Bette,'' Ms. Currier engaged
in copious research. In this she was assisted by her grandmother
Evangeline Bruce, whose husband, David, was at various times
American Ambassador to France, Britain and China, and who had spent
years writing the historical opus ``Napoleon and Josephine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her all the time to ask her questions,'' Ms. Currier
said. ``She had such a palpable sense of the period.'' (The film is
dedicated to Mrs. Bruce, who died two years ago. Ms. Currier's
lineage is illustrious on her father's side as well. She is
descended from the Currier of Currier &AMP; Ives.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Currier ended up taking liberties with Balzac's
story, she was a stickler for authenticity when it came to the
leopard. In preparation for the filming, animal trainers begged her
to use a tiger or a lion instead, because they are more social
animals. ``They told me a leopard is the most dangerous,
idiosyncratic and unmanageable of the great cats,'' she recalled.
But she dug in her heels. ``I thought only a leopard, so
individualistic an animal, would be weird enough to take up with a
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Her refusal to compromise had its price. The final script
morphed again and again to accommodate the demands of the leopard.
After initially battling heavy rains and sleet in the Jordanian
desert, the cast and crew returned in a drier season only to find
problematically high temperatures. The leopard didn't like the heat
and plainly didn't want to work. And the leopard trainer, who had
carefully advised Ms. Currier during the writing of the script as
to what the leopard could and could not be expected to do, had to
reassess the situation as the leopard turned moody.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Currier confessed, the battle scenes and the
part of the film that deals with the artist ``got bigger and
bigger, and the part with the leopard got somewhat smaller.'' And
it became necessary to pack off to the more manageable desert in
Utah to complete many of the scenes with the leopard.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, Ms. Currier and the camera crew were in a
duvetyn-covered cage, for their protection and so the leopard
wrangler could have the animal's full attention. It was, of course,
Daniels who was at the greatest risk. ``The leopard was
terrifying,'' recalled the actor, who has just starred on the
London stage in the Pirandello play ``Naked'' with Juliette
Binoche. ``I got chewed and scratched and bitten. When the cat
would go along with the scene as scripted, I knew she wasn't
concentrating on her role. She was thinking, `So, how can I eat
this person I'm playing with?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he accept the role? ``It was one of the most
extraordinary things I had ever read, and I couldn't resist it,''
he said. ``Also, when do you ever get a buzz like that from doing
an acting job? My fear threshold is about 100 times higher than it
was when I began.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Balzac called Bette ``une vraie sauvage'' (a true
savage), neither she nor her rich and ridiculous relations provided
anything like the filmmaking challenge that the leopard did. But
wrestling ``Cousin Bette'' into a screenplay was traumatic in it
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seifert and Ms. Tarr decided to write a script together in
1991, and Ms. Siefert eventually hit upon ``Cousin Bette.'' Ms.
Tarr said they were both impressed by ``its accessibility and
wit,'' and because it was originally written to be published in
serial form, it had a ``sense of moving quickly,'' she said. The
two women studied Balzac, outlined the novel and finished the
script on July 14 _ Bastille Day _ in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By that fall, Fox Searchlight had decided to support the film,
but the troubles were just beginning. ``We had been very faithful
to the novel in the first draft,'' Ms. Siefert recalled, ``but when
we started working with directors, it started to take another
twist. We were being asked to hack away at the characters or to
create composite characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarr added: ``The richness of detail and digressions are so
amazing, and much of this had to be eliminated. Our script
decisions involved sacrificing delightful characters and
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Menaul, who was expected to be the director, made the
strong suggestion that Adeline Hulot, a main character in the
novel, be dropped. The writers were mortified, but the studio
agreed. Although thrilled when a new director, McAnuff, was brought
in, there was no chance to resuscitate Adeline fully. McAnuff did,
however, see fit to give Adeline a deathbed scene at the start of
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Tarr sounds like a remorseful murderer when she
describes what happened. ``We literally killed Adeline,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the reduced number of characters, it was tricky to
maintain control of the story. ``A normal film follows four or five
characters,'' said McAnuff. ``We're really following eight. That
required lots of structural shenanigans.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is, by turns, a comedic and dramatic romp that has
narrative and visual richness and an immediacy not often seen in
period films. And it feels very much in the spirit of Balzac.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, the women are working on adapting
another Balzac novel, which they decline to name. And McAnuff said,
``Even with all the struggle, I would eagerly do Balzac again.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Currier is leaving Balzac behind, teaming up
with her friend Maura Moynihan to write the script of a ``caper
comedy'' that Ms. Currier will direct. Not that she plans to keep
it simple: the story takes place in Katmandu, Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Will the two films opening Friday have Balzac spinning in his
grave?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that he would expect us to adapt because he
was a very practical writer, and a real professional,'' said
McAnuff. ``I like to think he would have expected us to refocus the
narrative structure to make it work cinematically. But happily,
I'll never get the phone call if he didn't like the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Balzac would probably be pleased to be back in the
spotlight. ``Fame,'' he once wrote, ``is the sun of the dead.''

FIRST LADY HONORS WOMEN WHO HAVE IMPROVED CHILD CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling child care the uppermost concern for
working mothers, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton honored eight
women Wednesday for their work to improve the quality of child
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reinstill a sense of urgency in Americans,''
Clinton said. ``Commitment to child care is not only good for
children and family but good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more than half of the women in the work force are
mothers, and half of all mothers with children under the age of one
are working outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady warned against making child care a partisan
issue, mentioning the White House child-care initiative launched in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about taking care of Democratic or
Republican or independent children,'' Clinton said. ``We're talking
about taking care of American children.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady presented Redbook magazine's ``Mother and Shakers
of 1998'' awards to the women. Redbook is published by Hearst
Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Kate White, Redbook editor in chief, said the women were honored
in the magazine's June issue because they have ``fought
passionately for kids and families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of child care as a national issue is a direct
result of efforts by women, such as the ones we have recognized,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those honored were Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and talk
show host Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was honored for sponsoring every major child-care bill
since being elected to the Senate six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was recognized for her New York-based fund-raising
organization, For All Kids Foundation, which has distributed more
than $1.5 million to 105 child-related charities. The foundation
was founded in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The other award recipients were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Beth Phillips, a San Francisco mother whose infant
daughter was blinded after being shaken by her baby sitter, was
honored for launching Trustline, a state-certifying service that
checks for possible criminal or child-abuse background of
caregivers. Since the program's inception in 1989, Trustline has
reviewed nearly 33,000 potential caregivers, weeding about 2,500
potential caregivers who had criminal records, some including
murder and sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   _ Harriet Transgucci, of Summit, N.J, was awarded for
jump-starting an emergency child-care fund at the Summer Child Care
Centers in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elaine Fersh, a Boston mother, was honored for the work her
group, Parents United for Child Care, has done in her city. Parents
United has helped school boards implement all-day kindergarten and
has developed after-school programs for children whose parents work
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elissa Bassler, a public policy director at the Day Care
Action Council of Illinois in Chicago, was awarded for persuading
the Illinois Legislature to allocate $100 million for child care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yvonne Edwards, a child-care coordinator for Monterey County,
Calif., was honored for leading the effort to create a child care
and women's health care center for county workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Mason of Cambridge, Mass., was honored for creating
Bright Horizon Child Centers, on-site centers for corporations such
as Mattel, IBM, Apple Computer, Motorola and AT&AMP;T. There are about
160 Bright Horizon centers around the country serving more than
14,000 children.

HINGIS BOUNCES WILLIAMS FROM THE FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Venus Williams, the Williams sister favored to give
top-seeded Martina Hingis true trouble in her attempt to monopolize
a fourth consecutive Grand Slam, instead submitted, 6-3, 6-4, on
Tuesday in the quarterfinals of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave her least impressive performance in five meetings
with her fellow 17-year-old this year. She was so jittery in the
center-court spotlight that her beaded headdress shivered and
quivered even when she wasn't in perpetual motion trying to chase
down the backhands Hingis used to leverage their match in her own
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The rain clouds came and went, but the plot definitely thickened
in Paris, where the swirling clay got in everybody's eyes and tears
got in the eyes of several losers, none of whom could quite believe
their French Open experience was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean firebrand Marcelo Rios, the favorite to make his
Grand Slam breakthrough at Roland Garros, wore an angry grimace on
his unshaven mug after letting himself be tripped up, 6-1, 2-6,
6-2, 6-4 by Spain's Carlos Moya. It was a misstep that cost the
third-seeded Rios his chance to pocket Pete Sampras' No. 1 ranking
for a second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams walked forlornly from the court, she appeared on
the verge of bawling like a baby; but, remembering her
self-proclaimed status as the lady-in-waiting most likely to
dethrone the deservedly smug No. 1, she kept her cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude,'' was the odd and only word the chastened Williams chose
to mouth in the direction of her stonefaced mother-coach, Brandi,
as she passed by the friends' box. According to Williams, she and
her mother huddled for an unforgiving post-mortem on the
1-hour-22-minute match right after she soared a final backhand
blooper out of bounds on the second match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old for petting; I just need the truth,'' said
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made too many errors, definitely; that has to do with
mechanics, and I assure you those things will be corrected,'' vowed
the teen-ager, who had just two aces, plopped out two double faults
to trail 3-4 in the second set, and made a sorry total of 38
unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was struggling too much to hold serve, and generally
that's a sign that you're going to break down,'' said Williams, who
was so tight from the service line that she once spewed both her
racquet and the ball into the net in the course of being broken in
the second game of the opening set.
</P>
<P>
   But the day provoked a relieved smile, not a mechanical or
emotional breakdown, from the three-time champion Monica Seles, the
sentimental favorite, who wore the wedding ring of her recently
deceased father-coach, Karolj, on a chain around her neck like a
talisman when she flew into Paris just a week after he succumbed to
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain whether she would have the intestinal fortitude to
smash a single practice ball, much less pulverize an actual
opponent, Seles has been on automatic pilot at this Slam, her focus
unwavering, her grunt going full throttle, her mind on her business
and not her grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of him every day, but for me, it's a tennis match,
it's a tennis tournament, and I'm here because I want to win it,
that's kind of my take on it,'' Seles said after pounding her way
past third-seeded Jana Novotna with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 comeback that
even the wet-eyed loser found ennobling. When the two met at the
net after Novotna drifted a backhand wide of the sideline on the
second match point, Novotna told Seles she hoped she would carry on
and win this event.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, the sixth-seeded Seles first has to get past
a semifinal match with the ultra-confident Hingis. The Swiss
teen-ager leads their rivalry by 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina is the No. 1 player, so you know what she's going to
give you,'' said Seles. ``You have to play the best tennis at the
moment that you can, and that's what I'll have to do on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other women's semifinal, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport,
who dethroned last year's French Open champion, Iva Majoli, 6-1,
5-7, 6-3, will take a 2-6 record against fourth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario. The Spaniard, twice a champion here, reached the
semifinals with a 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 6-0 dismissal of Switzerland's
other teen-age wonder-girl, Patty Schnyder.
</P>
<P>
   The upset of Rios by the 12th-seeded Moya, who cut his Grand
Slam teeth the same way Rios did, by a reaching an Australian Open
final, deprived the men's draw of the only representative from the
top 10 to survive until the quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
   It also ended the 14-match clay-court winning streak Rios
assembled this spring by claiming titles at Rome and Austria,
distinguishing himself as the only man to win two clay titles in
1998 and the clear man to beat at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rios was disturbed by a call that led to his dropping
serve to trail 4-5 in the final set _ he thought a ball bounced
twice on Moya's side of the net and so missed a play on an easy
volley _ he admitted that he didn't play with vintage Rios
aggression Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing the first set, 6-1, that killed me a little bit,'' said
Rios. ``I started recovering a little bit, but he played a great
match and deserved to win today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other men's quarterfinal, Austria's Thomas Muster, who
won his only Slam title here in 1995, was ousted, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6,
6-3 by a fake blond with a fine forehand, Spain's 15th-seeded Felix
Mantilla.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Last year's French Open men's champion, Gustavo Kuerten, who
made an affable enough exit in the second round of singles, where
he fell to Russia's 18-year-old Marat Sade, was thrown out of his
doubles quarterfinal Tuesday evening after he got into a squabble
with head umpire Bruno Rebeuh and hurled his racquet toward the
official.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gilbert Ysern, the tournament referee, the
infraction took place just after Kuerten and his Brazilian
teammate, Fernando Meligeni, had dropped the first set tie breaker
to Patrick Rafter and Jonas Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kuerten was just unhappy with one call and lost his mind a
little bit,'' said Ysern. ``He threw his racquet very hard and very
fast and unfortunately it nearly hit the umpire and landed in the
crowd. It was a clear default situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebeuh is the same umpire who disqualified Jeff Tarango from
Wimbledon three years ago, an affront that caused the player's
wife, Benedicte, to direct a pair of slaps to the umpire's face,
but Ysern said there was no bad blood between Kuerten and the
official.
</P>
<P>
   Rebeuh was in the chair here last year when Kuerten won his
first and only Slam. Bjorkman said that Kuerten, one of the more
congenial players on the tour, was in tears and inconsolable in the
locker room after the incident. Besides being disqualified, Kuerten
will forfeit his French Open earnings, approximately $40,000, but
Ysern did not indicate that any further action would be taken
against the Brazilian. &QL;

   The last Washington to New York shuttle of the day was
two-thirds empty. Near the back sat Robert F. Kennedy, tears
welling up in his eyes, as the folk musician Phil Ochs, a fellow
passenger, sang ``Crucifixion.'' (``Who would want to hurt such a
hero of the game?/ But you know, I predicted it. I knew he had to
fall/ ... Do you have a picture of the pain?'') It had just dawned
on Kennedy, says the former aide who is telling the story, that the
song was about his brother.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel's three-hour special ``Robert F. Kennedy:
A Memoir'' (beginning Sunday night at 8), based on Jack Newfield's
1969 book, is about politics, of course. It's about the Senate
racket hearings, the civil rights movement, presidential campaigns,
power plays and the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But the personal side of Kennedy, who was assassinated in Los
Angeles 30 years ago (June 5, 1968), comes across with just as much
impact.
</P>
<P>
   William Haddad, who was on that plane beside Kennedy, tells the
Phil Ochs story. Robert Morgenthau describes having clam chowder
and tuna sandwiches with Kennedy by the pool at Hickory Hill,
Kennedy's McLean, Va., home, on Nov. 22, 1963, when the telephone
call came from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   William Vanden Heuvel tells of Kennedy, after late work nights,
stopping by Arlington National Cemetery and climbing the fence to
kneel at President Kennedy's grave and pray. George McGovern starts
out smiling as he recounts reactions to Kennedy's taking his dog
along on a campaign trip to South Dakota, but ends up moved to
tears, because that was the last time he ever saw Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's daughters tell of spending time at their father's
office when they were small. They read letters from him, one
written on the day the first black students were enrolled at the
University of Alabama, another written shortly after John F.
Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by a Columbia University student about his motives in
running for the Senate, Kennedy explains his desire to serve. ``I
don't need the money, and I don't need the office space,'' he
begins, winning his audience over.
</P>
<P>
   To young voters demanding his position on penalties for draft
evasion, he quotes Camus. And before an Indianapolis crowd to whom
he has just announced the news of Martin Luther King's death, he
speaks of ``pain which cannot forget'' and ``wisdom through the
awful grace of God.'' It has been a long time since a politician
quoted Aeschylus to us.

NEW BERLIN'S NEW OFFICIAL ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 7.) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL Z. WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The city that Hitler adorned with muscle-bound statues by Arno
Breker and where East German Communists plastered images of Marxist
stalwarts is set to get a mammoth new load of officially sanctioned
art. For Berlin's latest incarnation as Germany's capital, the
federal government plans to order more than $33 million of freshly
painted Neo-Expressionist canvases, cerebral conceptual
installations, neon sculpture, and perhaps even earthworks
</P>
<P>
   This one-shot public-art spending spree appears unrivaled in
modern times and is all the more remarkable for its coming amid a
general retrenchment in German government support for the arts. By
contrast, it has taken the U.S. government 35 years to spend the
same amount on artworks for public buildings across the United
States ``They're determined to bring the glory of Germany back and
bring it to Berlin,'' said Robert Storr, a curator at the Museum of
Modern Art, in New York. ``This is about the creation of an
official national art and a recognition that if you're going to
have a proud national culture, you're going to have to go to the
avant-garde to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will the official art of the new Berlin forgo the
conventional works that have historically prevailed in this
once-divided metropolis; it will also be resolutely international
for reasons that are as much political as esthetic. While the U.S.
government art-in-architecture program commissions only living
American artists for its federal buildings, Germany is taking pains
to include outsiders. Among Americans receiving Berlin commissions
are Ellsworth Kelly, Jenny Holzer and Joseph Kosuth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has met with the sculptor
Richard Serra and the architect Peter Eisenman, both New Yorkers,
to discuss their joint proposal for a German national memorial to
Jewish Holocaust victims. The design, consisting of 4,000 concrete
slabs arrayed like a vast burial ground, is one of four schemes
short-listed in a state-sponsored competition. The government and a
private group are expected to decide in the coming weeks which
design will be built on a site south of the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial plans are not without opponents. Several
intellectuals have objected that none of the submissions will
create a suitable place to commemorate the horrors and iniquities
perpetrated from Berlin. And Mayor Eberhard Diepgen of Berlin has
challenged the project altogether, asking whether any memorial
design is capable of conveying the terror of the Holocaust to
future generations.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy has not shaken many Germans from their
belief that state-sponsored art, particularly in the revived
capital, can be therapeutic as they continue to wrestle with their
difficult history.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, moving from Bonn to Berlin by the year
2000, has asked more than 140 artists from around the world to
propose pieces for the new chancellery, the president's office, the
Reichstag and a new set of parliamentary office buildings. Works
are also being commissioned for more than a dozen ministries and
agencies moving into renovated structures dating from the Prussian
monarchy, the Wilhelmine empire, the Nazi era and East-bloc
communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   By injecting the capital with such an overwhelming dose of new
art, the German authorities seek to proclaim that although they are
returning to well-trodden, bloodied ground, Berlin's refurbishment
represents a fresh beginning. ``Using the art of today is a way of
making the Reichstag our own,'' said Peter Conradi, a Social
Democrat in the national legislature, the Bundestag. ``We're not
moving into a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The new art, said Klaus Bussmann, head of the federal government
Art Advisory Board, ``should also be a signal within Germany itself
that the state is not withdrawing its responsibility for art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong tendency at the moment to leave it up to
private investors,'' Bussmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's bellicose past makes politicians wary of relying
heavily on historic artworks to furnish their offices. Kohl, for
example, would prefer to hang paintings by Caspar David Friedrich,
Albrecht Durer, Max Liebermann, and Lovis Corinth in the chief
executive's quarters rather than new art, said Axel Schultes, the
chancellery architect. ``That would of course be the preference of
the politicians,'' said Schultes, ``but they don't have the
confidence to do it. An American president can say, without
eliciting any suspicion, `Here I'd like to have a painting of
Washington crossing the Delaware.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so with politicians wanting to avoid sending a wrong signal
with too much art from yesteryear, modern works by established and
cutting-edge artists will prevail. Kelly is working on a $1-million
mural for the main facade and an exterior side of a Bundestag
office building. The work will consist of six colored-aluminum
panels, each averaging 225 square feet. ``They are the largest
panels I've ever done,'' Kelly said. ``My being chosen means that
the Germans are looking forward. In the 17th century, Rubens did
big paintings in the Louvre for Marie de Medicis and that was a
wonderful thing to do. Artists are always looking for opportunities
to do public art.'' Kelly's project is one of several direct
commissions already approved.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundestag, scheduled to move into the renovated Reichstag
next year, expressly wants representatives of the Allied victors of
World War II to have a hand in overhauling the building. Erected
more than a century ago as the imperial parliament, the Reichstag
came to embody fascist terror in 1933, when Hitler used a fire
inside the building as a pretext to impose emergency rule. The
architect in charge of the renovation is Sir Norman Foster, a
Briton. The plans call for works by Holzer and Christian Boltanski
of France as well as by the German painters Sigmar Polke, Gerhard
Richter, and Georg Baselitz. The Bundestag is also negotiating with
the conceptual artist Ilya Kabakov, a former Soviet citizen, to
join the project.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Breker statues that stood in and outside Hitler's
chancellery, much of the art envisioned for today's Berlin carries
a distinct element of propaganda. The Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan
has drawn up a series of glass panels to be erected along the River
Spree and inscribed with Germany's Basic Law, which was drafted in
1949 to guide the post-totalitarian democracy. Astrid Klein, an
artist from Cologne, will illuminate one parliamentary office
building with neon text from ``Leviathan,'' Thomas Hobbes' critique
of power.
</P>
<P>
   At the monumental north entry to the Reichstag, Holzer, also
using language as her medium, plans to deploy quotations from
addresses given there by Hitler and other German politicians. She
is consulting with historians to select hortatory excerpts from
``the most terrible and the better speeches,'' she said. The
project will take the form of a four-sided, floor-to-ceiling sign
column with light-emitting diodes spelling out sometimes
contradictory statements about war and peace. ``It's a daunting
project,'' Holzer said. ``I went to bed with a headache twice after
my first site visits.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that Berlin once inflicted great pain on the world, the
Art Advisory Board is encouraging artists to plumb the depths as
well as the heights of German identity and history. ``A critical
dialogue is particularly imperative in the burdened buildings of
the Third Reich,'' the board guidelines state. ``This involves not
just coming up with superficial countermeasures but an intelligent
and contemporary esthetic response to the pre-existing situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hermann Goering's former Aviation Ministry, a thrusting,
stone-clad complex completed in 1936 and now being converted into
the Finance Ministry, another New York artist, Dan Graham, is being
invited to create a sculpture for the rear garden. Tadashi Kawamata
of Japan and Piet Trantel, a German creator of earthworks, are
being asked to submit proposals for refurbishing a drab inner court
once used by the Luftwaffe for military exercises. Six German
painters, including Markus Lupertz, A.R. Penck, and Jorg Immendorf,
will vie for a commission for the entry staircase, previously
decorated with a fierce eagle atop a swastika. ``This building
demands esthetic interventions that make clear the ambivalence of
the place,'' the board's guidelines say.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the former Ministry of Popular Enlightenment
and Propaganda, from which Joseph Goebbels delivered anti-Semitic
diatribes, is being transformed into the Labor Ministry. There the
government wants the French sculptor Daniel Buren to help alleviate
the severity of the building's interior courtyard. In Paris,
Buren's addition of truncated candy-striped columns to the majestic
court of the Palais Royal was decried as an act of desecration;
amid Berlin's grim fascist-era architecture, however, a bold
intervention by the artist will more likely be greeted with a sigh
of relief.
</P>
<P>
   But plans for the former Nazi Reichsbank, soon to become unified
Germany's Foreign Ministry, have provoked unease. The architect
Hans Kollhoff is working with Gerhard Merz, Germany's
representative at last year's Venice Biennale, to add color to
walls, floors and ceilings in an effort to give the solemn building
a freshness and visual unity. To some Germans, though, Merz was a
thorny choice because of his predilection for classical forms and
his coy use of fascist symbols in some of his mausoleumlike art
installations.
</P>
<P>
   One critic, Hans-Ernst Mittig, a Berlin specialist in Nazi
architecture, says Merz's installations call into question
Germany's postwar anti-fascist stance. ``Works like those of Merz
perpetuate, elevate and certify the practice of superficial and
indecisive discourse about National Socialism,'' Mittig has
written. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based German artist Hans Haacke also assailed
Merz's role. ``If one is dealing with a building that is heavily
fraught with history,'' he said, ``it is irresponsible to overlook
that history.'' The design of the Reichsbank, a sandstone colossus
of 1,000 rooms, was personally selected by Hitler. Its vaults, used
under the Nazis to store plunder from Holocaust victims, are being
turned into the Foreign Ministry archives.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the Reichsbank's imposing main foyer has also
aroused concern among some art-board members. Merz wants to install
a cobalt-blue ceiling ringed at the cornice line by 1,200 neon
tubes and retain the original floor of highly polished red
porphyry, a combination that board members fear will reinforce the
building's chilly aura and create an uncomfortable space in which
to greet foreign dignitaries and put them at ease about the new
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The board therefore wants overtly politicized artists like
Haacke, Hanne Darboven, Frieder Schnock and Renata Stih to attempt
a more critical confrontation with the architecture. ``Merz has a
severity that could be misunderstood,'' said Bussmann, the board
chief. Merz brushes aside the criticism, calling his work ``beyond
any ideology, enlightened, cold, uninvolved with life, only pure
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Other artists, like Gerhard Richter, who examine the Nazi legacy
and sensitive postwar political issues, can be counted on to stir
strong emotions in Berlin. Richter's work often explores painful
aspects of the national past that some of his countrymen would
prefer to forget. One of the most provocative contemporary German
works ever produced _ Richter's series of 15 paintings based on the
unresolved 1977 prison deaths of Baader-Meinhof terrorist group
members _ was bought by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in
1995. It's doubtful that Germany would hang portraits of
terrorists, dead or alive, on official premises, and by awarding
commissions to artists like Richter, the politicians could well
find their capital-art initiative reaping an unwelcome harvest.
``I'm not certain whether very critical works will obtain majority
support within the ministries or the cabinet,'' Bussmann said.
``I'm very curious. It's an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of artists who worked for the defunct East German
regime has already sparked protest. Fifty-eight artists, dealers
and critics signed a petition condemning the invitation to Bernhard
Heisig, a Neo-Expressionist and veteran Communist, to submit a work
for the Reichstag. But the Bundestag has stood by Heisig's
participation.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the General Services Administration has
subjected public art projects to extensive citizens' review since
1989, when Richard Serra's ``Tilted Arc,'' a sculpture that threw a
120-foot-long steel barrier across Federal Plaza in lower
Manhattan, was removed. The German authorities appear less
concerned about a populist backlash against difficult artworks.
Rita Sussmuth, the Bundestag president, has argued that ``precisely
in a democracy, it's essential to have selection criteria other
than mere acceptability to public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for critical opinion, the esthetic merit of the huge
quantities of art that will soon be strewn in the German public's
path remains to be judged. But even many of those behind the
project temper their support with a note of caution. For all
Germany's expense and effort, Bussmann conceded, ``It will be a
miracle if a few good works come out of it.'' &QL;

 `THE SEAGULL': A CHEKHOV ROMANCE TO STYMIE WOMEN OF THE '90s  
 (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ True to the content of ``The Sea Gull,'' which begins
with the presentation of an amateurish backyard play, the Blue
Light Theater Company's production of Chekhov's tragicomedy of
thwarted ambition has the feel of something slapped together for a
few supportive friends.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery, a stand of birch trees with shiny plastic leaves,
flanked on one side by an incongruous series of paneled walls,
offers a country house with such an incoherent layout it's a wonder
the owners didn't sack the architects. The desultory props and
furnishings fuel suspicions, not aroused by the script, that the
whole lot has been unloaded on Madame Arkadina and her brother by
their wily caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences will overlook a production's physical decrepitude if
it is merely a shabby overcoat that envelops an array of
immaculately turned out performances.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Austin Pendleton's entirely sub-par production exposes
none of the exquisite pathos in the clashes of ego and crushing of
hopes in Chekhov's sad tale. Pendleton's version, which lumbers
along for two and a half intermissionless hours, also labors under
some misguided casting and directorial choices, like the moment
when the aging Arkadina (Maria Tucci) decides the only way she'll
keep Trigorin (Mark Blum) is by mounting him.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Sea Gull'' is not always so crude. Most of the time, in
fact, it's as mild (and about as Russian) as American cheese. Jeff
Cohen, in retrospect, had an interesting concept last winter with
his modern adaptation of the play, set in the Hamptons. At least
there the actors, encouraged to find clarity in more familiar
surroundings, made sense of Chekhov's characters, set in their
unhappy ways.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton, however, finds nothing in ``The Sea Gull'' to give
the play emotional depth or a coherent wholeness, and the staging
consists mostly of actors lined up or milling about.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Phillips' Nina conveys little of the tragic bearing of the
girl who leaves town as a starry-eyed naief and returns a shattered
outcast; Blum, as the self-infatuated pulp writer who uses and
discards her, plays Trigorin as a rumpled schlep who would have a
hard time getting to class, let alone the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Naughton's male model of a Konstantin _ why Nina would
reject him in favor of Trigorin is the sort of imponderable that
would give Ally McBeal nightmares _ comes across as sincere but
utterly dull. Joe Ponazecki's ineffectual Dorn practically
evaporates before our eyes, and Ms. Tucci, as Chekhov's horror show
of a mother, gets the character's self-absorption but none of her
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The director mutes the play's symbolism to the point of
irrelevance. When Naughton arrives onstage with the dead sea gull,
he tosses it matter-of-factly at the feet of Ms. Phillips, who
reacts as if he's taken off a pair of smelly old shoes. Naughton
says he shot the bird, but it wouldn't be surprising to learn the
poor thing had committed suicide.

`TALLEY &AMP; SON': DESPERATELY SEEKING ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes Timmy Talley a few minutes to realize he's
dead. It is July 4, 1944, and he is standing alone, wearing
fatigues and a helmet, in an old-fashioned Midwestern living room.
He has just been killed, thousands of miles away in the Pacific,
and only his spirit has come home.
</P>
<P>
   As Timmy (Tim Deak), who is invisible to his family, observes
them over the two acts of ``Talley &AMP; Son,'' he also realizes that
this is no bittersweet ``Our Town'' flashback to the joys of being
alive. Just about everybody in the Talley family is in desperate
need of attention, and almost nobody is getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talley &AMP; Son,'' the last in the trilogy of Lanford Wilson's
dramas about the family, was not particularly well received when it
opened in 1985. Critics compared it with its predecessors ``The
Fifth of July'' (1978) and ``Talley's Folly'' (1979) and found it
wanting. But regarded alone, it stands as an intelligent reflection
on unhappiness and waning morality, and in the Jean Cocteau
Repertory production at the Bouwerie Lane Theater through June 14,
the audience is in the hands of pros.
</P>
<P>
   The family patriarch (Craig Smith), who is expected to die at
any moment, alternates between likable senility and periods of
coherence when he is completely in charge. His son, Eldon (Harris
Berlinsky), is undecided about selling the family manufacturing
business (which is making a wartime bundle manufacturing fatigues)
to a big corporation. And he's further troubled by a young woman
(Christine Hall) who turns up in shorts and a halter top claiming
that he is her father.
</P>
<P>
   Eldon's wife, Netta (Tracey Atkins), is a vision of period
domesticity in a polka-dot dress and apron, like an ad from a 1940s
copy of House and Garden come to life. Ms. Atkins exudes a ladylike
repression which helps make her seem authentically of her time.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Act I, when the Talleys' friend, Harley Campbell
(Charles Parnell), delivers the telegram announcing Timmy's death,
Netta faints. At the beginning of Act II, she insists that she
didn't, that she had thought there was a chair behind her. ``He's
taking this very hard,'' she says of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Eldon seems worthy of sympathy when he responds: ``How are we
supposed to take this? How do people take it?'' But then he
mentions that what really matters is whether Timmy killed his share
of ``Japs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Timmy's brother, Buddy (Patrick Hall), and his
annoyingly self-possessed wife, Olive (Mary Ellen Taylor), can't
keep their hands off each other. And Aunt Lottie (Elise Stone) sits
quietly in the corner, playing solitaire and dying of radium
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The men in ``Talley &AMP; Son'' spend a lot of time apologizing for
cursing in front of the women, but it never occurs to them to stop
cursing instead. And as the drama plays out, it's clear that the
patriarch's rant about ``moral corruption'' applies to much more
than an affair with a woman from the wrong side of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the play, Netta insists that Eldon lock up the
house before going to bed. He argues, because nobody in this town
locks his doors. ``Talley &AMP; Son'' is a heartbreaking portrait of
the moment in recent history when that changed.

   NEW YORK _ It all sounds about as exciting as staring at a
glass-sided washing machine. Pieces of cloth unfurling in the
water? Floating fringes of threads and white sheets swathed in
bubbles?
</P>
<P>
   True magic, however, turns the ordinary into the sublime, and
there's no denying the presence of magic in the puppeteer Basil
Twist's extraordinary interpretation of Berlioz's ``Symphonie
Fantastique.'' This is a work that takes place entirely in a
500-gallon aquarium, without the visible presence of anything
remotely human. Or, for that matter, animal-like. If you taxed the
imagination, you could describe the figures that move to the
strains of Berlioz's great musical fever dream as looking vaguely
like the laundry of a Folies-Bergere dancer. But that's really
stretching it.
</P>
<P>
   That Twist's latest work, which inaugurates the ``Dream Music
Puppetry Program'' at the Here theater complex in SoHo, eludes
metaphors is an indication of just how original it is. His
``Symphonie Fantastique'' is a gratifying reminder that there are
still things undreamt of in theater producer's philosophies. It
also comes as close as anything I've seen to finding physical
equivalents to the abstractions of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Music, of course, isn't a visual medium. And as sensual as it
can be, it is definitely not of the flesh. But that hasn't stopped
artists as different as Balanchine and Walt Disney from trying to
capture it in earthly terms. That's not what Twist is aiming for.
There are no balletic hippopotamuses or anthropomorphic mops a la
Disney's ``Fantasia'' in this production. Nor is there anything
approaching a story-ballet plot.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the obvious way to go with ``Symphonie
Fantastique,'' conceived as a despairing love poem by Berlioz to an
Irish actress and for which the composer wrote an annotative
narrative that moves from a pastoral idyll to an opium delirium to
a witches' sabbath. Twist, who has created memorable personality
puppets for Theater Couture's ``Tell-Tale'' and Mabou Mines'
``Peter and Wendy,'' could certainly have depicted this story in
amusingly literal terms, had he chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has created his own Platonic vocabulary out of
light, water and substances that range from Mylar strips to
feathers. When the miniature velvet curtains part in the new
Dorothy Williams Theater at Here, what the audience sees is the
30-by-40-inch opening of a glass tank filled with water. The show
that follows plays on the transformational powers of water on light
and movement; it conjures the sense of music as an elemental force
in which everything we see occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear. This all sounds awfully precious and high-falutin',
doesn't it? That's not the experience of watching ``Symphonie
Fantastique.'' In fact, you'll probably find yourself smiling all
the way through it. Twist and his team of assistant puppeteers (who
remain unseen) manipulate pieces of fabric (and fiber-optic cords
and plastic cutouts) into an astonishing variety of compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they bring to mind what you see under a microscope; at
other times, they suggest time-lapse photography of blossoming
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   All this is no mere head trip, no random turning of a
kaleidoscope. As the symphony progresses through its five
movements, and certain images recur with variations, it becomes
apparent that Twist is conjuring a visual approximation of
Berlioz's motifs and showing how themes evolve and mutate in the
piece. There's wit here that goes beyond words, and it doesn't pall
during the hour it takes to perform the piece.
</P>
<P>
   It is also to Twist's credit that his images don't get in the
way of your appreciation of the symphony when you hear it
afterward. His visual portrait, so startling and immediate in the
performance, seems, in the memory of it, to have been reclaimed by
Berlioz's music. The interpretation is that seamless. It's as if
you had been listening with your eyes.

WILL IRAN OR IRAQ BE NEXT TO JOIN NUCLEAR CLUB?
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After India and Pakistan, what is next?
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration tried to stop the nuclear arms
race in south Asia, senior officials turned their attention Monday
to the next possible nuclear hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are
both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials,
although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several
years away from having devices that work. The arms buildup on the
Korean peninsula is less of a concern because North Korea, beset by
financial problems, has curtailed its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials in Washington admitted that events of the past
three weeks have shown that the United States cannot prevent the
rise of other nuclear states. A combination of threats and rewards
did not stop nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. And economic
sanctions will not sway Iran, which has no formal relations or
trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and other agencies disagreed
over the most pressing issue: how to prevent India and Pakistan
from turning nuclear devices into completed weapons that can be
delivered by missile.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the administration are calling for the strongest
sanctions possible, others argue that India and Pakistan need an
incentive to stop their tests and join the community of nations
committed to ending nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a loss over what to do,'' said an official familiar
with the discussion. ``We have to show them that there's another
avenue _ economic security instead of nuclear security.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been complicated by federal laws requiring
Clinton to impose rigid sanctions on countries that test nuclear
devices. The sanctions can be lifted only with the consent of both
houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there are some positive steps that India and Pakistan
can take to get out of the sanctions, there's no point in having
sanctions,'' said Tom Collina, a director of the Union of Concerned
Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Commerce Department argued Monday against
fully applying economic sanctions against Pakistan, which said it
conducted six nuclear tests last week. The officials warned that
the government in Islamabad would retaliate against American
companies that are engaged in multi-million-dollar energy projects
and other businesses in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pakistani members of Parliament also warned that
prolonged sanctions might force their government to reconsider its
allies. Ghul Sarwar Cheema, a retired Pakistani general who was
involved in Pakistan's clandestine nuclear program for more than a
decade, has suggested that Pakistan might share its nuclear
know-how with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, nobody is even thinking of doing that,'' he
said in an interview. ``But necessity is the mother of invention.
Don't force us, don't invite us, do not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials agree that both India and Pakistan should
immediately stop testing nuclear warheads, halt missile tests, end
the production of weapons-grade fuel, and join 149 other countries
in signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds quite logical. And that's the problem: Logic has
failed since India's tests rocked the western state of Rajasthan on
May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has articulated a series of steps that, if
taken, could cap the crisis right now and contain the damage,''
said Joseph Cirincione, a specialist on nuclear proliferation at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But, he added, ``I
am personally pessimistic about the ability of rational actors to
influence the process at this point. Passions are running hot and
heavy and there are many variables beyond anyone's control.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cut short a trip to Texas to return to Washington to
confer with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tomorrow
morning before she joins foreign ministers of the five permanent
United Nations Security Council members in Geneva to discuss the
arms race in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the non-profit Henry L. Stimson
Center, which studies arms control, said the turmoil in south Asia
has overshadowed significant achievements of the past 15 years in
halting the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the former Soviet Union have dismantled
thousands of nuclear warheads. South Africa, a former emerging
nuclear power, stopped its nuclear program before reaching weapon
capacity. In South America, Argentina, and Brazil pulled back from
the brink of a nuclear arms race. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan
have all agreed to rid their territories of nuclear warheads
deployed during the Soviet era. Iraq's nuclear weapons program has
been largely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Iran continues to raise the greatest concerns. In a 1994 speech
in Washington, James Woolsey, then director of central
intelligence, warned that Iran could become a nuclear state by the
year 2002 to 2004. That estimate has been pushed back slightly, but
Israeli intelligence services maintain that Iran might have a
nuclear device as soon as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which
opposes the regime in Tehran, said the government has been pursuing
a nuclear buildup known as the ``great secret plan.''

COURTNEY LOVE'S `GIFT FOR OBNOXIOUSNESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (For release Sunday, June 7.)  
(mk) 
 By JON PARELES  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Courtney Love has a genius for alienating people. That's one
indisputable fact that emerges in ``Kurt and Courtney,'' the
documentary by Nick Broomfield that opened on Friday.
Ex-boyfriends, ex-employees, acquaintances and even Ms. Love's
father are more than happy to say nasty things about her. Many
accuse her of complicity or worse in the death of her husband, Kurt
Cobain, who brought punk to the American masses as the leader of
Nirvana. ``Harpy'' and ``vampire'' are two of the gentler
descriptions of Ms. Love. In a strange way, the film is almost
enough to create a backlash of sympathy for her. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Cobain's death in April 1994 and Ms. Love's subsequent
transformation from a grunge Fury to a designer-dressed movie
actress have left her stranded between pop-culture archetypes. Is
she a 1990s Yoko Ono, a strong woman with her own artistic efforts
who was reviled for her effect on her more famous husband? Is she a
conniving would-be star who used her music and husband as stepping
stones toward fame? Is she an ex-punk who, unlike Cobain, couldn't
resist selling out to material success and Hollywood scene-making?
Or is she, as some of the people in ``Kurt and Courtney'' believe,
a character out of film noir, coldly plotting the death of her
naive husband to get her hands on his money?
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield, the drolly subjective narrator of his own film, went
to Seattle to report on Cobain's life and death. Cobain was
officially ruled a suicide; he was found dead from a shotgun blast,
with heroin in his blood and a handwritten letter and
identification near his body. Ms. Love refused to be interviewed by
Broomfield, and refused to allow the use of Nirvana's songs in the
film; her clout apparently caused Showtime to withdraw financing
from Broomfield partway through the project. Dave Grohl and Krist
Novoselic of Nirvana are also absent from the film. Broomfield was
left with tales of conspiracy to murder, conflicting
interpretations of the evidence at the death scene and hearsay
about Ms. Love's intense interest in her husband's will.
</P>
<P>
   As glimpsed in the film, Ms. Love is no charmer. In an abortive
``Today'' show interview, she refuses to discuss her heroin
addiction, something she had admitted to in the past; she decrees
that she doesn't want to talk about it for the morning show's
``demographic,'' making her seem both calculating and clumsy.
Outside the 1997 Academy Awards ceremony, she flaunts long
fingernails as proof that she hasn't been playing guitar, then
blithely says, ``When these come off, it's about the grunge,'' as
if songs that sound as if they're wrenched from the soul are just a
fashion choice. The death threats that she and Cobain left on a
journalist's answering machine aren't exactly endearing, either.
</P>
<P>
   Several people interviewed in the film insist that Ms. Love has
something terrible to hide. (One, El Duce of the Mentors, asserts
that Ms. Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain, says he knows who
``whacked'' Cobain and is found dead shortly afterward, spurring
more conspiracy theories.) There are, however, some possible
alternative explanations for Ms. Love's stonewalling. Perhaps she
had been talking about Cobain's will because she was worried about
his committing suicide or overdosing; he was, after all, a heroin
addict. She had recently had their child, Frances, and many people
make wills when children are born.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she didn't want to discuss Cobain's death for the film
because the topic was painful for her, or because she thought she
had said enough in a public memorial during which she read his
final letter in tears. Perhaps, after flaunting all sorts of things
about her past to the press, she was having second thoughts about
doing any more interviews. Perhaps she wanted the whole thing to go
away.
</P>
<P>
   One of the journalists she threatened, Lynn Hirschberg, had
reported in Vanity Fair that Ms. Love had used heroin while she was
pregnant. That contention led to a battle (described in Michael
Azzerad's Nirvana biography, ``Come as You Are'') with government
child-care agencies over whether she and Cobain were fit parents.
The situation could make a new mother act recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   Even under ordinary circumstances, the punk-rock underground is
not exactly a hotbed of judicious diplomacy. Cobain and Ms. Love
moved in a sphere filled with junkies, hustlers, sociopaths,
groupies and freeloaders, not to mention artists. They were
surrounded by people who were on the make, or self-destructive, or
both; sleaze was everywhere, and so was a bizarre theatricality.
It's a zone where throwing a drink in somebody's face (as an
ex-boyfriend recalls Ms. Love's doing when they met) isn't exactly
unheard of. Broomfield is properly skeptical about most of the
people he interviews; corroborating evidence for their stories, he
shows, is hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggeration, not understatement, goes with the punk territory,
where obnoxiousness can be a sign of creativity. Punk songs use
violence as both reportage and metaphor; they vent unpretty
emotions in the name of catharsis, truth and thrills. Ms. Love used
to treat other public encounters that way, too. As her band, Hole,
was making itself known, Ms. Love was the woman who might take off
her clothes or say anything, blurting out the thoughts that nice
girls hid. She preferred attention to privacy, and she was at least
as ambitious as any other songwriter who's convinced that the world
needs to hear her.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But now Ms. Love, like her observers, is stuck between
irreconcilable archetypes. She has received, as Hole's version of a
Young Marble Giants song sarcastically phrases it, ``credit in the
straight world''; she's rich, famous and too well documented for
her own comfort. When she acts up now, there are paparazzi and
gossip columnists waiting to tell the world. And what was
unexceptional behavior in the punk-rock sphere _ like writing a
poem as a teen-ager that announced, ``I'll destroy anyone in my
way'' _ can now, in tabloid style, be presented as ominous
foreshadowing by her embittered father.
</P>
<P>
   Cobain's suicide note suggests that he couldn't handle the
pressures of being a commercial blockbuster, feeling exposed while
trying to stay pure in his music. His widow isn't doing so well,
either. Many people who thought Hole's first two albums were
startlingly honest feel duped or disgusted by Ms. Love's
transformation; after all, there's a difference between maturing
and turning into a high-gloss phony. Hole's new album, due in the
fall, has a lot riding on it: Does the millionaire actress have
anything to say to the people in the mosh pit?
</P>
<P>
   It's too late for Ms. Love to pretend she has had an untroubled
past, and sad to see her swanning through Hollywood as if she
couldn't wait to become superficial. Her gift for obnoxiousness has
lately registered as mere narcissism. But it's a gift she hasn't
lost, only redirected. And even as Ms. Love shreds her own
credibility, it may be too soon to write off someone who can make
such fascinating trouble.

OPPOSITION FEARS TURMOIL IN MEXICO'S CHIAPAS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ As firefighters inched toward controlling forest
fires in Chiapas, opposition politicians said Tuesday that
political strife continues to rage in the southeastern state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political-military crisis in Chiapas is becoming more
profound every day,'' said Camilo Valenzuela, state delegate to the
national executive committee of the left-leaning Party of the
Democratic Revolution, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Despite three visits in the past month by President Ernesto
Zedillo, social and political factionalism, sharpened by the
intervention of the Mexican army, make Chiapas a tinderbox,
Valenzuela said in an interview at the party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a group of Chiapan PRD leaders to Mexico City to air
what they described as political and physical harassment by state
officials loyal to the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   After years of organizing and surviving the murder of scores of
party activists, the PRD has won political control of 18 of the
state's 111 municipalities since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot has been a slew of PRD officials indicted, Valenzuela
said, on trumped-up charges to remove them from office, endless
audits of municipalities governed by the PRD, and a devastating
round of budget cuts for municipalities proposed by the
PRI-controlled state government.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of PRD activists continues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army led a
brief rebellion against the government and the impoverished
conditions of the state's Mayan Indians. More than 150 people were
killed in 10 days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Since peace talks broke off nearly two years ago, villages have
divided along political, religious and economic lines. Armed
militias loyal either to the Zapatistas or to the PRI have clashed
repeatedly, killing hundreds and driving thousands more from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In December, 45 unarmed civilians _ many of them women and
children _ were slaughtered in the village of Acteal by a group of
pro-PRI gunmen allegedly trained by off-duty members of the Mexican
army.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of foreign supporters of the Zapatistas have been
expelled from the country for alleged political activities in
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people, including three Canadians and three Americans,
were expelled after a heavily armed force of state police and army
troops raided the autonomous municipality of Flores Magon on April
12.
</P>
<P>
   The interim governor of Chiapas, Roberto Albores Guillen, has
called the Zapatistas' unilateral creation of autonomous
municipalities unconstitutional and has broken up several in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move three days ago, Valenzuela said, Albores
announced a plan to create 33 new municipalities within the areas
of the state's worst violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave interested parties just one week to register their
input,'' Valenzuela said.
</P>
<P>
   While the PRD is studying the plan, observers in Chiapas say it
remains to be seen if the Zapatistas will accept Albores' political
districting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, firefighters are battling wildfires that have swept
across drought-stricken Mexico this year, spreading smoky haze
across the country and into the United States.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long after Sen. Edward M. Kennedy introduced a
bill to overhaul managed care this spring, his staff put out a
feeler to the unwitting heroine of the movement, Helen Hunt, the
actress who portrayed the exhausted, angst-ridden, HMO-bashing
mother of an asthma sufferer in the movie ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she be interested in promoting the bill?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunt is mulling it over, but countless others have jumped at
the chance, offering Democrats and lobbyists a public relations
coup in the explosive battle on Capitol Hill to revamp managed
health care: victims and their horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful insurance and small-business lobbies, meanwhile,
are fighting back. Last week, they began running advertisements
featuring ``Fat Cat Trial Lawyers'' who are ``laughing all the way
to the bank'' at the prospect of an expanded lawsuit provision in
proposed legislation. The radio spots were broadcast in Ohio,
Florida and Missouri, where some of the 12 House members on a
Republican managed-care study group _ and their constituents _
would be certain to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress considers wrestling with managed care in the next
two months, lobbyists are busy making sure their viewpoints are
heard too. Each side has spent at least $1 million in advertising
and close to $2 million in campaign contributions, mostly to
Republicans. They have hired astute lobbyists and barraged members
with faxes and telephone calls. And they have delivered
not-so-subtle reminders of party and corporate loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are lobbying like heck and spending money like crazy,''
said Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
Commerce Committee. Dingell has introduced one of the major pieces
of legislation on managed care along with Kennedy, D-Mass., and
senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few months, the managed-care conundrum has become one
of the issues of the year on Capitol Hill, with Democrats comparing
it to the minimum wage in its populist appeal. Originally, only a
few quixotic Republicans agreed with Democrats on the issue, but
slowly, with the polls showing its resonance, it has spread to the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who for months shied away from the issue
despite broad bipartisan support for one of the bills, have
relented. Doing something about managed care, say lobbyists and
members of Congress, has become practically unavoidable. Now the
question is what.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are in a box and the industry is probably not
much more popular than tobacco right now,'' said Charles N. Kahn
III, the chief operating officer and president-designate of the
Health Insurance Association of America, which represents
commercial insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Any day now a House study group appointed by Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia is expected to complete a bill to counter the
existing proposals that many Republicans consider too radical, too
regulatory and too likely to stoke frivolous lawsuits. So far,
though, the effort has drawn the ire of Gingrich, a reaction that
shows how contentious an issue it is for Republicans, and members
are busy retooling the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, you never know which way the football will
bounce,'' said Rep. Harris Fawell, an Illinois Republican in the
study group who said the public's concerns about managed care would
be addressed in the group's bill. ``The Democrats have jumped on it
and they seem to think it will be a nice vehicle for retaking
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the overhaul effort say they simply want to give
patients access to more doctors, the right to appeal a managed care
organization's decision to an impartial panel and the freedom to
sue the organizations for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton revved up the issue in his January State of
the Union Message when he called for a patient's bill of rights,
without offering specifics. Lobbyists, sensing change, got to work.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until April, when Democrats in Congress
introduced their bill, that the political warfare broke out and the
``anecdote'' faced off against the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats got an immediate, significant boost when the American
Medical Association decided to endorse the bill, despite
traditional reservations about lawsuits. Groups representing
nurses, pediatricians, anesthesiologists and many others came on
board, and all have been lobbying on behalf of the bill. Labor
unions have also made it a priority.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the effort was bolstered again when a Republican
pollster conducted a survey that made some Republicans cringe. It
showed that 67 percent of those surveyed were willing to pay $17
more a month in premiums to change the system.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Senate Democrats started their ``victim a
day'' campaign, which brought one Democrat or another to the Senate
floor each day to let fly a poignant anecdote about an ordinary
American who had been victimized by a managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, Sen. Barbara Boxer of California told of Harry
Christie, whose 9-year-old daughter was found to have a rare kidney
tumor and needed the expert skills that only two doctors in America
could provide. The insurance company directed them to a general
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my only child,'' Ms. Boxer quoted Christie as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out of luck,'' came the reply from the company, Ms.
Boxer said. The family paid for the surgery themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton took up the mantle and comforted
Regina Powers, a breast cancer patient who recounted her
gut-wrenching confrontation with a health maintenance organization
when she wanted to see an oncologist and a breast surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is urgent _ I mean how many more stories do we have to
hear like Regina's before we actually act?'' Clinton asked at a
news conference with Ms. Powers.

 WASHINGTON: Ms. Powers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senate Democrats have threatened to attach their bill to other
pieces of legislation in June and July, a pressure tactic that is
not permitted in the House. But House members supportive of the
overhaul efforts have raised the specter of a ``discharge
petition,'' the procedural maneuver that revived the moribund
campaign finance debate, if Republican leaders fail to act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, groups on both sides of the issue have contributed
generously to Congress. The managed care industry has given more
than $1.5 million in contributions to federal candidates and
parties so far this election season, paying particular attention to
Republican leaders, according to the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Health specialists who are not doctors have doled out more than
$1.8 million, with 53 percent of it going to Democrats. The
American Medical Association has weighed in with more than
$646,000, 71 percent going to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The groups opposing the overhaul effort see their biggest
challenge as muffling the swell of violins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the debate and discussion is very objective,''
Kahn said in frustration. ``It's a disease-of-the-month club
approach, and then it's also a Chinese menu of solutions, some of
which are thought out and others of which the cost implications are
not even analyzed or thought through.''
</P>
<P>
   To get their message out, lobbyists have run a series of
newspaper and radio advertisements since January. They have stuck
closely to one theme of warning: Pass this legislation, and expect
to see premiums jump, the number of the uninsured to rise and
frivolous lawsuits to multiply.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists have focused on certain Republican members, first
on the 88 who co-sponsored a bill by Rep. Charlie Norwood, the
Republican dentist from Georgia who spearheaded the first overhaul
effort. Six of those members backed off. When nine Republicans
supported the Democratic proposal, they were snowed under with
faxes, letters and telephone calls. Two of the lawmakers dropped
their support within 24 hours.

COMDEN AND GREEN: EXPERTS AT ORCHESTRATING THE SHOW WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7)  
 (bl)  
 By NORA SAYRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gene Kelly splashing sublimely through the puddles,
Debbie Reynolds bursting out of a huge cake, Jean Hagen as a
talentless jazz-age movie actress who declares, ``I make more money
than Calvin Coolidge put together!'' and Fred Astaire cutting loose
in a penny arcade: we owe these moments to Betty Comden and Adolph
Green, though admittedly the two writers had some assistance from
directors, composers, choreographers and the performers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A good many of the ebullient lyrics and scripts that kept Ms.
Comden and Green commuting between Broadway and Hollywood for
decades express their irreverent affection for movies and the
theater: when they present a show within a show, it's larded with
fond mockery.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since musicals began to ape the refinements of ``The
King and I'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' the Comden-Green creations have
appeared all the more visceral and funny.
</P>
<P>
   Eight MGM musicals with Comden-and-Green screenplays or lyrics _
ranging from 1947 to 1960 _ will be shown at the Film Forum
starting Friday and running through June 25, and the series gleams
with their powers of invention.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of ``Singin' in the Rain'' (1952), the most famous
of these films, was somewhat haphazard. In 1950, producer Arthur
Freed handed a batch of songs he had written with Nacio Herb Brown
to Ms. Comden and Green, asking them to write a picture called
``Singin' in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew that at some point there would be a rainy scene in
which someone would sing, but all they had was a stack of sheet
music, no hint of a story. They decided that the songs should be
presented in the context of the 1920s, when they were written, and
linked to the silent movies of that era. So they focused on the
impact of sound on the film industry and the ensuing turmoil. When
performers must take lessons in diction, Kelly and Donald O'Connor
chant some foot-tapping Comden-Green lyrics _ ``If Moses supposes
his toeses are roses/ Then Moses supposes erroneously'' _ and Ms.
Hagen's character, cursed with a whinnying nasal voice, practices
saying ``I ... cahn't ... STAN-nim'' as her accent worsens.
</P>
<P>
   The writers developed a treasury of sight gags when Ms. Hagen
was wired for sound: while a microphone is hidden in her
decolletage, it amplifies her heartbeat, then we hear her pearls
clacking loudly together. At a preview, the actors' lines are
hilariously out of sync. Ms. Comden and Green were painfully aware
of the history of the ruined careers of performers with ridiculous
or ugly voices, but their movie also cherishes the ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``Singin' in the Rain'' eschews the mush that creeps
into many fine musicals, and there are none of the wordy lulls
between numbers that make audiences mutter and shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor dancing on his knees, Kelly playing in water and making
wavelets like an ecstatic child, Cyd Charisse uncoiling her long
legs sheathed in pale green stockings _ all convey the witty
visions of the writers whose collaboration with the film's
directors, Stanley Donen and Kelly, produced a masterwork.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham Greene was a movie critic, he wrote, ``Only the
cinema is able in its most fantastic moments to give a sense of
absurd unreasoning happiness.'' That emotion surges through
``Singin' in the Rain''; as Green added, ``You can't catch it in
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Band Wagon'' (1953), a distressed Fred Astaire asks,
``What's happened to 42nd Street?'' as he gazes unhappily at the
tawdry marquees and recalls that this was once the home of
distinguished theater.
</P>
<P>
   This movie, directed by Vincente Minnelli, was an anthology of
songs by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz that were mostly written
for revues. Ms. Comden and Green devised a theatrical setting,
using some of their backstage experiences: the agonies of angst
before an opening, the disastrous first night in New Haven, the
desperate rewrites. When they gave Astaire the role of a fading
star, they drew on their own early discouragements in the years
before their success. And they modeled a pair of playwrights,
Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant, on themselves. Normally morose, an
angry depressive, Levant seems far more enthusiastic in this
picture than in any other _ because he was imitating Adolph Green.
</P>
<P>
   As you watch Astaire dancing with a shoeshine man or battling
black-suited hoods in a parody of a Mickey Spillane thriller,
you're elated to see him kneel, so you can relish the agility with
which he springs to his feet. You remember that he often dances
with his hands clasped casually behind his back, as in the magical
duet where he and Ms. Charisse glide through the dusk in a corner
of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Film Forum series enables you to compare the styles and the
screen personae of Astaire and Kelly. The former seems weightlessly
romantic and sometimes almost asexual; the latter stresses
virility. Kelly's acrobatic talents show exertion as much as
dexterity; what he does is triumphantly difficult, and it seems
that almost no one else could leap so nimbly from one spot to
another. As many have noted, Astaire makes every step look easy: as
he soars and swoops, many spectators feel that they could
effortlessly do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comden (from Brooklyn) and Green (from the Bronx) have
always celebrated New York. And many of us feel rather possessive
of ``On the Town,'' especially the great opening number, in which
the three sailors spill from their ship to lead ``a lifetime in
just one day,'' to revel in chance encounters and unforeseeable
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Kelly and Donen and shot partly on
location, begins with the vibrant energy the show demands, when
Kelly, the rubbery comedian Jules Munshin and a spindly young Frank
Sinatra (timid with women and given to eloquent shrugs) hurl
themselves at the skyline. Rushing from the Brooklyn Bridge to Wall
Street, to Times Square, to Rockefeller Center, they capture the
spirit of a city whose only tradition is perpetual change, where
there's no defense against the entangling lives of strangers: you
may get a bullet or a bunch of flowers that was meant for someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the rest of the movie is disappointing. The reasons
are drastically simple. MGM bought the rights to the Broadway
production before it opened at the end of 1944. The musical was a
colossal hit, but Louis B. Mayer was repelled when he finally saw
it. Above all, the studio pundits loathed Leonard Bernstein's
magnificent score, considering it inaccessible, and the movie
wasn't made until 1949. Most of the Bernstein songs were cut. Roger
Edens was commissioned to compose new ones, and Ms. Comden and
Green were under contract to provide the lyrics. There are
beguiling moments, but the movie mainly swells your appetite for
the Broadway revival that's scheduled for fall.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   No hoofer gets tipsy quite so joyfully as Gene Kelly; as a
dancing drunk in ``It's Always Fair Weather'' (1955), he's boneless
when his legs fly sideways. With Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd he
cavorts beneath the Third Avenue El: each has a foot attached to a
garbage-can lid, banging it rhythmically upon the pavement. The
movie, directed by Kelly and Donen with Comden-Green lyrics and
script, was conceived as a sort of sequel to ``On the Town'': what
would happen to the young men after the war? In ``Fair Weather''
three soldiers vow to meet again 10 years later _ and when they do,
they find they can't stomach one another.
</P>
<P>
   The theme is erosion: of friendship, of beliefs. Feeling
degraded by their lives and jobs _ a would-be chef runs a burger
joint in Schenectady, an ex-painter is an advertising executive _
the characters gave their creators an opportunity to lampoon
television (as Hollywood often did in the 1950s, when it was losing
its audience to the small screen).
</P>
<P>
   The writers made clever use of Cinemascope: as the men regret
their reunion, the screen splits into three panels and we hear each
one's private complaints sung to the tune of ``The Blue Danube'':
``This thing is a frost/ I'd like to get lost ... That one's a
heel/ And I'm a schlemiel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dailey's virulent alcoholic song about the idiocies of Madison
Avenue, ``Situation-wise,'' and Kelly's sidewalk tap dance on
roller skates as his self-confidence builds heighten the
originality of a vivacious musical that's steeped in skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of pungent satire, pretensions die quickly in
Comden-Green movies while melancholy hovers in the wings. There's a
ground note of loneliness, and crises carry the threat of failure:
the show may fold; the football game could be lost; the star hates
the ingenue; the playwright will be fired if he misses the
deadline; the desirable young woman has vanished _ perhaps for
good. But although a subtle pessimism flavors some of the scripts,
optimism pervades ``Bells Are Ringing,'' directed in 1960 by
Minnelli, with music by Jule Styne.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comden and Green write superb parts for performers _
undoubtedly because they've been performers since they appeared in
their own sketches at the Village Vanguard, then as two of the
leads in ``On the Town,'' and in ``A Party With Comden and Green,''
a two-person evening with selections from their shows and movies.
The role they designed for their friend Judy Holliday, a colleague
from their nightclub days, was inspired by the phone book: seeing
ads for answering services, they discovered that such a business
could consist of one person announcing, ``Mrs. Vanderbilt's
residence'' from a shabby basement room. That seemed a likely
setting for a young woman once employed on the switchboard of the
Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company.
</P>
<P>
   As the artful message-taker solves her clients' problems,
Holliday emits a resilient gaiety. At jubilant moments she
swaggers; determination makes her walk on a forward slant; when
exasperated, she lets out a guttural scream. The writers provided
Holliday with an intelligent character _ an exhilarating change
from the apparent fluff heads she often played _ and a temperament
so engaging that she could persuade a crowd of cross New Yorkers to
greet their fellow citizens. Like certain rare clowns, Holliday was
gifted at pathos: when she sings ``The Party's Over,'' love seems
to evaporate like mist on the East River.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts were crucial to Comden-Green movies and collisions
supplied some memorable scenes. As a quarrelsome couple in ``The
Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949), Astaire and Ginger Rogers float in
and out of each other's arms, exchanging testy remarks that further
divide them. Astaire was even given a chance to glower, which was
unusual for him. What Ms. Comden and Green wrote often freed actors
to play against type or to extend their range, as when Astaire
strolls through Grand Central Terminal in ``The Band Wagon,''
singing the somber ``By Myself'' and then lightening his mood by
quickening his pace, or when Holliday asserts in ``Is It a Crime?''
that she could have saved the lives of Romeo and Juliet by relaying
their messages: had they subscribed to her answering service,
``Those two kids would be alive today!'' That number was cut from
``Bells Are Ringing,'' but its logic displays the enthralling
ingenuity of Betty Comden and Adolph Green.

   CONRAIL-HEARINGS _ Two years ago, federal railroad regulators
approved, with hardly a blink, Union Pacific's acquisition of
Southern Pacific to form the nation's largest railroad. The result
was one of the nation's worst rail tie-ups, costing businesses
billions of dollars throughout the West. Wednesday and Thursday,
the Surface Transportation Board is holding hearings on plans by
two other railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, to take over
Conrail, the only major freight carrier serving the Northeast. By

 &HT;    Feelings about Braves defection still run deep 33 years later
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wisc. _ The historic first pitch still was nearly
three hours away, yet father and son had their game bratwursts on.
The car trunk was open. The brats were sizzling on the little
portable grill. The beer was frosty. And the Dischlers of Plain,
Wisc., were ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 33 years for this night,'' Pat Dischler Jr.
said. ``I mean that seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for Monday, when the Braves opened a three-game series
with the Milwaukee Brewers, now in the National League, and finally
returned to their old homeland after a 33-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game I picked when I bought my season tickets was
June 1, 1998,'' Dischler said. ``I wanted to be here when the
Braves came back. To boo 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He was here the night of Sept. 22, 1965, when Sandy Koufax and
the Dodgers beat the Braves in 12 innings, prolonging the civic
agony a bit more. It was the night the Milwaukee Braves played
their final game in Milwaukee County Stadium before moving to
Atlanta for the 1966 season.
</P>
<P>
   Dischler recalls the banner on the facade in the right-field
bleachers that evening: Goodbye, Milwaukee Braves. ``One of the
saddest signs I ever saw'' he said. ``There were a lot of sad
people, a lot of mad people.'' Few sadder, or madder, than
Dischler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad when the Braves left town I didn't drink Coke
again 'til I was 38,'' he said. A dry spell lasting 23 years,
prompted by a $15 million TV deal between the Braves and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd protest Coca-Cola the rest of my life,'' said
Dischler, now 48. ``Put it this way: I kicked a can around for a
long time. That was my team. Back then, you felt like they were
playing for you. Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn, Eddie Mathews, Lew
Burdette. There was no free-agency then. You knew they were going
to be on the team every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Until one year when the whole team was gone, after 13 memorable
seasons in Milwaukee. The Braves never had a losing season here
after moving from Boston in 1953. They set major-league attendance
records in the '50s, won two National League pennants and the 1957
World Series. They had power personified in Aaron and Mathews,
unparalleled pitching from Spahn and Burdette and a city's genuine
adoration, which included all the beer the Braves could drink.
Which they did.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the good old days. And then they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee always had this feeling,'' Dischler said, ``that
this community was not raped but ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here hate the Braves. They hate 'em,'' said Pat
Grainger, 35, an engineer and Braves fan, who lived in Atlanta
1976-86. ``People who've been around since the '50s, some of 'em
have never been to a game since. Some old men I know, they'll never
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some didn't return when the debt-ridden Seattle Pilots moved
here in 1970 after one dismal expansion season. They became the
Milwaukee Brewers of, alas, the American League. The Brewers made
the postseason twice, won the AL pennant in 1982 and lost that
World Series in seven games to the Cardinals. Yet this has always
been a National League town, and now it is once again.
</P>
<P>
   When Bud Selig, the Brewers CEO, baseball's acting commissioner
and a native Milwaukeean, got a faxed letter last November from the
major leagues' realignment committee, he was overcome emotionally
and began to weep. After so much wrangling over realignment, and
Kansas City's refusal to switch leagues, the owners wanted Selig's
Brewers to move to the NL. He had resisted, to avoid any appearance
of conflict of interest. But perhaps more than anyone, Selig knows
Milwaukee is back where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great night, a wonderful night,'' Selig said Monday.
``I guess there's a lot of fulfillment. I remember the last game
here 33 years ago. Now, the Braves are back, and all's well that
ends well.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig grieved that last, awful night of Sept. 22, 1965. By then,
he headed Teams Inc., the group that was in charge of running the
Braves' day-to-day operation, while the club's ownership, headed by
chairman of the board Bill Bartholomay, was, literally, safely
ensconced in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the saddest nights I've ever seen,'' Selig said.
``There was a standing ovation for Aaron and Mathews. The weeping,
the sadness. It was very, very, very emotional. I guess that night
if you would've asked me, or anybody, if the Braves would ever play
again here, well, it didn't look very good. But this is one of
those times in life we've come full circle, and it doesn't come
very often. I've looked forward to this game for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was Turn Back the Clock Night. Ticket and concession
prices were rolled back to the heyday '50s. Hot dogs, sodas and
bleacher seats cost a buck, general admission $3, upper-grandstand
tickets $4. Both teams wore replica Milwaukee uniforms from 1958,
the Braves in road gray, the Brewers in the old cream home jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron threw out the first pitch, just as he did on April 7
for the Brewers' home opener and NL debut. This one was caught by
Logan, the old battling shortstop who is now a Brewers scout and
the only original Milwaukee Braves player still living here.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Guthrie watched it all. Now 50 and a history teacher,
Guthrie grew up just a few miles from County Stadium in West Allis.
Logan lived in the neighborhood. ``I was out here virtually every
night as a kid. I lived out here,'' said Guthrie, who'd pedal his
bike to the ballpark, sometimes buy a 50-cent ticket but often sat
outside on a grassy knoll beyond right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was baseball crazy back then,'' said Guthrie,
wearing a Milwaukee Braves 1957 champs sweatshirt. ``They were like
the Packers are now. Even during the off-season, they'd be talking
about the Braves on the news. It was nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was troublesome one day in '64, when Guthrie was sitting near
the visitors' dugout and a Cincinnati Red yelled out to Mathews
during batting practice, ``I hear you guys are moving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' replied Mathews, saying what Guthrie was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were rumors,'' Guthrie said, ``but when it happened it
was very depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie was working as a hot-dog vendor the night of Sept. 22,
1965. ``I remember we ran out on the field after the game, ran
around the bases. People were picking up stuff: grass, dirt, even
the bases. I never thought I'd get to see the Braves again.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did. Most older fans here this week rooted for the
Brewers, although some wore old block-M Milwaukee Braves caps and a
few No. 44 Aaron Milwaukee jerseys. The Atlanta fans here? Those
were the younger ones, kids who have watched the Braves dominate
the 1990s. Some spent $20 on commemorative T-shirts that featured
two ticket stubs, one stamped the Braves' return to Milwaukee, the
other Milwaukee's return to the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee Baseball,'' the T-shirt reads. ``Past, Present &AMP;
Future.'' The future is rising beyond center field, where Miller
Park, the $200 million retractable-roof domed stadium opening in
2000, is being built. The past, and present, converges again
tonight. To a city's delight.

 &HT;    Breakdown of Atlanta-Tokyo route
 &HT;    (Sidebar to DELTA-JAPAN)
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta's Atlanta-Tokyo nonstop flights will travel
6,850 miles _ nearly 1,600 miles more than Delta's next-longest
route.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will use 222-seat MD-11 widebody jets with optional
center fuel tanks. The planes will take off with more than 40,000
gallons of fuel, or about 8,000 more than needed, the airline says.
Passengers will fly a little less than 14 hours westbound and about
12 1/2 hours eastbound, with the difference due to wind patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines, the incumbent on the route, uses 324-passenger
747-400 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   Four pilots will work each Delta flight with two working while
the others rest in bunks at the rear of the cockpit. Federal rules
require the extra staffing for any flight over 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will get three meals on either Delta's or JAL's
flights, with a choice of Western or Asian menus. Both carriers
staff the flights with bilingual flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's jets will have three classes: economy, business and
first. JAL's flights offer economy and business. While Asian
carriers are known generally for higher-quality service than
western airlines, the biggest single difference may boil down to
smoking. JAL still allows it; Delta has gone cold turkey.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS CALL MORALES A LIAR IN TOBACCO DISPUTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales has repeatedly lied
and tried to ``bully'' the governor and other state officials in
the dispute over tobacco legal fees, seven legislators told a
federal judge Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Angry over Morales' effort to slap them with multimillion-dollar
penalties, the lawmakers responded with some of the strongest
language yet in the 4-month-old controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general is the one who is holding repeated press
conferences filled with lies and evasions,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were made in a formal response filed by their
attorney, Pete Schenkkan of Austin, to Morales' motion seeking $25
million in sanctions against the legislators and Gov. George W.
Bush. The governor has not yet filed his response.
</P>
<P>
   Morales last week told U.S. District Judge David Folsom of
Texarkana that the governor and legislators should be fined for
allegedly acting in ``bad faith'' in their efforts to reduce $2.3
billion awarded five private lawyers who helped the state settle
the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said their opposition is politically motivated and
places the $15.3 billion settlement in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He has said the private lawyers recently were willing to
consider a ``substantial'' reduction in their fees but that Bush
refused to negotiate with them. The governor's office said there
was still no guarantee that part of the fees wouldn't come from the
state's share of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers reportedly offered to reduce their fees to between
$800 million and $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislators said if anyone is jeopardizing the
settlement, it is Morales, because he has refused their attempts to
separate the dispute over lawyers fees from final approval of the
tobacco settlement. They also blame him for escalating the fight by
calling a press conference the same day he filed the sanctions
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general's press release trumpeting the motion for
sanctions makes it clear that that motion was filed for purposes of
bullying and intimidating, in an effort to force legislators and
the governor'' to withdraw their opposition, the lawmakers' brief
said.
</P>
<P>
   They accused Morales of ``making false public statements for
emotional and political spin ... without proper attention to the
legal principles that control in this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales spokesman Ward Tisdale said the lawmakers'
characterizations of Morales are ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general has been nothing but truthful regarding
all the actions that have taken place throughout this litigation,''
Tisdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also oppose Morales' efforts to prohibit them and
the governor from contacting tobacco industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the seven legislators argue that the $2.3 billion in
legal fees, which were based on a 15 percent contingency agreement
the outside lawyers had with the state, are excessive. They also
say the state may have to pay part of the fees from its share of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, the lawmakers said cigarette companies
apparently have offered Morales and the private lawyers a
restructured fee agreement, similar to what the industry recently
agreed to pay lawyers in Minnesota's tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Minnesota deal, outside lawyers will be paid less than
in Texas but will receive all their money in less than three years,
rather than over 25 years, as in Texas. And the tobacco industry
agreed to pay all the lawyers' fees in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesman Scott Williams said tobacco companies haven't
made such an offer to Texas. Tisdale said a payment plan similar to
Minnesota's has been discussed, but he wouldn't say who proposed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been discussions about paying the lawyers less
money but in a shorter time frame,'' Tisdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators, in their latest federal court filing, again
urged the judge to let them question Houston attorney Joe Jamail
about allegations that Morales solicited millions of dollars from
lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was out of state Tuesday for meetings with tobacco
representatives. He is attempting to increase Texas' tobacco deal
by at least $2 billion to match, proportionately, the more-recent
Minnesota agreement.

 &HT;    Delta's nonstop Atlanta-Tokyo begins today
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The number of airline seats flying nonstop between
Atlanta and Tokyo climbs sharply today.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines begins daily nonstop service between Hartsfield
and Narita airports, joining Japan Airlines on the route.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the airlines will fly 2,526 seats round-trip every
week, up from the 972 weekly seats now offered by JAL on Monday,
Wednesday and Saturday flights.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Atlanta market support such a dramatic increase,
especially amid an economic slump in Asia? It doesn't have to,
although the timing could be better, said Vince Caminiti, Delta's
senior vice president marketing-international.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an Atlanta issue, it's a Southeast issue,'' he
said. Caminiti said Delta will rely on passengers from across the
East connecting through the airline's Hartsfield hub.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's existing Tokyo flights from Atlanta stop in Portland,
Ore. That second stop for passengers who've already connected once
at Hartsfield means two more hours total travel time, compared with
more streamlined routings on rivals such as United or Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after the connecting passenger who has been flying
through Chicago or Detroit or New York and offering them the same
or better service through Atlanta,'' Caminiti said. Delta expects
about 65 percent of its Atlanta-Tokyo passengers to be connecting.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the local market is unimportant. The additional flights
will boost Japan's business connections with Georgia, already ``the
center of Japanese industry in the Southeast'' with 370
Japan-affiliated businesses, according to Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which plans to continue its Portland-Tokyo flights, has
long wanted a nonstop route from Atlanta but had to wait for a
breakthrough this winter in U.S.-Japan air treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
   Continental and American, which like Delta are bit players in
the U.S.-Japan market, also plan new nonstops from their hubs under
the treaty revision. And United and Northwest plan to fortify their
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question for Atlanta is whether JAL will continue
its service, begun in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Evilsizor, JAL's Southeast sales chief, said its flights
run 78 percent full on average but expects to lose 10 to 15 percent
as some fliers defect to Delta because of its daily service and
frequent flier program. He added JAL could face a decision later
this year whether to leave the route.

 &HT;    Malone and Jazz ``just want one''
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, Utah _ Just once in his life, Karl Malone wants
to ride off into the sunset on that Harley of his with an NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be greedy,'' he said. ``I just want one. I
don't want three, four, five, or even two. I just want one.
Hopefully, we can take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearing his 35th birthday, Malone has a resume that lacks only
an NBA championship ring. He has done all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Malone came into the NBA a raw-boned kid from a small community
in rural Louisiana and learned to play basketball the right way. He
honed his body, mind and skills to become the pre-eminent power
forward in the game. He ended Michael Jordan's reign as the NBA's
most valuable player a year ago and is the acknowledged driving
force for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 6-foot-9, 255-pound Malone has a second chance to get
the one prize in sports that has eluded his grasp and escaped his
partner John Stockton and their phlegmatic, driven coach, Jerry
Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   He enters Game I of the NBA finals tonight against Chicago with
a reputation as a sometimes brutal competitor, a person who will do
anything to win. It's part fact, part fiction. Malone has been part
of a couple of ugly NBA moments. But those images must be balanced
by others:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two years ago during the West finals, a teary-eyed Malone
brought joy to a dying child, pushing his wheelchair into a
postgame press conference and introducing him as ``my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Malone, as Everyman, has spent several summers delivering
freight in his own 18-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the offseason, Malone loves to hide in a sweat box in
Alaska, the bayous of Louisiana or the Arkansas Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Malone is not too proud to advertise Rogaine, a solution he
rubs into his ever-growing bald spot in an effort to grow hair.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is, in fact, an NBA enigma. His NBA success has given him
the wherewithal to comfortably escape the limelight. That's what
Malone does best.
</P>
<P>
   He often is content to hop on his Harley-Davidson, chromed and
pearl with painted western motif, and ride across valleys and
mountains. Sometimes in company, often alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go down to Vegas and get out in the limo with the big
Rolex on and 20 people around me,'' Malone says. ``I do have a
posse sometimes, when I ride my Harley, because we ride to Jackson
Hole every summer, and I got six or eight guys that I ride with.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone says he catches grief for not being like most NBA
players. But he doesn't own a double-breasted suit and a closet of
gold chains and bracelets. In fact, he's a blue jeans and T-shirt
kind of guy who recently enjoyed the birth of his fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I was fishing and hunting all the time,'' Malone
said. ``But now I'm criticized for that. I love to hunt, and I love
guns. Now, when I go hunting, it's documented. I get my license at
the fish and game (department), and I have people upset with me
because I'm going bear hunting or I'm going cougar hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is how I grew up, hunting and fishing. I got a place
in Alaska, and (people say) I'm a hick for that. I go to Alaska to
fish, or I spend three or four days out in the tundra with friends
hunting caribou. But they say I'm a redneck for that. Things that I
do are not the norm for professional athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Take his commitment to winning, for example. Few equal Malone's
drive for excellence, although he says he gives into temptation
once in a while. A cheeseburger, for example, doesn't add to his
33-inch waist. He doesn't think he jeopardizes his health with a
cigar ``every now and then. I love a cigar.'' He doesn't mind a
visit to the Nevada border town of Wendover or a Shreveport
riverboat casino for a little gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know what I got to do the next morning,'' he said. ``If
you want to hang out and do things at night, you got to be able to
stay on your same schedule the next day. That's part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His workout regimen, including daily weight-lifting and situps,
is stuff of legend, and he doesn't mind letting people know how
hard he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about me bringing my lunch pail every night to help
you win,'' he says. ``I come to play for an organization every
single night. I'm going to play through injuries and give you what
I got to win. Now take a poll. And if you want to win, or have a
shot at winning, let's take a poll if you want to play with me or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget getting to know me as a person. I really don't ever
care if a teammate really, legitimately gets to know Karl Malone as
a person. I don't mind if that happens. But that's not my job, and
that's not your job. If we hit it off, we hit it off. But competing
and playing hard and trying to pick up for my teammates, and win or
trying to win and be competitive every night, take a poll.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention his reputation as a roughneck on the court -- Isiah
Thomas had 40 stitches after catching a Malone elbow, and David
Robinson was knocked out earlier this year -- and you touch a
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired of hearing it,'' Malone said. ``But let me say
this: I played with a lot of guys who didn't like Karl Malone
because he played the way he played. When I play, I play to win.
But I don't ever play the game to win at all costs. I think there's
a way to win. And that's the way I like to win. I don't like to win
by doing something dirty. Things happen. It's unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to let anybody run over me on the court. If
you get me, and I know you were trying to, yeah, I'm going to try
to get you back. I'm not going to be passive on it. That's human
nature. That's defending myself. If you hit me, and I know you
tried to do that, at some point in time, I'm going try to get you
back. That's the competitor. That's Karl Malone. That's the
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his unyielding spirit and remarkable body, Malone has
missed only one game because of injury in the past six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the long grind of a season, I think my work on the
weights has delayed the aging process, without a doubt,'' Malone
says. ``Those little nagging injuries that keep you out of games
aren't so bad. Yeah, I get bruised and all that. But there's never
a doubt in my mind that I'm going to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He plays it the way his mother told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always told me, 'Never quit, never make excuses and
always, at some point in life, outwork your opponent,' `` he said.
``At some point, have it in your mind that you outworked your
opponent. Maybe you didn't. But in your mind, you thought you did.
And that's a big edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Malone has never changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same little snotty-nosed boy from Louisiana who
happens to play professional basketball for a living,'' he said.
``I'm still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Still wanting the ring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sprint Corp. set the telecommunications industry abuzz
Tuesday, as it promised to fashion a new network that will let a
single telephone line handle voice, video and an extremely fast
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, phone calls travel over a single circuit, and while
the circuit is open, it can't handle any other communication.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sprint network, someone will be able to log onto the
Internet, send a fax, play a video game and conduct a telephone
conversation simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based company, which made its name in
long-distance, raised hopes that it can help provide customers with
speedier data services and cheaper phone calls starting next year.
By early 1999, Sprint will offer the service to small and
home-based businesses, and by late 1999, to residential customers.
The company has not yet released any information on rollout dates
for specific cities, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile announcement also spurred questions about how
the service will be delivered and at which customers it will be
aimed. And it also shoved Sprint into the spotlight as a potential
partner or takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   But what made the first big splash was the promise that Sprint's
''Integrated On-Demand Network'' will rely on an entirely different
model of service than the one that has prevailed for more than a
century. All communication will be treated as data and handled by
equipment meant for data, not voice. Even the most basic customer
function _ billing _ would change, if Sprint has its way.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to put meters in homes and offices to keep
track of how much data is passing through the wires. Instead of
paying by the minute, customers will pay by the bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has brought to a head the need for networks to
evolve,'' said telecommunications analyst Brian Adamik of the
Yankee Group. ``Sprint is making the appropriate move.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the network possible, voice must be digitized as it
travels through thousands of copper phone lines. Rewiring millions
of homes with fiber optics seems impossibly exensive. Regional
phone companies like BellSouth plan to offer ADSL _ asymmetric
digital subscriber lines _ that would permit voice and data to
share those lines at high speeds. Sprint is expected to use a
similar kind of technology _ or lease it from the likes of
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Since creation of the Internet, data has been carried on
networks constructed to handle voice traffic. But that must change
_ partly because data transmission are expected to soon outpace
voice, and partly because the demand for speed is hard to satisfy
on a network built to carry conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, data hitched a ride on voice,'' said John
Callahan, spokesman for Lucent Technologies, which makes equipment
for handling both. ``Starting today, voice will have to accomodate
itself to the data world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the surge toward the Net and to a digital system has been
the talk of the industry for some time. Sprint's approach may not
be radically different than that of other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving in that direction _ I think everybody is,'' said
spokeswoman Leslie Aun of MCI, the nation's second-largest
long-distance company . ``We want to marry networks so that video,
data and voice are treated seamlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Julie Spechler said the company, which handles
about half the nation's long-distance calls, in January announced
efforts to ``future proof'' its network by expanding high-speed
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But more than either of the two larger companies, Sprint is
concentrating on changing the way the data is transmitted and
managed, said Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan.
``This is Sprint's path to the future, but all the telephone
companies see the same finish line. It's just a question of which
vehicle you use to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials and analysts said consumers may not pay less
than if they purchased all the services individually. But they will
get more for their money, said Kagan. For instance, an Internet
connection would operate up to 100 times faster than with a
conventional modem on a traditional phone line.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Group President William Redderson said the Sprint
announcement ``reinforces'' what BellSouth has done to install
high-speed connections for local customers in its nine-state
region. ``We have been taking local networks down that path since
1994.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Sprint said the technology would let them provide
local service, the company might prefer to partner with Bells. That
would allow them to share the cost of installing equipment in
thousands of phone offices and piggyback on each other's marketing.
Even more likely would be Sprint's simply buying access to the
local service equipment, as it has already, said C. Sidney Boren,
BellSouth executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint and BellSouth may also be odds, since long-distance
companies have hoped that use of Internet technology would let them
avoid payment of the access charges they now pay for connecting to
local networks. Federal regulators have said they think Internet
long-distance should include those fees, but have not taken action
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big old dead fish they didn't put in the middle of
the table,'' Boren said.

VATICAN APPOINTS OUTSIDER TO COMMAND SWISS GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Hoping to clean house after the most shocking killings in
its modern history, the Holy See chose an outsider with broad
non-Vatican experience on Tuesday to replace the commander of the
Swiss Guards, who was killed last month by a disgruntled
subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican announced that Pope John Paul II had approved the
selection of Pius Segmueller, 42, a colonel in the Swiss army, to
replace Lt. Col. Alois Estermann.
</P>
<P>
   Estermann was found dead in his Vatican apartment on May 4,
beside the body of his wife and a 23-year-old Swiss Guard, only 10
hours after he had been appointed commander of the papal guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which conducted its own investigation of the crime,
said Estermann and his wife had been shot by the disgruntled young
guard, who suffered ``a moment of madness'' and then killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Guards, who have protected the pope since the 16th
century, now play a largely ceremonial role in their medieval red,
yellow, and blue costumes and plumed helmets. The tragedy brought
the 100-man unit to the world's attention, and subjected it to
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I am a Christian and a believer,'' Segmueller
said, explaining why he had agreed to be considered for the post a
few days after Estermann was slain. ``I also have experience in
police work and security.''
</P>
<P>
   Segmueller, who has led relief teams in Switzerland and Africa,
added: ``And I also have experience in catastrophes.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings _ and the sensation they created _ were devastating
to the Swiss Guards, who are made up of young Swiss Catholics who
live an insular life even by Vatican standards, restricted by the
rules of both the army and the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This news will lift the men's spirits, but there is still a
long way to go,'' said the Rev. Roland-Bernhard Trauffer,
secretary-general of the Swiss Bishops' Conference, which nominates
Swiss Guard commanders for Vatican approval. ``It would be naive to
think the drama didn't leave scars. There are still open wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Trauffer praised Segmueller, a German-speaker who was born in
Lucerne and is married with two children, as a leader whose contact
with the real world would help him in his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He studied and taught history and literature at the University
of Geneva and, as an army officer, served on a U.N. mission in
Namibia. A new deputy commander, Capt. Elmar Theodor Maeder, 35,
who is in the Swiss army and also has no previous Vatican or Swiss
Guard experience, was also appointed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Estermann was killed, the church was seeking to
bring new people into the corps. Estermann, who spent 18 years as a
Swiss Guard and was deputy commander when the top job became
vacant, did not get promoted right away. Instead, the Vatican spent
seven months searching for another candidate, preferably an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders discovered that many of the most promising
candidates among the Swiss nobility, diplomatic corps or military
were not eager to move to Rome for a job that pays little and whose
prestige has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, however, that changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that the tragedy in Switzerland was a
little like the death of Princess Diana in England _ there was a
terrible week of consternation and confusion,'' Trauffer said.
``After that a lot of qualified people realized the importance of
the Swiss Guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Segmueller, who said he had visited Rome a few times as a
tourist, said he knew only what he read in the newspapers about the
pope's army and did not want to prejudge what his task would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to study the situation and take measures,'' he said.
``But I cannot yet say what I must do or not do.''

`THE SIMPLE LIFE' IS SIMPLY ANNOYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to turn over a new gold leaf, Sara Campbell, nee Sara
Lipschitz, has moved her multimillion-dollar business empire to a
farm in upstate New York to experience the domestic ``simplicity''
she espouses on her television show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``The Simple Life'' life isn't simple. Simply
annoying is more like it, with characters as one-dimensional as
white-on-white stationery, punch lines as obvious as antique ducks
amid statice and chintz.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second of two Martha Stewart spoofs on CBS. The
first, Jean Smart's ``Style &AMP; Substance,'' came and went quickly
this winter before the Olympic avalanche. ``The Simple Life'' also
will disappear long before the fall season begins _ a summertime
sacrifice, if you will, and the network's delicate way of saying,
``This turkey is sliced so thin it'll never make a sandwich, let
alone the fall schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the doyenne of domesticity this time is Judith Light,
best known for eight seasons of ``Who's the Boss?'' with Tony
Danza. Surrounded by domestically challenged daughter Freddi
(Ashlee Levitch), demanding mother Muriel (Florence Stanley),
insufferable producer Greg (James Patrick Stuart) and studly farm
foreman Luke (Brett Cullen), Light's character tries to bring order
and simplicity into a rural homestead that looks like one person's
interpretation of what might happen if Laura Ashley exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of explosions, it's not enough that the bombastic
``Nanny'' precedes ``The Simple Life'' on the CBS schedule.
``Nanny'' star and whine connoisseur Fran Drescher helps out in the
pilot episode Wednesday night, playing Fran Fine, former high
school classmate of Ms. Campbell/Lipschitz, in her customary getup
of high heels, high hemline and high volume.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels to ``The Nanny'' are everywhere in ``The Simple
Life,'' in fact. There's the stuffy British guy, played desperately
by Stuart but still this week's best trivia question. (He's the son
of Chad Stuart of Chad &AMP; Jeremy fame, and the guy who was Elaine's
boyfriend who had a thing for the Eagles song ``Desperado'' on an
episode of ``Seinfeld''). There's the smarter-than-the-rest-of-them
hired hand, played painfully by Cullen with an accent that's more a
hybrid of Albany, Ga., and New Albany, Ind. _ and about a day's
drive from upstate New York. And there are three kids: Campbell's
flunkout-prone daughter, Freddi, played smartly by Levitch, and the
precocious nephew and niece of Luke Barton, played precociously by
Ross Malinger and Eliza Dean.
</P>
<P>
   The best of this wilted bouquet is the thorny Stanley, who
re-creates the same Selma Diamond-sound-alike kvetch viewers have
come to know over the years. Stanley has a refined sense of comedy
and the ability to get a laugh without uttering a word; most of her
castmates, including Light, are reciting lines that aren't nearly
as amusing as the show's artificially enhanced laughter suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, a roasted turkey, a horny bull and a docile sheep
were not harmed during filming of the pilot episode. They were not
funny, either, but writers of ``The Simple Life'' apparently were
working with one of the old sitcom manuals, which states: ``When in
doubt, try putting a bull in the kitchen.'' As we all know, more
recent editions have removed that passage and replaced it with:
``When in doubt, go with cleavage.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's Luke who finally has to inform Sara, ``Life ain't
simple, no matter where you live it.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have added: ``Make-believe ain't nearly as funny as the
real Martha Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simple Life. Half-hour comedy about a Martha Stewart-style
self-conglomerate who moves family and firm to the country to find
domestic tranquillity. Premieres Wednesday night, CBS. Check local
listings. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

     OPPONENTS CALL PRAYER AMENDMENT AN
ASSAULT ON LIBERTIES
 &HT;     By EUNICE MOSCOSO 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepares to vote this week on a
constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to school prayer,
opponents of the measure Tuesday called it an affront to civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   The ``so-called Religious Freedom Amendment is the most radical
assault on our liberties I have ever seen in Congress,'' said Barry
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a credible constitutional weapon to those who wish to
turn our schools into mission fields, whether they are members of
the Nation of Islam, the Church of Scientology, the next Heaven's
Gate or the local Baptist Church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., is
scheduled for a House vote on Thursday. It's the first vote of its
kind in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment states that ``the people's right to pray
and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on
public property, including schools, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, is leading opposition to the measure
in the House. He said it is unnecessary and could force a wide
variety of beliefs on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely do not want my two young sons some day exposed to
witchcraft, or satanic, or Branch Davidian prayer in the public
schools of Waco, Texas,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards found out Tuesday that the Christian Coalition has sent
out mailers in his district stating that he is opposed to prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Coalition should be ashamed for sending out such
a hateful mailer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some religious groups are expressing opposition to the
proposed amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give the Christian Coalition a chance to paint their
opponents as ``voting against God,'' said David Saperstein, a rabbi
and director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The vote will be featured on the Coalition's voting scorecard,
which will be distributed to its members later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Elenora Giddings Ivory, a reverend in the Presbyterian church,
said that the amendment is dangerous because schools could not
possibly satisfy all the religious diversity in their classrooms
and would therefore have to choose one religion over others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just among the Christian community there are different forms
of prayer. Pentecostals stand to pray. Catholics and Episcopalians
kneel to pray. Presbyterians bow their heads. In other religious
traditions prayer is done by chanting or lying prostrate on the
ground,'' she said. ``How is a public school to coordinate such
diverse activity?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has also weighed in on the issue of school
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address last week, Clinton said the amendment is
unnecessary because public schools already support voluntary
practice of religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 200 years, the First Amendment has protected our
religious freedom and allowed many faiths to flourish, in our
homes, in our work places and in our schools. Clearly understood
and sensibly applied, it works. It does not need to be rewritten,''
the President said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to the amendment say students can, at their own
volition, have Bible clubs in high schools, wear religious
clothing, read holy scriptures on the bus and in the lunchroom and
say grace over cookies and milk in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that government funding of religious activity is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee ``an ugly battle between religious groups
fighting for government funds, wreaking havoc on the American
tradition of religious liberty for all,'' said Terri Schroeder,
with the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is not expected to gain the two-thirds congressional
majority needed to send a constitutional amendment to the states
for ratification, but opponents say they expect its backers to
continue to push for school-sponsored prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, this fight will be re-fought in the near future, and
once again religious minorities will be forced to fight for their
survival,'' said Ira Forman, executive director of the National
Jewish Democratic Council.

</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10. Parents should be careful with sensitive children,
but unless they are bothered by movies with a lot of smashing
about, there isn't much harm. &QL;

them.) &QL;

   THE TRUMAN SHOW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, and Natascha
McElhone &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Peter Weir &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 102 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a nice seaside town lives a sweet insurance agent, Truman
Burbank ( Carrey). But what Truman doesn't realize is that his life
is the brainchild of Christof, a television wizard (Harris) who has
created a live, real-time drama about Truman that is broadcast
around the world 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Within that lovely stage-set of a town are 5,000 cameras
capturing Truman's every move, thousands of extras, product
placements everywhere and actors playing his wife (Ms. Linney) and
best friend (Emmerich). But after meeting a woman (Ms. McElhone)
who appears oddly uneasy around him, Truman begins to suspect
something is not right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE. A mildly threatening gesture with a sharp kitchen
gadget and several dire scenes of storms at sea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX. None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY. Three or four expletives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10. With no Ace Ventura-type slapstick yuks, this Jim
Carrey movie may well bore and confuse the very young. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-14. Savvier children may enjoy entering Truman's
alternative reality, although subtle satiric content may be over
the heads of most children this age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP. Older teen-agers should find this satire of our
media-obsessed society amusing and thought-provoking. &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ALMOST HEROES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Farley, Matthew Perry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Christopher Guest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 87 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's 1804 and Lewis and Clark are trekking west. Right behind
them, intent on getting to the Pacific Ocean first and cleaning up
on product endorsements, is the team of Edwards (Perry of
``Friends'' fame) and Hunt (Farley, who died last year).
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is the patrician leader with the high-flown rhetoric
about adventure and destiny. Hunt is the odoriferous rough-hewn
type who tries to eat pine cones. Much of their party takes off for
New Orleans, but those who stick it out with Edwards and Hunt get
to be terrorized by a Hollywood bear, go over a 200-foot waterfall
in canoes and be assaulted by stereotypically murderous
conquistadors. But dead ahead out there _ it looks like Malibu. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE. Some scuffles and assaults of the slapstick variety,
none of which would be taken the least bit seriously by even small
children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX. An Indian maiden with an eye for Edwards bathes partly nude
in a woodland stream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY. Less than one would expect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6. The profanity rules it out, but they'd be bored
anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-12. This is the right age, although more sophisticated
older children may turn off at the silliness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP. Farley and Perry have appeal, but the film is
miles beneath most teen-agers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Peter M. Nichols &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Master P, A.J. Johnson, Gretchen Palmer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Martin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 93 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two fast-talking hustlers who operate a so-called shopping
center in an urban slum lot manage to lie their way into possession
of a shipment of cellular phones. Within a short time they are
rolling in unaccustomed wealth, and their customers are talking up
a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the hustlers, the phones are illegally hooked
into a legitimate network, and when the technology falters a
gangster's conversation about $70,000 in cash in an unguarded
locker is broadcast on the radio. The upshot is a neighborhood gold
rush and a contract on the lives of the hustlers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE. Beatings and gunplay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX. Partial nudity, simulated coupling, transvestite
prostitution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY. Incessant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER 13. Under no circumstances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP. Keeping in mind that this is an R-rated movie
(and a poor one), there is no compelling reason for them to see it,
but they have probably experienced similar characters, language and
situations in other films they've seen.

CHICAGO: SECOND TO NONE AS A THEATER TOWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ This is a town where theater companies compete for
advertising space on supermarket bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   There, after the checkout counters, in the foyer of the Treasure
Island or the Jewel Osco, among the offers of free puppies, the
booklets on how to meditate and the offers of housecleaning
services, are the fliers for one-man and one-woman shows, new works
by young playwrights, adaptations of classic novels, even musicals,
being performed in second-floor loft spaces, garages converted to
black boxes and, yes, real theaters with seats that are nailed to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mundane thing, theater in Chicago, pervasive as Polish
sausage. Unlike New York, where, nonprofit companies
notwithstanding, the theater seems part and parcel of a vast
commercial enterprise known as the entertainment business; or Los
Angeles, where, in spite of a sea of local talent, the theater is a
crippled sister to the movies; or a handful of cities like Seattle,
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Washington,
Minneapolis and Houston, where there are accomplished theater
companies but not the critical mass that can commandeer the local
Zeitgeist _ here in Chicago, the theater is a vivid,
attention-getting strand in the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is a theater town; so, of course, is New York. It's
really not true about anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Chicagoans will grudgingly admit that, theatrically
speaking, their city is still second, they are quick to point out
that factors like a more modest living standard and a general lack
of cynicism contribute to an atmosphere that is conducive to both
enthusiasm for putting on a show and the percolation of artistic
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Even though second-largest, Chicago's theater community is
probably the nation's most tightly knit, arguably its most
adventurous and almost certainly its most important incubator of
young talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theaters are possible here,'' said Martha Lavey, the artistic
director of Steppenwolf, the company founded in 1974 that is
probably more responsible than any other for putting Chicago
theater on the map. ``The real estate issue is a factor in New
York. In L.A., the artist issue is a factor. But here, there's a
critical mass of artists. You can get a space. And there's a
funding community that's responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an atmosphere that breeds loyalty among those who were
weaned on it. ``I've been to a lot of theater in New York and L.A.
and all I can say is it's more about the people in Chicago, more
ingrained in the community,'' said the actor David Schwimmer, who
helped found the Lookingglass Theater Company here nine years ago
with several classmates from Northwestern University but who is
best known as Ross on the television series ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwimmer is currently playing the title role in a decidedly
low-budget Look-ingglass adaptation of Dostoyevsky's novel ``The
Idiot,'' in which his familiar, hangdog demeanor, minus the glib
irony, is remarkably effective. ``The audience here really loves
and nurtures theater,'' he said. ``There's no sense of protocol, no
sense of a special occasion, like there is in New York. For most
people, going to the theater here is as casual a thing as going to
a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment that is echoed all over town. And so are its
corollaries: that theater here is about art, not commerce. That
Chicago actors are more concerned with serving the material at hand
than their careers. That elsewhere critics are an enemy, but here
the small corps of reviewers is diligent and generally supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inferiority complex? I don't have it,'' said the director
Mary Zimmerman, 37, who came here from Lincoln, Neb., to attend
Northwestern. Now a Northwestern professor, an artistic associate
at the Goodman Theater, the city's largest nonprofit theater, and a
founding member of Lookingglass, Ms. Zimmerman, a recent recipient
of a MacArthur grant, has a formidable Chicago pedigree. But she
has also brought her athletic, visually vivid adaptations (``The
Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci,'' ``The Arabian Nights'') to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fabulous place to do theater, and particularly to
start doing theater,'' she said. ``For one thing, you can get an
audience. And if you are even remotely organized, you can get
critics to come to see your work at your 35-seat hole-in-the-wall
theater. That just doesn't happen in New York. I'm being
deliberately arrogant. But in my experience, we're not standing
like refugees at the border with hollowed-out eyes, yearning toward
the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   It is merely 25 years since the initial stirrings of the
so-called Off Loop theater movement, an explosion of experimental
stage activity in the mid-1970s that established Chicago as an
alternative to New York as a place for actors and directors to
work, that spawned a blunt and brawny style of acting and writing,
that revived the practice of ensemble work, and that propelled the
careers of, among others, the playwright David Mamet, the director
Frank Galati, the producer Gregory Mosher and actors like Joe
Mantegna, Dennis Franz, Meshach Taylor, William Petersen and those
now-familiar stars who were original members of the Steppenwolf
Theater Company: Laurie Metcalf, John Malkovich, Gary Sinise, Joan
Allen and Glenne Headly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by some estimates, there are as many as 200 different
theater companies in Chicago at any one time, many of them
evanescent but a large majority viable, persistent and, as distinct
from New York, where the commercial theater is king, nonprofit. Of
the 120 theaters, producers and ensemble groups belonging to the
League of Chicago Theaters, the local trade association, only 20
are commercial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly perhaps, Chicago has not been a consistently
profitable stop for Broadway road shows. Nonetheless, a study of
the local theater market commissioned by the city government last
summer concluded that with a metro area population of nearly 8
million, Chicago is being underserved by commercial theater
producers.

MCCAIN (Washington) _ It r eally is no coincidence that Sen. John

seems to possess some of the qualities that characterized Goldwater
(i.e., a blunt ``maverick'' streak, concern for the environment,
attention toIndian causes.). More than most, McCain cherishes role
models and he sought to emulate two in particular: Goldwater and
former Rep. Mo Udall, D-Ariz. McCain proudly possesses Goldwater's
old desk in his office, inviting the comparison. ``I do beli eve
that when it comes to conscience and integrity, we do have somebody

 CHICAGO: theater producers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The findings must have been a relief to officials; the city is
optimistically helping outside entertainment companies rebuild two
theaters as part of its massive effort to reinvigorate the
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Through a plan known as tax-increment financing _ by which the
city provides incentive money to developers in anticipation of
being repaid in the form of increased real estate taxes _ the city
contributed $17.6 million to a renovation, by Fox Theatricals of
St. Louis, of the 2,300-seat Palace Theater and $13.5 million to a
renovation of the Oriental Theater by Livent, the Toronto-based
company, which is to present ``Ragtime'' there in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the city six commercial theaters downtown
(including the Civic Opera House, home of the Lyric Opera between
September and April, but currently housing ``The Phantom of the
Opera''), a total of more than 16,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city has contributed $18.8 million to the
construction of a new downtown home for the venerable Goodman
Theater, which has been housed at the Art Institute of Chicago
since 1925, and in conjunction with the State of Illinois, $14.5
million for a new lakefront home for the 10-year-old Shakespeare
Repertory Company, the only all-Shakespeare-all-the-time company in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   How the new theater district will affect the life of the theater
here is unclear. This is a place where ``Beauty and the Beast,''
Disney's extravaganza, had a disappointing run this winter, but
where ``Co-Ed Prison Sluts,'' the signature gross-out comedy of the
tiny Annoyance Theater Company, has been a late-night hit for
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also where the Court Theater, a 20-year-old Equity company
affiliated with the University of Chicago that has aspirations to
become a national center for classic theater, had to extend four of
five productions this season, including Euripides' ``Iphigenia''
plays and Chekhov's ``Cherry Orchard.'' It is where Frank Galati,
as a director at Steppenwolf and the Goodman and as a teacher at
Northwestern, created a local tradition of adapting classic novels
to the stage (remember his Tony-winning version of ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' in 1990).
</P>
<P>
   And it is where there are a handful of black theater companies
(including Chicago Theater and Onyx), at least two Hispanic
companies (Teatro Vista and Latino Chicago), at least one Asian
company (Angel Island) and one devoted to gay- and lesbian-themed
plays (About Face).
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where Schwimmer, Petersen and John Mahoney, all
local actors who made it big in Hollywood, are now on stage at the
theaters that gave them their starts. (Mahoney is starring in ``The
Man Who Came to Dinner'' at Steppenwolf; Petersen is in
``Flyovers,'' a new play by a Chicago playwright, Jeffrey Sweet, at
Victory Gardens Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a place where unproven talents are taken
seriously, as they rarely are anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a place where only one television series
(``Early Edition'') is filmed, and where movie companies come to
shoot only sporadically, resulting in a loss of talent to both
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some 1,400 members of Actors' Equity, the stage
actors' union, live here, 25 percent of whom, said Kathryn Lamkey,
the director of the union's central region, make their entire
living onstage. And if that doesn't sound like a great number, it
does constitute a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I always felt that the whole Chicago acting pool was
our company,'' said Michael Maggio, an associate artistic director
of the Goodman, referring to Robert Falls, the artistic director of
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1959 that Bernard Sahlins, Paul Sills and Howard Alk
started the Second City, a revue theater with a company that
included Barbara Harris and Alan Arkin and that would go on to
produce the likes of John Belushi, Dan Ayckroyd and Bill Murray.
(The name was taken in defiance of A.J. Liebling, who used the
phrase sneeringly about the city in The New Yorker.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, William Sickinger established what would be the city's
first conventional theater company on the North Side, away from the
downtown business district known as the Loop. But it wasn't until a
decade or so later that a theatrical community began to take root,
when several new companies _ including Victory Gardens, St.
Nicholas and Body Politic _ came into being.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet's play ``Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' had its
premiere at the Organic Theater in 1974; Steppenwolf began life the
same year, putting on its first shows in a church basement in
suburban Highland Park. They shared a softball league, several bars
as hangouts and a predilection for ensemble work and long rehearsal
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just found it valuable to go about the business of
creating something without knowing if you'd actually be able to
produce it,'' Petersen recalled of the early days at Victory
Gardens, where he earned his Equity card in 1979, and whose current
artistic director, Dennis Zacek, has been there from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why all this started,'' Zacek said. ``I guess it
was because the Goodman was so influenced by New York. Everyone who
performed there came from New York. Victory Gardens' purpose was to
develop theater in Chicago. And 25 years later, we've done some
developing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flyovers'' is typical of its work: its cast of four _
Petersen, Amy Morton, Mark Vann and Linda Reiter _ are all Chicago
actors. The playwright, Sweet, is from here. The play, set in an
Ohio town, is about the aftermath of a high school reunion attended
by a man who is a television film critic not unlike the Chicagoan
Gene Siskel.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gardens has grown a bit; it has become a midsize
theater, one of a vanishing breed, putting on five shows a year
with an annual budget of about $1.5 million and controlling two
200-seat theaters and two small studio spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're the Shuberts of Lincoln Avenue,'' Zacek said with
a laugh, adding more seriously: ``We're one of the few survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked in interviews about the apparent theater boom here,
many theater executives ticked off a number of companies that have
folded in the last few years: Wisdom Bridge, Body Politic, the
National Jewish Theater and the Candlelight Dinner Playhouse.

 CHICAGO: Dinner Playhouse.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is Steppenwolf, now ending its 23rd
full season, which has gone from being a subversive cultural force
to an established institution, with a budget of $5.3 million and a
subscriber base of more than 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who will look at what we do now and say
`Sellout,' '' Ms. Lavey acknowledged. ``But one can't forever
maintain the outsider renegade position. After 23 years of life,
it's attendant upon one to take the adult position. After all, the
institution is just recapitulating where the individuals are in
their lives. They are 40-year-olds with children and mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   Steppenwolf has become an icon in the city and, because of its
reputation both as theater and star-making ensemble, the model for
emerging companies, from Lookingglass to the six-year old Roadworks
to even younger groups like Streetsigns and Shattered Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what Steppenwolf was able to do and seeing its growth
in the 80s was a motivation for us,'' said David Kersnar, the
artistic director of Lookingglass, which still does not have its
own theater despite an increased annual budget of $800,000. ``And
it was a motivation to stay in Chicago, knowing the city does
nurture ensembles.''
</P>
<P>
   Roadworks' tough, edgy productions of Mike Leigh's ``Ecstasy''
and Patrick Marber's ``Dealer's Choice,'' two British writers, have
led many theater professionals here to anoint it as the next hot
ensemble. It may be the prototype Chicago ensemble _ talented,
fortunate and ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Roadworks was started by a handful of Northwestern theater
students who graduated without the promise of jobs when they
recreated their campus production of ``Road'' by Jim Cartwright,
another British writer, in a rented garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bake sales, washed cars, wrote letters to everyone we
knew for money,'' said Debbie Bisno, the artistic director. ``And
we raised 5,000 bucks. We were playing for maybe four people a
night, but we got reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company's annual budget has reached $110,000, and it
produces at least two shows a year, concentrating on appealing to
the jittery sensibility of the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do `Long Day's Journey,' you know?'' said Ms. Bisno,
27, whose plans for the company include film production and a
branch in Los Angeles. ``We've always stuck to productions
appropriate to our age, signature pieces for 20-somethings. And
we've always envisioned ourselves as bigger than we are. I totally
admire what Steppenwolf has done. If we could emulate that ...''
Her words trailed off, the thought complete.
</P>
<P>
   Emulation of the larger and better known is also what the city
is attempting downtown, where the idea is to recreate an
entertainment district _ it has been in decline since the 1960s _
by constructing the nation's most prominent theater district west
of Broadway. Ostensibly, the theaters will attract restaurants,
retailers, even residences; the city expects the new theaters to
create 5,000 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Broadway can send enough product to interest Chicagoans
is a question. A second is whether a raft of Broadway-style shows
will draw patrons away from Chicago's homegrown theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nonprofit executives shrug and say they suspect that
their audiences don't overlap too much with those that would flock
to see ``The Lion King'' or ``Jekyll and Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one, Barbara Gaines, the artistic director of the
Shakespeare Rep, which is getting its own new theater on Navy Pier
right on Lake Michigan, sounds as gleeful and optimistic as a kid
putting up a flier in a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fantastic what's happening,'' she said. ``I feel
absolutely no paranoia about these theaters coming in. I think the
suburbs, for them, are an untapped audience. And I think if our
work continues to be good, there will be funding for it and
audiences too. You want a New York versus Chicago? I'll give you a
versus. There's more hope here.''

FRIENDS GRAMM, McCAIN BUTT HEADS OVER TOBACCO BILL 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. Phil Gramm ran for president a few years
ago, one of his earliest backers was John McCain, an Arizona
Republican who broke ranks with many Senate colleagues supporting
GOP front-runner Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Gramm, R-Texas, isn't lending a helping hand as
McCain tries to marshal support for the ambitious and controversial
anti-tobacco bill being considered by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has been one of the most vocal critics of McCain's bill,
arguing that its $1.10-a-pack price increase for cigarettes would
impose an unfair burden on lower-income smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has further complicated McCain's attempts to win approval
of the bill by offering an amendment that would return in tax
breaks almost all the revenue generated by the tobacco price
increase. Gramm has proposed eliminating the marriage penalty,
which gives some couples a smaller standard deduction than singles,
for spouses earning less than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut proposal has the potential of alienating what is
already a fragile coalition of Democrats and moderate GOP lawmakers
supporting the anti-smoking measure.
</P>
<P>
   The measure calls for the tobacco revenue to be used to help
states defray Medicaid costs related to smoking and fund other
health and anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Gramm have denied that their differences over the
tobacco bill have hurt their longtime relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been friends before this and they will be friends
after this,'' said Gramm spokesman Larry Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm recently said that if McCain were to run for president he
couldn't imagine supporting anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that he is not angry at Gramm and some other
conservatives who have opposed his legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have strongly held views. I treat them with
respect and they treat me with respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gramm, McCain and two other lawmakers huddled for an
hour to try to work out a compromise on the tax issue, with McCain
saying he could support more modest tax breaks. Neal said the
senators did not reach an agreement but will continue the
negotiations later this week.
</P>
<P>
   As currently conceived, Gramm's amendment could cost as much as
$50 billion over five years, which critics contend would make
impossible to fund any other programs with the tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that the
inclusion of a tax break could improve the prospects for the bill
because it might draw more support from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, Neal said that even the Senate's adoption of the
marriage penalty provision would not necessarily guarantee that
Gramm would vote for the entire tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain indicated that he hopes to move to end debate on the
measure sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Senate can afford to have extended debate
forever. We have other pressing issues,'' he said. It requires 60
votes to end debate in the 100-member Senate. McCain said he was
optimistic but not sure that he had the votes to bring his bill to
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, the Senate will likely consider a number of
amendments. McCain has proposed that $3 billion be allocated over
five years to help veterans with smoking-related illnesses, an
amendment that is not expected to generate much opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers will also consider a move to toughen penalties on
the tobacco companies if youth smoking is not reduced and a
proposal to remove federal price supports for tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear when the Senate will take up the issues. On
Wednesday many lawmakers are flying to Arizona to attend the
funeral of former Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Senate interrupted debate on the tobacco issue
to take up another measure regarding storage of nuclear waste. &QL;

YELTSIN URGES BUSINESSMEN TO USE THEIR MONEY TO STEADY MARKETS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin gathered the nation's most
powerful businessmen at the Kremlin on Tuesday and urged them to
use their money to help steady Russia's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our own investors do not put their money in, foreigners
leave,'' Yeltsin warned the businessmen. ``If you want foreign
investors to put their money in, you must put in yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank will hold an important treasury bill
auction on Wednesday. The sale has emerged as an important
bellwether for the government, which worries that the failure to
sell all of the bills will further unnerve jittery investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin went out of its way Tuesday to underscore Yeltsin's
appeal, which was made in a closed-door session. The presidential
request was made public by a Russian news service reporter who was
allowed into part of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Yeltsin listened to the businessmen's pleas for
lower rail and energy tariffs. Some bankers at the sessions also
urged the Kremlin to threaten bankruptcy proceedings against
deadbeat creditors.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's financial crisis comes to a head, Yeltsin is
striving to assure foreign investors and skeptical voters that
Russia's economic situation is under control.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting the support of Russia's hard-hit but still powerful
businessmen is the key. Dispelling the impression that Russia is
run by a part-time president is also an important part of the
Kremlin's public relations campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting began with bit of political theater.
</P>
<P>
   As the financiers assembled before a cordon of television
cameras, Yeltsin turned to Anatoly Chubais, the former Kremlin aide
he sent to Washington last week to appeal for additional
international financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did my telephone calls help?'' Yeltsin asked, referring to an
earlier appeal to President Clinton. Chubais dutifully agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the mantle of a strong leader, Yeltsin also promised to
present an ``anti-crisis program'' by the end of the month. The
plan will be disclosed at a rare meeting in the Kremlin's Marble
Hall. Yeltsin summoned deputies from the upper and lower houses of
Parliament to the session.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obtaining Western aid is still vital to restoring the
confidence of investors, Russian officials say. And weeks of
deliberations and negotiations still appear to lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and other Western officials are trying to hammer out an
aid plan, but they are moving at a deliberate pace.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals under consideration include an $8-billion to
$10-billion reserve fund administered by the International Monetary
Fund to help Russia's central bank buttress the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials are also discussing other financial
arrangements, including one that would help compensate the Russians
for the toll that declining oil prices have taken on Russian
exports. As part of the aid effort, future World Bank disbursement
could be also be advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critical are the economic reforms the Russian will be
asked to undertake in return. American officials have made it clear
that the additional financing will be ``conditional,'' a
stipulation that appears intended to insulate the Clinton
administration from criticism that it is giving the Russians
something for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the clouds were dark on Tuesday. The Yeltsin government
received a rare bit of good news when shares on the volatile Moscow
stock exchange rose 12 percent. But brokers played down the
significance, noting that trading was very light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going down on zero volume and going up on zero volume,''
said Tom Ashead, the co-director of research for United Financial
Group. ``The significance of this is that the market does not know
what to do and where to go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yeltsin's meeting with the businessmen lasted for an hour and 40
minutes. It brought together 10 power brokers, including oil
company executives, bankers and the heads of major financial
industrial groups. The heads of some of the financial consortiums
included Vladimir Potanin of Interros, Mikhail Fridman of Alfa
Group, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky of Rosprom.
</P>
<P>
   The business barons have often fought among themselves, as they
jockeyed to control the spoils of the former Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   Fridman said in an interview that his bank was doing its share
to invest in Russia: it bought $100 million in treasury bills last
week just before the IMF disclosed that it planned to disburse the
next $670-million installment of its $10-billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin said in an interview that Yeltsin underscored the need
to work together to cope with financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the point that we are in the same boat and that we
have to coordinate because of the very serious situation in the
economy,'' Potanin said.

BIOLOGIST APPLYING HIS SCIENCE ON CAPITOL HILL

 By CARL HULSE   New York Times Regional Newspaper Group   c.1998
N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Biologist Gary K. Meffe is undertaking one of his
most ambitious experiments yet _ moving the science of conservation
out of the field and off the pages of obscure technical journals
into the corridors of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meffe, an adjunct professor at the University of Florida who
edits the bimonthly periodical ``Conservation Biology,'' is in the
forefront of a move to inject more hard scientific research and
analysis into the usually politically and economically driven
debates over endangered species and public land use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation biology _ as a science, a society, and a journal
_ needs to do a better job of informing environmental policy and
policy makers,'' Meffe wrote in the February issue. ``We cannot
simply wait and hope that the knowledge we generate will be adopted
by decision makers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old expert in aquatic biology is certainly heeding
his own advice. At two high-profile Washington events earlier this
year, he bolstered national conservation organizations as they
first criticized a key federal policy on species preservation and
then promoted legislation to limit logging in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Meffe doesn't see himself as an advocate, but more as the holder
of knowledge that it would be irresponsible to keep from those
shaping federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we are scientists and need to remain
objective, dispassionate,'' he said in an interview. ``On the other
hand, the information we have and produce, the things we see and
know about are very relevant to how society gets along in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong with taking scientific knowledge
and arguing a particular point to legislation if that knowledge has
bearing on it,'' he said. ``You get into trouble as a scientist if
you go beyond that and are arguing from personal feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of science as a tool in advancing legislation and
policy is related to the increasing complexity of the issues
confronting Congress, issues that can't always be addressed in
simple political terms. Decisions on subjects like global warming,
ecosystem preservation, ozone depletion, pesticide regulation call
out for some scientific rationale.
</P>
<P>
   True policy advocates say the support of respected scientists
such as Meffe can enhance the credibility of their cause with
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tremendously helpful,'' said Carl Ross, executive
director of Save America's Forests and a force behind the logging
proposal. ``It lets members of Congress know that there are
solutions to these many confusing problems. They get so many
different messages from different interests groups and this shows
the scientific community is backing this approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The forest coalition, which wants to halt timbering on millions
of acres of national forests and limit it on millions more,
marshaled an impressive list of more than 600 scientists to back
its bill. They included renowned primate expert Jane Goodall and
Harvard entomologist E.O. Wilson, a Pulitzer Prize winner, as well
as Meffe.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists argued that extensive clear-cutting of forests is
shattering ecosystems, putting thousands of species at risk and
permanently degrading natural resources in the immediate rush for
goods and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed with the credentials of the
scientific support for the bill introduced by Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., thus illustrating a problem with citing science
in such policy fights: all sides are typically able to muster
scientific justification for their position.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the forest bill suggested its backers simply
assembled an all-star cast of scientists who embrace the
conventional views of the environmental establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `scientists' involved in Sen. Torricelli's photo op are
not qualified based upon their research and expertise to evaluate
the proper management of the national forests,'' complained Sen.
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Other forestry experts said the timbering the group is trying to
halt is essential to the health of the forests and the nation at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of science within the forest service
that contends harvesting is an appropriate and sustainable
activity,'' said Bill Banzaff, executive director of the Society of
American Foresters. ``A broad brush approach to management policies
in our national forest doesn't make a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meffe understands there are competing views but he is
comfortable with his. And his view is a sought after one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Meffe is considered one of the leaders in the field of
conservation biology,'' said Laura Hood, director of science at
Defenders of Wildlife, a group that enlisted Meffe's help in
pointing up flaws in a federal endangered species policy. ``There
is a powerful voice there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in New Jersey, Meffe received undergraduate and graduate
degrees in zoology from Rutgers College and his doctorate from
Arizona State University. He said he wasn't ``a birdwatcher or a
frog chaser'' as a youth but was steered into conservation biology
by his college studies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985-97, he was an ecologist at the Savannah River Ecology
Laboratory associated with the University of Georgia. But when he
was named editor of the journal of the Society of Conservation
Biology in 1997, he chose to relocate the publication to the
University of Florida, where he had done post-doctoral work as the
Archie Carr Fellow in the mid-1980s. He said he sacrificed salary
and a full professorship to return to an area he and his wife,
Nancy, love. They live near Micanopy on 10 acres they share with
rare gopher tortoises.
</P>
<P>
   While not the type of reading material found at supermarket
check-out lines, Conservation Biology is highly regarded among
those in the field, sort of a New England Journal of Medicine for
conservationists. With an international circulation of about 6,000,
the magazine is packed with academic papers and essays on a subject
of increasing scientific and popular interest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the journal, Meffe is known as the author of the premier
textbook on conservation biology. And in addition to his new
profile in Washington, Meffe has another federal connection _ he is
one of the instructors for a week-long training course on ecosystem
management for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees. The heads
of the agency will take it later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meffe sees conservation biology becoming of critical importance
in the years ahead as mankind grapples with its interaction with
and impact upon nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost a very selfish applied science,'' he said. ``It
is not opposed to humans and what we do. In fact, it is a long term
vision of how humans can get along on the planet without
substantially degrading the very resources that support us.''

VALLEY FLING WITH SPRING WELL DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Ow! Ooh, eeh, ah, ooh, eeh, ah!
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? If you walk out barefoot to the carport to
retrieve your paper in the morning, it should.
</P>
<P>
   Those noises are the sounds of pain, the burning sensation one
suffers whenever . . .
</P>
<P>
   This is beginning to sound like a commercial for some kind of
intimate-hygiene product. You know, one of those crucial but
humiliating creams or salves you have to wear a disguise to the
drugstore to buy? And then you buy another item _ usually yet
another gross of dental floss _ that you don't even need, as a
diversion for the checkout person?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. The burning sensation is the pain in your toes and feet
from the blistering concrete, a sure sign that summer heat is
finally here.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this year it took its t ime. It's a shame that El Nino
caused all the problems it did in California and that certain
vegetables are now so expensive they have to be appraised by a
jeweler before they can be displayed in the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But I sure loved the spring.
</P>
<P>
   That all ended Tuesday, when Phoenix had its first 100-degree
day.
</P>
<P>
   Spring here this year was like a weather wonderland. If you grew
up back East, you remember the joy of a snow day. But do you also
recall the futile hope that the shor t-term vacation might be
extended for another day or two beyond the original snowfall? (This
usually ran parallel to the realization that you had a 10-page book
report due the next day and hadn't started the book.)
</P>
<P>
   It almost never happened. But
</P>
<P>
   this spring, all those childhood wishes came true, only in a
slightly different form. Maybe the sub-100-degree weather will last
a little longer, we told ourselves all of April and May, knowing
that it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   But it did. We had, for one bright, shining moment, actually
interesting weather.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's over. Break out the car shades, folks, we're back in
the oven.
</P>
<P>
   One group that should be happy is the gaggle of television
meteorologists. I never noticed this before I wrote a column about
El Nino and its soothing effects on our weather, but several
readers pointed out that the forecasting folks really seem to love
the heat.
</P>
<P>
   (Frankly, I never much noticed the weather forecast at all.
Seems to me it's the k ind of thing they could wrap up in about 10
seconds: ``It's going to be 106 degrees tomorrow. Wear cool
clothing. Now, on to our expanded sports coverage. . . .'' Who
cares what the weather is like in Tulsa?)
</P>
<P>
   The readers were right. Several times I saw meteorologists
prognosticate a cool, wet day with the same frown normally reserved
for an anchorperson reporting on a missing dog. Don't worry, they
would say. Chin up. In just a few weeks, we'll be back up around
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Norma l? Burning blisters on your hands from the steering wheel
of your car is normal. Who wants that?

   ``It's a knock we all get,'' Sean McLaughlin, meteorologist for
Channel 12 (KPNX), said, laughing and quoting Lincoln (the ``you
can fool all of th e people some of the time'' bit, fitting for a
forecaster).
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was a good sport. He assumed I was calling to take
meteorologists to task for not being able to correctly predict the
first 100-degree day. Not at all. Although I was rem inded of the
old saw about a stopped clock being right twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to have enjoyed the lower temperatures as much as
anyone, even if he can't crow about them. ``El Nino for us has been
absolutely fabulous,'' he said, ``but the min ute I say that, I
hear from a thousand allergy sufferers.''
</P>
<P>
   And he says he's not exactly pining for hotter weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't hit (100 degrees), I'm glad I'm wrong,'' he said.
``I'm glad. It has been a fabulous spring.''
</P>
<P>
   An d now, summer heat. For McLaughlin, endless days of sunshine
mean an additional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I keep things entertaining when I'm saying the same
thing every day?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, it means something else: Ow! &QL;

`HARVEY MILK': ALMOST RISES TO REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.))   (For release Sunday, June 7.) 
(ja)  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fad for headline opera, a genre that began so promisingly in
1987 with John Adams' ``Nixon in China'' and fizzled last year with
Michael Daugherty's ``Jackie O,'' seems to have passed. Breathe a
sigh of relief, knowing that we have been spared operas based on
O.J., Tonya, and Paula.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a new recording of ``Harvey Milk'' (Teldec 0630-15856-2; two
CDs), with music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie,
shows that the attempt to link the opera house to the nightly news
may have been a missed opportunity rather than a cynical marketing
strategy. Sensationalism did not kill headline opera; opera has
always thrived on shock. It was the dead hand of operatic tradition
that undermined the attempt to give opera a contemporary relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey Milk,'' which was performed first at the Houston Grand
Opera, in 1995, and soon thereafter at the New York City Opera, is
a good test for headline opera. The story it tells, of the events
leading up to the 1978 assassination of the San Francisco
supervisor who created the first successful gay political movement
in the United States, presents all the elements needed to inspire
pity and terror. In its interplay of personal tragedy with broader
political forces, it recalls ``Boris Godunov'' or ``Don Carlos,''
yet its characters _ drag queens, militant lesbians and emerging
ethnic politicians _ and American locales are utterly contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   The story has also been told in other media. ``The Mayor of
Castro Street,'' a 1982 book by Randy Shilts and an important
source for Korie's libretto, is a masterpiece of print journalism.
``The Times of Harvey Milk,'' an Oscar-winning documentary by
Robert Epstein and Richard Schmeichen, offers images and voices of
the real characters, and captures the political turbulence of the
era. ``Execution of Justice,'' an intensely focused play by Emily
Mann, re-enacts the grotesquely mismanaged trial of Dan White,
Milk's political nemesis and killer.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, unfortunately, is the one version of the story that
seems unworthy of its subject. But the fault may lie as much with
the nature of opera today as with the shortcomings of the actual
words and music. A libretto may place contemporary characters on
the stage, but it seems nearly impossible to find an operatic idiom
that will sustain them. As soon as they start to sing, the
characters lose their connection to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century opera moved easily between the mythic and the
real in subject matter, and the refined and the popular in music.
Censorship imbued costume dramas with political relevance by
forcing audiences to read them as allegories. Today, realism is the
province of film and television. Opera seems an increasingly remote
artificial paradise, remote in both subject matter and musical
style.
</P>
<P>
   Headline opera and minimalist music promised to rebridge this
gap, but even in ``Nixon in China,'' artifice prevails over the
real. The Chinese characters, who for Western audiences are merely
icons to begin with, are entirely convincing, but where is Tricky
Dick? Adams' music gains its power by a relentless consistency, but
its sleek surfaces and symphonic proportions smooth out the rough
edges of its protagonist, who is a mere shadow of the terrifying
figure portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's ``Nixon.''
Movies can do close-ups. In opera, characters are dwarfed by the
stage, unless they are given music that transcends physical
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Korie pursue a riskier, more epic path in ``Harvey
Milk.'' Instead of constructing the opera as a tight drama, like
Ms. Mann's play, they present it as a civic pageant, part
martyrology, part history lesson. They lead the audience
didactically from the age of the closet, through the Stonewall
riots of 1969 to Milk's political rise, triumph, and tragic demise.
The libretto is full of incidents from Shilts' book; indeed, many
of them go by so fast that listeners should read the book first, at
least if they want to know the identity of Medora Payne, an
11-year-old political supporter of Milk's, or the significance of
matzoh brei to Milk's love life. But in this approach, the whole is
more important than the parts. Milk and White are less characters
than emblems. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Milk's life immediately became a legend, Shilts notes at the end
of his book, because ``it already existed in the lives and minds of
millions of gays.'' The operatic Harvey, despite the heavy use of
details from the real story, is a legendary figure far removed from
the person Shilts writes about, and it is hard to tell to what
extent the change was driven by political agendas and to what
extent by operatic habits.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Milk is a born activist, athletic, theatrical,
extravagant: a soul brother to his contemporaries Abby Hoffman and
Jerry Rubin. He became sexually active at 14 and easily filled his
life with a succession of thin young men who were flattered by his
romantic attention, intelligence, and energy.
</P>
<P>
   His promiscuity reveals more about his political drives than
about his sexual proclivities. The mostly unworthy objects of his
affection _ newly arrived in the big city, after having been thrown
out by their families, and often addicted to alcohol or drugs _
kindled Milk's compassion. His militancy grew less from any
suffering of his own than from his sensitivity to the suffering of
others. His compassion was also a political weapon, allowing him to
forge alliances beyond the homosexual constituency. His smile,
which made him sexually and politically attractive, was that of
someone surprised and empowered by his own happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The operatic Milk is an altogether different being, a whining
Jewish mama's boy. The opera begins and ends with the wailing of
the Kaddish, the mourner's prayer, and Harvey's mother floats into
the action periodically to remind him of the Holocaust; no wonder
he moved from Long Island to San Francisco. As a young man, Harvey
seems sexually insecure and ridden with guilt (an image belied by
beefcake photos of Milk and his boyfriends in Shilts' book). The
emphasis on the Holocaust serves the political legend. Dan White
and the cops are Nazis; the singer who plays White first appears as
a policeman who entraps the young Harvey in New York's Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto also tidies up Milk's domestic arrangements for
political purposes. His hollow promiscuity is connected to his
years as a closeted, clean-cut Wall Street investor. On the night
of Stonewall he meets Scott Smith, a radical hippie, who converts
him to political activism, then becomes his self-styled wife. In
fact, though Smith remained Milk's business partner, they were
lovers only for a short time, but political legends, gay or
straight, seem to require puritanical whitewashing.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is the opera's continued, almost comic
insistence on Milk's sexual insecurity. As if desperate for
affection, Harvey asks Smith why he sticks around; since the
opera's Harvey was portrayed in the San Francisco opera production
recorded here by the handsome Robert Orth, it is hard to believe
that those lines did not elicit catcalls. The opera relentlessly
reduces Milk from an activist to a victim, the creation of a
political movement rather than its creator, either because its
political ideology demands that he be a martyr from start to finish
or because his musical voice is a whimper when it should be a bang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dan White, meanwhile, emerges as a cartoon devil. There is no
room here for Shilts' or Ms. Mann's nuanced portrait of the
all-American boy gone terribly wrong. Instead, the opera turns to a
caricature that too often smacks of reverse racism and snobbery.
White seems to be condemned simply because he is an Irish Catholic,
watches television from his Barcalounger and eats Twinkies.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. White was the negative image of
Milk's identity politics, representing his constituents as
partisanly as Milk represented the Castro district. If Milk's
people were victims, White would claim, so were his people, driven
out of their neighborhoods by real-estate speculators. More
sinister, White was the tragic pawn of a political struggle between
old and new San Francisco that he barely understood. His rage may
have been fueled by Milk's greater political acumen, but his script
was being written by the fat cats downtown. According to Shilts,
White was their weapon against an emerging liberal consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's score has powerful moments, especially at the end,
when it sounds the perfect mournful tone. But it is plagued by an a
tin ear for vernacular speech and a chronic shortness of breath.
Korie's libretto provides many opportunities for strong musical
numbers, two love duets for Harvey and Scott, a mad scene for
White, two political rallies and a surrealistic vision of closeted
life in the '50s. But although Wallace often uses Adamsian
ostinatos in the orchestra, his vocal lines are twisted in an older
expressionist manner strangely at odds with pungently vernacular
lines like: ``Mama, I've slept with over a thousand men. If you
don't know by now, I'm gay, queer, feigelah _ different.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Wallace should have delivered one great love
song and a memorable gay anthem, but they just don't happen. Worse,
none of the lead characters is given a distinctive musical profile.
Harvey, sung here by Robert Orth; Scott, sung by Bradley Williams;
and Dan, sung by Raymond Very, for all their differences in
personality, age, and background, just sound like opera singers,
painfully trying to enunciate the street language and negotiate
their fussy musical lines without sacrificing a technique of bel
canto that comes from another world.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, and without conviction, the opera aims for greater
musical contrast through quotation. The opening chords of ``Tosca''
appear whenever Harvey goes to the opera house. ``The Rite of
Spring'' rumbles under the Stonewall riot, and White's speeches
dredge up memories of ``Nixon in China,'' but these are all
hit-and-run devices that mainly expose the lameness of Wallace's
own material. And when, at the end of the opera, we hear the taped
voice of Milk reading his political will, the dramatic power of the
moment painfully reveals Wallace's failure to give the opera's lead
character a voice with any similar power and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Musical success for this opera would have required a more daring
eclecticism than Wallace was evidently willing to try: an
eclecticism that does not have to be imagined, because it is
already there in works like ``Trouble in Tahiti'' and ``Mass.'' If
only Leonard Bernstein had lived to set this libretto rather than
wasting his efforts on the narcissistic psychodrama of ``A Quiet
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein might well have known how to bring down the walls of
the opera closet, the walls that trap the genre in singing styles
and musical forms from a distant past. The story demands the tragic
scale of opera, the intimate sophistication of cabaret, the
insouciance of pop, the utopian political drive of '60s rock. And
more than anything else, it demands the kind of melodic warmth and
memorability that brings the constituency it is celebrating into
the opera house to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite its flaws, ``Harvey Milk'' contains moments that
are touching and zany and contemporary in ways that we are used to
on the stage but hardly ever encounter in the opera house. And as
it reaches its tragic conclusion, the opera suddenly feels both
wrenching in its pain and heroic in its politics: the equivalent of
the message of hope that Milk so skillfully repeated at the end of
his campaign speeches. At these moments ``Harvey Milk'' seems to
open possibilities for a vital, risk-taking musical theater, free
from the oppressions of tradition, good taste and ``Masterpiece
Theater'' restorationism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps headline opera just needs a few more years and a few
more honorable failures to realize its initial promise to
revitalize a 400-year-old art form.

     HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY U.S. ILL-PREPARED FOR
BIO-TERRORISM
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Experts now regard the threat of a terror attack
against U.S. civilians involving chemical or biological weapons as
``no longer a matter of if, but of when,'' a top health official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that in addition to bombs, today's terrorists can
choose among highly dangerous agents, including chemical and
biological agents,'' James Hughes, director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Infectious Diseases,
told a Senate subcommittee. ``An attack with a biological or
chemical weapon used to be considered very unlikely, but now seems
entirely possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes added that in recent years, CDC investigators attempting
to explain the causes of mystery outbreaks have been forced to
consider whether sickness was the work of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This possibility arose during the investigations of the 1993
outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States, the
1994 outbreak of plague in India and even the 1995 outbreak of
Ebola hemorrhagic fever'' in Zaire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others added that an infectious disease, deliberately
released by terrorists in the United States, might spread
throughout the country before it is recognized. By then, waves of
``second generation'' illness could already have begun among health
workers and others exposed to the initial victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply nothing that scares the hell out of me like
this issue,'' said Michael T. Osterholm, an Iowa public health
official who testified as a representative of the American Society
for Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy last month,
President Clinton announced that he was ordering government
agencies to prepare for ``nontraditional'' threats, such as
bioterrorism and computer sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing was conducted by the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on labor, health and human services. However, the only
member of the subcommittee to attend the two-hour affair was Sen.
Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C. He explained that Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee, was recovering from heart
surgery and other members were attending the Arizona funeral of
former Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials, as well as state and local health officials, told
Faircloth that the best defense against a bioterrorist attack would
be a strengthened and upgraded national public health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be like a battle tank that we need to win a war but has
the ability to be a very efficient school bus,'' said Ed Thompson,
state health officer of Mississippi and a member of the Association
of State and Territorial Health Officials.
</P>
<P>
   CDC's Hughes said that in addition to laboratory facilities and
training to quickly identify a deliberately released infectious
disease, health officials may need secure telephone lines. Some
experts have warned that widespread panic growing out of a
terrorist attack could jam conventional communication systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although deadly pathogens such as anthrax and biological toxins
such as botulinim are traditionally pictured as the weapons of a
bioterrorist attack, those diseases do not spread beyond the
initial victims, several witnesses told Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   But deliberately released smallpox virus, plague bacteria or
some other pathogen might spread widely before it is ever detected,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought something like this would be some
sweeping, instant panic, but you're saying it will be a creeping
attack among our citizens, aren't you?'' Faircloth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are very fortunate and we are someday attacked by a
naive terrorist ... if we are lucky enough to get dumb terrorists,
they might detonate an anthrax bomb over a packed sports stadium or
release botulinim in an airport,'' said Thompson. ``But a
sophisticated terrorist could release smallpox virus in Jackson,
Miss., or Omaha, Neb., and we would see an ill-defined pattern of
disease that could be spread over our entire population before we
even recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth asked Hughes how many scientists CDC has working on
plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, when the outbreak occurred in India ... '' Hughes
started to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about 1994,'' Faircloth drawled. ``I want to know
about nineteen-ninety-now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes then repeated that the CDC had only one plague laboratory
specialist in 1994 when an epidemic of pneumonic plague, which is
spread from person to person like a common cold, appeared in the
Indian city of Surat. Today, he said, the center has 10 or 11
people working in its Fort Collins, Colo., laboratory.

INDONESIA'S NEW LEADER, SELF-STYLED REFORMER, HOPES TO STAY
AWHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Presenting himself as the reformer that
Indonesians have been calling for, President B.J. Habibie laid out
an intricate election timetable Tuesday that would keep him in
office at least through the end of next year, despite widespread
calls for a quick handover of power.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately effusive, assertive, defensive and a touch
melancholy, his eyes flashing and his hands chopping the air,
Habibie spoke in his first newspaper interview about his hopes to
lead Indonesia out of its political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after his elevation from vice president after the
sudden resignation of his friend and mentor, President Suharto, he
still seems amazed to be where he is.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing across his broad desk and clapping his hands in
seeming astonishment, he said: ``You know, I was always sitting on
that side. The president was always here. Now I am here!''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he had to be reminded by an aide not to refer to
Suharto as president. ``You are the president,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Habibie outlined a confident program that challenged both
his critics and his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the attorney general announced an investigation of
Suharto's accumulated riches, but Habibie said he personally did
not favor digging into the sources of his predecessor's billions,
and he warned against ``Wild West'' justice.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the Suharto family's self-enrichment as part of a
feudal culture, and described his predecessor as frugal and never a
part of the jet set.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing Suharto's accumulation of billions of dollars, he
said: ``If you dig into the past, then the past is unlimited, and I
have limited resources. I'd better concentrate on the future. Many
of the things that are said are right and many things are also
exaggerated. And so it is not worthwhile for the future of my
country to dig into the past.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own wealth and that of his family members, Habibie
said they are all highly educated and talented people who had
earned their riches fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``this is not a jungle,'' he also dismissed opponents who
are urging a quick transfer of power and insisted that the only
constitutional route to a transition involves a rather tortured
procedure that would lead to a parliamentary election next year,
followed by an electoral assembly at the end of the year that would
select a new president.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to rule out his own candidacy for a new term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Habibie also gave a vivid account of the transition of power May
21, when he received the news that he would become president only
at the last moment and only from a presidential aide. Suharto, he
said, refused to speak to him.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, who for 20 years was Suharto's minister of research and
technology, has little administrative experience and little base of
power, and had never been seen _ even by Suharto _ as a potential
president. Most Indonesians view him as a transitional figure, and
powerful forces are pressing him to step out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with a mixture of deep affection and veiled criticism
for Suharto, a man he said he had known since childhood and
considers to be one of his best friends, but who now appears to
have turned his back on the new president.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that Suharto, 76, had grown too old to sense
the mood of the people. As a younger man of 62, Habibie said, he
has a better feel for the aspirations of the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural process, aging, you know,'' he said. ``I don't
want to insult because he has done a lot for the country. But he's
not a young man. The students are my children and the students are
his grandsons. The gap between father and son is less than the gap
between grandfather and grandson. It is a generation gap, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with his patron, Habibie presents himself as a
champion of democracy and human rights, and of the kind of economic
openness that he said he hoped would quickly restore public
confidence in the economy and attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have another person _ you have another president,'' he
said. ``You have another economic team. You have transparency. You
could never talk to President Suharto the way you can talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I am not the king.''
</P>
<P>
   In a melancholy tale of the hand-over, he described his sudden
abandonment by Suharto, who he said had not communicated with him
since stepping down. When told of a newspaper report that Suharto
was passing the time playing golf and jogging, Habibie said,
``Golf? That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time they met, he said, between 8 and 9 on the evening
before Suharto resigned on May 21, Suharto was still discussing his
plans to announce a new cabinet the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then at 11 o'clock I was informed by the secretary of the
president that he had changed his mind,'' Habibie said. ``He was
going to step down the next morning and leave it to the vice
president to take over the leadership of the country. The next
morning I applied to see him at home but they said, `No, he is on
his way. He will not receive you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said he hurriedly asked various officials whether the
hand-over was constitutional, and was assured that it was. ``Then
they told me the president had arrived, and I immediately sent the
protocol officer to see whether I could see him, and he said no,''
he continued.
</P>
<P>
   After Suharto had read his brief resignation statement and
Habibie had taken the oath of office, he said: ``He looked at me,
he shook hands _ not a single word, just a smile. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Habibie said, as powerful politicians and
military men milled around him and his mentor disappeared in his
chauffeured car, he did the only thing left to him to do. He
prayed, ``God, give me strength.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing President Suharto has always told me _ because for
me he is like an older brother, and sometimes like a father, but
for sure a good friend; he's a good guy _ he told me: `My dear
Rudi, one day a lot of people will be looking at you. A lot of
people will know you. You will be the most lonesome man in the
world, because you have to face your own decisions.' And I faced
that. I had to face that and make decisions so fast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of meetings with economic ministers, military
leaders and several opposition figures whom he has invited to join
him in regular consultations, Habibie said, he embarked on a
program that in many ways repudiated both the style and the
substance of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Habibie is not more or less than the puppet of
his former master,''' he said. ``If that is the case, why on my
first day do I touch on human rights? Within 25 hours and 30
minutes after I took over, I announced a cabinet. Two hours later I
was negotiating about human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He has begun what officials say will be the releases of hundreds
of political prisoners. But he said Tuesday there would be no
change in policy toward the separatist movement in the island
province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``I was facing the military problem
between Prabowo and the others.'' Lt. Gen. Prabowo, Suharto's
son-in-law, had been removed from his command in a quick move by
the armed forces commander and defense secretary, Gen. Wiranto, to
consolidate his military command.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry show of force, Prabowo mobilized some of the troops
he commanded and stormed into Habibie's residence to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me what to do, and I told him to obey his
commander,'' Habibie said. But as a precaution, he said, the new
president and his family were moved for several hours that night to
a safe house and his grandchildren were flown by helicopter to join
him.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo has accepted his demotion to head a military college
away from the capital, but he remains an unpredictable power.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after that, I had to receive the Bank of Indonesia
and listen to the economic situation and make my decision what to
do or not,'' Habibie said. ``You see? I was alone. And then, you
know, it was already 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock. I had to read a lot of
things to make my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I tell you, that first week, I slept at most two
hours. But I was very calm, correct? I was not nervous, just calm.
Correct?''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was his two decades ``in the cockpit'' at Suharto's
side that prepared him for leadership. ``I'm not deaf and blind. I
can read. I can see. I can put a lot of questions, OK? I learned at
the hands of the master.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Suharto's team, he said, he could discuss
policies with him, but in the end it was his job to support the
president. That did not mean he did not have his own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a puppet,'' he said. ``I was his former member of the
cabinet for 20 years and I know him personally for 48 years, and I
consider myself one of his best friends. You have also a best
friend, but that does not mean that you do everything your best
friend wants you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said some colleagues were urging him to act more
``presidential,'' to imitate Suharto's taciturn and measured style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `Hey, Dr. Habibie, you should look like
Suharto and talk like Suharto,''' he said, lowering his voice an
octave. ``But my children said to me, `No, I want to see you as you
are. Be yourself.'''

LOTT SEEKS CHINESE SATELLITE DATA FROM WHITE HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked
the White House on Tuesday to turn over all documents related to
President Clinton's decision to allow the export of U.S. satellites
to China for launch into space.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Lott wrote that he and other Republicans
are concerned that recent satellite transfers may have compromised
national security. He asked for Clinton's cooperation in an
investigation of the matter begun this week by a special task force
of GOP chairmen formed by the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply troubled about the national security
implications of satellite exports and related technology transfer
to the Peoples' Republic of China,'' Lott wrote in the letter
released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   The request came as Clinton prepared to visit China later this
month and as lawmakers on Capitol Hill readied themselves for their
annual debate on whether to grant most-favored-nation trading
status to China for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to notify Congress on Wednesday that he
plans to renew MFN for China unless the House and Senate votes to
block it within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the MFN debate has often been heated, with
Republicans and Democrats split over whether to back it. But in
recent years, Lott, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and other
GOP leaders have been strong advocates of the special trade status.
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to win MFN again this year. But supporters
will have a tougher time getting it approved by Congress because of
the controversy over the satellite transfers and whether Beijing
sought to influence the 1996 elections with campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley told a group of exporters
Tuesday that he believes MFN will be granted to China. But he
acknowledged that the task of winning approval this year will be
far ``more difficult'' than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Lott said his task force was particularly
concerned about the possible transfer of U.S. technology, which may
have allowed the Chinese to improve the accuracy of the missile
guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that Chinese ballistic missile capabilities
may have been enhanced, either directly or indirectly, by these
exchanges,'' he said in the letter that also went to the State,
Defense and Commerce departments, as well as to the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has also formed a select committee to conduct a House
investigation of the Clinton waivers, which were granted following
a 1996 decision to move the licensing authority for technology
transfers from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The
Republicans are interested specifically in a Clinton decision last
February to allow Loral Space and Communications Co. to launch a
commercial satellite from China while the company was under
investigation by the Justice Department for possibly providing
sensitive information to the Chinese in violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In his broad request for information, Lott also asked for
records, including memos and computer e-mail related to all
technology transfer waivers to China granted by Clinton and any
military and national security concerns that may have been raised
about them. He also requested documents related to U.S. export and
licensing policies for U.S. commercial satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the White House said the administration would
cooperate with the request. But he noted that much of the
information has already been made available ``in one form or
another'' to various Senate and House committees that are
responsible for overseeing decisions regarding ``the transfer of
technology abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep a check on the Republican investigations of
the waivers, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told
reporters Tuesday that he plans to set up his own task force of
Democrats to help ensure that the GOP inquiries are carried out in
a non-partisan manner. &QL;

REGULATORS TAKE MORE TIME OVER CONRAIL ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla. Pa.)  (ja)  
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, federal railroad regulators approved, with hardly
a blink, Union Pacific's acquisition of Southern Pacific to form
the nation's largest railroad. The result was one of the nation's
worst rail tie-ups, costing businesses billions of dollars
throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday, the Surface Transportation Board is
holding hearings on plans by two other railroads, Norfolk Southern
and CSX, to take over Conrail, the only major freight carrier
serving the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   While approval of those plans is expected, the board, striving
to make amends for the Union Pacific debacle, has already attached
tougher conditions and oversight to Conrail's acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads said that the takeover of Conrail presented far
fewer threats to competition, reliability, and safety than Union
Pacific's $5.4-billion acquisition of Southern Pacific, and that
their preparations have been far more thorough. Businesses
throughout the Northeast will enjoy much smoother, faster shipments
from other regions, they said, and motorists on the interstates
will enjoy reduced traffic as 1.1-million truckloads of freight
each year are diverted to the rails.
</P>
<P>
   While shippers and labor unions generally supported the
acquisition, some said that it would present them with higher
shipping costs and unacceptable risks. The railroads, they said,
cannot reliably or safely handle the extra freight they expect the
merger to generate.
</P>
<P>
   Conrail is a monopoly by design, created by the government in
1976 from the failed Penn Central, itself a combination of the New
York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, and several other roads.
To assure its success, Conrail was given exclusive rights over much
of the region.
</P>
<P>
   CSX and Norfolk Southern, which dominate rail freight east of
the Mississippi, bought Conrail for $10.2 billion last year. They
have operated it independently pending government approval for
dividing it up and integrating its operations with theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board's own existence is up for
congressional reconsideration this year. Members of Congress, labor
leaders and many shippers accuse the agency, the successor to the
Interstate Commerce Commission, of serving only to protect the
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   `It's the worst case of an agency that has been captured by the
industry it regulates,'' said Edward Wytkind, executive director of
the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department. His union, citing
safety and job loss fears, opposes the Conrail acquisition, while
other unions, having negotiated job security provisions, support
it.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, has not turned down a railroad merger
since rejecting a deal between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific in
1987. Customers and investors consider approval of the latest deal
a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most businesses believe the merger is a fait accompli,'' said
Douglas Rockel, an analyst with Furman Selz. ``The STB never saw a
merger they didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Linda Morgan, the board's chairman, said she would
have no comment because the case was pending. The board's only
other member is Gus Owen, with a third, nominated member, William
Clyburn Jr., awaiting Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not consider safety issues in the Union Pacific
deal. A series of crashes that left nine railroad crew members dead
followed the acquisition of Southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the board has demanded that the railroads
submit thorough safety plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Pacific merger left too few locomotives and overworked
crews, supervisors often unprepared for their new duties, and
clashing computer systems that lost track of trains. Railyards
overflowed and delays mounted, as customers filed suits to recover
their losses and Union Pacific stock plunged.
</P>
<P>
   CSX and Norfolk Southern have therefore assured investors that,
instead of trying to capture immediate savings, they are buying
hundreds of extra locomotives and adding hundreds of conductors and
engineers to make certain the acquisition goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be chaos and confusion in this one,'' said Michael
Ward in an interview. As CSX's chief financial officer, he has
assumed prime responsibility for the Conrail acquisition. ``We've
had plenty of time to look at what we've learned from other
people's mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern, the smaller of the acquirers, would assume 58
percent of Contrail's operations, CSX 42 percent. Both would serve
New York and Washington, although only CSX would serve Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers generally agree that, by splitting Conrail, this
railroad deal, unlike most others, would increase competition. `A
lot of our members thought they had died and gone to heaven,'' said
Ed Rastatter, policy director for the National Industrial
Transportation League, the leading association of shippers. But,
fearing that CSX and Norfolk Southern overpaid for Conrail,
Rastatter's association negotiated an agreement with the railroads
to control rates and see that Union Pacific's problems are not
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Where Conrail and its acquirers overlapped, however, shippers
were wary of reduced competition. The Justice Department had
supported a complaint by Indianapolis Power &AMP; Light that CSX could
raise the utility's costs for hauling coal if competition from
Conrail is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association, in fact, planned to tell
the board it opposed the deal. ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out that when you take three railroads and make two out
of them you're going to reduce competition,'' said James Pasierb,
an association spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads said that improved service, without the delays
caused by switching from their systems to Conrail's, would capture
so much freight now moving by truck that motorists traveling
between cities along Interstates 95 and 81 in particular ought to
notice the difference within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads have struck an agreement to use Amtrak's
high-speed rails, saying that Amtrak's safety and reliability would
not be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Conrail, however, has seldom carried freight on Amtrak rails
since a 1987 collision between passenger and freight trains killed
16. Within cities, the railroads will continue to rely on trucks to
carry many shipments to their final destinations.

     BARR SPEAKING AT IOWA GOP EVENT _ BUT WHY?
 &HT;     By REBECCA CARR 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The list of those invited to speak at an upcoming
Iowa Republican Party forum includes nearly every GOP hopeful for
the Oval Office in 2000. Former presidential candidates Lamar
Alexander and Steve Forbes will be there, as will Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri and House Budget Chairman John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Now add one more: Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has accepted an invitation to return to his native state to
speak at the ``First in the Nation Gala,'' a political forum
scheduled for June 12 in Cedar Rapids. The event has featured every
Republican presidential nominee for the past decade, said Steve
Grubbs, chairman of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr, a two-term congressman, insisted that the speaking
engagement is not a bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
Rather, it is an attempt to ``make sure public officials at all
levels of government, including the president, are held accountable
for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Barr will mostly likely discuss the current scandals
at the White House ranging from Monica Lewinsky to allegations of
illegal fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since Iowa is historically the stomping ground for presidential
aspirants, Barr's decision to speak with the rest of the pack has
some politicos wondering whether the conservative congressman is
just being coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Iowa and everyone knows what Iowa stands for,'' said Aric
Kahle, spokesperson for the Iowa Republican Party. ``We're first in
the nation and everyone knows that Iowa is the testing waters for
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr, not known for mincing his words, said his Iowa speech
is truly an attempt to get the nation focused on the issues he
thinks are important. ``I remain concerned about the direction the
Republican Party is taking and will remain actively involved in
helping shape our party's national agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not exactly what Barr told the Iowa Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away from a conversation with him thinking he was very
sincere about entering the national political scene,'' Grubbs said.
``Barr said he wanted to test a national message.''
</P>
<P>
   What this most likely boils down to is an attempt to do what
Ross Perot and others have done: capture the national spotlight to
push a personal agenda, said William Connelly, professor of
politics at Washington &AMP; Lee University and author of a book about
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly does not think that Barr is a viable candidate for the
presidency. He sees Barr's speech as a sign of atrophy in the
national political parties and a confirmation that the presidential
election process is increasingly dominated by the media.
</P>
<P>
   In such a culture, Connelly said, ``all sorts of people are
running who have no business doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Alexander, Forbes, Ashcroft and Kasich, Iowa voters
will hear from Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.; Gary Bauer, president
of Campaign for Working Families; Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma;
Alan Keyes; former vice-presidential nominee Jack Kemp; radio talk
host Oliver North; Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, Sen. Bob Smith of
New Hampshire, and Marilyn Quayle, the wife of former Vice
President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the list are House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, widely considered prime
contenders for the nomination.

TRAINER PLEASED WITH REAL QUIET'S FINAL WORKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., see RAC-BELMONT) 
(ja)  
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his final workout before his bid for the Triple Crown in
Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes, Real Quiet covered five furlongs
on Tuesday at Churchill Downs in 1 minute 1 second, a drill that
encouraged his trainer, Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Preakness, he was a bit dehydrated, but now he's
hitting on all cylinders,'' Baffert said. ``He looks great. He's
training great. I'm amazed at the way he's come around. He's put on
weight. He looks fresh. He looks like he could run two weeks after
the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet has trained primarily at Churchill Downs throughout
the Triple Crown. He was there for three weeks before the May 2
Kentucky Derby, then was in Maryland for just five days _ long
enough to win the May 16 Preakness Stakes _ before returning to
Kentucky. Real Quiet was to be flown Wednesday morning from
Louisville to New York and to receive a police escort for his van
ride to Belmont Park from John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The jockey Dana Barnes was on Real Quiet for his workout.
According to Baffert, the colt started off too quickly in his
workout, so he told Barnes _ via walkie-talkie _ to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty anxious,'' Baffert said. ``He really wanted to
do a lot.'' By the end of the work, Baffert said, ``He was just
galloping, just cruising, doing it effortlessly. I want a strong
horse when the gate opens.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet captures the mile and one-half Belmont, he will
become the sport's 12th Triple Crown winner and his owner, Mike
Pegram, will receive a $5-million bonus from Visa, the Triple
Crown's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER MEANINGFUL WORKOUTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Four of the horses expected to challenge Real Quiet also had
important workouts on Tuesday. At Belmont Park, Classic Cat _ who
finished third in the Preakness _ breezed five furlongs in 1:01
2/5, Raffie's Majesty cruised through an easy half-mile in :49 3/5,
and Thomas Jo was timed in 1:28 1/5 for seven furlongs. And at
Churchill Downs, the long shot Hot Wells covered a half-mile in :48
3/5.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jo has won four straight races and six of his last seven,
but has yet to defeat horses of this caliber. He will be the first
Belmont Stakes starter for the trainer Jimmy Jerkens, who was a
long-time assistant to his father, Allen Jerkens, before going out
on his own in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would I feel if I win? Forget about it,'' he said,
smiling. ``This is one of those races everyone remembers.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raffie's Majesty finished fourth in the Illinois Derby in his
last start, but trainer James Bond said the extra distance of the
Belmont will suit his colt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can gallop for three miles and wouldn't even blow out a
candle,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINISH LINES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Both Grand Slam and Yarrow Brae are expected to be entered in
the Belmont Stakes by the trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Jerry Bailey had
committed to ride Yarrow Brae, but that was before Grand Slam's
victory in the Peter Pan Stakes, so Bailey could end up on Grand
Slam. Mike Smith is the other jockey who will be employed by Lukas.
... Hanuman Highway, who missed the Preakness Stakes and Peter Pan
because of a sore right front hoof, has switched to shoes that are
glued on, rather than affixed with nails. He will have a workout on
Wednesday. ... Entries will be taken and post positions drawn for
the Belmont Thursday morning. Unlike this year's Kentucky Derby and
Preakness Stakes, trainers will not select their post positions;
they will be determined in a blind draw.

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 20 years she has had rheumatoid arthritis, Veronica
Lewandowski has undergone replacements of both hips, both knees and
the knuckles of her right hand. She has tried virtually all the
drugs available but nothing has really worked.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eight months since Ms. Lewandowski, a 39-year-old
resident of Worcester, Pa., began taking an experimental drug known
as Enbrel, she is less fatigued and no longer has to descend stairs
backward to spare her knees. And when her son fell off his bicycle
recently, she astonished her two children, and herself, by running
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had never seen me run before,'' said Ms. Lewandowski, who
had to give up her job in a chemical company laboratory because she
could no longer operate the instruments. ``Life is fun now.''
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel is the first drug produced by the two-decades-old
biotechnology industry that is aimed at rheumatoid arthritis, which
afflicts 2.5 million Americans and is the most severe of the
diseases of the joints. What is more, other promising new drugs for
rheumatoid arthritis are right behind it, a stark change for a
disease for which there have been almost no new therapies for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this degree of activity in this field,'' said
Dr. Michael Weinblatt, a professor at the Harvard Medical School.
``I'm much more optimistic about controlling this disease than I
was five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs are causing excitement on Wall Street as well as
in the clinic because the potential market for them is estimated to
be in the billions of dollars each year. The stock of Immunex
Corp., the Seattle biotechnology company that makes Enbrel, nearly
tripled in the last year, though it has recently fallen back to a
level twice its 12-month low.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the coming new drugs are involved in the big merger
announced on Monday between American Home Products Corp. and
Monsanto Co., promising to make the combined company a powerhouse
in arthritis treatment. Immunex is 54 percent owned by American
Home Products, which will help promote Enbrel in the United States
and sell it overseas. Monsanto's pharmaceutical subsidiary, G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co., is leading the way to develop a new type of
painkiller for people with arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs appear to be as good or better than existing
therapies but with fewer side effects. But they are not cures and
just how much optimism is warranted won't be clear for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Existing drugs can already control rheumatoid arthritis in 60 to
75 percent of the cases, especially if treatment is started early,
said Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs at
the Arthritis Foundation. He said the new drugs are likely to add
to existing therapies, not replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex applied in May to the Food and Drug Administration for
permission to market Enbrel. The company hopes for approval as
early as the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., hopes to file for approval of a
somewhat similar arthritis drug called Avakine within a year from
now. But an FDA advisory panel has just recommended approving
Avakine for treatment of Crohn's disease, an intestinal
inflammation. Once it is approved for that, doctors will also be
able to legally use it for arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected in 1999 are a new class of ``super aspirins'' that
treat pain and inflammation but without stomach bleeding and
ulcers, which are estimated to cause several thousand deaths a year
among patients who take existing painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Searle expects to file for FDA approval in the third quarter of
this year for use of such a drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis and pain. Merck &AMP; Co. is close behind, though it is
first concentrating on osteoarthritis and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc., an American unit of Hoechst AG,
meanwhile, recently applied for approval to market still another
new arthritis drug, called Arava.
</P>
<P>
   Meirav Chovav, biotechnology analyst at Salomon Smith Barney,
said that Enbrel ``could be a billion-dollar drug five years out.''
Sales projections from various analysts are even greater _ $2
billion or more _ for the super aspirins.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs have their limitations. The super aspirins, known
as COX-2 inhibitors, do not even claim to halt the progress of the
disease; instead, they are meant to relieve just the symptoms.
Enbrel, Avakine and Arava probably will slow the destruction of
joints but might not halt it completely, and they will not be able
to heal already damaged bone and cartilage. Moreover, patients will
probably have to take these drugs for life, possibly along with
existing medications. But the new drugs, if started early enough,
may allow sufferers to lead nearly normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make it as controllable and tolerable as
insulin-dependent diabetes or hypertension, where you have to take
your medication but life goes on,'' said Elizabeth Tindall,
clinical associate professor of medicine at the Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland. ``That's a lot better than `Buy
your wheelchair now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous types of arthritis, the most widespread being
osteoarthritis, a wearing away of the cartilage that is associated
with aging that affects about 20.7 million Americans, according to
the Arthritis Foundation. But rheumatoid arthritis is the most
debilitating. Half the victims _ many are women aged 25 to 50 _
must quit work because of disability within a decade, Weinblatt of
Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, one in which the
body's immune system, designed to fight bacteria and viruses,
mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, in this case the lining
of the joints.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, drugs for rheumatoid arthritis have been borrowed
from other diseases like cancer or malaria. They either suppress
the immune system in general or work in other ways not fully
understood. And they can have serious side effects. The most
commonly used is methotrexate, a generic cancer drug, which can
cause liver and lung problems in a small number of patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are also two dozen or so nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, which range from over-the-counter aspirin and ibuprofen to
more potent formulations sold by prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The newer drugs take advantage of the explosion of knowledge
about the immune system. They are designed to be more specific in
their activities, hopefully producing better results with fewer
side effects. ``We are on the threshold of targeted approaches,''
said Conn of the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the COX-2 inhibitors. COX, which stands for
cyclo-oxygenase, is an enzyme involved in causing pain and swelling
at injury sites. But one type of COX is also involved in protecting
the stomach lining and in helping the kidneys function.
</P>
<P>
   Existing nonsteroidal painkillers like ibuprofen inhibit both
types of COX. COX-2 drugs block the action of the enzyme involved
in inflammation but leave the type that protects the stomach
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michelle Petri, who heads the FDA's arthritis advisory
committee, said that Searle's data show its COX-2 inhibitor to be
as effective as existing painkillers yet ``the toxicity profile was
the same as for people taking the placebo.'' But she said the
committee still asked for more data, in part to make sure there are
no effects on fertility, as an animal study suggested there might
be.
</P>
<P>
   The existing market for prescription nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis is $2 billion in the United
States and as much as $5 billion worldwide, said Dr. Philip
Needleman, president of Searle. ``We think COX-2 inhibitors will
take over that entire market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex's Enbrel works by stopping the activity of tumor
necrosis factor, or TNF, one of the major substances involved in
mounting an immune attack. TNF attaches to certain immune system
cells at docking stations known as receptors. Enbrel consists of
versions of this receptor that float in the bloodstream and act as
decoys, getting the TNF to bind with them rather than with the
immune cells.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex at first is aiming at patients for whom existing drugs
have failed. In clinical trials, about 60 percent of such patients
responded to Enbrel and 40 percent saw their condition improve
substantially. Immunex has also shown that Enbrel together with
methotrexate is better than methotrexate alone, said Peggy
Phillips, senior vice president for pharmaceutical development.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Enbrel will displace methotrexate is not clear
because a direct comparison of the two drugs has not been
completed. Moreover, a year's supply of Enbrel will cost between
$5,000 and $10,000, Ms. Phillips said, and patients must inject
themselves twice a week. Methotrexate is available in pills and a
year's supply costs only about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Competition could also come from Hoechst's new Arava, which will
also be in pill form. Analysts consider it a conventional medicine
rather than a biotechnology marvel, but it does work by a mechanism
different from the existing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown is how effective and safe Enbrel will be over
the long run, said Dr. James O'Dell, chief of rheumatology at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center. Immunex's data extend only
to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Johnson of Lake Oswego, Ore., began taking Enbrel in
December 1996. ``In the first year, I was literally cured, and it
was astonishing,'' she said. But in the last few months, she said,
some symptoms returned, though still nearly nowhere as bad as they
were before.
</P>
<P>
   Centocor's Avakine targets TNF not with a receptor but with a
monoclonal antibody, a specially engineered version of the body's
infection fighters.
</P>
<P>
   For the most seriously ill patients who are not helped by any
drugs, Cypress Bioscience of San Diego is applying this year for
approval to market a device that filters antibodies from a person's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies _ including Amgen, Autoimmune Inc., Immune
Response Co. and Isis Pharmaceuticals _ are in clinical trials of
drugs that work in various other ways. Some companies hope to stop
the body from attacking itself to begin with. Anergen Inc., for
instance, has reported some effectiveness in early clinical trials
of an arthritis ``vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the immune system is complex and efforts to control it have
met with mixed results. Also, weakening the immune system can leave
a patient more susceptible to infections. Idec Pharmaceuticals
Corp. and SmithKline Beecham PLC last year suspended late-stage
clinical trials on an Idec arthritis drug after some patients
experienced declines in a key immune system cell. The companies
have now started new trials with a reformulated drug.
</P>
<P>
   Progress made in treating arthritis might also help in treating
other diseases, particularly autoimmune ailments like lupus and
Type 1 diabetes. Immunex is testing Enbrel for congestive heart
failure and COX-2 inhibitors show promise in colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, scientists hope to find the cause of the
self-immune attack. The Arthritis Foundation is searching for the
genes that make people susceptible to the disease. Because not all
genetically predisposed people get the disease, scientists suspect
there is some trigger, like a bacterium or virus, that sets it off.
But that trigger, if it exists, has not been found.

     TOBACCO BILL SURVIVES CHALLENGE
 &HT;     By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The embattled comprehensive tobacco bill survived
an effort Tuesday in the Senate to move on to other legislation, a
move its supporters said would virtually kill the bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   The key vote came on an procedural effort to invoke cloture _
thus requiring consideration _ on a bill backed by the nuclear
power industry to proceed with plans to store industrial nuclear
waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The motion failed, 56-39, to obtain the necessary three-fifths
vote in the 100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said invoking cloture would
have put the tobacco bill back on the Senate calendar where any
senator could object to its further consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would put us at the mercy of every single opponent of the
tobacco bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Republicans were attempting to
``reward two very powerful industries: big tobacco and the nuclear
power industry,'' by voting for cloture.
</P>
<P>
   But Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was simply
trying to provide time for the Senate to take up an array of other
pressing business.
</P>
<P>
   As senators continued to huddle privately, the tobacco bill
faced difficulties on several fronts, but primarily from Republican
lawmakers who argue the bill would impose a huge tax increase on
lower-income Americans who smoke cigarettes at a far higher rate
than more affluent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, would offset the bill's
$1.10-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes by eliminating the
so-called marriage penalty _ which imposes higher taxes for a
couple with relatively equal earnings than if they were single _
for couples with incomes under $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats have opposed tinkering with the marriage
penalty as part of the tobacco bill, Daschle said he could support
some proposal if it would increase chances of passing the
half-trillion-dollar tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, a leading opponent of the tobacco bill, said
he would welcome changing the marriage penalty, but would still
oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bill is still a fatally flawed bill,'' Nickles
said. ``This is a big tax increase. ... This is a big new spending
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., argued that the public pays $80
billion a year _ $1,370 per family _ to cover the cost of
smoking-related illnesses. Kerry argued the bill was not a tax
increase because the people who would pay higher cigarette prices
would do so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment by
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to provide $660 million a year for five
years _ a total of $3 billion _ to reimburse the Department of
Veterans Affairs for the cost of treating veterans with
smoking-related illnesses.

CELEBRATING BLACK CONTRIBUTIONS TO MODERN DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 7.) 
(js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most significant accomplishments of the American
Dance Festival in its 65-year history has been its shedding light
on the rich but often little-known contributions of black
choreographers to American modern dance. In 1987, the festival
began a long-term program to reconstruct lost classics and present
new work, to encourage black dance companies and to build wider
national audiences for repertories and dancers. An unparalleled
collection of archival and scholarly material on American black
dance was also begun.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, in Durham, N.C., will continue the programming
this Thursday through Sunday with ``Masterpieces of the Black
Tradition.'' Classics by Talley Beatty, Asadata Dafora, Katherine
Dunham, Donald McKayle and Eleo Pomare will be performed by the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company and the Cleo Parker Robinson
Dance Ensemble of Denver. The dances will also be filmed for a
series produced by the festival and the Public Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, on June 23 and 24, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and her
Urban Bush Women company will perform recent pieces as well as her
new ``Hands Singing Song,'' a work commissioned by the festival
through its Doris Duke Awards for New Work program. (The company
will also perform at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in
Massachusetts in August.)
</P>
<P>
   And on June 29, Fayard and Harold Nicholas, the tap stars known
as the Nicholas Brothers, will receive the 1998 Samuel H. Scripps
American Dance Festival Award for lifetime achievement in dance.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Scripps award in the festival's bare-bones early
years, and certainly there was very little black concert dance to
tap into. What the festival did have going for it was the visionary
practicality of early American modern dance. Martha Hill, a former
Martha Graham dancer who had become a dance educator, saw that what
the fragile yet determined young art of modern dance needed most
was a place to grow, away from the distractions of the city.
</P>
<P>
   What better place than a workshop, at Bennington College in
Vermont, that would offer six weeks of classes in dance technique,
composition, music, history and critical theory? And who better to
teach those dance classes than Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey,
Charles Weidman and Hanya Holm, by then stars of American modern
dance, who could also create and present work at Bennington? The
first students were 103 women, many of them physical education
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the festival, which moved to Durham in 1978, offers 65
classes a day, taught by 55 teachers, for some 500 professionals
and preprofessional students from around the world in studios,
classrooms and theaters spread out over the campus of Duke
University. This year, there will be 43 performances by 14 groups,
including an ice-dancing company, along with a film and video
festival, tributes to American dance legends, and lectures and
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its growth, however, the festival has remained at its
core a much-needed, prestigious summer home for established
modern-dance artists, and a place for the artists of the future to
develop in the company of those who have come before.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not hard to chart the lineage from Graham, that festival
pioneer, to David Grenke, whose new company will perform this
season in Durham. Grenke danced with Paul Taylor, who danced with
Graham. Ms. Zollar's earliest dance training was with Joseph
Stevenson, who studied with Dunham, in her childhood home, Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Zollar also talks of a heritage that includes Dianne
McIntyre, the black choreographer at whose New York studio Ms.
Zollar developed her own style in the 1980s. Ms. McIntyre was, in
turn, influenced by the improvisational work of the white
avant-gardists Judith Dunn and Bill Dixon. Even more, Ms. Zollar's
choreography has been informed by her memories of the sensuous
shake dancers she watched as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Graham created larger-than-life heroines. Ms. Zollar's pieces
are about everyday women. Her seven dancers will play themselves as
they are today in ``Self-Portrait'' and ``Transitions.'' In ``Hair
Stories,'' the dancers portray their younger selves. In the new
``Hands Singing Song,'' they are women whose hands push against
society's barriers, slap together in ebullient handshakes and
engage in what Ms. Zollar wryly refers to as what ``Jocelyn Elders
lost her career over.'' It is tempting to imagine that Graham might
have recognized Ms. Zollar's women as sisters to her characters, a
connection that seems entirely possible in the historical framework
of festival programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African-American dance artist has at every turn been a
reflection of his/her social era, serving as a catalyst at one turn
and as a willing community barometer at others,'' Halifu Osumare, a
writer on black dance, observed in ``African-American Genius in
Modern Dance,'' published by the festival in 1993. In its
determined attention to that artistry, the festival has enlarged
and reinforced its founding traditions.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: ADVANCE BOARDING PASSES, HEATHROW TRAINS, HOTEL
UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
(bl) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three airlines _ American Airlines, Trans World Airlines and
United Airlines _ are eliminating all advance boarding passes this
month, which could mean longer check-in times for business
travelers at airports.
</P>
<P>
   With these moves, the three carriers are following in the
footsteps of America West, Continental Airlines and Northwest
Airlines, which stopped giving out advance boarding passes late
last year. American's and TWA's actions were effective Monday,
while United's new policy begins next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Delta Airlines eliminated advance boarding passes
only on its international flights. U S Airways still offers them on
all flights, though a spokesman said the carrier was ``taking a
very close look at its policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they are eliminating the passes because of the
ever-growing popularity of electronic tickets, which are currently
available on domestic flights but not most international service.
Another factor, the airlines say, is increased security procedures
mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration that require all
passengers to check in with an agent. Elimination of the passes
does not affect carriers' ability to offer travelers advance seat
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Before the FAA's procedures were instituted, in the wake of the
crash of TWA Flight 800, advance boarding passes had saved
travelers time upon arrival at the airport, since they could go
directly to the gate and use the pass to board their flight.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines that have eliminated the passes contend that this
change has not slowed their check-in or boarding procedures. Patty
McMenamin, a spokeswoman for Rosenbluth International, the
Philadelphia-based corporate travel company, said Rosenbluth's
clients ``do not seem to be unhappy'' about the changes, since many
fly with electronic tickets and are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, other officials predict the changes will make it
necessary for passengers to arrive at airports even earlier than
they do already. Sabina Terrades, vice president of marketing and
communications for Stevens Travel Management in New York, another
corporate travel company, warned that the changes ``would
definitely create a hassle.'' She added, ``Our travelers used to
get to the airport 20 or 30 minutes before their flight; now we
advise them to be there a minimum of one hour before departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel
Agents, predicted that ``lines at the gate are going to be
dramatically longer,'' noting that ``anyone who travels is going to
have to allow more time now at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Train to Heathrow
</P>
<P>
   BAA PLC, which owns seven British airports, including London's
Heathrow Airport, will offer express train service between Heathrow
and Paddington Station in downtown London starting June 23. One-way
rates will be $17 for so-called express class and $33 for first
class; the journey will take 15 or 20 minutes, depending on the
terminal at Heathrow. Subway or taxi service between Heathrow and
downtown London normally takes at least one hour and the one-way
cost can run from $6 for the subway to $60 for a taxi, including
tip.
</P>
<P>
   Airline check-in at Paddington for British Airways, American
Airlines and British Midland passengers with hand luggage will be
offered. This service will be available next May for passengers who
want to check their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The express service will operate every 15 minutes from 5:10 a.m.
to 11:40 p.m. daily. BAA will offer frequent bus service from
Paddington to West End hotels for $3.30.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   The five London hotels owned by Millennium Hotels and Resorts, a
subsidiary of CDL Hotels of Singapore, are cutting their rates by
30 percent to 40 percent from July 6 through Sept. 6. The reduced
rates, which include value-added tax and breakfast, will run from
$199 a night at the Copthorne Tara to $250 a night at the
Millennium Britannia Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Inter-Continental in New York is upgrading guests to a
suite for an additional $75 a night above their booked rate,
through Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Swiss hotels that belong to Leading Hotels of the World
set a single-occupancy room rate of $250, including value-added tax
and Continental breakfast, through March 31, 1999. A two-night stay
is required. Rates at these hotels normally range from $175 to $520
a night without breakfast.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN ADMITS IT DUMPED OIL AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the world's
second-largest cruise line, announced on Tuesday that it had agreed
to plead guilty to federal charges of dumping oil at sea, lying to
the Coast Guard about the discharges and tampering with witnesses
and evidence, and as a result would pay $9 million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal activity involved at least five of Royal Caribbean's
12 ships. The company acknowledged that they had routinely dumped
waste oil into the sea instead of sending it through purifying
equipment for storage. In some cases the oil was pumped out of the
ships through illegal pipes that were then removed by the crews
just before Coast Guard inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The practice saved tens of thousands of dollars a year per ship,
the company said. In court, prosecutors said some officers had
received bonuses for cutting operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company is entering its guilty pleas, to eight felonies, in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Miami this week and will pay an $8
million fine and an additional $1 million for environmental
projects. The Justice Department said the $8 million was the
largest environmental fine ever levied against a cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   The offenses covered by the agreement occurred from 1990 to
1994, a period when Royal Caribbean's stewards and deckhands wore
buttons that said ``Save the Waves'' and urged passengers not to
bring on deck any paper goods or other objects that might blow
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Royal Caribbean, second in size only to Carnival
among all cruise lines, had argued vigorously that it was immune
from prosecution in the United States, since none of its ships are
registered here. For instance, the company, whose main offices are
in Miami, hired former Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti as its
lawyer and brought in former Attorney General Elliot Richardson as
a witness, to contend that under international treaties, discharges
from one ship, the Nordic Empress, could be prosecuted only by
Liberia, because the ship is registered there.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Tuesday, Royal Caribbean said its decision to
plead guilty was ``based on a review of the available evidence,
including evidence recently submitted by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may have been a decision on May 12 by Donald
Middlebrooks, a federal district judge in Miami, that Liberia did
not have sole jurisdiction in the Nordic Empress case.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: ADVANCE BOARDING PASSES, HEATHROW TRAINS, HOTEL
UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three airlines _ American Airlines, Trans World Airlines and
United Airlines _ are eliminating all advance boarding passes this
month, which could mean longer check-in times for business
travelers at airports.
</P>
<P>
   With these moves, the three carriers are following in the
footsteps of America West, Continental Airlines and Northwest
Airlines, which stopped giving out advance boarding passes late
last year. American's and TWA's actions were effective Monday,
while United's new policy begins next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Delta Airlines eliminated advance boarding passes
only on its international flights. U S Airways still offers them on
all flights, though a spokesman said the carrier was ``taking a
very close look at its policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they are eliminating the passes because of the
ever-growing popularity of electronic tickets, which are currently
available on domestic flights but not most international service.
Another factor, the airlines say, is increased security procedures
mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration that require all
passengers to check in with an agent. Elimination of the passes
does not affect carriers' ability to offer travelers advance seat
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Before the FAA's procedures were instituted, in the wake of the
crash of TWA Flight 800, advance boarding passes had saved
travelers time upon arrival at the airport, since they could go
directly to the gate and use the pass to board their flight.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines that have eliminated the passes contend that this
change has not slowed their check-in or boarding procedures. Patty
McMenamin, a spokeswoman for Rosenbluth International, the
Philadelphia-based corporate travel company, said Rosenbluth's
clients ``do not seem to be unhappy'' about the changes, since many
fly with electronic tickets and are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, other officials predict the changes will make it
necessary for passengers to arrive at airports even earlier than
they do already. Sabina Terrades, vice president of marketing and
communications for Stevens Travel Management in New York, another
corporate travel company, warned that the changes ``would
definitely create a hassle.'' She added, ``Our travelers used to
get to the airport 20 or 30 minutes before their flight; now we
advise them to be there a minimum of one hour before departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel
Agents, predicted that ``lines at the gate are going to be
dramatically longer,'' noting that ``anyone who travels is going to
have to allow more time now at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Train to Heathrow
</P>
<P>
   BAA PLC, which owns seven British airports, including London's
Heathrow Airport, will offer express train service between Heathrow
and Paddington Station in downtown London starting June 23. One-way
rates will be $17 for so-called express class and $33 for first
class; the journey will take 15 or 20 minutes, depending on the
terminal at Heathrow. Subway or taxi service between Heathrow and
downtown London normally takes at least one hour and the one-way
cost can run from $6 for the subway to $60 for a taxi, including
tip.
</P>
<P>
   Airline check-in at Paddington for British Airways, American
Airlines and British Midland passengers with hand luggage will be
offered. This service will be available next May for passengers who
want to check their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The express service will operate every 15 minutes from 5:10 a.m.
to 11:40 p.m. daily. BAA will offer frequent bus service from
Paddington to West End hotels for $3.30.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   The five London hotels owned by Millennium Hotels and Resorts, a
subsidiary of CDL Hotels of Singapore, are cutting their rates by
30 percent to 40 percent from July 6 through Sept. 6. The reduced
rates, which include value-added tax and breakfast, will run from
$199 a night at the Copthorne Tara to $250 a night at the
Millennium Britannia Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Inter-Continental in New York is upgrading guests to a
suite for an additional $75 a night above their booked rate,
through Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Swiss hotels that belong to Leading Hotels of the World
set a single-occupancy room rate of $250, including value-added tax
and Continental breakfast, through March 31, 1999. A two-night stay
is required. Rates at these hotels normally range from $175 to $520
a night without breakfast.

GOVERNMENT REBUKES PRIVATE-DONOR NETWORK
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with strong criticism over its plan to revamp
the nation's system for distributing donated organs, the Clinton
administration said on Tuesday that it would press ahead with the
overhaul and accused the private network that runs the system of
lying to patients in an effort to fend off the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The government outlined its position in two letters dated June 1
and made public Tuesday by the Department of Health and Human
Services. Each contained a sharp rebuke to the nonprofit United
Network for Organ Sharing, which contracts with the government to
allocate organs and is lobbying Congress to keep the current system
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your response reflects a disappointing strategy of fostering
conflict rather than cooperation,'' Dr. Claude Earl Fox,
administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration,
which oversees the organ-sharing policy, wrote to Dr. Lawrence
Hunsicker, the network's president. ``UNOS has lobbied to block the
rule in a campaign not grounded in truth, and has used tactics that
have frightened transplant patients and risk negatively affecting
organ donation.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is outlined in a regulation, proposed on March 26,
that is intended to even out waiting times for organs across the
country. Organs are now offered first to patients who live closest
to the donor; the proposed regulation orders the network to devise
a plan that would allow for greater regional sharing. If the
network does not act, the government has said it will impose a new
system. But just when, and how, the regulation will go into effect
remains unclear. Not long after it was announced, Congress delayed
its implementation from July 1 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Labor Committee and the House Commerce Committee have
scheduled a joint hearing for June 18 to debate the new rule. The
plan has generated so much attention that 181 members of Congress
have written letters to Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services, to inquire about it.
</P>
<P>
   About 54,500 Americans are now waiting for hearts, lungs,
livers, kidneys, and pancreases, and demand far exceeds supply.
Because of the shortage, the new rule has not only spawned debate
among patients, but also among hospitals vying for their share of
the lucrative transplant business.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to settle the debate, Shalala has said she wants to
ensure that all Americans have equal access to donated organs, no
matter where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proposed these changes because we believe the current
system is fundamentally unfair,'' the secretary wrote in reply to
the senators and representatives who have written her. She cited
the case of a Maryland child who received a transplant in Florida
within a week after being placed on a transplant list there. The
same child had been waiting for one year on a list in California,
and four years on another list in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Shalala complained that the organ-sharing network
was ``needlessly frightening transplant patients'' by insisting,
among other things, that the overhaul would result in fewer
transplants and fewer lives being saved _ claims she described as
``simply specious.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Graham, the executive director of the network, said
the group's medical professionals ``honestly believe'' that the
government's plan would cost patients' lives. He said the group's
views are ``based on hard evidence and the best judgment of the
medical community,'' and said the network's executive committee
would meet next Monday with Fox to ``discuss our reasonable
differences.''

SCRIPT OF LAST `SEINFELD' TO BE AUCTIONED
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday June 7.) 
(ja)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script,
filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and
bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television. But are
sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth
thousands of dollars?
</P>
<P>
   As they say on television, stay tuned. On June 18, little more
than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from
``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers''
and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction
the 68-page script with all the ``alrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93
season will go for $1,500 to $2,000. But some
television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta
Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could
easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood
collectibles is blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV scripts are fast becoming the pop art of the future,'' said
Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like
scripts and props from old shows. ``As you enter the new
millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become
what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate,
television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the
signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who
wrote it). On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible
autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost
unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that
introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the
23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that
`Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television
jargon as an original `table draft.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not
an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors
ad-libbed. Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes
dropped before the episode was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly
profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10
billion market for collectibles. Dealers say that prices for
television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated
1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an
unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended
the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,''
becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go
on the auction block. Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The
Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996. Again, value is tied to
autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners''
script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music
to `The White Album,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This
Is Your Life'' went for $1,150. Once again, autographs were
essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and
his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than
other film and television collectibles. A script for an episode of
``MASH,'' signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier
this year, it went for $4,000. A signed script from the NBC sitcom
``Friends'' that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.
And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running
sitcom went off the air in 1993. The owner recently put it on the
market for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said. ``While we were working on
it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the
original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer
Gene Roddenberry. The 26-page typewritten document describes the
spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars.'' Most of the
characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the
cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and
surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will
sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope
the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, he acknowledged. But not to worry, either. ``They're
going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said,
``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this
time. `Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with
the scripts.''

COAST GUARD TO HONOR SUPPLY CREW WHO SAVED 42 RIG WORKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was after midnight when an offshore rig's distress
call reached the supply ship Trinity Seal. A natural gas well on
the Gulf of Mexico had blown, and spewing gas and debris threatened
the lives of 42 rig workers.
</P>
<P>
   A closer ship already had refused to approach when the Trinity
Seal plowed through high winds and 10-foot waves. As the captain
maneuvered the 175-foot vessel, steadying it as best he could, four
crew members guided rig workers on board. Then they sailed away,
counted heads and realized that someone was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Defying danger a second time, the crew returned to the
thundering rig. They searched the rig with spotlights until they
found and rescued the missing worker.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the rig exploded in a fireball that could
have been deadly to workers and rescuers alike. Instead, the events
of April 1, 1997, are being remembered Wednesday as examples of
heroism at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The crew from the Trinity Seal, led by Capt. Randall ``Randy''
Treon, will receive the Coast Guard's meritorious public service
award from Adm. Paul Pluta in 11 a.m., CDT., ceremonies Wednesday
at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred about 100 miles southeast of Cameron, La.,
on a platform known as East Cameron 328. It burned for three days
after the explosion, officials said, and it took a year to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disregarding their own safety, the crew of Trinity Seal
responded without hesitation knowing that the 42 workers aboard the
platform were in imminent and mortal peril from the uncontrolled
high pressure release of gas that could explode and consume the
platform and their vessel at any instant,'' a Coast Guard
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   Other honored crew members are chief engineer Arthur Briggs,
mate Sidney Skinner and able seamen Anthony Bush and Jason Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were as humble as can be, but they are real heroes,''
said Mark Andrews, vice chairman of Louis Dreyfuss Natural Gas Co.,
which owns the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Treon, 38, with 17 years experience at sea, was within a few
miles of the rig when the crisis was reported about 12:30 a.m.
Another vessel was closer but refused to get involved, he said.
Panicky rig workers were preparing to jump into the rough seas
about 100 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called me, they said the rig was `kicking,' it was
blowing, and they had to abandon the platform,'' Treon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was coming over there and not to get into the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 20-knot winds, Treon eased his ship into position to
accept fleeing rig workers, some of whom dove onto the deck of the
Trinity Seal from escape ladders and ropes.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel pulled away from the rig, but Treon did a U-turn
rather than leave someone behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had everybody,'' Treon said. ``And they did a
head count and found out there was some guy missing, so we had to
go back to try to find him. After we found him, we pulled away and
about 30 minutes later is when it blew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a massive explosion _ a huge fireball.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire melted the platform to the water level, causing $10
million in damages but no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Treon said he'd never been so close to catastrophe, but ``it's
one of those things you don't think about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just do it, and then usually after a couple of days later,
you kind of think about it a lot,'' the captain said. ``When we saw
it blow, I think that's when reality finally hit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the evacuation, the other four crew members worked
together to assist the rig workers and trained a spotlight onto the
rig to help locate the missing worker. All the while, dangerous
gases roared from the blown-out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made everybody nervous, because we knew it was
fixing to explode,'' Treon recalled. ``We just didn't know when,
and we were trying to get out before it did.''
</P>
<P>
   A small spark could have ignited the fireball during the rescue,
but Treon said he was just ``lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of Randy and his crew,'' said Ed Schreiber,
co-owner and vice president of Southern States Offshore, Inc.,
operator of the Trinity Seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never thought about the situation in terms of it being
life-threatening to themselves,'' Schreiber said. ``They knew they
had to get these people off that platform before it exploded. They
never thought about any danger to themselves until it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stuff movies are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the rescued rig workers are ``extremely grateful''
to the Trinity Seal crew. They paid tribute to them a year ago with
a dinner in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They technically didn't have to respond to the call,'' Andrews
said. ``They could have turned a deaf ear to it. Somebody already
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept their heads and they got every one on board and gave
them blankets and literally some of the clothes off their backs _
and they did it in all the confusion and chaos,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a real disaster, and thanks to these fine
men, it wasn't.''

FIGHTING FOR EUROPE'S NO-FRILLS AIR TRAVELERS
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Commuters who walk into the subway at Piccadilly Circus
these days cannot help but see the giant advertisement for Go,
British Airways' new no-frills carrier. Not far away is a
considerably smaller, bright-orange poster for Easyjet, a European
bargain airline. It reads: ``Fly the Real Thing. GO Easyjet.''
</P>
<P>
   The size and juxtaposition of the two ads say a lot about the
war over the growing low-cost, no-frills European airline market
now that British Airways has pushed its newborn into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Go, which began serving Italy on May 22 with flights to Rome and
Milan, has a lot of muscle behind it. But it has come under fire
from Britain's four other no-frills carriers operating in Europe _
Easyjet, Debonair, Ryanair, and Virgin Express _ all of which
contend that British Airways is unfairly using its market dominance
and deep pockets to subsidize Go to drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely disgusted,'' said Stelios Haji Ioannou,
founder and chief executive of Easyjet. He has taken British
Airways to court here and is expecting to go to trial in several
months. ``It's impossible to compete against someone who is trying
to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Go, which has been set up as a wholly owned
subsidiary of British Airways, says that it is completely
independent of its owner and is simply interested in finding a
profitable niche in the low-cost market that has been created by
the deregulation of European airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being owned by BA is a double-edged sword,'' Barbara Cassani,
chief executive of Go, said in an interview just before the service
began. ``We are certainly a better airline because we are owned by
BA, but it obviously makes us a target.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ever since British Airways announced last year that it
intended to enter the no-frills airline business, executives from
competing carriers have been on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``BA has done a lot of anticompetitive things over the years,''
said Richard Branson, chief executive of Virgin Group, which
operates Virgin Express along with Virgin Atlantic, his original
upstart airline that competes with British Airways on several
international routes. ``I think they are determined to get rid of
low-cost carriers and subsidize Go to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines have been part
of the U.S. airline industry for years, no-frills carriers are
relatively new in Europe. They exist largely because the European
Union opened the door in April 1997 to increased competition. The
idea was to provide an alternative to the long-established European
carriers, most of which began as state-sponsored airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The London hub is the most hotly contested. Round-trip tickets
on a British Airways flight to Rome, for example, typically cost
(PS)189 to (PS)538, or $308 to $876, depending on the class of
service and time of purchase. But a no-frills round-trip flight on
Debonair to Rome costs as little as (Btitish pounds)119, or $194.
And now Go is charging only (British pounds)100, or $163.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop in prices has caused a surge in passengers, but
competitors of Go say its fares are too low for anybody to make
money. Easyjet, in its lawsuit, contends that Go will unfairly
benefit from subsidies by its parent, arguing that British Airways
is illegally supporting Go by guaranteeing its aircraft leases and
by providing help in other ways, like offering insurance,
advertising and other services at below-market rates.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Go started service, a judge denied Easyjet's
request for an injunction stopping British Airways from
guaranteeing the leases of five Go planes. But he also refused
British Airways' request to throw out the suit. Upon hearing the
ruling, both companies claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want from the ultimate outcome of this whole thing is
for them to play fair,'' said Haji Ioannou of Easyjet. ``If you
maintain a dominant position in the marketplace, you have special
responsibilities,'' he added, comparing the situation to the U.S.
Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But some outsiders say the fight is as much for public attention
as it is for legal victory. ``I don't think BA has an agenda to
drive Easyjet out of business,'' said Steve Clapham, a travel
industry analyst at Robert Fleming Securities in London. ``Easyjet
is just looking for publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Debonair, another low-frills airline, is taking on British
Airways by requesting an investigation by the European Commission
in Brussels, which governs competition. ``I can show you they have
predatory pricing,'' said Franco Mancassola, chief executive of
Debonair. ``Our objection is that their prices are unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani of British Airways dismissed the accusations. ``We
have never said we plan to maintain these prices,'' she said.
``Like any introduction, they are promotional prices. We will
introduce a flexible fare later in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Haji Ioannou insisted that Go's strategy was to lose money until
it could put everyone else out of business. ``In court it came out
that BA said it was willing to lose (British pounds)29 million over
the next three years while they squash everybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani replied: ``That number has been blown out of context
and bandied about. As with any responsible business plan, I had to
tell the board how much BA would be out if things didn't work
out.'' British Airways has provided Go with (British pounds)25
million, or $40.7 million, in capital.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani, an American who served as U.S. general manager for
British Airways for four years before taking control of Go a year
ago, said she had a personal goal to turn a profit in two to three
years. ``I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it could work,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the backing of its parent, Go has started modestly. In
addition to flights to Rome and Milan, it will begin service to
Copenhagen on Friday. The only other no-frills carrier that
operates direct flights on those three routes is Debonair, with its
London-to-Rome service. Ms. Cassani said she planned to announce
another Go route within a month and would move into other markets
as the opportunities arise.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, Virgin Express countered Go's debut by introducing
service to Rome and Milan for (PS)2 less than Go but through
Brussels rather than nonstop. ``We would never let BA undercut
us,'' Branson said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the airlines can offer such cheap fares is
that they operate out of airports that are far less crowded than
Heathrow near London, which serves as the international hub for
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Go and Virgin Express fly from
Stansted Airport, northeast of London, while Easyjet and Debonair
operate from Luton, northwest of London, where slots are even
cheaper and more available.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassani acknowledged that all the sniping had forced her to
spend less time on what she called the important things and more
time responding to criticism. But she still sees a silver lining in
the whole fight. ``All of this picking on us,'' she said, ``has
made us tougher.''

WORLD BANK RESUMES LENDING TO INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA-HABIBIE, INDONESIA-HABIBIE-MONEY) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank said Tuesday that it had approved a
$225 million loan to Indonesia, which is expected to use the money
to build roads, improve water supplies and rebuild schools.
</P>
<P>
   The loan, approved by the Bank's board Tuesday, is the first
World Bank credit to be approved for Indonesia since lending was
suspended May 18 amid the unrest that toppled President Suharto and
ushered in his successor, B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bank's strategy to strengthen local planning and
avoid entanglement with the central government in Jakarta, the loan
will go directly to accounts set up by community leaders in rural
areas, the bank said in a statement Tuesday. The money is part of
some $43 billion in aid from the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and individual nations.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said the $225 million could benefit 7 million to 10
million rural Indonesians, especially those in the eastern regions
hardest hit by recent droughts. Villages contribute labor, cash or
materials to supplement loan money, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Guggenheim, the World Bank's loan project manager, said
the money was intended for ``people who really need the help the
most'' in a poor country that is the world's fourth most populous.
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim, who has spent considerable time in Indonesia, said
villages in remote regions can be virtually cut off for months at a
time during rainy periods. Building a simple road, typically a
gravel path 10 feet wide, would, for instance, enable a pregnant
woman to get medical assistance or or allow farmers to get their
crops to market.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director of the IMF,
said in Tokyo Tuesday that the IMF may be able to resume
disbursement of its funds to aid the battered Indonesian economy
``reasonably soon,'' Reuters reported.

DARING TO RISK BEING HIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.) (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest and perhaps most staid advertiser, the
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., is unexpectedly kicking up its corporate
heels with an unconventional marketing ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The usually downright upright P&AMP;G is uncharacteristically making
a foray into so-called nontraditional media in an effort to
stimulate sales of Noxzema skin cream among women ages 21 and over.
The company is sponsoring a project centered on placing small
advertising signs, which pitch Noxzema with edgy messages, in the
women's restrooms of about 115 trendy restaurants, bars and clubs
in chic Manhattan neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which are going up this week, are being hung in frames
affixed to the walls across from mirrors in the restrooms. The
signs are printed in reverse and are meant to be read in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The ads offer such pithy, somewhat confrontational statements
as: ``It's not the lighting,'' ``Look as good as the woman your
date is hitting on,'' ``He must really love you for your inner
beauty'' and ``Did someone miss her beauty sleep?'' At the bottom
of each ad is a photograph of a jar of Noxzema and a slogan, ``Next
time Noxzema,'' being introduced solely for this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The project is indicative of the growing interest among
mainstream marketers in unusual media vehicles meant to reach
small, niche segments of the shopping public, particularly in urban
centers where trends are often incubated.
</P>
<P>
   Other such new media ventures include trucks that drive through
city streets, displaying billboards; ads beamed on the sides of
buildings; racks filled with postcard ads, which are placed in
restaurants, bars and nightspots; ads printed on coffee cups and
posted on coffee carts; and even small signs affixed to the backs
of messengers' bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new campaign is a break from traditional Noxzema
advertising, reaching young women in places they wouldn't expect
with a big dose of in-your-face humor,'' Mark Schar, vice president
and general manager for the skin cleansing and conditioning
business at P&AMP;G in Cincinnati, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noxzema in the blue jar has long been the leading facial
cleanser for teen-age girls,'' he added. ``The campaign drives home
the message to young women that Noxzema isn't just for teens; it's
for them.'' In addition to Noxzema, Schar oversees important P&AMP;G
brands like Coast, Clearasil, Ivory, Oil of Olay, Safeguard, and
Zest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noxzema brand has been around forever, so there's a desire
to make it feel fresh, unexpected and new,'' said Gerry Miller,
executive vice president and managing creative director at the Leo
Burnett USA unit of the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, the Noxzema
agency. ``Media becomes a way, a means, for delivering a message
that's a little up the contemporary, hip scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you notice and ask `Who has the nerve to do that?' ''
he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The campaign, Miller said, is aimed ``at women who are thinking
about their face, about their skin, but not in the traditional
bathroom time and place _ in a bathroom that's eight feet from a
dance floor with people crowded around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evolving alternative-media universe, bathrooms have
become a popular locale for advertising. Some ads appear on walls,
others on the doors of stalls and still others above urinals in
men's restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we sell to advertisers is a captive audience with a prime
demographic of 21 to 35,'' said David Dorfman, co-owner with Marc
Miller of Insite Advertising, a New York company that sells ad
space in restrooms in 250 locations in Manhattan to marketers like
P&AMP;G, the Joe Boxer Corp. and the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's sex-specific,'' he added, ``so you can get either men
or women and eliminate the waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller of Burnett called the Noxzema campaign ``a bit risky,''
but added: ``Risk these days is living in the middle of the road
where most of the cars can pass over you. Instead, you take an
attitude, you take a point of view, which is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The creative credits for the campaign are: Sarah Rose,
copywriter; Darryl Vasilinda, art director; and Chris Laubach,
creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett has extensive experience in producing risk-taking,
rule-breaking campaigns for products meant for younger consumers
that are sold by marketing behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   For the Altoids brand of mints sold by Callard &AMP; Bowser-Suchard,
a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, Burnett has produced ads
with odd, offbeat imagery to promote the product as ``the curiously
strong mints.'' One shows a cheerful woman wielding a whip above
the headline ``Pleasure in Pain.'' Burnett won two awards last
month for the Altoids campaign _ including the $100,000 grand prize
for general excellence _ from the Magazine Publishers of America.
And for the Dewar's brand of Scotch whisky sold by Diageo PLC,
Burnett has created a trailblazing series of ads using wry humor to
make Scotch more palatable to drinkers ages 21 to 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, the environment is inspirational,'' Miller
said of the influence of those campaigns on Noxzema's, ``but I'm
not sure it was all that literal and direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Moore, a spokeswoman at P&AMP;G for the product lines
supervised by Schar, declined to discuss the budget for the
campaign. The ads ``at this point are in New York City only,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get into future plans,'' Ms. Moore added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bars, restaurants and clubs that will display the
signs are Pageant, Trilogy, the Tunnel, the Turtle Bay Tavern and
Union Bar.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   EDITORS: The following identification line must be printed with
the column. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (This commentary is adapted from a panel discussion entitled
``Democracy: Is It for Everyone,'' held at the Council on Foreign
Relations, in New York, on May 19, 1998.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? I think the answer is no, not yet,
but it certainly is for more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is a heavy concentration of democracies, obviously, among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world? I
think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on different
forms and acquiring different characteristics in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of
constituting, limiting and changing governments. There is often a
tendency, however, to see it as something much more _ as, for
example, to suppose that the introduction of democracy will bring
about peace, equality, prosperity, harmony among nations and
classes and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that is the case. For governments produced by
elections can be inefficient, corrupt, shortsighted or
discriminatory. They can pursue aggressive nationalistic policies
and pursue ruinous economic policy. Democracy is no guarantee that
other good things will happen, although they may.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency among people to assume that democracy won't
have unhappy consequences. However, I think we have to confront the
fact that, in this world, elections will produce results which
don't necessarily make us happy; they may produce anti-Western
governments, illiberal governments, ones that we find very
difficult to deal with _ including, when they are weak and resting
on fragile coalitions, even governments which will go off, as India
just has, and explode nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To underline this point, I think this sort of caution,
concerning democracy, is desirable because of the widespread
assumption that, if other countries will simply democratize _ if we
can encourage them to move in that direction _ they will be
friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with. Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it
is not difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously
being a China which is highly nationalistic, in which politicians
competing for office appeal to Chinese nationalism and find it
worth their while, in terms of votes, to denounce the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, greater
equality, elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of a lot
of other social problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be
impossible for democratic governments to do that; only that there
is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   I think democracy is desirable for two reasons: One, it provides
order and a mechanism for incremental change, and it provides a way
of removing from office political leaders who have turned out to be
total flops.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is also one way _ not the only way _ of protecting
liberty in a society. And I agree that violations of liberty are
less likely if you have a democratic system of elected officials
who are going to have to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   It is timely, of course, to consider that India is a democracy.
Yet one of the reasons why the recent nuclear explosions took
place, it seems to me, was the existence of a weak coalition
government and a minority party that obviously wants to build
popular support. Indeed, apparently _ so far, at least _ it has
been extraordinarily successful in building popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I think it is necessary, even though India is a
democracy, to recognize that lots of things make the relations
between the United States and India very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference at Harvard University, where people
attended from the major countries and regions of the world, and
discussed the attitudes of their political intellectual elites
toward the international system, the use of force, and so forth,
one of the points that came through loud and clear was the seething
resentment under the surface, in large part, in many areas of the
world about the United States. We are the superpower and people
don't like that.
</P>
<P>
   This came through particularly clear in a paper prepared by a
scholar from India. He wrote of the divisions among the Indian
elites, including the Gandhians, yet concluded: ``For all Indian
elites, the United States represents the major diplomatic and
political threat. On virtually every issue of concern to India, the
U.S. has veto or mobilizational power, whether it is nuclear,
technological, economic, governmental or political matters. That
is, the United States can deny India its objectives and can rally
others to join it in punishing India.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, if any, on the globe will remain in the authoritarian camp?
Today 55 percent of the people in the world live under democratic
government, according to Dr. Gideon Rose, at the Council on Foreign
Relations. I believe that 50 years from now a larger percentage of
the world will be democratic. I would not guess exactly what
percentage or who will and won't be. But I will say there will be
some non-democratic regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically perhaps, given such a pivotal role on the world
stage, the situation of democracy in the United States, I believe,
is not as good as it should be. It certainly seems to have been
more vigorous in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is the extent to which political competition
now has become increasingly competition among candidates, or
between candidates, rather than between parties, and the parties
have tended to become service organizations for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there is the tremendous impact of television, not
just in terms of the influence on voters. Rather, the big influence
of television is the tremendous demand for money, and that's what
has made fund-raising such a central preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   To glance through the daily newspapers, it seems that our
president now probably spends more time fund-raising for his party
than any other single activity. I don't know that any of the bills
in Congress are going to remedy that. Very probably there may have
to be some drastic action, such as provision of public funds for
campaigns, or at least for advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   But then, democracies are not necessarily going to introduce
lots of good things. One can even think of democratic governments
that have been aggressive and that, in one way or another, have
terrorized parts of their population.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the young people of the country are inclined to wait for
the ideal world, or not wait, will depend upon, in large part, what
governments do and how governments act.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think youth, or students in particular, are
necessarily going to be the central force for change in the coming
years _ and not necessarily a force for positive change. They may
be, but like so many other parts of the equation, that isn't at all
certain.

<P>
   EDITORS: The following identification line must be printed with
the column. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (This commentary is adapted from a panel discussion entitled
``Democracy: Is It for Everyone,'' held at the Council on Foreign
Relations, in New York, on May 19, 1998.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? I think the answer is no, not yet,
but it certainly is for more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is a heavy concentration of democracies, obviously, among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world? I
think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on different
forms and acquiring different characteristics in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of
constituting, limiting and changing governments. There is often a
tendency, however, to see it as something much more _ as, for
example, to suppose that the introduction of democracy will bring
about peace, equality, prosperity, harmony among nations and
classes and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that is the case. For governments produced by
elections can be inefficient, corrupt, shortsighted or
discriminatory. They can pursue aggressive nationalistic policies
and pursue ruinous economic policy. Democracy is no guarantee that
other good things will happen, although they may.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency among people to assume that democracy won't
have unhappy consequences. However, I think we have to confront the
fact that, in this world, elections will produce results which
don't necessarily make us happy; they may produce anti-Western
governments, illiberal governments, ones that we find very
difficult to deal with _ including, when they are weak and resting
on fragile coalitions, even governments which will go off, as India
just has, and explode nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To underline this point, I think this sort of caution,
concerning democracy, is desirable because of the widespread
assumption that, if other countries will simply democratize _ if we
can encourage them to move in that direction _ they will be
friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with. Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it
is not difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously
being a China which is highly nationalistic, in which politicians
competing for office appeal to Chinese nationalism and find it
worth their while, in terms of votes, to denounce the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, greater
equality, elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of a lot
of other social problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be
impossible for democratic governments to do that; only that there
is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   I think democracy is desirable for two reasons: One, it provides
order and a mechanism for incremental change, and it provides a way
of removing from office political leaders who have turned out to be
total flops.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is also one way _ not the only way _ of protecting
liberty in a society. And I agree that violations of liberty are
less likely if you have a democratic system of elected officials
who are going to have to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   It is timely, of course, to consider that India is a democracy.
Yet one of the reasons why the recent nuclear explosions took
place, it seems to me, was the existence of a weak coalition
government and a minority party that obviously wants to build
popular support. Indeed, apparently _ so far, at least _ it has
been extraordinarily successful in building popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I think it is necessary, even though India is a
democracy, to recognize that lots of things make the relations
between the United States and India very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference at Harvard University, where people
attended from the major countries and regions of the world, and
discussed the attitudes of their political intellectual elites
toward the international system, the use of force, and so forth,
one of the points that came through loud and clear was the seething
resentment under the surface, in large part, in many areas of the
world about the United States. We are the superpower and people
don't like that.
</P>
<P>
   This came through particularly clear in a paper prepared by a
scholar from India. He wrote of the divisions among the Indian
elites, including the Gandhians, yet concluded: ``For all Indian
elites, the United States represents the major diplomatic and
political threat. On virtually every issue of concern to India, the
U.S. has veto or mobilizational power, whether it is nuclear,
technological, economic, governmental or political matters. That
is, the United States can deny India its objectives and can rally
others to join it in punishing India.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, if any, on the globe will remain in the authoritarian camp?
Today 55 percent of the people in the world live under democratic
government, according to Dr. Gideon Rose, at the Council on Foreign
Relations. I believe that 50 years from now a larger percentage of
the world will be democratic. I would not guess exactly what
percentage or who will and won't be. But I will say there will be
some non-democratic regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically perhaps, given such a pivotal role on the world
stage, the situation of democracy in the United States, I believe,
is not as good as it should be. It certainly seems to have been
more vigorous in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is the extent to which political competition
now has become increasingly competition among candidates, or
between candidates, rather than between parties, and the parties
have tended to become service organizations for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there is the tremendous impact of television, not
just in terms of the influence on voters. Rather, the big influence
of television is the tremendous demand for money, and that's what
has made fund-raising such a central preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   To glance through the daily newspapers, it seems that our
president now probably spends more time fund-raising for his party
than any other single activity. I don't know that any of the bills
in Congress are going to remedy that. Very probably there may have
to be some drastic action, such as provision of public funds for
campaigns, or at least for advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   But then, democracies are not necessarily going to introduce
lots of good things. One can even think of democratic governments
that have been aggressive and that, in one way or another, have
terrorized parts of their population.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the young people of the country are inclined to wait for
the ideal world, or not wait, will depend upon, in large part, what
governments do and how governments act.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think youth, or students in particular, are
necessarily going to be the central force for change in the coming
years _ and not necessarily a force for positive change. They may
be, but like so many other parts of the equation, that isn't at all
certain.

COMMENTARY: THE RIGHT STUFF  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the participants in Barry Goldwater's funeral Wednesday in
Tempe, Ariz., will be Ty Ross, a former Zoli model turned interior
decorator, a gay man who is HIV positive but remains in good
health. Ross, 36, is Barry Goldwater's grandson, and when I reached
him by phone at his home in Tucson Tuesday, he summed up his
grandfather's philosophy thus: ``Live and let live _ and party
on!''
</P>
<P>
   Ross was joking slightly, but he has great reverence for his
grandfather, whom he last saw just two days before his death. I had
called to ask him if it was true, as widely written, that he had
inspired the elder Goldwater to become an octogenarian proponent of
gay civil rights. Though Barry Goldwater was Conservative, the
seminal politician of the modern American right, his outspoken
views on gays in the military (for), abortion rights (for) and
government-sponsored school prayer (against) caused some of his
longtime ideological allies to whisper about his sanity in recent
years. Was he being manipulated in old age by his gay grandson, or
his younger second wife? Were his views warped by incipient
Alzheimer's?
</P>
<P>
   Ross said no _ a view confirmed by his mother, Joanne Goldwater,
in a separate interview. His grandfather's mind was sharp until the
end, he said, and his grandfather's principles had deep roots. ``He
was never a Bible-thumper,'' Ross explained. ``We're from a long
line of saloon owners _ frontiersmen, pioneers. Our family came out
here when Arizona was just a territory, Polish guys looking for
opportunity ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just pro-Constitution. If you look at the Constitution,
it doesn't say anything about having life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness _ unless you're gay. That's what he saw _ that we'd
all be included in the whole American dream.'' As for
conservatives' pro-choice stance, Ross pointed out that his
grandmother _ Barry Goldwater's first wife (of 51 years) _ had
helped start Planned Parenthood in Arizona. ``My mother got an
abortion when she was young,'' Ross added. ``It was illegal [in the
1950s), and my grandmother flew with her east to get one. Luckily
we had the money to do that. I can't imagine what someone with no
money did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Did your grandfather talk to you about being gay? ``No,'' Ross
said. ``I'd just show up with my partner, and he'd say, `Glad to
see you again.' Or he'd say, `It's good that you're standing up for
what you believe in. I'm proud of you, Goddammit.' He punctuated
everything with `Goddammit.''' Ross said that his homosexuality was
never a secret. ``In fourth grade, I wanted to decorate my room,''
he recalled with a laugh _ adding that his chosen color scheme was
a conservative red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   History records that Barry Goldwater's views about
constitutional inclusiveness did not prompt him to vote for the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that his position on choice sometimes
wavered. But the record also shows that he was far more
ideologically consistent than those conservatives knocking him
toward the end. ``The least government is the best government'' was
the Goldwater credo. As he wanted the government to get out of
social programs and the economy, so he wanted it to keep out of its
citizens' private lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father didn't change that much,'' said Ty's mother, the
eldest of Barry Goldwater's children, when I spoke with her later.
``He really believed in freedom of spirit. I think everyone has
changed all around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere more than in the Republican Party. The religious right
started to earn Barry Goldwater's vocal wrath when it opposed the
nomination of his fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O'Connor to the
Supreme Court in 1981 by distorting her views on abortion. A few
years later he publicly scolded his fellow senator Jesse Helms for
writing school-prayer legislation. In 1994 the retired Goldwater
predicted that if the GOP was hijacked by the likes of Pat
Robertson, it could ``kiss politics goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But few conservative eulogists have mentioned these warnings
this week. No sooner will Barry Goldwater be mourned in Arizona
than his belief in personal freedom will be mocked Thursday in
Washington, where his Republican heirs in Congress plan to vote to
mandate school prayer through a ``Religious Freedom Amendment''
that is anything but.

POLITICS CHARGED IN DELAY OF NEW YORK RENT SURVEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City panel that sets annual increases
for rent-stabilized apartments voted on Tuesday to delay the
release of a survey that would provide the first detailed look at
rents since the state Legislature scaled back protections for
tenants last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-3 vote by the Rent Guidelines Board drew angry criticism
from the board's two tenant representatives. They accused the
chairman, Edward Hochman, an appointee of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
of suppressing the report because it could prove politically
damaging to Giuliani's fellow Republican, Gov. George Pataki, who
is running for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   During the bruising fight in Albany last year over the future of
rent regulations, Pataki advocated eliminating protections on all
apartments once they became vacant. That proposal failed, but
landlords, backed by Pataki and the Republican leaders of the
Senate, won a compromise in which they can now increase rents by
about 20 percent when apartments turn over.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questioned slightly more than 2,000 tenants who had
moved since the new rent laws went into effect. While the staff
completed a report on the findings and planned to make it public
last Friday, Hochman read it on Thursday night and said he was
troubled by its presentation and because it compared new rents with
those in 1996, before the new laws were passed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 numbers are the most recent ones available from state
officials, who record stabilized rents each year. Figures for 1997
rents are expected to be released by the state this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a flawed report,'' Hochman said, in the
middle of often barbed exchanges with Kenneth Rosenfeld, one of two
tenant representatives on the board, who loudly demanded a copy of
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman later added: ``We're not going to go off half-cocked.''
He condemned past instances in which half-completed reports were
leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, who engaged in a shouting match with Hochman as the
meeting began, responded: ``I understood, legitimately, from the
staff that the report is ready, and ready to be distributed. And at
the last minute you made what appears to be a political decision _
but perhaps not, perhaps just an erroneous decision _ not to let it
out. I think it's an insult to the public and the board.''
</P>
<P>
   He said later that he believed that the report was not being
released because ``it will show with hard data what we all know is
happening, that regulated rents are skyrocketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're either protecting this administration or
probably the Pataki administration,'' Rosenfeld said. Hochman
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The board's two landlord representatives joined the two
so-called public members, who represent neither landlords nor
tenants, in voting against the release of the report now.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that there were enough votes against the
release, Hochman, in an apparent dig at Rosenfeld, cast his vote in
favor of handing out the report, and smiled broadly. As Hochman
left the meeting room in lower Manhattan, reporters asked why he
voted against his own position. ``I'm in favor of freedom of
information,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ In a panic when she found herself
pregnant for the first time three years ago, Fernande Aka, a
slender, soft-spoken high school senior, drank a concoction of
nearly frozen Coca-Cola and wine mixed with a heavy dose of sugar
that her schoolmates swore would make an unwanted pregnancy go
away.
</P>
<P>
   When that didn't work, she felt she had no choice but to
approach her mother, who took her one morning to a public hospital
and after hushed hallway negotiations with medical personnel there
paid $60 for the illegal termination of the two-month-old
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Miss Aka got pregnant once again, she and her
boyfriend decided to forgo the embarrassment of dealing with
parents and scraped together about $30, which they took to an
undercover abortion clinic on a side-street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor took new patients, three of us at a time, into his
clinic, and we were all treated very quickly,'' Miss Aka said.
``There was no anesthetic, he just kept talking to me the whole
while. Within 15 minutes we were on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, however, Miss Aka's troubles began with heavy
bleeding and horrible abdominal pains that still come and go, as do
unusual vaginal discharges. Worse, she suspects she is sterile.
</P>
<P>
   In a cruel sense, Miss Aka, who is now 19, is very lucky. She
has already seen several classmates die from self-administered
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   All across Africa, where all but a handful of governments outlaw
abortion, statistical indications of the consequences of
clandestine procedures are appalling.
</P>
<P>
   In one country after another, problems related to pregnancy are
the leading cause of death for women of child-bearing age, with
complications from abortion consistently ranking at the top of this
list. In Ethiopia, for example, 55 percent of maternal mortality
stems from illegal abortion. In Nigeria, fully half of the deaths
among pregnant women can be traced to this same cause.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent World Health Organization study, 58 women
are known to die each day on this continent from the consequences
of attempting to end their pregnancies using homemade ``cures'' or
in unsafe underground clinics. Many public health experts, however,
say this figure probably represents an infinitesimal tip of the
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent of the women who come to Treicheville hospital
come because of traditional or back-alley abortions,'' said a
doctor at one of this city's largest public hospitals who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Between 16 and 18 percent of these
women die without leaving the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christiane Welflens, director of obstetrics at Yopougon
University Hospital Center, one of Abidjan's largest public
hospitals, said, ``Twenty percent of the women who die during
pregnancy die from the consequences of clandestine abortion. This
represents the central drama of reproductive health in Africa. And
the women who do not die are condemned to bear heavy consequences
for their health far into the future, from sterility to chronic
pain to psychological scars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this toll, because of persistent inequalities between
men and women, widespread poverty and low literacy rates, the legal
status of abortion receives little of the public discussion in
Africa that has made it a central political issue in the United
States. In fact, the reproductive health care needs of women in
general scarcely figure in the public policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many of our countries abortion is treated as a symptom of
moral weakness, with a stigma of looseness attached to the woman
who undergoes the procedure,'' said Dr. Pape Syr Diagne, director
of the Center for Family Studies in Nairobi, Kenya, a nonprofit
organization that conducts training and research in reproductive
health. ``Abortion is a sensitive topic in any country, but in much
of Africa, its public discussion is virtually taboo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Ivory Coast, as in most of the former French colonies in
Africa, laws forbidding abortion derive from French legislation of
the 1920s that punished ``incitement to abortion and the
distribution of contraceptives.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first three decades in power, Ivory Coast's founding
father, the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, encouraged
people to have large families and forbade Western aid groups from
organizing birth control or family-planning activities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Houphouet-Boigny's approach grew out of the belief commonly held
in much of post-independence Africa that the continent was too
underpopulated to develop economically, thanks to factors ranging
from tropical disease to the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   This policy, combined with social traditions that measure a
family's wealth by the number of children and, in many places, with
the influence of the Roman Catholic Church's prohibition on
artificial means of birth control, have severely impeded any
campaigns for modern family planning or legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have relaxed here somewhat since Houphouet,'' said an
official at one major international aid agency in Abidjan who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``But the government would still like us
not to make too much noise about birth control, and is certainly
not interested in having a debate about abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ministry of Health in Abidjan, officials say flatly that
the country is ``just not ready'' for legalized abortion _ and, in
fact, may never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion is not a means of birth control, and legalizing it
would make people think that we were advocating it as such, which
is definitely not the message we want to express,'' said Dr. Robert
Ezzo, a Health Ministry official. ``The ministry is far more
concerned with prevention from the outset, to avoid even the notion
of unwanted pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for statistics about what was being done to help women
prevent unwanted pregnancies through birth control or better
reproductive health education, officials acknowledged that only 5
percent of the local, publicly funded health care clinics of the
sort used by poor and working-class women in the country provide
birth control information or counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Aka spends much of her time regretting that she had not
been better informed about her choices before her second pregnancy.
After her first abortion, she said, she had taken birth control
pills for a while, but abandoned them and all other forms of
contraception when she felt chest palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the shy but articulate high school student is
preparing for the baccalaureate examination that will determine
whether she will be admitted to college next fall, allowing her,
she hopes, to achieve her dream of becoming a French language
teacher some day.
</P>
<P>
   She is also desperately scraping together money to determine the
viability of another dream: eventually having children.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic where her second abortion was performed, the
doctor told her the other day that she would need to have three
tests done to see if she is still fertile. The tests cost a total
of $35, a sum she would have difficulty raising without the help of
her mother, whom she was too afraid to tell about her second
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was waiting to see the doctor I sat next to another
couple of young students who were about to have an abortion,'' Miss
Aka said. ``I told them about what had happened to me and asked
them if they were sure they wanted to go ahead. The girl didn't say
anything, but the boy turned to me and said: `We don't have the
money to raise a child now. It is too late to turn back.'''
</P>

JEERS ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR THE ROWDY PRESS 
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ It is an exercise familiar to the millions of readers
of Britain's populist tabloids. In times of national anxiety about
their country's place in the world _ when Britain is upset about
Europe's impending single currency or its anti-British beef policy
_ the papers dust off their jingoistic lexicon, trying to buck up
Britain by being rude about the French and the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The country's top press watchdog, Lord Wakeham, the chairman of
the Press Complaints Commission, usually responds by saying that
intemperate language is the price of free speech in a free society.
But last month he apparently reached his personal breaking point
when he picked up The Daily Star, one of the country's most raucous
tabloids, and saw the headline: ``Frogs Need a Good Kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline, and The Star's editorial referring to France's
``slimy Continental ways'' as it prepares to be the host of the
World Cup soccer tournament this month, moved Wakeham to say he did
not think The Star was being at all funny.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeham, whose group holds the newspapers to a voluntary code of
conduct, was particularly worried, he said, about the possibility
that Star-style coverage of the World Cup would provoke Britain's
notoriously violent football hooligans to attack French people
during the tournament. The tabloid editors, he said, should make
sure that ``their reporting and their comment does nothing to
incite violence, disorder or other unlawful behavior, or to foster
any form of xenophobia that could contribute directly to such
incitement.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, The Star's editorial expressed _ in crude terms _
views that are surprisingly widespread in Britain. Even as the
country moves closer to the rest of Europe through the European
Union, old-style prejudices against the Germans and the French seem
to flourish as robustly as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The antagonisms date back as far as the Norman Conquest, but
they also reflect fears that Britain might be swallowed up by the
new European order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of Britain's relationship with Europe is a crucial
one, and there's a lot of widespread anxiety and doubt and
skepticism,'' said Geoffrey Goodman, editor of The British
Journalism Review. ``But what minority prejudice exists in Britain
is fanned and exaggerated by the tabloids.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said people should stand up to the tabloids with more
vigor. ``I think Wakeham's response was pathetically weak,'' he
said. ``He should have made it clear that this is intolerable, that
you don't behave that way in a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   As the World Cup approaches, the tabloids have not been the only
ones being unpleasant to the French. The so-called quality papers,
for instance, were just as quick to blame what they felt was
typical Gallic bungling for the fact that millions of British
soccer fans were thwarted by an endless busy signal several weeks
ago when they tried to call a telephone number in France to order
World Cup tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 million callers reportedly failed to get through on the
first day alone because, according to the papers, the French were
jamming the telephone lines and hogging the tickets for themselves.
``This is the World Cup, not the French Cup,'' The Times said in an
editorial. Or, as The Daily Record put it, ``Well done mes amis
across at Froggie Telecom.''
</P>
<P>
   It was portrayed as typical French incompetence when the French
minister for tourism, a woman The Daily Mirror characterized as
``thick as a parrot,'' blithely invited soccer fans without World
Cup tickets to come to France anyway. Everyone knows, the papers
said, what happens when a bunch of ticketless British fans convene
in a small place with a lot to drink and not much to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``French Unrepentant on World Cup Invite,'' reported The Daily
Telegraph. ``Oui are not amused,'' noted The Daily Record.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, Wakeham's comments seem to have inspired a
bout of soul-searching in the tabloids, which have been fighting a
brutal circulation war. Though The Star was defiant, saying of the
French that it would continue ``squeezing their escargots,'' Piers
Morgan, editor of The Mirror, said he had learned a ``salutary
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was old-style tabloid humor,'' said Morgan, whose paper
succeeded in offending even its own thick-skinned readers with a
headline saying ``Achtung! Surrender'' to the Germans in a soccer
tournament in 1996. He vowed not to use words like ``Frogs'' and
``Krauts'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all probably realized that the appetite for this kind
of thing has gone,'' he said. ``We have to reflect the way the
readers change.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stuart Higgins, editor of The Sun, a Murdoch paper _ which
urged readers in rude terms in 1990 to tell Jacques Delors, then
the president of the European Commission, what they thought of
monetary union _ said he would be careful with the epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to go out and say `We're going to invade
France,' or encourage our fans to behave in a hooligan-type way,''
Higgins said. But, he added, appearing to diminish his point a bit,
that does not mean he has to be nice to the French. ``In many
ways,'' he said, ``the French, in the way they've handled the
ticket allocation, deserve a good kicking.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7)  
 (af)  
 By HILARY OSTLERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suki Schorer perches precariously on a ballet barre,
giving her the maximum overview of her students in Studio 3 at the
School of American Ballet at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 2 inches tall, she needs the extra height to conduct a
rehearsal of Balanchine's challenging ``Donizetti Variations,'' one
of three ballets presented this weekend at the school's Workshop
Performance at the Juilliard Theater. Her eyes dart everywhere.
Cajoling, joking, demonstrating, she demands perfection, just as
Balanchine, her mentor, did when she danced for the New York City
Ballet from 1959 to 1971. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schorer is famous for staging Balanchine ballets for the
workshop every year. ``I've been doing it for 24 years,'' she says.
``Twelve different ballets. I've recycled `Serenade,' one of my
favorites, four times.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schorer's students, who range in age from 16 to 18, treat
her with affectionate familiarity. ``If she wanted, I'm sure she
could still dance her part in `Donizetti,' '' says Ryan Kelly, 17,
one of three corps members who will be performing in the workshop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Megan Pepin, long-limbed and coltish and one of two students who
will dance the ballerina part, adds: ``She has so much energy. We
work hard, but we also tell stories and laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Before curtain time they know Peter Martins, City Ballet's
artistic director and ballet master in chief, will stop in to offer
suggestions and give a final stamp of approval.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schorer, 59, whose given name is Suzanne though she's never
called that, was born in Boston and is the daughter of the literary
critic Mark Schorer. She has won her reputation as a visionary
teacher with attention to detail and the ability to inspire people
to dance with naturalness, grace and a feeling of spontaneity and
not just perform the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine spotted her ability to analyze and correct when she
was in the corps de ballet. ``He would ask me to explain what
someone in class was doing wrong and to suggest a correction,'' she
recalls. ``He would ask, `What do you think of this person _ not
what you're looking at now, but the talent underneath, the
potential that's there?' One day, because he had a meeting, he
said, `Suki, you start company class.' Sometimes he didn't turn up
at all, and I'd be there teaching as well as taking class.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Balanchine went out to scout new talent, Ms. Schorer would
occasionally go along. She taught a children's class, then an
intermediate men's class, then a class for new people in the
company. ``I tried to help dancers with their roles,'' she says.
``A dancer, perhaps in the corps of the `Waltz of the Flowers,'
would say: `Come and look at me. How could I do better?' We'd talk
about how each step should move, how we should put the feet to the
floor, how to bend the body. I tried to get them to dance the way
Mr. B. liked to see dancing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schorer acknowledges that she's not one of nature's Swan
Queens, but she excelled in the soubrette roles that Balanchine
created for her, like Pierrette in ``Harlequinade'' and the First
Butterfly in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques d'Amboise, the former City Ballet principal dancer,
says: ``I noticed her from the beginning. She was like a little
cosmic particle flitting around the stage. When she was our
children's baby sitter, I don't think she actually ever
(italics)sat.(end italics) But just because she's not outwardly
serious doesn't mean she not a great brain. She's the best teacher
I know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schorer is enjoying a particularly good year. This spring
she received the Dance Magazine Award for lifetime service to dance
and was named to the senior faculty chair at the School of American
Ballet, previously held by the legendary teacher Stanley Williams,
who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her teaching continues to encompass lecture demonstrations and
the dissemination of the Balanchine ethos to teachers abroad. And
she's working on instructional dance videos and writing a book on
Balanchine technique, to be published next year by Knopf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it's still more dance. ``I love to
tango,'' Ms. Schorer says. She and a friend, Russell Lee, go out to
spin around a ballroom in vintage dances or try to solve tango's
sexy complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could master the Argentine style in three
months,'' she says. ``Three years later I'm still taking lessons.''

HUNDREDS PAY RESPECTS TO BARRY GOLDWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Mike Thomas was the first one at the chu rch door
Tuesday morning. And before the sun set, he and 1,000 others had
said their good-byes to Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in ROTC at Camelback High School from 1955 to 1959, and
we won a lot of awards,'' Thomas recalled. ``Barry pinned a lo t of
them on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator died Friday at the age of 89. More than 100
people were in line outside Trinity Cathedral when the bells rang
exactly at 11 a.m., and the doors opened.
</P>
<P>
   They came in wheelchairs, old station wagon s and big red BMWs.
Many were silver-haired, wearing Western hats and turquoise
jewelry. They were all native Arizonans, or at least Goldwater made
them feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's wife Susan spent the day greeting every one with a
handshak e or a hug, except for a moment when retired Episcopal
Bishop Joseph Harte prayed with the family over the coffin at
noontime.
</P>
<P>
   The line of people passed smoothly, pausing at the coffin and
the baptismal font that displayed Goldwater's 1911 chu rch
registration.
</P>
<P>
   A few people left mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an eagle feather,'' said Debra Nez of Needles, Calif.
``I want to give it to him because he had respect for the Indians -
every tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, an aging veteran wo uld imitate a posture of youth
and throw a salute.
</P>
<P>
   Past commanders of American Legion Post 41 showed respect for
Goldwater as a 49-year member gave an ``order-arms'' salute as the
visitation began. ``He helped get the deed for the property the
post is on,'' said former state lawmaker Earl Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   A uniformed honor guard from Luke Air Force Base flanked the
coffin without moving except to change personnel as the cathedral
bell chimed every 45 minutes. Joanne Goldwater, the sen ator's
eldest daughter, took a break from greeting guests at one point to
ring the bell.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong stream of visitors included some dignitaries -
former Maricopa County Supervisor Hawley Atkinson, former Arizona
House Speaker Don Aldridg e, former state Sen. Jim Buster of Yuma,
former Gov. Jack Williams. They all praised Goldwater's candor and
commitment to conservative principles.
</P>
<P>
   Most had a story to share, like Aldridge's helicopter trip with
Goldwater into Havasupai Villa ge at the bottom of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were checking on a big hydroponic vegetable operation the
federal government had put in,'' Aldridge said. ``Before we got
there, they had thrown out all the hydroponic stuff and built horse
barns for
trail rides - something that made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods had some regrets after
passing by the bier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have spent more time with him,'' Woods said. ``I
wanted to have lunch with him at least once a mon th. But things
come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma Chriseman, 90, of Sun City, got up early to ride to
downtown Phoenix with her daughter, Emilie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired that man for many years,'' Chriseman said from her
wheelchair. ``I wanted to meet him so badly.' '
</P>
<P>
   The visitation helped with the family's sadness as well, Joanne
Goldwater said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me when I saw the casket draped with the flag,'' she
said. ``Just knowing he's in a better place is keeping our spirits
up. And having a lot o f my friends come down - a lot of my old
high school buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Kim Hudson of Phoenix, who needed a tissue when
asked about Goldwater. ``I'm sure he's better off,'' she said.
``But a lot of people are going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several visitors said they were disappointed in the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there would be many, many people here,'' Barbara
Shine of Glendale said. ``He was so big. There should have been
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a line outside the
</P>
<P>
   church on a hot day is what attracted Teeter Francies of
Phoenix, who was passing by on the way to an errand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they talked on the news was, we wouldn't be able to
get in,'' she said. ``But when we saw it wasn't crowded . . . .'' &QL;

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO ALLOW NEW METHOD OF CENSUS COUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton plunged into the debate over race,
politics and the U.S. Census on Tuesday, urging Congress to permit
the use of a new method for counting the population that Democrats
say is more accurate but Republicans contend is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The president, joining forces with other members of his party
and Census officials, contended that the 1990 Census missed whole
segments of the population, largely members of minority groups,
thereby throwing off decisions by government and business on
everything from health care to advertising. Statistical sampling,
Clinton said, would include in the count people who might be missed
by traditional techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inaccurate census distorts our understanding of the needs
of our people,'' Clinton said, before sitting down here with a
group of eight community leaders, activists and academics for a
discussion intended to promote sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have filed suit to stop the use of sampling, arguing
that it is unconstitutional and designed to help the Democratic
Party by including more minorities, many of whom tend to vote
Democratic. Among other things, the Census helps determine how
congressional districts are drawn and so could affect which party
controls the Congress at the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the count is, wherever the people are, this is not a
political issue,'' Clinton insisted. ``This is an American issue.''
His remarks on Tuesday were by far the most extensive Clinton has
made about sampling, and his first comments on the matter since
last year, when he promised to make the issue a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Census Bureau have been arguing for many months
that statistical sampling would yield a far more accurate estimate
of the population than the old-fashioned head-count method, but
Clinton has said little on the subject, prompting complaints from
some Democrats. Tuesday's roundtable discussion seemed designed to
give encouragement to members of his party while putting pressure
on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of sampling is of such importance that many who have
followed it believe it will inevitably be decided in the Supreme
Court. Politically, it is explosive. Many experts believe, for
instance, that if the 1990 Census had been adjusted to make up for
its acknowledged undercount, California would have gained yet
another congressional seat, while Wisconsin would have lost one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one key Republican accused Clinton of ``partisan
calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than committing himself to do the hard work necessary
to end the minority undercount,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who
is chairman of the House subcommittee on the Census, ``the
president is out peddling statistical snake-oil to the public that
will add `virtual people' in some areas while deleting real people
from other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The president downplayed partisanship here, but politics was an
important part of his trip to Texas. He appeared at a
$5000-a-person lunch here to raise $800,000 for congressional
Democrats, and he planned to raise another $500,000 in Dallas on
Tuesday night for the Democratic National Committee. A handful of
protesters turned up at some of Clinton's appearances on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new sampling approach advocated by Clinton would still rely
on the techniques the Census Bureau has used since 1970, mailing
out questionaires to the population as well as knocking on doors.
But instead of trying to count everyone, the bureau proposes to
count people in 90 percent of the households in each census tract,
a neighborhood of about 1,700 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau statisticians would use those figures to try to determine
the number of people in the tract who had not been physically
counted. The bureau would check the results by conducting a survey
of 750,000 households nationwide and adjusting the total if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed approach was developed by the Census Bureau after
the 1990 Census, which cost $2.6 billion, a huge increase over
previous surveys. The bureau later determined that it had missed
8.4 million people and double-counted 4.4 million others.
Nationally, the Census Bureau estimates that it undercounted the
population by 1.8 percent, a margin of error that the Clinton
administration argues sampling would reduce to 0.1 point.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans vehemently object to sampling. They say that it
violates the Constitution, which calls for an ``actual
enumeration'' every 10 years, and that it is much too complex to be
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mallett, the deputy commerce secretary, said that the 2000
census was expected to cost $4.2 billion. Without sampling, he
said, it will cost far more, because the government will have to
hire at least 100,000 more ``enumerators'' _ beyond the 260,000 now
planned _ to count the population.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ In a panic when she found herself
pregnant for the first time three years ago, Fernande Aka, a
slender, soft-spoken high school senior, drank a concoction of
nearly frozen Coca-Cola and wine mixed with a heavy dose of sugar
that her schoolmates swore would make an unwanted pregnancy go
away.
</P>
<P>
   When that didn't work, she felt she had no choice but to
approach her mother, who took her one morning to a public hospital
and after hushed hallway negotiations with medical personnel there
paid $60 for the illegal termination of the two-month-old
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Miss Aka got pregnant once again, she and her
boyfriend decided to forgo the embarrassment of dealing with
parents and scraped together about $30, which they took to an
undercover abortion clinic on a side-street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor took new patients, three of us at a time, into his
clinic, and we were all treated very quickly,'' Miss Aka said.
``There was no anesthetic, he just kept talking to me the whole
while. Within 15 minutes we were on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, however, Miss Aka's troubles began with heavy
bleeding and horrible abdominal pains that still come and go, as do
unusual vaginal discharges. Worse, she suspects she is sterile.
</P>
<P>
   In a cruel sense, Miss Aka, who is now 19, is very lucky. She
has already seen several classmates die from self-administered
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   All across Africa, where all but a handful of governments outlaw
abortion, statistical indications of the consequences of
clandestine procedures are appalling.
</P>
<P>
   In one country after another, problems related to pregnancy are
the leading cause of death for women of child-bearing age, with
complications from abortion consistently ranking at the top of this
list. In Ethiopia, for example, 55 percent of maternal mortality
stems from illegal abortion. In Nigeria, fully half of the deaths
among pregnant women can be traced to this same cause.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent World Health Organization study, 58 women
are known to die each day on this continent from the consequences
of attempting to end their pregnancies using homemade ``cures'' or
in unsafe underground clinics. Many public health experts, however,
say this figure probably represents an infinitesimal tip of the
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent of the women who come to Treicheville hospital
come because of traditional or back-alley abortions,'' said a
doctor at one of this city's largest public hospitals who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Between 16 and 18 percent of these
women die without leaving the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christiane Welflens, director of obstetrics at Yopougon
University Hospital Center, one of Abidjan's largest public
hospitals, said, ``Twenty percent of the women who die during
pregnancy die from the consequences of clandestine abortion. This
represents the central drama of reproductive health in Africa. And
the women who do not die are condemned to bear heavy consequences
for their health far into the future, from sterility to chronic
pain to psychological scars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this toll, because of persistent inequalities between
men and women, widespread poverty and low literacy rates, the legal
status of abortion receives little of the public discussion in
Africa that has made it a central political issue in the United
States. In fact, the reproductive health care needs of women in
general scarcely figure in the public policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many of our countries abortion is treated as a symptom of
moral weakness, with a stigma of looseness attached to the woman
who undergoes the procedure,'' said Dr. Pape Syr Diagne, director
of the Center for Family Studies in Nairobi, Kenya, a nonprofit
organization that conducts training and research in reproductive
health. ``Abortion is a sensitive topic in any country, but in much
of Africa, its public discussion is virtually taboo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Ivory Coast, as in most of the former French colonies in
Africa, laws forbidding abortion derive from French legislation of
the 1920s that punished ``incitement to abortion and the
distribution of contraceptives.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first three decades in power, Ivory Coast's founding
father, the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, encouraged
people to have large families and forbade Western aid groups from
organizing birth control or family-planning activities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Houphouet-Boigny's approach grew out of the belief commonly held
in much of post-independence Africa that the continent was too
underpopulated to develop economically, thanks to factors ranging
from tropical disease to the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   This policy, combined with social traditions that measure a
family's wealth by the number of children and, in many places, with
the influence of the Roman Catholic Church's prohibition on
artificial means of birth control, have severely impeded any
campaigns for modern family planning or legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have relaxed here somewhat since Houphouet,'' said an
official at one major international aid agency in Abidjan who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``But the government would still like us
not to make too much noise about birth control, and is certainly
not interested in having a debate !bout abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ministry of Health in Abidjan, officials say flatly that
the country is ``just not ready'' for legalized abortion _ and, in
fact, may never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion is not a means of birth control, and legalizing it
would make people think that we were advocating it as such, which
is definitely not the message we want to express,'' said Dr. Robert
Ezzo, a Health Ministry official. ``The ministry is far more
concerned with prevention from the outset, to avoid even the notion
of unwanted pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for statistics about what was being done to help women
prevent unwanted pregnancies through birth control or better
reproductive health education, officials acknowledged that only 5
percent of the local, publicly funded health care clinics of the
sort used by poor and working-class women in the country provide
birth control information or counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Aka spends much of her time regretting that she had not
been better informed about her choices before her second pregnancy.
After her first abortion, she said, she had taken birth control
pills for a while, but abandoned them and all other forms of
contraception when she felt chest palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the shy but articulate high school student is
preparing for the baccalaureate examination that will determine
whether she will be admitted to college next fall, allowing her,
she hopes, to achieve her dream of becoming a French language
teacher some day.
</P>
<P>
   She is also desperately scraping together money to determine the
viability of another dream: eventually having children.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic where her second abortion was performed, the
doctor told her the other day that she would need to have three
tests done to see if she is still fertile. The tests cost a total
of $35, a sum she would have difficulty raising without the help of
her mother, whom she was too afraid to tell about her second
!bortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was waiting to see the doctor I sat next to another
couple of young students who were about to have an abortion,'' Miss
Aka said. ``I told them about what had happened to me and asked
them if they were sure they wanted to go ahead. The girl didn't say
anything, but the boy turned to me and said: `We don't have the
money to raise a child now. It is too late to turn back.'''

`MACHO' AMENDMENTS IMPERIL TOBACCO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's massive anti-smoking bill is
</P>
<P>
   in peril because of ``macho'' amendments senators are pushing to
punish the tobacco industry and score political points, McCain said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of knocking this thing way out of balance, if
we haven't already,'' the Arizona
</P>
<P>
   Republican said in an emotional speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, McCain placed the stalled bill's prospects
for passage at ``still better than 50-50. But you know me, I'm an
eternal optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, McCain s aid, is that some senators want to toughen
the bill _ apparently for political posturing _ to penalize
cigarettemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see going on here _ interestingly from both ends of the
political spectrum _ is such punitive amendments that we
</P>
<P>
   will drive the tobacco companies out of business,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers must decide whether to pass his legislation, McCain
said, or whether to simply to ``vote for amendments to show how
macho and tough we are on the tobacco companies.' '
</P>
<P>
   His remarks cast McCain, if only fleetingly, in the unlikely
role of a tobacco industry defender. The tobacco companies have
accused him of trying to orchestrate their demise. While conceding
he is no fan of the cigarettemakers, McCain has
</P>
<P>
   denied that his goal is to tax the industry out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill is designed to reduce youth smoking through stiff
cigarette price increases and sales and marketing curbs. The
measure would cost the industry at least $516 billion
</P>
<P>
   in tobacco-related health costs and anti-smoking programs. It
also proposes a ban on outdoor advertising by tobacco firms that
may violate free speech, says the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers hope to shut off debate and proceed to a vote
on the measure by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Senate must consdider amendments that are
worrisome to McCain and the bill's other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment, by Richard Durbin, D-Ill., would toughen the
penalties on
</P>
<P>
   tobacco companies if youth smoking reduction targets are not
met.
</P>
<P>
   The Durbin amendment _ combined with an earlier, passed
amendment eliminating a cap on the industry's legal liability _
``could be the death knell of the whole bill'' because
</P>
<P>
   it exacts such a great toll, said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said if cigarette companies started going under, the
nation would be deprived of billions of dollars of tobacco revenues
that could go towards trying to con vince teens not to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies began closing, McCain said, 40 million adult
Americans would still find ways to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be a Marlboro, or a Camel or another operating out of
Mexico, El Salvador or whatever, and they
</P>
<P>
   would be exporting cigarettes into the United States which we
would not have nearly as much control over,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news on the tobacco bill for McCain on
Tuesday. The Senate approved his amendment to add $3 billion
</P>
<P>
   in funding for veterans' tobacco-related health-care costs.
Veterans' groups have been angered at Congress for recently taking
away a $17 billion benefit program for former service members who
contracted smoking-related ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Debate o n the tobacco bill is scheduled to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders said they feared the Republican majority was
losing interest in the bill; as evidence, they cited the Senate's
willingness to move on to other Senate business Tuesday while
</P>
<P>
   the tobacco measure was still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the message seemed to
be, ``If Democrats behave, we'll probably be able to come back to
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is out of session Wednesday so that membe rs may
attend the late Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater's funeral in Tempe. &QL;

IN SEARCH OF THE MORAL BASIS OF SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Miss., Mass.)   (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From time to time in years past, David Blankenhorn's
grandmother would call him from Birmingham, Ala., to ask whether he
had found a job yet. He would patiently explain that he was in New
York running a group that promoted the importance of the family and
of fatherhood, but she never really got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could always tell that she was thinking, `He gets paid to do
this?' '' he said last week. ``It was just so obvious to her that
it never occurred to her that it was necessary. So she always said,
`Good boy, you'll do fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, 10 years after Blankenhorn willed the group into
existence, the Institute for American Values seems an improbable
venture, calmly searching for the moral truths of society from a
small office suite on the furious gyre of Columbus Circle. Its
name, which Blankenhorn concedes is both corny and grandiose,
sounds more like the academic offshoot of the Christian Coalition
than the brainchild of a 43-year-old former Vista volunteer and
liberal organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, the institute has achieved considerable mainstream
success in the last few years, taking pro-family arguments once
made only by the religious right and making them palatable for the
center and even a few academic leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after two years of effort, 24 prominent professors,
politicians, and community activists from across the spectrum
signed a new report issued by the institute that is likely to
stimulate debate. The report, entitled ``A Call to Civil Society:
Why Democracy Needs Moral Truths,'' is the group's most ambitious
effort to date, making 41 recommendations to various segments of
society to reverse what it calls the nation's growing inequality
and moral depletion.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are for the most part centered around the
idea of strengthening the married couple as the basic unit of child
rearing. To that end, the report calls on government to make
divorce more difficult to achieve and tax codes more supportive of
marriage. It supports giving a preference on welfare benefits to
married couples, making work places more flexible for parents and
reducing violence and sexual content on television during the
first, ``family hour'' of prime time. It also advocates more
emphasis on arts education, incentives to give more charitable
donations to anti-poverty groups and an end to state lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ideas come from conservative groups like Focus on
the Family, while others are supported by liberal advocates. Few of
those who worked on and signed the report are known as flaming
ideologues; most are centrists, grappling like Blankenhorn for the
kind of ideological synthesis he began to develop years ago while
pondering why most Americans believe their country is in moral
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The chairwoman of the group that prepared the report was Jean
Bethke Elshtain, the University of Chicago ethics professor. Other
members included Cornel West, professor of religion and
Afro-American studies at Harvard; Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.; and John
Atlas, executive director of the Passaic County, N.J., Legal Aid
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great majorities of Americans feel we are on the wrong track,
that the institutions of civil society are getting weaker,'' said
Blankenhorn, who lives with his wife and three children on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan. ``At one time, only religious zealots
would talk about this, and it's still kind of countercultural to
assert that it's possible to have some shared moral understandings.
But we believe that it's not only possible, but necessary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blankenhorn, as one of his friends put it, tends to amble
through a sentence, a residue of his upbringing in Jackson, Miss.,
more prominent than any remaining accent. Friends say his courtly
willingness to listen to a person's argument and find a common
ground with others has helped him hold together disparate groups
like the most recent panel. His institute gets its $600,000 budget
from a variety of donors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has also deliberately avoided the most
rupturing flash points: There is no mention in the report of
abortion or gay rights. (He says he is personally wary of
legislation that extends benefits to same-sex partners, believing
that the mother-father relationship is the best way to raise
children.)
</P>
<P>
   His quest for the moral basis of society came after graduating
from Harvard and working several years as a community volunteer in
the Boston area, railing against high utility rates and organizing
low-income residents to fight City Hall. After seeing firsthand the
effect on children of single-mother families, he began writing
articles on the importance of traditional fatherhood, and spent
three years fruitlessly knocking on doors, trying to get centrist
and liberal academics interested in families.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1989, he put together the first of several
conferences on the subject, beginning to popularize the notion of a
more civil society that was not necessarily based on divine
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenhorn's critics often say that he is too rigid in his
conception of the ideal family, but they acknowledge that his
advocacy of fatherhood has pushed the debate beyond the usual
polarizing arguments. He says he will be satisfied if he can get a
few citizens thinking about the obligations of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't come across as finger-pointing, like some
kind of national catechism,'' he said. ``We don't think anyone has
perfect access to the truth, or a complete understanding of it, but
we do believe that moral truths really exist. And it shouldn't be
taboo to think so.''

RUSSIA'S WEEKLY DEBT-AUCTION FACES AN ESPECIALLY TOUGH SELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ECON) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the money it needs each week to pay off
debt that is coming due and fund its persistent budget deficit has
always been a tricky proposition for Russia, given the nation's
tumultuous political and economic climate.
</P>
<P>
   But the job will be particularly difficult on Wednesday, when
the government needs to raise about $1.2 billion from the financial
markets in the face of near-panic among domestic and foreign
investors about Russia's ability to maintain the value of its
currency and honor all its debts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has failed in its three previous weekly debt
auctions to raise all the cash it needs, and economists said it
remained unclear whether Wednesday's auction would go any better.
Although sky-high interest rates and the possibility of additional
aid for Russia from the International Monetary Fund have somewhat
reassured investors, economists and market analysts said Russia
might once again be able to sell only a portion of bonds it is
offering. That would force the government to dip into its skimpy
financial reserves to pay off its creditors, deepening the sense of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has been pressing domestic banks and
investors to buy the bonds as a sign of confidence in Russia's
prospects. There were some reports on Tuesday that domestic
investors, who are required to place money in escrow with the
government the day before an auction if they want a chance to bid,
had made bigger-than-expected deposits on Tuesday, suggesting that
demand for the bonds could be better than expected. But analysts
said that with the situation so unsettled it was difficult to
predict any quick end to the financial turbulence, especially if
foreign investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be another volatile day,'' said Dmitry Chernyak,
a Russia specialist at Merrill Lynch in London. ``I don't see a lot
of foreign investors returning to the market at this point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia's main vehicle for raising money on its domestic
financial markets is a type of bond, known as a GKO, that matures
in less than a year. The country has about $60 billion in GKOs
outstanding, and because of the bonds' relatively short durations
the government is forced into a weekly scramble to redeem them and
refinance the debt. Investors demand short maturities to minimize
the risks of the ruble's being sharply devalued, eroding the return
on the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, as much as a third of the GKOs are held by
foreign investors, with Russian banks holding most of the rest. The
crisis in Asia had made foreign investors skittish about investing
in developing economies even before Russia's latest woes erupted.
And since the Russian stock market began falling and the currency
started coming under pressure, foreign investors have been pulling
their money out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To make ruble-denominated investments more attractive and prop
up the currency's value, the Russian central bank has pushed up the
short-term interest rates it controls to 150 percent. The tactic
has succeeded in maintaining the ruble's value so far.
</P>
<P>
   But between the government-controlled interest rates and the
rates set by the market _ including those on the GKO bonds, which
are currently around 65 percent _ Russia's interest costs threaten
to soar out of control. Nearly a third of the government's
expenditures this year are projected to go to making interest
payments (the comparable figure in the United States is about 14
percent), and that projection is based on an assumption that GKO
rates will decline to around 35 percent, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If interest rates remain high it exacerbates the budget
problem and puts them in effect in a debt trap,'' said Desmond
Lachman, the head of emerging market economic research at Salomon
Smith Barney, the investment firm in New York. ``It's imperative
that they get interest rates down quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   If rates remained at their current levels for the rest of the
year, the budget deficit would be around 8 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with the 5 percent target agreed to last
week by the IMF and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, according to
Erik Nielsen, an economist at Goldman Sachs in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who met with Kiriyenko on Monday in Moscow as part of a
delegation of Western bankers, said Russia plans to try to lessen
its dependence on the domestic GKO market by issuing more bonds
denominated in dollars and other currencies through financial
markets in Europe. He said Russia now hopes to raise as much as $6
billion this year on the European markets, up from $3.5 billion
under a previous plan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will need to finance the redemption of around $50 billion
in debt this year, Nielsen said. But if there is good news for the
government, it is that the redemptions are fairly evenly spaced out
through the rest of the year, giving the Finance Ministry and the
central bank an opportunity to work out a solution on the run.

CARDINALS GAMBLE ON DREW, SLUGGER PHILLIES COULDN'T SIGN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the fifth pick in the first round of baseball's annual
draft, the St. Louis Cardinals gambled on Tuesday by selecting J.D.
Drew, the college outfielder whom the Philadelphia Phillies were
unable to sign in the past year. Unfortunately for the Cardinals,
they did not hear from Drew the sentiment expressed by the Mets'
first-round choice, Jason Tyner. Asked if he might be represented
by Scott Boras, Drew's agent and the No. 1 scourge of major league
clubs, Tyner said: ``Scott Boras doesn't fit my personality at all.
I don't fit that. I feel honored the Mets drafted me and I don't
want to hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyner is a 21-year-old center fielder from Texas A&AMP;M by way of
Beaumont, Texas. The Mets made him the 21st player drafted, and he
was followed three picks later by Andy Brown, an 18-year-old
Richmond, Ind., high school outfielder whom the Yankees selected.
The Phillies, who made Drew the No. 2 pick last year, drafted first
this time and took Pat Burrell, a third baseman from the University
of Miami, whom they projected as a first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited the Yankees picked me,'' Brown, who batted
.466, said by telephone from his home. ``They were my first choice.
I knew they were showing a lot of interest. I was really hoping
they would pick me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyner, a .384 hitter with 37 stolen bases, was equally excited.
``It's a dream come true for me,'' he said from his home. ``New
York is an unbelievable place for baseball. They love their
baseball there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his plan was to sign as quickly as possible. He had
someone who has been advising him, he said, and wasn't sure he
would hire an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs in recent years have found Boras so difficult to negotiate
with that many shun his clients. Five players who had been
projected as first-round picks Tuesday were not because of the
perception that Boras will represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Representing Drew, who has started his second season as a
professional with the Saint Paul Saints of the independent Northern
League, Boras demanded a $10-million signing bonus in negotiations
with the Phillies until the last day they were eligible to sign the
outfielder. The agent finally reduced the asking price to $7
million, but the Phillies rejected the proposal, raising their
overall offer but sticking to their $2.6-million signing bonus that
was in line with the going rate for high first-round choices last
year. Matt Anderson, a college pitcher who was the No. 1 pick,
signed with Detroit for a $2,505,000 bonus, a record for a drafted
player. Walt Jocketty, the St. Louis general manager, said the
Cardinals drafted Drew with their eyes open, having spoken with
Boras as recently as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably three guys for sure, maybe four, we keyed
on in the draft,'' Jocketty said by telephone from St. Louis.
``When we saw they were going to be selected ahead of us, we
decided to go with Drew. We just felt J.D. Drew is one of the best
players in the draft. He has the ability to play in the big leagues
soon. We decided we'd draft him and do the very best to sign him.
The ceiling is high on this guy and sometimes you have to take some
risks to succeed.'' His exploratory chat with Boras, Jocketty
added, went as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of restated his position,'' Jocketty said. ``We look
at it this way. He has a chance to play in a good organization, one
of the most storied organizations in baseball, one with a lot of
Hall of Famers and one of the most prolific home run hitters of all
time. There are a lot of things we think we can use to sell him on
playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jocketty said, he knew of two other teams he
wouldn't identify that were prepared to draft Drew, who in his
first four games with St. Paul this season hit .583 with a .917
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager, who last year pulled off an unexpected coup
by signing Mark McGwire to a multiyear contract, said the Cardinals
had internally discussed at length the cost of signing Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'd rather not divulge what we've discussed,'' he
said. ``It's something we have to talk to them about first. But
we're well aware of what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cardinals fare no better than the Phillies? The club
had three other picks in the first 55 selections, Jocketty said,
seeing that as a consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Among other first-round picks, the San Diego Padres took Sean
Burroughs, a high school third baseman, whose father, Jeff, was the
American League most valuable player in 1974, and the Minnesota
Twins selected Ryan Mills, an Arizona State pitcher, whose father,
Dick, pitched in two games for the Boston Red Sox in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had wanted to draft Mark Teixeira, a high school
third baseman from Maryland, but in their talks with him on Monday
night, they could not induce him to commit to signing for a bonus
in the $1.5-million range. He wanted about $500,000 more. Teixeira,
who had been projected to go higher than Brown, is believed to be
one of those players whom Boras will advise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Yankees failed to sign their No. 1 pick, Tyrel
Godwin, an outfielder, who opted to go to the University of North
Carolina. The Yankees offered Godwin $1.9 million; he sought $2.1
million.

RUSSIAN CRISIS COULD SPREAD TO OTHER COUNTRIES, U.S. OFFICIAL
WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned on Tuesday
that unless Russia's financial crisis is resolved, its economic
troubles ``could spread to Central Europe,'' placing two major
regions _ Asia and Europe _ in simultaneous downturns.
</P>
<P>
   In his first statement since President Clinton said on Sunday
that the United States would support an international bailout of
Russia, Rubin chose his comments carefully to avoid worsening the
flight from Russian and Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be fair to say that the situation facing the
world today with respect to financial stability is unprecedented,''
Rubin told a group of executives on a presidential export council.
``Russia's a difficult situation. We have an obvious national
security interest. There is also the risk, once again, of contagion
that could spread to Central Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has a clear political agenda: He has been trying for
months to convince a skeptical Congress to increase Washington's
contributions to the International Monetary Fund by $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He has met enormous resistance, with conservatives saying the
fund interferes in free markets and liberals contending that it is
saving wealthy investors by imposing austerity programs that make
ordinary workers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, argue that Russia's
latest crisis underscores the urgency of adding to the fund's war
chest. U.S. officials have said that if an aid package is put
together for Russia, it would have to come from the IMF and the
World Bank, not directly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rubin's warning on Tuesday seems in stark
contrast to his recent predictions that another major outbreak of
trouble was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago Rubin told the Foreign Policy Association in New
York, ``The probability of the crisis worsening or spreading, or of
a major new crisis developing, is low.'' He said essentially the
same thing to Congress several weeks earlier, though some top aides
winced at the time and declined to make the same prediction
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in a brief telephone conversation, Rubin said his
earlier statements referred to ``a systemic crisis that could have
a material impact on our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments Tuesday, he reiterated his belief that
while the U.S. trade deficit would rise ``substantially'' this
year, the overall impact on the economy ``has been relatively
minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a world right now where the only healthy economy,
growing on a sustained basis, is the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern, however, is that if economic
contagion spreads beyond Asia, it will become harder and harder to
insulate the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the heart of that issue _ and of Rubin's comments on Tuesday
_ is the question of how economic troubles in one part of the world
worsen troubles elsewhere, a little-studied subject that has
suddenly become a top challenge in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some links are clear-cut. Southeast Asia's troubles, which began
last summer, are being reignited by Japan's worsening recession,
and in particular by the steady fall of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a major purchaser of Asian goods, so its downturn is an
enormous weight on the region. The yen's fall only aggravates the
problem, because it puts competitive pressure on other nations to
let their currencies fall so the goods they make retain a price
advantage over Japanese goods in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question,'' one senior administration official
said recently, ``that if Japan turned around, the picture would
look very different throughout Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   More tenuous is the connection between Asia's troubles and
Russia's. Many view the link as primarily psychological: Investors
are fleeing all emerging markets, regardless of their differences.
In recent days, investors have not only fled Russia; they have
gotten out of Brazil, Turkey and other, smaller markets. Each
country has its own problems, but they are worsened whenever
investors get skittish and flee to the relative safety of the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia's case, the alarm bells are ringing in Washington, but
not with enormous urgency. Deputy finance ministers from the
world's largest industrial countries meet in Paris next week to
discuss their next moves. Officials say it will probably take
several weeks to put together a package of loans or emergency
credits through the IMF, the World Bank and other international
institutions. And the aid they are considering _ about $10 billion
_ is about a quarter of what was promised to Indonesia, and a fifth
of what was promised to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan for now. In both South Korea and
Indonesia, the size of the problem increased dramatically while the
fund and its member states negotiated over what to do. The same
could easily happen with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking weeks, you are talking the vast
unknown,'' one senior official in an international institution
dealing with Russia said on Tuesday. ``Several weeks is a very,
very long time in the markets.''

   DRUGS-FUTURE (Seattle) In the near future, pharmaceutical drugs
as we know them will be changed forever by the merging of two
exploding scientific fields -- genomics, or the study of the human
genetic blueprint, and information sciences. Drugs will be safer,
and more tailored to treat specific diseases with fewer side
effects, scientists said yesterday at an international meeting of
technology experts in Seattle. In addition, patients will be able
to tell before they take a drug if it will work for them, given
their particular genetic makeup. Such advances are being made
possible by applying the vastly increasing computational power of
computers to unraveling the mysteries of how genes interact in the
human body.

REPORTS FINDS BASIC FLAWS IN U.S. INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. intelligence ``needs to be scrubbed'' from the
top down, from its spies to its analysts to its bureaucratic
barons, according to a classified report into the intelligence
agencies' inability to foresee India's May 11 nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle revealed chronic failures of imagination and
personnel, flaws in information-gathering and analysis, and faulty
leadership and training, said the report's author, retired Adm.
David Jeremiah, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   His investigation, requested by the Central Intelligence
Director George Tenet provided a core sample of the structural
weaknesses in U.S. intelligence that go far beyond the question of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah said these included some sobering realities about the
CIA and its sister services:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA had no spies worthy of the name in India.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its ability to pry information out of people is weak
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nation's spy satellites typically produce far too much
information for overworked and undertrained intelligence analysts
to handle.
</P>
<P>
   _ In India, satellites and analysts alike failed to focus on the
nuclear test site, despite clear clues that a nuclear test was
coming. Senior intelligence officials discounted those clues and
did not order their underlings to examine them.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. policy-makers and intelligence officials had an
``underlying mind-set'' that India would not test its nuclear
weapons, he said. That fixed idea was unaffected by the fact that
India's newly elected Hindu nationalist leaders openly and
repeatedly vowed to deploy the bomb. The United States never
understood that they were driven by ``national pride and psyche''
to go nuclear, Jeremiah said. As a result, he said, its $27
billion-a-year intelligence eyes and ears were blind and deaf to
the test, which ignited nuclear tensions and an arms race between
India and its regional rival, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah, a former commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific,
described a kind of intellectual laziness at the intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fall into a pattern; you start to expect things to
happen,'' he said. ``You need to have a contrarian view.'' The
CIA's managers were passive, he said, instead of taking command and
saying: `` `Who's in charge? Take charge. Make things happen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has talented people capable of great work, he said, but
it needs many more intelligence analysts with better training and
sharper skills. It must be ``much more aggressive in thinking about
how the other guy thought'' _ breaking out of American political,
social and cultural patterns to grasp the ways in which the rest of
the world thinks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of the criticism in Jeremiah's report is particularly new.
The House Intelligence Committee, for instance, reported last year
that the CIA and its sister services lack ``the analytic depth,
breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic
developments worldwide.'' But rarely has a report commissioned by
the CIA drawn such swift and sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Other veteran intelligence officers concur with Jeremiah's
judgments. Gordon Oehler, who retired last year as director of the
CIA's Nonproliferation Center, said the group of intelligence
analysts responsible for interpreting spy satellite photos is a far
less skilled group than it was at the end of the Cold War. The
analysts now have an average of about 18 months' experience in
their highly technical tasks, said Jeffrey Harris, a recently
retired director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency
that builds spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Oehler said the ``contrarian views'' that Jeremiah called for
are sometimes disregarded by senior officials, which discourages
fresh thinking. Clinton administration officials dislike
inconvenient facts about nuclear weapons, he said, and sometimes
disregard information that does not fit ``a preconceived view of
what the world ought to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah, whose report remains secret, said he would recommend
that the the director of Central Intelligence make changes to
improve the ways the CIA and other intelligence agencies gather
information, analyze that information, manage their employees and
train new people. Tenet, who said he discussed Jeremiah's report
with President Clinton on Tuesday, immediately accepted these
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said that, in a perfect world, the CIA would never again
miss an event that changes the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I could say that it'll never again occur,'' he said.
``But given the problems we face in the world, and given the kind
of resources and commitments we have around the world, U.S.
intelligence is stretched and we have to do the best we can.''

 &HT;    Promotor has more pressing matters than Holyfield-Akinwande
fight
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Midway through a news conference, a member of the
promotional team let out a sarcastic snore while the stand-in for
Don King delivered a string of words with unparalleled dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. The promotion for the Evander Holyfield-Henry
Akinwande heavyweight-title fight Saturday lacks so much zip,
people Tuesday actually found themselves missing Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, at least that news conference was a lot
shorter,'' Madison Square Garden executive Paul Munick, the
surrogate King, said later. ``If Don was here, he'd still be
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   King wasn't at the Garden, which is at least part of the reason
ticket sales have been slow and the pay-per-view telecast is
shaping up as another splash of red ink for Showtime. The promoter
was four miles away, sitting in a Manhattan federal courtroom, for
a re-trial on insurance fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys want him focused on the trial, not the fight
card, and they certainly don't want him in a room filled with media
members. It follows that when fight officials asked attorneys about
King's availability for the news conference, the answer was, ``No.
We want him in a controlled environment.''
</P>
<P>
   King has been reduced to mute by legal advisers recently, and it
could not come at a worse time. He is 66 years old and has been
worn down by a number of lawsuits and defections, including, but
not limited to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Tyson lost his boxing license after his infamous
ear-biting incident, stripping King of his greatest source of
income. King earned a significant percentage of Tyson's $140
million in six fights after his release from prison, and also cut
deals with the MGM and Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tyson is suing King for $100 million deals and is trying to
get out of his deal with the promoter, which has four fights
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   _ Holyfield, King's second-biggest income source, figures to
retire after two or three more fights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Welterweight champion Felix Trinidad is reported to be near
the end of his deal with King and might defect to rival Bob Arum,
who also promotes Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   _ King's partnership with British promoter Frank Warren ended in
a blur of lawsuits. When Warren left, King lost his financial ties
to rising featherweight ``Prince'' Naseem Hamed, one of boxing's
few draws.
</P>
<P>
   _ MGM ended its affiliation with King after the Holyfield-Tyson
II post-fight riot.
</P>
<P>
   And this week is not going well. Carl King, Don's son, showed up
late for Tuesday's news conference and left in a huff after
Akinwande's manager, J.C. Courreges, complained about the lack of a
private car.
</P>
<P>
   Carl King then took a shot at Munick's toastmaster abilities. He
said his father is ``frustrated he can't be here, but he can leave
the promotion in the hands of some very capable people. They're
just not up there, he said, pointing to the dais. Asked why he
didn't run the news conference, Carl King said, ``I don't know,''
then left the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Munick said, ``I don't know why he came late, and I don't know
why he's upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Munick concedes that Don King's absence hurts the show and added
that he would have thought twice about the Garden guaranteeing a
significant site fee _ reported to be more than $2.5 million _ if
he knew King's trial would last this long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have Don King here, doing what he does best,
promoting an event,'' he said. ``Say what you want about Don, with
the fraud trial and everything, but there's nobody better at what
he does. He's out there. He's pitching. By the end of the week,
he's kissing rabbis and priests and sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Munick said King might drop by the Garden on Friday, an off day
for the trial. In the mean time, there are plans today to bring
Holyfield to the Broadway set of ``Lion King,'' to Belmont on
Thursday to pose with Triple Crown candidate Real Quiet and to the
Letterman show Friday.
</P>
<P>
   King, who has survived a manslaughter conviction and other legal
entanglements, figures to be in court for another two weeks. The
end of his promotional reign has been forecast before, particularly
when Tyson was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But then millions of dollars flowed into his pocket when Tyson
re-signed, and King bellowed, ``I have risen from the media pallet
of death.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he is only comatose.

   ATLANTA _ Depending on whose figures you read, home values in
the United States were up either 5.7 percent or 9.1 percent in the
first quarter, compared with the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by Experian RES, an Anaheim, Calif.-based real
estate data collector, said values were up 9.1 percent, a peak for
the decade. However, a quarterly report issued Tuesday by Freddie
Mac said the nation's annualized rate of home-value appreciation
was 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference is how appreciation is calculated.
Experian uses sales prices of the same houses in metro areas, while
Freddie Mac tracks both sales and appraisals by region.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the 1990s, the average, year-to-year increase has
been 2.5 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Experian has Northern California cities leading the pack with
double-digit appreciation, and cities like Baltimore and Hartford,
Conn., actually losing value.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta houses appreciated at a 2.2 percent year-to-year rate,
ranking 31st among 38 cities on Experian's list.
</P>
<P>
   In the Freddie Mac report, South Atlantic states were the
leaders at 7.6 percent annualized appreciation, with the Pacific
states _ including California _ second at 6.8 percent. Data on
individual metropolitan areas were not given.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Levent, president of Metro Brokers/Better Homes and
Gardens, tends to believe the Freddie Mac figures, based on what is
going on in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen 5 percent to 6 percent increases in sales prices,
and our business stays pretty constant in the 15-county metro
area,'' said Levent, though he acknowledged that Experian's method
of tracking appreciation is valid.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Atlanta's rate look low compared with Oakland,
Calif., on the Experian report?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is a good housing market, said Nima Nattaugh, Experian's
research director, but some of its statistical oomph comes from new
houses that do not have a resale track record.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California, on the other hand, has a resale housing
market whose valuation is driven by short supply and long demand
caused by jobs in the high-technology industry. In Southern
California, where houses lost value earlier in the 1990s, ``the
growth rates are high, but the recovery we are seeing is regaining
lost ground,'' he explained.

 &HT;    Bulls try underdog tactic
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, Utah _ In pursuit of their sixth championship in
eight years, the Chicago Bulls have decided to redefine themselves
as underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's not on us,'' Chicago's Scottie Pippen said
Tuesday. ``No one's expecting us to win. Everybody's expecting the
Jazz to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls are listed as a 6-5 pick to win another NBA
championship, even though the Utah Jazz has homecourt advantage and
is a slight favorite in Game I tonight at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year (the pressure) was on us, and this year it's not,''
Pippen said. ``There's no pressure on us. It's a different feeling.
We've never (before) been in a situation where we were written
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' motivation this year is ``to prove everybody wrong,''
Pippen said. ``Everybody's predicting that the Jazz, having the
home court, will win the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah forward Karl Malone isn't buying the Bulls' message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a little bit of their Game 7 against Indiana (on
Sunday), and I heard Judd Buechler say they were underdogs,''
Malone said in a cynical tone of voice. ``Yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that, no matter what the Bulls say, Chicago's
Michael Jordan summed it for him: ``After everybody said everything
they said, Michael said, 'But we have heart.' That's all I needed
to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They find a way to win, so I don't listen to that stuff,''
Utah guard John Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have relied on home-court advantage during four of the
six championship runs. In 1993, they beat Phoenix in six games
after the Suns compiled the best record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has never played in an NBA Finals in which he did not
emerge as the series' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   So, even though the Bulls are trying to play the underdog role,
they still have many of the same players who won the 1997 title by
defeating Utah in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still consider us to be the champions,'' Jordan said. ``They
still have to take that away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordan, there are new challenges for his team.
``We've got to prove we can win on the road,'' Jordan said. ``They
beat us twice in the season, here, in our building. Their hunger
may be stronger than ours. People say maybe it's Utah's year. We
battle age, experiencing this so many times in terms of losing
focus in pressure moments. So, we look at it as though the
pressure's not really on us. . . . But we like our chances.''

 &HT;    NBA Finals Notebook
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY , Utah _ The Utah Jazz know how close they came
to beating the Bulls in the Finals a year go, losing the first game
84-82 at the end when Karl Malone threw up bricks at the foul line,
losing the fifth game when Michael Jordan, weakened by an attack of
food poisoning, scored 38 points, including the game winner in a
90-88 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there. The door was open,'' Chris Morris said Monday,
``but we closed the door in our own faces.''
</P>
<P>
   One to grow on means a lot, Malone said. ``In life you rarely
have an opportunity to correct something. The chance never comes
back or maybe it's two, three, four years down the road. But to
have an opportunity the next year to correct something you didn't
finish last time, I'm excited. It's not supposed to work out like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dennis Rodman was a fraud in last season's Finals, insulting
the Mormon religion, spending off days in Las Vegas during the week
the Bulls resided at a Park City ski resort and commuted 45 minutes
into town for games and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan says he only hopes Rodman will temper his love of the
good life this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure Dennis is thinking about how he didn't perform
as he wanted to last year (2.7 ppg., 7.7 rebounds, 5 of 20
shooting). Hopefully, that's motivation within itself. Vegas being
so close, I don't think he can really control his appetite. I just
want to make sure his appetite doesn't impede our objectives in
winning a title. I can't tell Dennis not to be Dennis, but all we
can ask Dennis is to be Dennis on the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bulls are not staying in Park City this time around, but
in a local hotel where Jordan says he will spend most of
non-basketball time, living off room service. ``I won't eat pizza,
though.'' It was pizza that allegedly made him ill last June.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once again Monday, Jordan distanced himself from coach Phil
Jackson's future with the Bulls. Nor will winning or losing in this
series influence his decision. ``If my hunger and my excitement for
the game continues at the end of the season, win, lose or draw,
I'll continue to play,'' he said. ``You can't win every time at the
end of the season. You lose a game, does that stick with me? Does
that drive me crazy? No. I can deal with that. That's part of the
game. I just don't want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The way to beat Chicago entails more than simply stopping
Jordan, Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. ``The big thing is stay
between him and the basket and that's a more difficult assignment
than it sounds. You have 50 percent chance he's gonna miss it.
Don't increase that by fouls, second shots. Those things are the
big difference. You become so concerned with everything going on
that you fail to rebound, block out, and then you turn over the
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your concentration can't be to the point where you only try to
stop Michael Jordan. You also have to defend the four other guys
and that's fundamental basketball. He's gonna score 40, 50.
Everybody knows that.''

HERMOSILLO DEAL MAKES SENSE FOR MLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Hermosillo's allocation last week to the Los Angeles
Galaxy makes sense on so many levels that it's difficult to
envision the griping that has accompanied the move as anything more
than sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   That would be in error, of course: How are supporters, or
executives, or even players of the Dallas Burn, the Tampa Bay
Mutiny or the San Jose Clash supposed to react when the most
talented team in Major League Soccer pulls off such a coup? The
rich get richer, and the poor wail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to June 27 when Carlos Hermosillo plays
here in Spartan Stadium,'' San Jose Clash president Peter
Bridgwater said when the news got out. ``I want to kick his ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgwater, a fiery Englishman, has good reasons for that. He
pursued Hermosillo for more than a year, and the Mexican striker
nearly signed a deal last fall that would have sent him to the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   That fell through, and MLS officials had no hope of luring the
33-year-old star north of the border until a deal that would have
sent him to Guadalajara broke down during last week's Mexican
League ``draft'' in Acapulco. That left an opening that Deputy
Commissioner Sunil Gulati quickly filled, engineering a complicated
agreement among MLS, Hermosillo, the Mexican player's former club
(Cruz Azul) and Necaxa, for whom he will play once the Galaxy's
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   That he ended up in Los Angeles was the work of his wife, who
insisted that if the Hermosillo family was heading to America, it
would make its home in Southern California, where some of her
family resides.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else seemed to fit, too: The Galaxy was owed an
allocation from the Jorge Campos trade in January; it needed a
Mexican to boost sagging attendance; and it had been pursuing
Mexican strikers since before the season kicked off two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dallas Burn remains a team without stars, Tampa
Bay a team without wins, and San Jose has to endure the loss of
Hermosillo to its chief rival, the announcement of which upstaged
its signing of Mexican veteran Francisco Uribe, also last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those sides
</P>
<P>
   teams are league-owned, and they have too often been overlooked
as teams with big-moneyed ``investor-operators'' reap the lion's
share of talent. Dallas has built one of the best teams in MLS with
little help from the league; Tampa Bay is still reeling from the
league's decision to move star playmaker Carlos Valderrama to
Miami; and the Clash learned long ago it must take a back seat to
its southern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The whole affair raises questions about MLS's single-entity
structure, designed in part to create parity or at least a level
playing field among the 12 teams. Is it fair that a team as strong
as the Galaxy, which was 10-1 when Hermosillo agreed to the deal,
is given one of the most significant allocations in league history?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy a question to answer as it may appear. MLS
officials understand their teams in Los Angeles and New York must
be successful, on the field and at the gate. The Galaxy's on-field
record has not led to increased attention at the Rose Bowl they
averaged 17,057 in the four home games sandwiched between the
opener and Hermosillo's signing and what was missing, General
Manager Danny Villanueva says, were Mexican fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've definitely seen, especially through the Mexican (League)
playoffs, a turning of attention in Los Angeles,'' Villanueva
noted. ``The Latin crowd (at the Rose Bowl) is largely Central
American. ... I don't think there's a player able to attract
Southern California soccer fans the way Carlos Hermosillo can. We
expect a jump (in attendance).''
</P>
<P>
   How much, he won't say, but 33 percent sounds fair. The Galaxy
should, once Hermosillo arrives, get crowds in the 28,000-30,000
range, maybe more. Hermosillo is the third-leading active
goalscorer in world soccer, with 275 goals in 457 games. That he
was overlooked for Mexico's World Cup team has been heavily
criticized on both sides of the border, making him somewhat of a
martyr. That will compute here in ways it couldn't elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Is that favoritism for the Galaxy or smart business?
</P>
<P>
   The rich do get richer, but whose fault is that? The Galaxy
traded away two of its biggest stars Campos and Eduardo Hurtado and
still won. Of what's left of L.A.'s stars, only Cobi Jones and
Mauricio Cienfuegos likely were coveted by many other teams, and
while they are enjoying their best MLS seasons, so are several
others: Brazilian speedster Welton, the league scoring leader;
Clint Mathis, the clear rookie of the year choice
</P>
<P>
   Martin Machon, who quietly does as he pleases on the left flank;
and Ezra Hendrickson, who has emerged as a solid attacking
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Jones, Cienfuegos and maybe Welton, these are role
players; why should the Galaxy be penalized because they're all
doing well?
</P>
<P>
   There's another view on all this, one that sounds reasonable
even if it a bit far-fetched. MLS wants a strong Galaxy because it
wants the Galaxy in the MLS Cup final, which will be played at the
Rose Bowl. If the Galaxy's there, they figure 100,000 show up. If
someone else, say Dallas or San Jose, represents the West, maybe
40,000 show. A full house might sway Disney, which reportedly has
backed off from its desire to bring a team to Anaheim, to invest in
the league and purchase a team. And that, you have to figure, would
help everyone involved in MLS.
</P>
<P>
   XXXXX
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hermosillo is headed for L.A., what happens with German
star Juergen Klinsmann, who appeared likely to be Rose Bowl-bound
when the World Cup ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has no foreign slot open, and Hermosillo's contract
no terms announced, but he's got to be making the $236,000 max
slices heavily into L.A.'s salary-cap space. And why would the
Galaxy need another
</P>
<P>
   aging forward?
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, MLS will try to sway Klinsmann if he decides to come
to MLS to Chicago, where he'd be embraced by Chicagoland's German
community. But Klinsmann owns property in Orange County, and his
wife is from San Diego; what if he tells the league that he'll play
only if he can stay in Southern California?
</P>
<P>
   In that event, the Galaxy would have to jettison one of ther
foreigners, Cienfuegos, Machon, Hermosillo, Welton or Wellington
Sanchez. Sanchez, who hasn't made an impact yet, seems the
likeliest, but if he turns out to be the player he's been rumored
to be, that decision won't be so simple.
</P>
<P>
   Cien is L.A.'s most popular player, a Salvadoran legend whose
influence on the Galaxy is incalculable. Machon, a Guatemalan,
would be tough to replace on the field and at the gate. Hermosillo
stands to be the Galaxy's biggest attraction. And Welton has become
one of MLS's premier forwards, and he's only 23.

   PHOENIX - So what's all this fuss about hitting 100?
</P>
<P>
   For days, experts have been predicting the triple-digit event,
but until Tuesday the century mark had been an elusive no-show for
Phoenix. The temperature finally hit 100 at 2:34 p.m. _ and peaked
at 101 three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Atta Reynolds and Paul M. Pair are concerned,
hitting 100 was a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds turned 100 more than a year ago and Pair reached the
century mark in March. And together they awaited the 100-degree
breakthrough together Tuesday, as th ey licked ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to turning 100 (years old) and it didn't make
any difference to me,'' said Reynolds, sporting a knitted sweater
vest. ``So what? I'm a 100!''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't care about the rising temperature, ei ther.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix was a little more excited about hitting the century
mark. Rarely had it taken so long to accomplish that feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was this the 8th coolest spring since we've been
keeping records for the last 102 years, but the re have only been
11 other times when it's been this late to reach 100,'' said Craig
Ellis, meteorologist for the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   On an average, the temperature reaches 100 on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who turned 100 more than a year
</P>
<P>
   ago, said she refuses to fret over age or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the buildings are refrigerated, all the homes are
refrigerated and so are all the cars,'' said the Phoenix resident,
who arrived here in 1936 and whose son is a meteorologist in
Colorado . ``You shouldn't worry about the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living at Beatitudes Campus of Care, Reynolds remembers a
time when the Valley wasn't quite so cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to sleep out in the yard, it was so hot. But I
never worried about it,''
</P>
<P>
   she said. ``I loved to work out in the yard all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the prospect of a long, hot summer trouble Pair, who
has lived in Phoenix since 1977, and also resides at Beatitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat doesn't bother me and the older I get th e less it
bothers me,'' Pair said. ``I don't understand it. I can't explain
it, but I'm just real happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Hamilton, medical director for Beatitudes may have an
explanation. As the body ages, the mechanisms that keep it in
</P>
<P>
   balance aren't as finely tuned as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although your body doesn't tolerate extreme heat that well,
the heat doesn't bother you that much because you don't feel it
like you used to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherwise, Ellis is hap py to predict cooler days ahead, at
least for the next few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have another 100-degree day,'' he said, ``until at
least into next week at the earliest.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting off the weather hook.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Craig sai d, the Valley can expect approximately 90
days of 100-degree temperatures or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that's the average,'' he said. ``But nobody knows how
many we'll have this year for sure.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. agreed Tuesday to pay $400
million to Orange County, Calif., to settle claims that the leading
Wall Street brokerage firm helped push the affluent county into
bankruptcy four years ago with reckless investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will largely close the book on the largest
municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history, which shook the
foundations of the municipal bond market, a basic way that towns
and cities across the country finance services such public schools
and roads.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement by Merrill is one of the largest for any
securities-related litigation and is by far the largest stemming
from the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy, which set off a storm of
litigation as the county sought to recover some of the more than
$1.6 billion it suffered in losses from risky investments.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, which has consistently maintained it did nothing wrong,
said it decided to settle because the costs and distraction of the
litigation did not justify the battle. But the magnitude of the
settlement was still considered surprisingly huge and goes a long
way to restoring much of what Orange County lost.
</P>
<P>
   The county still has lawsuits pending against more than a dozen
Wall Street securities houses and a variety of other companies. But
Merrill Lynch was clearly the county's main target, since it was
much more heavily involved than other companies in selling risky
securities to the county-run investment pool.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Merrill Lynch has settled, attorneys predicted, others
will follow suit. ''We're very pleased with the result,'' said
Bruce Bennett, a Los Angeles attorney who has represented Orange
County. ``We think it represents a very substantial recovery for
Orange County.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with Merrill Lynch brings the county's total
recovery from legal settlements to more than $621 million. Analysts
and other attorneys said that based on Tuesday's settlement with
Merrill Lynch, they expect the county could end up recovering
nearly $1 billion overall out of a total of more than $1.6 billion
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not a disaster for the county, an affluent area
south of Los Angeles, which has a thriving technology industry,
tourist attractions including Disneyland and an unemployment rate
below 3 percent. A boom in California's economy has largely
restored the social services that were cut immediately after the
bankruptcy. Municipal officials said the money recovered will
probably go mainly toward restoring capital spending plans that had
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more part of Orange County's history than its
future,'' said James Doti, president of Chapman University, which
is in the county. ``The economy of Orange County is doing great.
But this cloud of bankruptcy has been hanging over our head. This
is the last page of an ugly story.''
</P>
<P>
   The losses were suffered by 200 school districts, municipalities
and other public agencies that invested in the pool that was run by
Robert Citron, Orange County's treasurer at the time, who was
released last October after serving two thirds of a one-year term
in jail. His deputy, Matthew Raabe, was sentenced to three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Because the money recovered from litigation goes preferentially
to schools and then the other public agencies and municipalities,
school districts have already recovered 98 percent of their losses,
said Paul Brady, city manager of Irvine and chairman of the Orange
County Investment Pool Committee. Municipalities and other agencies
will be able to recover more than 90 percent of their losses after
getting the proceeds from the settlement with Merrill, But the
county itself is only now starting to share in the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, one of the largest firms on Wall Street, has
argued that it had not done anything wrong and that the risky
investments that went sour were the decisions of Citron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that we acted properly and professionally in
our relationship with Orange County,'' Merrill Lynch said in a
statement issued Tuesday. ``However, after weighing the substantial
costs and distraction of continuing to litigate, we determined that
it would be in the best interests of Merrill Lynch and all our
constituents to definitively bring this matter to a close and end
the uncertainty inherent in any judicial proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch said it already had set aside money for the
settlement, which would not affect its earnings for the second
quarter, which ends this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying $400 million to Orange County, Merrill
Lynch agreed to pay an additional $17.1 million to the Irvine Ranch
Water District, which also had sued Merrill Lynch over the
bankruptcy. Last year the company paid $30 million in a settlement
with the county district attorney to assure that the county would
not bring criminal charges against it. It also agreed last year to
pay $1.9 million to settle a class action suit brought by holders
of Orange County bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill Lynch is still not completely free of the legal
consequences of Orange County's bankruptcy. The Securities and
Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company violated
securities laws in another role it performed for Orange County _
underwriting bond offerings. The SEC is looking at whether Merrill
adequately informed bond buyers of the risks involved. The
Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday declined to comment but
some attorneys involved in the bankruptcy predict Merrill and the
federal agency might also now move toward a settlement.

TV SPORTS: RACE TO BUY THE BROWNS HAS NEW YORK FLAVOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (ja)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard Milstein, the real estate developer, and Chuck
Dolan, the cable television magnate, have three things in common:
lots of money, businesses that are located in the New York
metropolitan area and a desire to own the soon-to-be-revived
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The race to buy the expansion Browns is accelerating, with
Milstein's and Dolan's groups among six to have applied to the
National Football League. No price has been set _ estimates range
from $400 million to the moon _ but it will most likely be the
costliest sports franchise ever for several reasons: a lucrative
lease at a new stadium where the team will start play in 1999;
immediate access to $70 million a year from new TV deals, and a
rabid fan base that seems certain to support the new Browns as it
did the old ones before Art Modell shipped them to Baltimore in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here because this is a fundamentally great
investment,'' Dolan, the chairman of Woodbury, N.Y.-based
Cablevision Systems, said Tuesday from Cleveland, his hometown.
``We love Cleveland and we want to own the Browns.''
</P>
<P>
   Milstein, who is a co-owner of the New York Islanders, said
Monday from Cleveland: ``This will be a very good business. We
expect to realize significant value from the team as a business.
You have to look at the whole issues of winning football and
restoring tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' move to Baltimore, where they were renamed the
Ravens, was the most wrenching team shift since the Dodgers moved
to Los Angeles. As part of the NFL's approval of the move, the
Browns' name, colors, and logos remained in trust for the new
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of the Browns as the team for the next century,''
Milstein said. ``We're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other potential applicants, the Dolan and Milstein
groups paid $150,000 to enter the process, and are being
investigated by the NFL for their financial worthiness before they
receive economic data upon which to base their bids. An owner is
expected to be chosen in September.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein was persuaded to join the bidding five weeks ago by
Calvin Hill, the former Browns and Dallas Cowboy running back, and
Paul Warfield, the Hall of Fame receiver for the Browns and Miami
Dolphins. Robert Lewis, a lawyer for Milstein, is also part of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the job is to re-establish a winning reputation _ one that
goes back in Cleveland to the 1940s _ we can do it,'' said Hill, a
consultant to the Cowboys. ``We know both sides of the ball. We had
wonderful careers as players, but since I retired, I've been a
consultant and administrator.'' Warfield is in private business.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan returned to his hometown on Tuesday, with his brother
Lawrence, a lawyer in suburban Cleveland, to announce that the
entertainer Bill Cosby had taken a 5 percent stake in their
ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby was not an investor in the Dolans' group when they
declared their interest several weeks ago. Cosby said he was not
added as a token, to be a prominent symbol for a league without
black ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it,'' Cosby added, but he said that the
potential size of his investment, $25 million if the team costs
$500 million, placed him in a different category.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Dolan said, ``I don't see the appropriateness of
tokenism when we're discussing Bill Cosby.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he did not want to speculate about whether the Dolans
added Cosby because they felt their group needed a prominent
African-American. But, he said: ``The fact that Paul and I are
black and Howard and Robert are white is wonderful. We're not just
people who fit categories. It was about getting the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chuck Dolan, the Browns would be a personal investment,
separate from Cablevision's acquisition of Madison Square Garden,
which owns the Knicks and the Rangers. He would provide the bulk of
the money to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure anyone who is seeking wealth to get a good
education and have a brother like I have,'' Lawrence Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolans and the Milstein group appear sanguine that the
league will not price the team into the stratosphere; Malcolm
Glazer, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' owner, reportedly said the price
should be $1.5 billion. In the NFL's last expansion, Carolina and
Jacksonville paid $140-million entry fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to bid the value,'' Lawrence Dolan said. ``But
it's important the winning bid not necessarily be the biggest
bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Milstein echoed the sentiment. ``If all they want is maximum
dollars,'' he said, ``maybe it's not a good business deal.''

CLINTON CALLS CENSUS `AMERICAN ISSUE' IN BACKING NEW COUNTING
METHOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton, meeting Tuesday with Houstonians
affected by low census tallies, embraced a new counting method
vigorously opposed by Republicans and set the stage for a critical
showdown with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured the Womens, Infant and Childrens Program, which
receives federal funds based on the decennial census. At the
Magnolia Multi-Service Center near downtown, he also heard from
minority leaders and academics who urged a more accurate census for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The president, making his third trip to Houston this year, also
helped Texas Democrats raise $800,000 at a $5,000-per-plate
luncheon at the posh River Oaks home of attorney Richard Mithoff.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid an unscheduled visit to former U.S. Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, who recently suffered a mild stroke. Clinton stayed at the
Texan's townhome for about an hour. Bentsen served as Clinton's
first treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton flew to Dallas where he raised $1 million for the
national Democratic Party before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hispanic enclave of Magnolia Park, Clinton sought to put
a human face on the census problems, which have enormous political
and financial ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the count is, wherever the people are, this is not a
political issue, this is an American issue,'' Clinton told the
eight panel members and 150 other officials in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The census issue has raged in Congress for more than a year.
Clinton offered his support for a Census Bureau plan, developed by
the National Academy of Sciences, to use statistical sampling to
estimate the 10 percent of the population that enumerators are
unable to contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has got an ax to grind for any method; we should all
want the most accurate method. And when it's all said and done, all
we should want is to have everyone of us properly, accurately,
fairly and constitutionally counted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Republican Conference retorted: ``Sampling corrupts a basic
sense of fairness by treating people as numbers that can be
estimated rather than individuals who have a right to be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has estimated that it failed to count 8
million people in the 1990 census, most of them children and
minorities, and double-counted more than 4 million for its most
inaccurate count ever.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Houston had the largest undercount of any urban
city as the census missed 66,748 people, again most of them
children and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means some of our most vulnerable populations routinely
are omitted when it comes time to provide federal funds for
critical services. An inaccurate census distorts our understanding
of the needs of our people, and in many respects, therefore, it
diminishes the quality of life not only for them, but for all the
rest of us as well,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed a crowd that included members of Congress and
Houston Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president couldn't have picked a better place to pinpoint
the inaccuracies with the 1990 census,'' said Rep. Gene Green,
D-Texas. ``It's estimated that Texas lost about $1 billion in
federal funds because of the inaccuracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary desVignes-Kendrick, director of the City of Houston
Health Department, said accurate census data ``is critical to
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted census data on child poverty rates helps determine
nutrition programs and child health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Moreno, chairman of the Association for the Advancement
of Mexican-Americans, said the census must accurately chart the
growth of Hispanics in the United States. ``Over the next 50 years,
Hispanics and Asians will provide almost half of the country's
population growth. Those statistics are going to be very
critical,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Joe, owner of Great Wall Enterprises, a marketing firm
aimed at the Asian community, called the census ``the bible for
corporations looking to plan their business allocations for
marketing and advertising.'' An inaccurate count means she has
trouble selling corporations on the idea of Asian outreach because
Asians are undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained the issue will be difficult to explain to the
American people. Chiding Republicans, Clinton said it was ``quite
unfortunate that some in Congress have so vociferously opposed
sampling, because improving the census shouldn't be a partisan
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans accuse Clinton and the Democrats of
pressing the statistical sampling method as a way to gain more
seats in Congress and state legislatures across the nation.
Electoral office districts are based on census figures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear they could lose 24 seats in Congress, which
would cost them control of the House, and more than 400 seats in
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't get it. He continues to advocate the use
of an unproven methodology that didn't work during the 1990 census
and won't work in the 2000 census. We've heard enough of his
`political' science. Where is the `empirical' science,'' said Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have filed suit to block the Census Bureau's
sampling method, and the case will be heard in late summer.
Legislation also has put the case on the fast track for a Supreme
Court hearing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mallett, deputy secretary of commerce and a Houston
native, said that despite the lawsuit the Census Bureau is bracing
for a fight in Congress before the issue is finally settled. He
said the bureau must have the dispute resolved by February in order
to perform the census.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid an unscheduled home visit to former Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen who recently suffered a mild stroke. Clinton stayed
at Bentsen's townhome for about an hour. Bentsen served as
Clinton's first treasury secretary. &QL;

FINDING MONTEVERDI IN THE NOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Arianna,'' which will be given its first American performance
Sunday by the Opera Theater of St. Louis, is not exactly a new work
and not exactly an old one. Quite who wrote it is also in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the title page of the score, it is a ``lost opera
by Claudio Monteverdi ... composed again by Alexander Goehr,'' the
English composer who, now 65, has steadily been gaining a
reputation for music at once serious and playful, beautiful and
quirky, as this is.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the story goes back to 1608, when Monteverdi wrote
``Arianna'' for a wedding at the court of the Gonzagas in Mantua.
The subject was, as usual in early opera, a classical myth. Theseus
and Ariadne have left Crete, after she, for love of him, turned
from her family and helped him defeat the Minotaur.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is Athens, where Theseus is king, but they
have stopped on the island of Naxos. Theseus is persuaded that the
Athenians will not accept Ariadne, who comes of enemy stock, so he
sails away alone, under the protection of night. When Ariadne wakes
to find him gone, she is distraught. Then, out of the blue, a new
consort arrives in the shape of the god Bacchus, who takes her up
to join him in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arianna'' was much appreciated in its time, especially for its
lament, which Monteverdi published as a solo piece and a madrigal.
In those early days of Baroque emotionalism, the lamenting heroine
was already an established type: composers had quickly learned how
music could, by slow stepwise falls, by sudden lifts of the voice
and by obsessive repetition, model hopelessness, shrieks of anguish
and the monomania of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody did all this better than Monteverdi, but though he
revised the opera for later productions, the rest of its score
somehow got abandoned, like Ariadne, as time moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Goehr, as Bacchus. In 1994 he decided to set the libretto
by Ottavio Rinuccini a second time. The libretto is a remarkable
piece of work, Renaissance in sentiment but true to the ancient
Greek stage in its use of chorus and messengers to narrate much of
the action.
</P>
<P>
   The task was not to embed the surviving lament in pastiche: that
would have been to create a fake opera, not a lost one, and for
Goehr it was a preliminary stage. Having set the Rinuccini text,
slightly cut, in Monteverdian style, as a sequence of melodious
dialogues, madrigalian choruses and instrumental sinfonias, he went
on to vary, elaborate and play with what he had fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, with what Monteverdi had fashioned in
1608, since the authentic lament is also transformed, and also
honored, by Goehr's attentions: the melody ranges more widely
(magically so, after the familiar opening phrases), the harmony is
enriched, and the accompaniment is laid out, as throughout the
opera, for an ensemble of 17th-century scale but 20th-century
countenance, featuring flutes and saxophones, high string trio,
percussion, harp and electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Goehr was well equipped to take on the challenge of imagining
Monteverdi _ indeed, of imagining himself as Monteverdi. For one
thing, he is a composer with a profound sense of being heir to the
Western musical tradition, and thus of housing, inside his own
creative personality, the ghosts of the greats.
</P>
<P>
   He is an artist with the rare selflessness that could allow his
internal Monteverdi, in this case, to pretty much take over. He
also has the technical adroitness, taste and intelligence necessary
to give that internal Monteverdi the tools, together with enough
charm and lightness of touch to make the cooperation a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Besides all that, Monteverdi had a special place in making Goehr
a composer. His father, Walter Goehr, was a conductor and a member
of Schoenberg's circle: hence, in part, the junior Goehr's
reverence for the central tradition, often to the extent of
emulating its characteristic forms, textures and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Goehr was also a leader in the mid-20th-century
Monteverdi revival, and in Monteverdi his composer son found an
alternative to the harmonic richness and inwardness of Schoenberg.
Monteverdi held out an ideal of music as pure melody and
spontaneity, and Goehr as a young man was captivated.
</P>
<P>
   He was not prepared, though, to ditch the artistic morality that
Schoenberg had defended, and his works of the last 40 years can be
seen as a sequence of sites in which the battle between Central
European Romantic or modern weight and Italian Baroque lightness is
fought again and again, occasionally with intensity but more often
with exuberant good humor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So it is in ``Arianna.'' Sometimes, whether in the lament or in
what surrounds it, the musical language of 1608 sounds through
freshly; more often it is patinated or observed through layers of
pearl. Harmony and texture haze the image, and there are passing
references to what has been happening in the interim between
Monteverdi's Baroque dormition and his modern awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Goehr invites us to hear a little of Debussy's Melisande in
Arianna, and there are teasing touches of Puccini occasionally at
the ends of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to know is whether the echoes of Richard Strauss'
``Ariadne auf Naxos'' come from the composer or from us, as we
watch similar events, especially the arrival of Bacchus, unfold in
music. After all, the question of the author's authority is being
posed gently and gracefully throughout this entertainment, by an
author _ Monteverdi _ whose death could hardly be more certain (for
we can visit his grave in the Venetian church of I Frari) or now
more unsettlingly insecure.
</P>
<P>
   However this music arrived, it is riddled with Monteverdianisms:
in the vocal decoration, in the dancing character and brightness of
the sinfonias, in the keen expressiveness and tonal lucidity of the
melody, in the repeated notes to finish clauses, in the brushing of
the accompaniment into and under the vocal line.
</P>
<P>
   (For those who cannot hear the opera in St. Louis during the
next couple of weeks, there is a newly released recording of it on
NMC, distributed by Allegro, of Portland, Ore. The singing is
variable, but the wonderful countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, as
Bacchus, is spellbinding in the final song.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the harmony and the instrumentation are almost
constantly telling us that this is not Monteverdi at all, and thus
reinforcing our knowledge of the case (if we can hold on to that
amid all the pleasure and opalescence). The Monteverdi we hear is
an absent Monteverdi. This is still a lost opera.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the view of the central character that was tolerable
in 1608, and even unsurprising, is so no longer. That Ariadne
should be ``rescued'' by a male figure she has never met is not, in
Goehr's treatment, a happy ending. Her lament, as he adapts it, is
a great journey of self-learning. This is where she rescues
herself.
</P>
<P>
   By the end her persona is one of dignity raised to a point where
it becomes challenging, and her final words (``Rejoice in my
rejoicing'') are set in a way that indicates she accepts Bacchus as
she accepts the inevitable: with dismay, with foreboding and with
the heightened awareness her self-knowledge has brought.
</P>
<P>
   Another key moment in Goehr's setting comes when a messenger
tells of Ariadne's hopeless striding into the ocean after the
departing Theseus. Nothing in this marvelous passage was written by
Monteverdi, yet what drives through it is everything we have always
thought Monteverdi to be about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arianna'' is a triumph of musical resuscitation, and because
it presents us with Monteverdi composed now _ with a Monteverdi who
can write for electronic sampler, and who knows about Schoenberg,
Debussy and Puccini _ we rejoin the audience of 1608, confronting
something that did not exist before and that is therefore
uncategorized and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the ``Arianna'' that was performed at the Gonzaga
court, but it might be how it felt.

MONICA LEWINSKY PICKS TWO WASHINGTON LAWYERS TO REPLACE GINSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(th) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four months of embroilment in the criminal
investigation of President Clinton's sex life, Monica Lewinsky
replaced William Ginsburg as her lawyer Tuesday and her new team of
Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris immediately set a different tone by
standing mute before the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers, both seasoned spotlight performers of the
Washington bar, played the taciturn antidote to Ginsburg, the
California malpractice lawyer who became famous, then
controversial, for his loquacious musings on his representation of
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the heart of the
investigation of the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Stein and Cacheris posed for curbside pictures with
Ms. Lewinsky at their side in a smiling, unrevealing tableau. The
group set off a minor media riot five blocks from the White House
but offered no hint of any new strategems.
</P>
<P>
   To the one shouted question that was finally acknowledged _
``What are you going to do that Mr. Ginsburg didn't?'' _ Cacheris
warily replied, ``I don't want to get into that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailed at first as a candid newcomer from California, Ginsburg
eventually came to be widely criticized for his representation of
Ms. Lewinsky, particularly for lacking Washington court experience
and for failing to secure an early plea-bargaining agreement with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently criminal defense specialists faulted him for his
blistering open letter to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
in which Ginsburg declared: ``As a result of your callous disregard
for cherished constitutional rights, you may have succeeded in
unmasking a sexual relationship between two consenting adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the pressure, Starr, in another filing with the
Supreme Court, raised the prospect Tuesday for the first time
publicly that he is preparing to send to Congress an impeachment
referral against the president in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and Stein are seasoned plea-bargainers as much as
litigators, but various colleagues in the bar cautioned against
assuming their singular focus would be on attempting to cut a deal
with prosecutors. They joined Nathaniel Speights, a Washington
trial attorney who will remain on the defense team as Ms. Lewinsky
awaits her fate at the hands of Starr, who has not yet summoned her
to the grand jury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Starr investigation set off a national sensation when it
opened in January when the prosecutor was authorized to look into
reports that Clinton had a sexual affair in the White House with
Ms. Lewinsky and then sought to have her cover it up under oath.
The president has denied the affair and allegations that he
suborned perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The task of the Lewinsky legal team has been complicated by the
fact that Ms. Lewinsky denied the affair in a sworn affidavit in
the separate Paula Jones lawsuit against the president. At the same
time, Ms. Lewinsky reportedly confirmed the affair in rambling
conversations furtively tape-recorded by a one-time friend and,
ultimately, by Starr's investigators. If so, she faces possible
indictment, depending on Starr's efforts to turn her to his
advantage as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got into the case today, basically, so we hope we have
a lot to bring to the table,'' Cacheris added in his only other
comment on the task facing the new team as Starr presses forward
with his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After the sidewalk photo opportunity that seemed well timed for
5 p.m. live news reports, the group retreated to the Cacheris,
Stein law office on Connecticut Avenue. A sidewalk crowd of evening
commuters stared open-eyed at Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Judy Smith, Ms. Lewinsky's new
spokeswoman, said Ginsburg departed by mutual agreement and with
the deep appreciation of the Lewinsky family for a ``tremendous
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Ginsburg was on CNN television, declaring, ``I was
not fired.'' New faces were needed, he said, ``if this is to be
resolved short of indictment and full litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The two new lawyers bring decades of criminal and civil law
experience to the case as well as the polish of veterans in the
Washington media cauldron of celebrated cases.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, a natty dresser widely known as ``Jake,'' was himself an
independent counsel in 1984 when he investigated charges of
financial improprieties against Edwin Meese III, President Ronald
Reagan's counselor. In the current era of long-running, multiple
independent counsels, Stein is celebrated for the speed with which
he concluded his task, in which he left Meese criticized but
unindicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris, an affable former assistant U.S. attorney in
Virginia's Eastern District, has represented such notorious clients
as Aldrich Ames, now serving a life sentence for espionage, and
John Mitchell, the attorney general for President Richard M. Nixon
convicted in the Watergate scandal. Respected as a painstaking
negotiator, he also represented Fawn Hall, a White House secretary
caught up in the Iran-Contra investigation during the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many prosecutors fear facing him in court,'' said Lawrence
Barcella, a veteran defense attorney and former federal prosecutor
who estimated the new Lewinsky team presented a formidable
combination of backroom and courtroom skills.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers are ranking members of the city's legal inner
sanctum, with cross-ties to various figures in the Starr
investigation. Cacheris is a close friend of Robert Bennett, who
defended Clinton in the Paula Jones civil suit, and he has worked
in the past with William Hundley, who represents Vernon Jordan, the
president's confidante, in Jordan's role in the Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and Stein are well tailored, with the former favoring
customized French-cuff shirts and Stein resplendent Tuesday in a
chalk-stripe suit and spectator shoes as he beamed in silent escort
of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers are gifted in dealing with the media, although they
could only nod and smile silently, in public at least, at old
friends in the sidewalk media pack.
</P>
<P>
   As his replacements came silently on stage, Ginsburg had a final
musing on his time in the Washington glare: ``It's been a very
interesting experience.''

CLINTON CALLS CENSUS `AMERICAN ISSUE' IN BACKING NEW COUNTING
METHOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to move up Bentsen item and to delete graf from bottom) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton, meeting Tuesday with Houstonians
affected by low census tallies, embraced a new counting method
vigorously opposed by Republicans and set the stage for a critical
showdown with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured the Womens, Infant and Childrens Program, which
receives federal funds based on the decennial census. At the
Magnolia Multi-Service Center near downtown, he also heard from
minority leaders and academics who urged a more accurate census for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The president, making his third trip to Houston this year, also
helped Texas Democrats raise $800,000 at a $5,000-per-plate
luncheon at the posh River Oaks home of attorney Richard Mithoff.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid an unscheduled visit to former U.S. Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, who recently suffered a mild stroke. Clinton stayed at the
Texan's townhome for about an hour. Bentsen served as Clinton's
first treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton flew to Dallas where he raised $1 million for the
national Democratic Party before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hispanic enclave of Magnolia Park, Clinton sought to put
a human face on the census problems, which have enormous political
and financial ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the count is, wherever the people are, this is not a
political issue, this is an American issue,'' Clinton told the
eight panel members and 150 other officials in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The census issue has raged in Congress for more than a year.
Clinton offered his support for a Census Bureau plan, developed by
the National Academy of Sciences, to use statistical sampling to
estimate the 10 percent of the population that enumerators are
unable to contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has got an ax to grind for any method; we should all
want the most accurate method. And when it's all said and done, all
we should want is to have everyone of us properly, accurately,
fairly and constitutionally counted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Republican Conference retorted: ``Sampling corrupts a basic
sense of fairness by treating people as numbers that can be
estimated rather than individuals who have a right to be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has estimated that it failed to count 8
million people in the 1990 census, most of them children and
minorities, and double-counted more than 4 million for its most
inaccurate count ever.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Houston had the largest undercount of any urban
city as the census missed 66,748 people, again most of them
children and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means some of our most vulnerable populations routinely
are omitted when it comes time to provide federal funds for
critical services. An inaccurate census distorts our understanding
of the needs of our people, and in many respects, therefore, it
diminishes the quality of life not only for them, but for all the
rest of us as well,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed a crowd that included members of Congress and
Houston Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president couldn't have picked a better place to pinpoint
the inaccuracies with the 1990 census,'' said Rep. Gene Green,
D-Texas. ``It's estimated that Texas lost about $1 billion in
federal funds because of the inaccuracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary desVignes-Kendrick, director of the City of Houston
Health Department, said accurate census data ``is critical to
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted census data on child poverty rates helps determine
nutrition programs and child health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Moreno, chairman of the Association for the Advancement
of Mexican-Americans, said the census must accurately chart the
growth of Hispanics in the United States. ``Over the next 50 years,
Hispanics and Asians will provide almost half of the country's
population growth. Those statistics are going to be very
critical,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Joe, owner of Great Wall Enterprises, a marketing firm
aimed at the Asian community, called the census ``the bible for
corporations looking to plan their business allocations for
marketing and advertising.'' An inaccurate count means she has
trouble selling corporations on the idea of Asian outreach because
Asians are undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained the issue will be difficult to explain to the
American people. Chiding Republicans, Clinton said it was ``quite
unfortunate that some in Congress have so vociferously opposed
sampling, because improving the census shouldn't be a partisan
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans accuse Clinton and the Democrats of
pressing the statistical sampling method as a way to gain more
seats in Congress and state legislatures across the nation.
Electoral office districts are based on census figures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear they could lose 24 seats in Congress, which
would cost them control of the House, and more than 400 seats in
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't get it. He continues to advocate the use
of an unproven methodology that didn't work during the 1990 census
and won't work in the 2000 census. We've heard enough of his
`political' science. Where is the `empirical' science,'' said Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have filed suit to block the Census Bureau's
sampling method, and the case will be heard in late summer.
Legislation also has put the case on the fast track for a Supreme
Court hearing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mallett, deputy secretary of commerce and a Houston
native, said that despite the lawsuit the Census Bureau is bracing
for a fight in Congress before the issue is finally settled. He
said the bureau must have the dispute resolved by February in order
to perform the census.

STARR RAISES POSSIBILITY OF SENDING IMPEACHMENT REFERRAL TO
CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-LEWINSKY) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, on Tuesday
raised the prospect for the first time publicly that he may send to
Congress an impeachment referral against President Clinton in the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in papers he filed with the Supreme Court
urging it to quickly resolve efforts by the Clinton administration
to block the testimony of several officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be blunt,'' Starr wrote in replying to the White House
contention, raised again on Monday, that some of the testimony
being sought by investigators is protected by the attorney-client
privilege. ``The Nation has a compelling interest that this
criminal investigation of the President of the United States
conclude as quickly as possible _ that indictments be brought,
possible reports for impeachment proceedings issued, and
non-prosecution decisions announced. This Court's immediate review
would powerfully serve that vital goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President's response,'' Starr added, ``treats this as a
matter-of-fact investigation. But the unhappy fact is that, at the
determination of the Attorney General herself, a President is under
serious criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and lawyers, following Starr's investigation of
whether the president had a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and urged her to lie about it, have speculated for months
about the possibility of an impeachment report. However, the filing
on Tuesday marked the first time that Starr has publicly signaled
that he is moving in that direction. Such a report would inform
Congress that the independent counsel had found evidence of an
impeachable offense, compelling Congress to consider whether to
exercise its authority under the Constitution to remove the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be months before such a report is completed. Starr
and his staff must first face a crucial decision about whether to
prosecute Ms. Lewinsky, a former intern at the White House, for
perjury and other charges. And they remain embroiled in a series of
legal disputes with the administration _ over the testimony of a
top White House aide, Bruce Lindsey, as well as several Secret
Service agents _ that may take months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the White House on Tuesday called Starr's brief
``an act of public relations, not a work of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr's filing today serves as a vehicle for rhetoric in
the place of legal substance,'' said the statement, which was
issued by Jim Kennedy, a special adviser to the White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who on Tuesday jettisoned her flamboyant
California lawyer, William Ginsburg, in favor of two seasoned
criminal defense lawyers from Washington, is under investigation
for perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. In the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, she and Clinton denied under
oath that they had a sexual relationship, although she is said to
have contradicted her sworn testimony in secretly recorded
conversations with a former colleague, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the new legal team by Ms. Lewinsky raised the
prospect that negotiations over a possible plea agreement or
immunity deal, which had stalled in recent months, could be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing to short-circuit the normal appeals process, Starr on
Tuesday asked the Supreme Court for the second time in two weeks to
bypass the Court of Appeals on the administration's challenge to
grand jury testimony by top aides and Secret Service officials.
Starr asked the justices to expedite the administration's appeal of
a Federal District judge's order compelling three employees of the
Secret Service to answer questions about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, two uniformed officers and the agency's chief
counsel, had declined to answer the questions citing a new kind of
privilege that the Secret Service maintains is essential to ensure
the safety of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Starr asked the Supreme Court to quickly consider
Clinton's appeal from the same judge's order compelling the
testimony of two senior presidential aides, Lindsey and Sidney
Blumenthal. On Monday, Clinton abruptly dropped the executive
privilege claim that had blocked Blumenthal's testimony, but he
continued to assert the attorney-client privilege claim to limit
the testimony of Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel and one of
the president's closest confidantes.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have urged the Supreme Court to let the
appeals process run its normal course, prompting Starr to reply on
Tuesday that it was in the national interest to quickly resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the President himself (among others) is under criminal
investigation, the grand jury, this Office, the President, the
Congress, and the Nation have a compelling interest that the matter
be resolved quickly and definitively,'' Starr told the justices.
``More months of protracted litigation are inimical to the Nation's
well-being. The facts are needed, and they are needed now.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7)  
 (af)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gasp!
</P>
<P>
   This is not a sound often heard anymore among Broadway
audiences. Gasping these days is generally reserved for the arrival
of large, eye-catching pieces of scenery, especially scenery that
moves, and such spectacle tends to be accompanied by heavily
amplified, gasp-drowning music.
</P>
<P>
   But what about that sudden, collective catching of breath that
whooshes through a hushed theater, a noise that seems as
involuntary and inevitable as that of someone who has been punched?
</P>
<P>
   There were occasions during the recent New York theater season,
which is celebrated by the presentation of Sunday night's Tony
Awards, when that sound flew out of audiences who had achieved a
rapt, respectful communion with what was happening on the stages
before them.
</P>
<P>
   The inspirations for these abrupt responses, which are surely
more gratifying to actors than even standing ovations, are wildly
varied and, taken out of context, unremarkable. A bedraggled,
middle-aged Irishwoman puts on a pair of rubber gloves, the kind
used for washing dishes. A priggish Parisian draws a childlike
sketch of a man skiing. A Brooklyn dockworker plants a kiss on the
mouth of another man.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal? Even men kissing men is not unheard of on
television. But each of these prosaic actions _ from, respectively,
the current Broadway productions of ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' ``Art'' and ``A View From the Bridge'' _ registers like
a clap of thunder.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that the emotional weather in these works started
out stormy doesn't take away from the gestures' power to shock. The
crisis at which you have vicariously arrived makes perfect,
illuminating sense.
</P>
<P>
   The plays described here all figure prominently in Sunday
night's broadcast of the 52nd annual Antoinette Perry Awards at
Radio City Music Hall from 9 to 11 p.m. on CBS. (From 8 to 9 p.m.,
PBS will broadcast some presentations at the music hall on
``Broadway '98: Launching the Tony Awards.'') ``Beauty Queen,'' by
the young Anglo-Irish dramatist Martin McDonagh, and ``Art,'' by
the Iranian-born French playwright Yasmina Reza, are nominated for
best new play; Arthur Miller's ``View From the Bridge,'' produced
by the Roundabout Theater Company, for best revival.
</P>
<P>
   None of them represents the kind of breakthrough in form or
content that ``Angels in America,'' Tony Kushner's fantasia on life
in the age of AIDS, did five years ago. And it would be overly
optimistic to see them as harbingers of an era in which the
straight play can flourish again on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this was a season that confirmed the worst as
well as the best of the current directions in theater, with a
mediocrity like the revival of ``Wait Until Dark' selling entirely
on the basis of Quentin Tarantino's presence and a musical like
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' yawning its way through a storybook
formula.
</P>
<P>
   But the vivid presence of ``Beauty Queen'' and company in the
Times Square area, and their ability to stir emotional currents far
beyond the reach of your average musical blockbuster, is
heartening, a testimony to the enduring appetite for theater at its
most elemental. They speak to the child in everyone who begs,
``Tell me a story,'' and then finds he can't sleep afterward.
</P>
<P>
   For none of these works is unconditionally the stuff of what you
would call a feel-good night at the theater. ``Beauty Queen,'' set
in a bleak provincial Ireland, and ``View,'' which takes place in a
blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood of the 1950s, are crackling
studies in self-delusion and self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Art,'' the shortest and slightest of the three, is
described by its author as being as much a tragedy as a comedy,
turning a silly quarrel among three friends over a painting into a
glimpse of fathomless isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The greater surprise is that the tone of these plays isn't out
of keeping with what has been an exceptionally busy year in the New
York theater. From the visual bedazzlement of such megamusicals as
``The Lion King'' and ``Ragtime'' to the gritty naturalism of such
Off Broadway hits as Jez Butterworth's ``Mojo'' and Mike Leigh's
``Goose-Pimples''; from the absurdist wasteland of the first-class
revival of Eugene Ionesco's ``Chairs'' to the memory-haunted
Poconos of Neil Simon's ``Proposals,'' there has been a distinct,
sober awareness of the darker threads of life: of mortality,
cruelty, injustice and existential loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   This was the season, lest you forget, in which Nazi uniforms
became a wardrobe staple. The Weimar-era sybarites of ``Cabaret,''
the 1966 musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb, re-emerged with
startling clarity, elucidated by the English director Sam Mendes,
as the victims and executioners of the Holocaust to come; while
that carefree party girl Sally Bowles, brilliantly reinterpreted by
Natasha Richardson, became an aimless woman on the edge of an
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   A heavily revised version of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
directed by James Lapine from Wendy Kesselman's adaptation of
Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett's 1955 script, brought the
Gestapo onto the stage toward the play's end and chose not to
conclude with Anne's hopeful declaration of her belief in human
goodness.
</P>
<P>
   The standard-issue revival of ``The Sound of Music,'' which
largely remained as sugary as ever, scaled up the menacing
political context, and ``Edelweiss'' was sung by the wholesome Von
Trapps before an oversized Nazi flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even the corporate show-business machines, Walt Disney and
Livent, found the serious side in their eye-popping spectacles.
Disney's second adaptation of one of its popular musical cartoon
movies, ``The Lion King,'' was far more adventurous and, for all
its festive atmosphere, more somber than its earlier ``Beauty and
the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor, an avant-garde director who specializes in folk
and ritual theatrical techniques, introduced a raw sense of death
and predation that sometimes seemed at odds with the cozy fable at
the show's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime,'' the producer Garth Drabinsky's epic adaptation of
E.L. Doctorow's novel, heard America singing in the early part of
this century, and what it heard, in the songs by Stephen Flaherty
and Lynn Ahrens, were cries of oppression, frustration and social
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The composer Paul Simon's misbegotten $11-million musical ``The
Capeman,'' the season's most flamboyant flop, turned the real-life
story of a street-gang murder into a salsa-driven rock opera of
crime, punishment, and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   All of these shows had ambition and innovation to spare. Yet
none really advanced the evolution of the organic American musical;
they registered more as novelty toys, lacking the exhilarating
humanity and the electric bond with their audiences of the
breakthrough productions that opened two years ago, ``Rent'' and
``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King'' is undeniably inspired in its use of a global
visual vocabulary, but its story, dance, music and individual
performances are all secondary. It is perhaps best viewed as a
series of breathtaking tableaux, a sort of latter-day Ziegfeld
Follies by way of National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capeman'' was never able to find the basic stagecraft simply
to tell its story or to match the spark of its revolutionary score.
``Ragtime'' suffers from a sense of having been produced by
corporate committee; it's a good-looking, liberal-minded historical
pageant with little feeling of spontaneous life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted a new Broadway musical with a human heart, you
would have had to have seen the short-lived ``Side Show.'' With a
book and lyrics by Bill Russell and a rich, compelling score by
Henry Krieger, ``Side Show'' dared to ask its audiences to identify
with a set of performing Siamese twins, stunningly portrayed by
Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner, and in the process created one of
the fuller, warmer character portraits of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream theatergoers recoiled, however, clearly feeling safer
with the icy sensationalism of the long-running ``Titanic'' across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown audiences have had no such reservations about another
portrait of an anomaly, the Off Broadway sleeper ``Hedwig and the
Angry Inch,'' in which John Cameron Mitchell, the work's author,
plays a transsexual rock star in search of a completed self.
</P>
<P>
   With an eclectic rock-pop score by Stephen Trask, ``Hedwig,''
like ``Side Show'' (and like ``Rent,'' for that matter),
demonstrates how contemporary musical idioms can revitalize a
classic genre without sacrificing its essential sentiment. Both
shows are reminders that once upon a time, people went to musicals
to (italics)feel,(end italics) not just to look at pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   They also reflect the spirit of an age in which cultural and
sexual identity is in flux. The same point of view is embodied in
two current, galvanic one-man shows: John Leguizamo's
autobiographical ``Freak'' on Broadway and Danny Hoch's ``Jails,
Hospitals and Hip Hop'' at Performance Space 122, works in which
two young master chameleons repeatedly transform themselves to show
how race is as much a matter of mind-set as skin color.
</P>
<P>
   A questing spirit was equally evident in David Mamet's eloquent,
troubling ``Old Neighborhood,'' which considered the pain and
rudderlessness of living in a world without faith. Mamet's most
deeply personal play to date, it also featured extraordinary
ensemble work from Peter Riegert, Patti LuPone, Vincent Guastaferro
and Jack Willis, none of whom, shamefully, were nominated for
Tonys. Nor was the play itself, which is easily the best new drama
by an American this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were well represented by intriguing but uneven
offerings from such stalwarts as Sam Shepard (``Eyes for
Consuela''), Tina Howe (``Pride's Crossing'') and Jon Robin Baitz
(the witty ``Mizlansky/Zilinsky, or `Schmucks' ''). But it was a
clutch of young playwrights from England and Ireland who shone
brightest, combining old-fashioned narrative verve with a bold,
atmospheric use of language.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McDonagh, represented by both the excellent
``Beauty Queen'' and a less certain production at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater of ``The Cripple of Inishmaan,'' there were
Butterworth, whose ``Mojo'' at the Atlantic Theater Company was a
high-adrenaline romp through London murder and mayhem in 1950s
Soho, and Conor McPherson, who provided a deliciously sly exercise
in Gothic storytelling, ``St. Nicholas,'' beautifully delivered by
the Scottish actor Brian Cox at Primary Stages.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence that the British are less than perfect as theater
artists, look to Peter Whelan's ``Herbal Bed'' or David Hare's
disappointing ``Judas Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall level of acting this season was, in fact,
exceptional, starting with the symbiotic quartet of Irish
performers who, under Garry Hines' direction, make ``Beauty Queen''
such a potent brew: Marie Mullen, Anna Manahan, Brian F. O'Byrne
and Tom Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The magnificent Cherry Jones shimmered through the many ages of
one woman in ``Pride's Crossing,'' while Nathan Lane drew a satiric
sketch worthy of Daumier as a sleazy Hollywood producer in
``Mizlansky/Zilinsky.'' Anthony LaPaglia and Allison Janney, under
Michael Mayer's direction, expertly conjured a fiery, tragic muse
out of the kitchen-sink ``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Russell Beale dazzled and chilled as a bland everyman of
an Iago in the Royal National Theater's excellent visiting
production of ``Othello,'' directed by Mendes, at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music; Vanessa L. Williams confirmed her sensual star
presence and high-sheen skills in the concert version of ``St.
Louis Woman,'' from the invaluable Encores series at City Center;
Ms. Richardson and Alan Cumming, as a demonic nightclub M.C.,
hauntingly located the desperate, vulnerable center of ``Cabaret'';
the stand-up comic Lea DeLaria emerged as a meteoric musical star
in the Public Theater's ``On the Town'' and the Encores production
of ``Li'l Abner,'' and Geraldine McEwan and Richard Briers breathed
endlessly entertaining life into the moribund couple of ``The
Chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   This last production, a London import directed by Simon
McBurney, showed how a seemingly quaint period piece can be
resurrected with a freshness that makes it feel newly minted. All
art, of course, is to some degree a dialogue with the past as well
as the present, and revivals and pastiche plays and musicals don't
have to be museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how the inventive Off Off Broadway deconstructions both
of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' by that fine young troupe the Drama
Dept., and of Eugene O'Neill's ``Emperor Jones,'' by the great
experimental veterans of the Wooster Group, used a medley of
century-spanning performance styles to create a shifting landscape
of perceptions of complicated works that can never again be seen
with virgin eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And in Millburn, N.J., the Paper Mill Playhouse presented a
revelatory revival of ``Follies,'' Stephen Sondheim's profoundly
ambivalent hommage from 1971 to a more innocent era of musical
theater.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Robert Johanson, with affectingly honest
performances from stars ranging from Ann Miller to Donna McKechnie,
the production (which, if heaven allows, is Broadway bound) made it
clear that this great, multi-layered musical isn't about making fun
of a theatrical heritage but about learning to live with it and to
take it into the future. It turned out, oddly enough, to be the
most modern-seeming show of the year.

ANALYSIS: MILESTONE IN ATTEMPT TO CLEAN UP MUNICIPAL FINANCE
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BC-ORANGE-COUNTY) 
(JT) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The $400 million settlement between Merrill Lynch and Orange
County, Calif., is another significant milestone in efforts, now
years in the making, to clean up questionable practices in the $1.3
trillion municipal finance market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the municipal marketplace, where cities and
towns across America raise money to provide services to their
citizens, has been rocked by a series of scandals often involving
cozy political arrangements between local officials and some Wall
Street bankers. But the bankruptcy of Orange County, one of the
richest in the country, was striking in the sheer scale of the loss
_ $1.6 billion _ and now for the magnitude of the payments from
Wall Street firms and others to settle the legal charges.
</P>
<P>
   For years, municipal finance has been considered a backwater of
Wall Street. And because it operated at a lower profile, with less
celebrated deal makers and less glamorous assignments, many of the
same standards considered appropriate in the raising of capital by
corporations never seemed to apply. Wall Street firms wanting
lucrative municipal bond deals, for example, eagerly wrote big
checks to politicians able to hand out those deals. And poorly
informed local financial officers were easy prey for Wall Street
firms often peddling risky and wildly inappropriate securities to
be bought with taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But in late 1994, just when Orange County became the largest
municipal bankruptcy in American history, government regulators
began a serious effort to clean up the municipal finance market
that is only now beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orange County bankruptcy drew national attention to the
municipal debt markets at a time when the Securities and Exchange
Commission had just undertaken efforts to improve the municipal
market overall,'' said Paul Maco, head of the SEC's office of
municipal securities. ``We've made great progress. We've improved
disclosure in the markets, we've eliminated many conflicts of
interest between bond issuers and Wall Street firms, and we are
putting into place a better system for providing prices of
municipal bonds to the retail investor.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been just a coincidence that the SEC's chairman,
Arthur Levitt, declared cleaning up the municipal markets his ``No.
1'' priority close to the Orange County bankruptcy filing. But the
publicity surrounding the debacle certainly served to focus a
spotlight on those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The following has been accomplished in the intervening years:
</P>
<P>
   _Efforts have succeeded to eliminate ``pay to play'' practices.
Wall Street firms are now prohibited from making campaign
contributions to local politicians that hand out bond underwriting
business.
</P>
<P>
   _More disclosure has been required of municipalities when they
issue bonds to investors.
</P>
<P>
   _Fraud charges have been leveled by the federal government
against a number of firms, bankers and municipal officials. At
least one major banker, Mark Ferber, a former partner at Lazard
Freres &AMP; Co., was sentenced to a 33-month jail term for failing to
disclose a secret kickback arrangement he had with another Wall
Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Orange County settlement with Merrill Lynch _ the
largest piece of nearly $600 million the county has collected so
far _ is a signal of how much remains to be done. The settlement
shows there is plenty of blame to spread around, including everyone
from the county officials who were loath to raise taxes and instead
devised a get-rich-quick scheme with public money to the Wall
Street advisers, deal makers and lawyers who enabled that scheme to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   In almost fitting justice, the amounts that the county is
expected to collect _ around $800 million or so when all the
lawsuits against Wall Street professionals are settled _ and the
amount the county will lose itself will ultimately be about equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode shows there are a lot of people in municipal
governments at the decision-making level without the training to
make financial decisions,'' said one Wall Street investment banker,
who was involved with Orange County and spoke only on condition he
not be named. ``Situations can arise when you have the confluence
of so many dollars. You've got profits to be made by Wall Street
professionals and people in municipalities who aren't always at top
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bennett, the attorney for Orange County who led the
bankruptcy case, added: ``The message of this settlement is that
public money is fairly well protected by the statutes, and when
they are violated it will result in liability by those who do
business with municipal officials. This was the largest settlement
ever in municipal finance and maybe the sheer size of it will lead
people to be more careful and not treat public money as a hedge
fund.''

NEW BLASTS HURT EFFORTS TO LIMIT NUCLEAR ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Pakistan)   (Eds: See also PAKISTAN-GOALS) 
(mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have undermined the
agreements and assumptions on which efforts to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons have been based for the last 30 years, a range of
officials, analysts and diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   They say the tests have also helped to all but doom prospects
this year for Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
which prohibits nuclear testing and which the Clinton
administration has made a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   The tests have also revived a fierce debate about how to get
countries to keep their commitments not to develop nuclear weapons
and how to stop India and Pakistan from plunging headlong into a
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nuclear tests are the most significant and damaging
proliferation event in years,'' said Lawrence Scheinman, who until
August was assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and is now director of the Washington office of
the Monterey Institute of International Affairs, an arms control
research center.
</P>
<P>
   But arms control advocates disagree about how much the tests
have changed the prospects for halting the spread of the weapons
and how the United States and other nations should respond.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the amount of damage to efforts to stop the
spread of nuclear weapons will depend on whether India and Pakistan
are forced to pay a high price for their tests. They say that would
mean getting other countries to join the United States in imposing
tough sanctions to discourage similar tests.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts warn that while the tests have undermined American
efforts, the administration should acknowledge that neither India
nor Pakistan is as potentially dangerous as countries like Iraq or
Iran. Isolating India and Pakistan with tough sanctions, they say,
may only complicate efforts to keep them from putting nuclear
warheads atop missiles and from sharing their nuclear know-how with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``American policy has always placed India, Pakistan and Israel
in an unstated, special category _ the de facto weapons state,''
said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution. ``So we need to continue distinguishing, in
fact, if not in arms control theory, between them and rogue
states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-out isolation campaign is a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some arms control advocates say the administration has not put
sufficient emphasis on nuclear disarmament in general. Paul
Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a
Washington-based nonprofit group that lobbies for arms control,
said the administration had inadvertently encouraged the tests by
making trade a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   Others cite the relative lack of progress in disarmament by the
two countries with the most nuclear weapons _ the United States and
Russia _ noting that treaties and agreements between them permit
each side to have 3,500 long-range nuclear missiles and unlimited
tactical nuclear weapons. But most analysts give the administration
relatively high marks for its efforts to stop the spread of the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the administration claimed a major arms control
achievement _ helping to draft the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
which bans all test explosions, and persuading reluctant
governments in China and France to sign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to counter opposition in the United States, the
administration agreed to spend $45 billion over the next 10 years
to enable weapons laboratories here to develop ways to check the
reliability of bombs without detonating them, by using computer
simulation, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the Indian and Pakistani tests, the treaty was
already on life support in the Senate. Conservative Republicans,
including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the influential chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said adherence to the treaty
could not be verified and vowed to block Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Helms wrote President Clinton that he would not
consider the test ban treaty until the Senate voted on the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the global warming treaty reached
in Kyoto, Japan. In practical terms, that meant the test ban treaty
had virtually no chance of coming to a vote in the Senate this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some arms control analysts say, the Indian and Pakistani
tests may have lessened the chances even further.
</P>
<P>
   Ten prominent members of the Union of Concerned Scientists _
including Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the joint chiefs
of staff; Hans Bethe, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and
Herbert York, a former founding director of the Livermore National
Laboratories _ sent letters to the Senate urging action on the
treaty now.
</P>
<P>
   Haass of the Brookings Institution, who worked in the Bush White
House, said: ``Even if India and Pakistan do sign the test ban,
which India has hinted it may do, the tests make the treaty
something of a mockery. To push for it now says: Get your testing
done and then sign. Why should we reinforce this cynical message
when the problem is not so much further testing as stopping the
deployment, use and transfer of nuclear technology.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the administration maintains that it has
``redoubled'' its commitment to the treaty. The Indian and
Pakistani tests, a senior White House official said, ``demonstrate
the urgent need for such a treaty now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't write the treaty's epitaph just yet,'' the official
said.

PEPSI DISMISSES BOTTLER IT SAYS THREATENED TO JOIN COCA-COLA SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio, Fla.) (js) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, Pepsico broke off a 32-year franchise
agreement with one of its largest independent bottlers on Tuesday,
saying that the bottler had threatened to intervene in Pepsico's
lawsuit against Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pepsi officials, executives from the bottler,
Central Investment Co. of Cincinnati, met with Pepsico's chairman
and chief executive, Roger Enrico, on Monday and insisted that a
number of demands be met within 24 hours or that they would enter
into the suit as a counter-plaintiff on Coke's side. Central
Investment, which also bottles Pepsi products in Fort Lauderdale
and Palm Beach, Fla., demanded more territory in Florida and Ohio,
money for marketing expenses and a limit on prices of concentrate,
Pepsi officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests to us that their real aim was to force us to pay a
stupendous ransom to avoid our very legitimate initiatives against
Coke being compromised or blunted,'' Enrico said in a letter sent
to 200 of the company's bottlers. In a telephone interview on
Tuesday, he called the demands ``the utmost in disloyalty,''
adding, ``We don't need traitors in our family and we're not going
to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico also sued Central Investment in U.S. district court in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left for Dick Caudill, an executive of
Central Investment Co. named in Enrico's letter, were not returned
on Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with the bottler comes amid intense negotiations
between Pepsico and several of its independent bottlers who have
not signed a new contract with the company. The new contract
removes the fountain business from bottlers for the first time, an
important element in Pepsico's reworked strategy to gain market
share from Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more than Pepsi just acting tough,'' said John
Sicher, publisher of the Beverage Digest, a trade magazine, adding
that Central Investment is Pepsi's ninth-largest independent
bottler. ``A big franchise company does not terminate a major
bottler unless it feels the bottler has seriously breached its
fiduciary duty to the franchise company.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit Pepsico filed against Coca-Cola last month contends
that Coke unfairly pressed food-service distributors not to carry
Pepsi products. Lawyers for Coca-Cola moved last week to have the
suit dismissed.

REAL ESTATE: COMMERCIAL RENTS RISE NEAR UNION SQUARE IN MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ In late 1996, W &AMP; M Properties spent more than $16
million to buy 58,000 square feet of retail space at the base of
the Zeckendorf Towers condominium on the east side of Union Square.
It was a time of continuing renewal for the once-seedy
neighborhood, and W &AMP; M expected that the rents from the tower's
dozen stores would make the deal profitable. But even W &AMP; M did not
reckon on the rents it is getting today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first year's income was considerably more than we
anticipated,'' said Fred Posniak, vice president of W &AMP; M, which is
owned by the Malkin real estate family. ``And this year's will be
even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union Square area, whose resurgence can be traced to the
1980s, is seeing a spurt of development that includes new housing,
a 14-screen multiplex cinema, a mammoth Virgin music and
entertainment store and two New York University residence halls.
And with the neighborhood's increasing desirability, brokers say, W
&AMP; M and some other retail landlords have been able to charge rents
much higher than they might have imagined a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Posniak said that Marine Midland Bank had just signed a renewal
lease for its 4,556-square-foot branch at the towers at an average
annual rent in excess of $120 a square foot; the rent under its old
lease was less than $90 a square foot. In April, he said, Federal
Express renewed the lease on its 1,495-square-foot space for more
than $140 a square foot. ``Its old lease was less than $90, and
when we bought the space we projected a rent of about $90 a square
foot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Starbucks leased a 3,500-square-foot store near
15th Street for more than $100 a square foot annually, Posniak
said. The previous tenant, a Woolworth's store, had paid $80 a
square foot. And A &AMP; P, whose original rent for its
30,000-square-foot store was less than $20 a square foot, took an
additional 2,100 square feet for more than $100 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Posniak's tale is being repeated around Union Square. Faith Hope
Consolo of Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing said she is
representing a food-service tenant in a lease that is out for
signing at $100 a square foot for 1,800 square feet at 42 Union
Square East, between 16th and 17th Streets. The previous tenant, a
delicatessen, had paid $25 a square foot, Ms. Consolo said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for space has also increased. Jonathan Switzer
of Winoker Realty said that an 800-square-foot retail space at
24-32 Union Square East had recently been leased to California
Burrito for an annual rent of about $100 a square foot. ``There
were about 10 offers, from businesses like greeting-card dealers
and newspaper stands,'' said Switzer, who represented the building
in the deal. ``Some were as high as $130, but the owner decided to
go with a name, creditworthy tenant,'' he said. The previous
tenant, a food store, had paid about $75 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Consolo said that there is a food shop in a
1,500-square-foot retail space at 3 East 14th Street, not far from
the square, that pays an annual rent of $50 a square foot. The
owner of the building is seeking a new tenant and asking $90 a
square foot, she said, ``and they've already received offers of $90
or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1980s, The city's Parks Department began a
series of major improvements to Union Square Park, which, although
home to a celebrated Greenmarket several days a week, had long been
plagued with an image as a haven for drug dealers and the homeless.
A $3.4-million program included turning the park into a large open
space and eliminating its thick undergrowth, hidden paths and
screen of bushes around the perimeter, which the police said
provided cover for drug sales. Also in the '80s, William Zeckendorf
Jr. developed the 670-unit Zeckendorf Towers condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Related Companies began construction on a $130
million, 240-apartment development on the full block south of Union
Square between Broadway and Fourth Avenue. The building will
include a new 75,000-square-foot Virgin music and entertainment
store, a 14-screen United Artists movie theater and a
48,000-square-foot Circuit City electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   Residential tenants began to move in this week, and the retail
sites are expected to begin opening after Labor Day. They will join
the many chains already in the neighborhood, among them Nobody
Beats the Wiz, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Toys `R' Us, Bradlees and P.C.
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-story, 650-bed New York University residence hall is to
open in September on 14th Street between Fourth and Third avenues,
where Luchow's restaurant stood. Work has begun on a 16-story,
1,000-bed university residence hall and recreation center just two
doors down, on the site of the Palladium. With these two halls, as
well as the existing 700-bed Carlyle Court residence hall, the
university will house about 2,350 university students in and around
Union Square by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day location,''
Posniak said. ``There are already several Off Broadway theaters in
the area, and the old American Savings Bank building on 15th Street
is going to become an Off Broadway theater. The neighborhood is
full of upscale restaurants. The Union Square subway stop has an
entrance in the towers building, and the station is one of the
busiest in the city, with about 250,000 people a day. That's a lot
of bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Union Square now, Posniak said he had only one
regret. ``All I can tell you,'' he said, ``is that I wish we had
more space there.''

LITTLE GUYS TRYING TO SEE TRUCK TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stacy Compton looks up, he sees Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt
and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Compton is fifth in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series heading
into the Pronto Auto Parts 400k Friday night at Texas Motor
Speedway. Ahead of him are some of the biggest names in auto
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not exactly Gordon, Earnhardt and Burton behind the
wheel of the trucks. They're sort of busy on the Winston Cup
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But they are, directly or indirectly, behind the men who are
behind the wheels of the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The truck that Jack Sprague has driven to the top of the truck
series points standings is owned by Hendrick Motorsports, which
also owns Gordon's Cup car. Gordon himself is listed as a co-owner
of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hornaday, second in the truck standings, has the backing of
Dale Earnhardt Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ruttman, third in the points, drives for Jack Roush. Roush
owns five Cup cars, including the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford
driven by Burton. Ruttman drives the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford in
the truck series.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sauter, fourth in the points, drives for Richard Childress.
Childress also owns Earnhardt's Cup car.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Compton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Hendrick and Earnhardt ahead of us, we've got Roush
and Childress up there,'' he said. ``We're an independent right in
the midst of a lot of Winston Cup influence.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Compton, and fellow independents like Tony Raines,
Bryan Reffner, Randy Tolsma, Rick Carelli and Rick Crawford,
decided underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   An independent team can be competitive in the truck series.
Compton, Raines Reffner, Tolsma, Carelli and Crawford are in the
top 10 in points.
</P>
<P>
   An independent team can win in the series. Compton has won a
race this season, as has Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult for an independent to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner won the inaugural title in 1995 in a truck owned by
Childress. Hornaday won in '96, and Sprague won last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those teams that have Winston Cup backgrounds, as we get past
midseason and start heading down the stretch, I think you'll see
the points race spread out a little bit,'' said Don Hawk, president
of DEI. ``We don't spend all of our money the first six weeks. We
don't spend all Ron's energy the first six weeks. We've got a lot
of staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cup-affiliated teams not only tend to have deeper pockets,
but they have a deeper pool of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right there at their fingertips,'' said Buddy Morrison,
co-owner of the Arlington-based Reher-Morrison engine shop that is
running a limited schedule in the truck series. ``When you've got a
Winston Cup team that's doing a lot of testing, they're out there
in highly instrumented cars working on little picky things that are
real hard to learn. They make a bunch of tiny improvements. A truck
team that's affiliated gets that automatically. When you get that
kind of expertise, it's a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers like Compton and Reffner don't have that edge. Both
drive for teams that started from ground zero last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our own,'' Reffner said. ``We started from scratch,
and that hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurts, but Compton said it doesn't have to be crushing. He
doesn't know Gordon or Burton. Earnhardt has never given him any
advice. But he still is aiming for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a really solid team,'' Compton said. ``We've proven
that. We don't have the Winston Cup influence, but we've got a lot
of things in our favor.''

<P>
   When the Sprint Corp. decided to whip up attention for a planned
new communications network, it followed a careful plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, it invited stock analysts and members of the news
media to come the next day to the Richard Rodgers Theater in Times
Square for an announcement about ``a revolutionary capability that
will change the way businesses and homes use telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Once at the theater, Sprint's guests were treated to a dazzling
multimedia display that included a cutaway replica of a
technology-energized house on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the buildup, Sprint's stock rose just 50 cents on
Tuesday, to close at $72.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The underwhelming response from investors largely reflected the
missing details, in terms of technology and business plan, from the
company's presentation. Besides, the shares had already had a
strong run-up this year, rising 24 percent to trade at 41 times
estimated earnings, mainly on speculation that Sprint would soon be
acquired soon, perhaps by a local telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   At the presentation, Sprint held up its new system as the
telecommunications equivalent of the Cuisinart, the essential tool
of the future that could do just about anything. The company said
the service would allow people to talk on the phone, send and
receive video images, surf the Internet and get high-speed data
access through a single existing connection.
</P>
<P>
   But it said little about how consumers would reach this
technological nirvana (in the second half of next year, when the
company plans to make the service available to homes).
</P>
<P>
   It did explain how it is upgrading its long-distance, or
``backbone,'' network to use an advanced technology called
asynchronous transfer mode. But every-day users do not see
backbones. They see the small tendrils of a network that actually
reach into their homes and offices. And Sprint explained little
about those tendrils' technical anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the company say it is negotiating with the
regional Bell companies, in particular Bell Atlantic and SBC
Communications Inc., to cooperate on high-speed local connections.
Tuesday, Sprint said only that it was talking to local carriers of
all sorts about a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly complex announcement,'' said Howard Anderson,
managing director of the Yankee Group, a high technology consulting
firm based in Boston. ``Well, it's not really an announcement. It's
a statement of direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications stock analyst in Marietta,
Ga., put it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has done a remarkable job of positioning this
announcement as earth-shaking,'' he said. ``I haven't seen this
much hype around a pre-announcement since Windows 95. My hat's off
to Sprint's marketing team.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to work for a while. Sprint's stock had closed on
Monday at $71.9375. Shortly after 11 a.m. on Tuesday, the shares
the shares were up almost $2, trading at $73.875. But by the the
time the presentation finished at noon, they had fallen back to
$72.75.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, part of the decline resulted from the company's
statement that the new venture would dilute earnings through 2000.
Sprint said it would spend $400 million on the system over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The new network may indeed change the industry. But that was not
obvious on Tuesday, especially given that many of Sprint's
competitors had made similar assertions. Big telecommunications
companies these days are rushing to offer an integrated package of
voice, data and video services.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Scott, chairman of IXC Communications Inc., which is
building a fiber optic network, remarke, ``It's a great validation
of our strategy and we're ahead in implementing it.''
</P>
<P>
   William Reddersen, a group president at the BellSouth Corp.,
said, ``Sprint's national backbone network reinforces what
BellSouth has been doing at the local level for the last four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ianna, who runs the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s national network, said,
``Our basic reaction is that a lot of what he said is nothing
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Clayton, chief executive of the Frontier Corp., reacted
with more skepticism yet. ``It's vaporware,'' he said. ``Where's
the beef on this deal?''

PANEL SAYS ADMINISTRATION UNDERESTIMATES MEDICARE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Iowa, W.Va., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan federal advisory panel said on Tuesday
that the long-term costs of Medicare were likely to be higher than
estimated by the Clinton administration, because the program was
likely to continue growing at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion increases the pressure for major changes in the
popular health program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had been assuming that the growth of Medicare
spending per beneficiary would slow after 2010, just as the first
baby boomers become eligible. But the National Bipartisan
Commission on the Future of Medicare, at a two-day meeting that
ended on Tuesday, said it was just as plausible to assume that
there would be no slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending grows not only because the number of
beneficiaries and their average age are increasing, but also
because elderly people are receiving more health care and more
costly services. The administration assumed that the average annual
growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary would gradually drop to
about 4 percent, the commission said, but experience suggests that
it could just as easily remain at around 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those differing assumptions lead to a difference of $760 billion
a year in Medicare spending by 2030, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission, created by Congress and headed by Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., has decided to assess the effects of all its
proposals on Medicare spending under both sets of assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration assumes that the growth of Medicare will slow
so that costs per beneficiary eventually grow at about the same
rate as the nation's economy, measured by the total output of goods
and services per person. But Breaux and other commission members
said this assumption was at odds with the history of Medicare
because costs have generally increased faster than the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is considering fundamental changes in the structure of
Medicare, but has not yet made specific recommendations. The higher
estimates of Medicarespending, considered more realistic by many
commission members, accentuate the need for changes in the program
to keep it solvent for 76 million baby boomers, born from 1946 to
1964.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One panel member, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said the estimates
of Medicare spending could have a profound effect on the
commission's recommendations, which must be submitted to the
president and Congress by March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another panel member, Bruce Vladeck, former administrator of the
Medicare program, said any forecast of Medicare spending beyond 10
years was ``an exercise in comparative fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   But most commission members said it was necessary to make such
estimates because otherwise the panel would not see the huge
effects of the baby boom on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a commission member and former economic
adviser to President Clinton, said history suggested that the
administration's estimates of future Medicare spending were, in
fact, optimistic. ``There's no reason to expect a sustained
slowdown'' in the growth of such spending, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who sits on the commission, said the
Administration's projections substantially ``underestimate what the
true costs will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor appointed to the
commission by Clinton, said, ``We are going to see a resumption of
health cost increases in this country.'' If that coincides with the
``tidal wave'' of baby boomers reaching retirement age, he said,
there will be immense pressure to restrict spending or to ration
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel got a vivid reminder of the politics of
Medicare when it convened Tuesday at the Library of Congress. In
the audience were dozens of members of the Gray Panthers, an
advocacy group for the elderly. They held up signs that said: ``No
more Medicare cuts!'' They also demanded that the commission hold
public hearings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Breaux said the commission would hold hearings
July 10 and 13 and seek public comment in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners agreed that they must also assess the overall
fairness of the Medicare program and the adequacy of its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., a member of the
commission, said he hoped that the panel would not become entranced
with cost projections. ``If this commission is simply about
solvency,'' he said, ``I'd like to get that cleared up right now,
because I'm not sure I belong on it.''

 &HT;    Shuttle launched for last rendezvous with Mir
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON, Texas _ The space shuttle Discovery made a flawless
blastoff Tuesday for the ninth and last shuttle docking with
Russia's space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   But problems on Mir that threatened to delay the flight might be
well taken as a warning that building the International Space
Station, scheduled to start in November, will likely face
unexpected complications and dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery lifted off precisely on schedule a few minutes after 6
p.m. Eastern Daylight Time from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Once the 4.5-million pound rocket cleared the launch tower, control
of its nearly 10-day mission shifted to NASA's Johnson Space Center
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes of the countdown, the temperature still was
registering 95 degrees, prompting launch controllers to keep close
watch on the hydraulic systems at the pad, especially the movable
walkway. The limit for launching is 99 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 miles above Earth, Mir's automatic thrusters were
firing on cue, keeping the station on an unswerving course. The
cosmonauts fixed the steering system Monday, three days after it
shut down. Without automatic steering, Mir would have been too
shaky for a shuttle docking.
</P>
<P>
   The space center opened an auditorium to the public, where more
than 800 people watched the launch on three giant screens and
veteran shuttle commander Kevin Kregel gave a running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle and its six crew members are to dock with Mir on
Thursday. It's the last planned shuttle visit to the aging space
station before Russia abandons it next year, then drives it back
into earth's atmosphere for a fiery destruction. It's also the last
scheduled flight for Discovery before U.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
rides it back into orbit in October.
</P>
<P>
   The next era in human space dwellings is scheduled to begin Nov.
20 with Russia's launch of the first element of the International
Space Station, the control module. It's to be followed Dec. 3 by
space shuttle Endeavor's launch with the space station's docking
node, which will connect the control module and several others to
be launched in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Troy resident Nancy Currie will play a key role on that
mission, using the shuttle's remote manipulator arm to help connect
the U.S. And Russian modules.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute problem on Mir threatened to delay Discovery's
launch. On Sunday, a motion-control computer failed, leaving the
sprawling station to tumble slowly in its orbit. Mir's Russian crew
replaced the computer with a new one but continued to wrestle with
the control problem until declaring it fixed Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of many problems that have bedeviled and
sometimes imperiled Mir's crews, including U.S. astronauts. It
prompted Andy Thomas, who has spent the last 4 months on Mir, to
ask Discovery's mission controllers whether the problem would delay
his return to earth. He said last week he was ``very keen'' for
Discovery to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to a certain extent, but, hey, maybe it's our
signature. It certainly adds some drama,'' said Frank Culbertson,
director of NASA's shuttle-Mir program.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, problems _ sometimes fatal or life-threatening _ have
accompanied all space station programs since the Soviet Union's
Salyut 1 became the world's first space station in 1971:
</P>
<P>
   E The first three cosmonauts launched to Salyut 1 could not
board the station because of docking problems. The next crew
occupied it for 23 days, but all three died during their return to
earth when their capsule depressurized.
</P>
<P>
   E America's first station, Skylab, lost one of its two
electricity-generating solar panels and an insulating shield when
it was orbited in May 1973. After the last crew left Skylab in
1974, it fell out of orbit in 1979, sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
   E Mir has been in service for more than a decade, but it has
experienced a series of mishaps, especially within the last two
years. Fire broke out in February 1997, forcing the crew to don
oxygen masks. An oxygen generator failed the next month, leaving
the crew with a two-month air supply. Last June, a seven-ton cargo
rocket collided with the station, poking a hole in one of its
pressurized modules and damaging a solar panel. The computers that
manage control and power have had problems ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-nation International Space Station will be far bigger and
more complex than any of its predecessors. It will have far more
capabilities, but it has already had more than its share of
problems. The upcoming launches originally were scheduled for 1997,
then pushed back to this summer because of Russian delays in
delivering the all-important service module. Continuing delays
prompted the latest schedule slips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, space station cost estimates continue to soar above
$20 billion, not counting launch costs.
</P>
<P>
   The nine shuttle dockings with Mir and seven long-duration
flights on the station by U.S. astronauts are what NASA calls Phase
One of the International Space Station program. It began in 1995
and ends with this flight. Culbertson said the problems encountered
during Phase One have been a benefit because they gave lessons in
how to detail with unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
   If the International Space Station follows the historical trend,
it will give plenty of lessons of its own.

FORD EXPLORER HAS HIGHER CHANCE OF CAUSING INJURY, TESTS FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mich., Canada)   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ The first round of American crash tests
analyzing what happens when light trucks hit cars has found that a
Ford Explorer, a mid-size sport utility vehicle, was twice as
likely as a mid-size car, mini-van or pickup truck to inflict a
critical or severe injury to a car driver's chest and somewhat more
likely to hurt a car driver's head and neck, according to test
results released at an international conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, which conducted the tests this
spring in Ohio, said that the results reflected a real-world
problem in which sport utility vehicles inflict more damage on
cars. But auto industry officials were deeply divided on the value
of the tests, with some saying that the tests provided little if
any new information while others said that the tests were only the
first steps in what could be a long research program.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a private contractor, the government slammed four
different vehicles traveling at 33 miles an hour into the driver's
side of four stationary Honda Accords. The four striking vehicles
were a two-wheel-drive Ford Explorer, a Chevrolet Lumina mid-size
sedan, a Chevrolet S-10 pickup and a Dodge Grand Caravan mini-van.
After checking the dummies in the driver's seat of each Accord,
regulators determined that the mid-size car, the mini-van and
pickup would each have had an 18 to 20 percent chance of inflicting
a severe injury to the chest of a real person and a 2 percent
chance or less of inflicting a critical injury. The Explorer would
have had a 40 percent chance of inflicting a severe injury and a 5
percent chance of inflicting a critical injury, according to the
test results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Explorer is one of the smaller American-made sport utility
vehicles, and the two-wheel-drive version, which was used in the
test, rides lower and is more likely to override a car in a
collision than the four-wheel-drive version. Its score for damage
to the Accord dummy's head and neck was 395, on a scale for which
1,000 is likely to be fatal. By comparison, the pickup's score was
314, the car's score was 242 and the Caravan's score was 193.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the striking vehicles also had dummies in their front
seats. The car provided the most head and neck protection for the
dummy in its own driver's seat, while the Explorer scored second
best. But the car also provided the worst head and neck protection
for a dummy in its front passenger seat, while the Explorer did
second-worst. The Explorer fared best on chest protection for both
dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that the tests showed that light trucks _ a
category including pickups and mini-vans as well as sport utility
vehicles _ were clearly incompatible with cars during collisions.
``It's not a question of whether or not the compatibility issue
exists,'' said Martinez, a former emergency room physician. ``It
does, everyone knows it does, the question is why does it exist and
what can we do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said his agency would conduct four front-to-front crash
tests this summer and develop computer simulations for further
research. The goal is to determine how vehicles can be redesigned
to make car occupants safer without making light truck occupants
less safe.
</P>
<P>
   Light trucks account for only one-third of the vehicles on the
road, but now kill more people in cars than other cars do. Martinez
said the mismatches in collisions appeared to reflect the greater
height, greater weight and stiffer frames of light trucks. But he
said further research was needed to determine the relative
importance of these issues and whether any new regulations might be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and auto industry officials spoke at an international
traffic safety conference in this factory town across the Detroit
River from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The auto lobbyists and executives here acknowledged that some
safety problem existed on the nation's roads but questioned whether
the test results provided any new information.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Felrice, a former top regulator who is now the director
for regulatory affairs at the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association, a Washington lobbying group for Detroit's Big Three
automakers, said that it was unclear why the pickup and mini-van
inflicted virtually the same damage as the mid-sized car.
</P>
<P>
   While mini-vans are built much like cars, pickups are built like
sport utility vehicles. Regulators said they had expected the car
to inflict less damage.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have crashed hundreds of cars into each other over
the years and can usually predict what will happen. But only now
are regulators beginning to examine light truck collisions with
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's test results also held several small surprises for
which regulators had no immediate explanation. While the Explorer
inflicted the most damage to the head, neck and chest of the dummy
in the Accord driver's seat, the mini-van did the most damage to
the dummy's pelvis. While pelvis injuries receive less attention
from regulators because they are less likely to be fatal, such
injuries can still be debilitating.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and
environmental affairs, said that the damage done by the mini-van,
which has a low front end, showed that there were trade-offs
involved in developing lower-riding sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Ford manager said in a recent interview that, among
other safety features, the company was designing new suspensions
that would allow sport utilities to ride closer down to the wheels,
reducing the risk that they would override cars' bumpers. Mrs.
Petrauskas refused to discuss Ford's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Petrauskas said that Ford had crashed an Explorer into the
side of a Taurus and found less damage than regulators found in
their test into the side of the Accord. She also questioned
Mercedes' claim to have produced a safer sport utility vehicle,
saying that Ford had crashed a Mercedes sport utility into the side
of a Taurus and done the same damage as with the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that his goal was to persuade the industry to
conduct research and eventually make design changes, rather than
pursue a lengthy regulatory process. ``I want to focus on corporate
responsibility,'' he said. ``Anybody can fight the industry _
changing the industry, that's a little more work.''

OFFICIALS SAY U.S. IS UNPREPARED FOR GERM WARFARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.C.) (ja)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representatives of the nation's public health
service told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the country is
woefully unprepared for a biological terrorist attack and
criticized government spending on biological defense as misguided
because so much of it goes to the Pentagon instead of public
hospitals and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Witness after witness described shortages of trained medical
personnel, the lack of high-security laboratories in which lethal,
highly contagious microbes can be tested and identified, public
health clinics with rotary phones and no computers or ready access
to disease data banks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who chaired the hearing, called
the testimony ``frightening,'' a sentiment echoed by his witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that scares the hell out of me like this
issue, senator,'' said Michael Osterholm, Minnesota's state
epidemiologist who spoke for the American Society for Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm criticized the $300 million recently set aside for the
National Guard to set up biological rapid response units, which he
said would only play a ``minor'' role in responding to an
infectious outbreak. ``The public health system has not been
brought into any of this,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Fincher Jr., the fire chief of Charlotte, N.C., which
recently experienced a bioterrorism threat which turned out to be a
false alarm, noted that while the Department of Defense was
supposed to leave $300,000 worth of equipment in his district to
help combat biological and chemical terrorism after police
officers, firefighters and other ``first responders'' are trained
this fall, there were no plans for further training.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Morris, president of the National Association of County
and City Health Officials, listed the problems faced by the
nation's 3,000 public health officials. About half of all local
health departments do not have the use of e-mail, and at least
1,000 of them have no access to any online or Internet service.
Seventy percent of health directors said their staff had little or
no expertise in using online services and data. Twenty percent of
local health departments still use rotary phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just cross their fingers that they can reach the right
people by phone or that the fax goes through,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses agreed that a biological attack would be different
from one involving chemical, nuclear, or other weapons of mass
destruction in that hours, perhaps days might pass before it was
known that a target had been attacked. In this sense, said Donald
Henderson, the professor at Johns Hopkins University School of
Public Health who recently urged that smallpox vaccine be produced
and stockpiled again, public health care facilities and personnel
are what he called the first line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are willing to spend $300 million on the National Guard,
why not invest a billion dollars on our real first line of defense,
our hospitals,'' Henderson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases, said that because none of the biological agents
considered most likely to be used as bio-weapons are public health
problems in the United States, ``we have limited capacity to
diagnose them, either at the state, local or federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also said that while he now had 10 to 12 people working
on plague, no one on his staff was working on anthrax, one of the
most attractive agents for terrorists because its highly lethal
spores are durable and long-lasting.

NEW YORK WOMAN KILLED BY STRAY BULLET
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A kind of murder that has become increasingly rare in
recent years returned to New York City on Monday night when a
19-year-old woman was shot and killed on a Brooklyn street corner
by a stray bullet that was apparently intended for someone else,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Sheamba John King, 19, had just used a pay phone
around the corner from her apartment in East Flatbush and was
talking to some friends around 9:30 p.m. when a burst of gunfire
crackled and a single shot struck her in the back and killed her,
the police said. Detectives believe that the fatal bullet was one
of about 10 shots fired by a group of young men having a fight, but
said that they were not sure who the intended target was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that she was not the intended target,'' said Betsy
Herzog, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Such random shootings have become rare in recent years. As the
murder rate has plummeted _ there were 770 homicides reported in
the city last year, down from 2,245 in 1990 _ the number of people
killed by strangers has fallen the fastest. In the last two years,
roughly 20 percent of murder victims were killed by strangers, down
from 37 percent in 1993, police statistics show. And the number of
innocent bystanders shot has fallen each year since 1991, when a
spate of random shootings led the police to keep a tally of such
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The killing devastated Ms. King's family. ``She was a very loved
child,'' sobbed her grandmother, Emily John Ocsi, 65.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ms. King got married. It was also the year that she
became an American citizen, after having immigrated with her family
from Guyana seven years ago. And it was the year she was to
graduate from Erasmus High School. She had already had her portrait
drawn in pencil, wearing her cap and gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were planning to have a big party July 9,'' Mrs. Ocsi said,
clutching the graduation portrait to her chest. ``It was for her
graduation, and for her 20th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ocsi was the first member of the family to come to the
United States from Guyana, back in 1976. In 1991 she sponsored her
daughter, Barbara, and her four grandchildren, Marcy, Carl,
Samantha, and Sheamba _who was the youngest _ for citizenship. They
all moved to Brooklyn, eventually all settling in the same
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy,'' Mrs. Ocsi recalled. ``I didn't know her
then. She was born while I was over here. Now we were all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in the apartment that Ms. King shared with her mother
and siblings at 1354 New York Ave., in the Vanderveer Estates in
East Flatbush, Mrs. Ocsi broke down and wept for her granddaughter,
crying, ``Sheamba gone, Sheamba gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. King's friends, Sheba Williams, 17, tried to comfort
her. ``Don't cry now,'' she said softly, rubbing the wailing
woman's shoulders. ``Don't cry now.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends remembered Ms. King as a jokester who was full of life,
who loved to dance to the latest reggae hits at parties and who had
hoped to become a hairdresser after graduating from high school.
She already worked after school giving shampoos at True Skill, a
hair salon on Nostrand Avenue. And she often did the hair of
friends and woman in the neighborhood, giving them braids, weaves
and curls.
</P>
<P>
   She was supposed to do a friend's hair the night she was killed.
``I had just left her on the corner,'' recalled Doretta Williams,
22. ``It must have been two minutes after I left her she was shot.
I said, `Come fix my hair.' She said she'd come later.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives at the 67th Precinct were questioning several men
Tuesday about the shooting. An investigator who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said that the police believe that one of the
men Ms. King was standing with may have been in a dispute earlier
that night and may have been the target of the fusillade. It
appeared no one besides Ms. King was hit, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the shots,'' said a friend, Afana Johnson, 20, who
was in her apartment at the time. ``We were like, `They're always
shooting, those gangs.' Then we heard someone yelling, `Sheamba
shot, Sheamba shot.' We went down. She was lying on the floor. We
were praying she'd pull through. Her eyes were open. You hear about
things like this every day, but you don't think it will come so
close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't deserve this, she didn't deserve a bullet like
that, she didn't have to die like that,'' Ms. Johnson said.

SPORT CHALET CHAIR HANDS OUT $1.8 MILLION IN SHARES TO EMPLOYEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a gesture so generous that it elicited two
standing ovations from the company's managers and longtime
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Olberz, Sport Chalet chairman and interim chief
executive officer, told 109 workers Tuesday that he was giving them
300,000 shares, collectively, of his own company stock as a reward
for a year of record earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I salute the 109 new owners,'' said the 73-year-old former
pastry chef, who moved from a small town near Bonn, Germany, and
bought the first Sport Chalet store in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a country, where a poor immigrant can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company were handed out based on seniority.
Ten-year employees received 2,000 shares, plus 100 shares for every
year thereafter. Thus, at Tuesday's close of $6, a 15-year veteran
of the company would get about $15,000 worth of shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company will benefit from employees who will have more
pride in their work,'' said Tom Ishkanian, an 18-year company
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Olberz, whose ownership will be reduced to 65 percent after the
$1.8 million gift, agreed. ``Everybody will work like an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   The shares represent about 4.6 percent of Sport Chalet, which
has 6.5 million shares outstanding. About 8 percent of the
company's work force received a share of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   But recipients, who cheered and whistled as the announcement was
made at company headquarters in La Canada, a Los Angeles-area
suburb, early Tuesday, can't sell the stock for two years in
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
They also will lose the stock if they're fired or go to work for a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't faze Barbara Gagne, an employee for the last 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally unexpected,'' she said, all smiles. ``I'll just
keep it and let it grow. Maybe I'll pass it on to my children and
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though workers can't sell the stock yet, the law requires
they pay taxes on it immediately. Sport Chalet said it will lend
money to workers at market rates to meet those obligations.
Employees can pay it back through payroll deductions lasting up to
four years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gift couldn't have come at a better time for the
company, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   It should motivate workers at a time when Sport Chalet faces
increased competition in the marketplace, said Bob McGee, an editor
at Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade publication in Glen Mills,
Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this offer will breed goodwill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority, the nation's largest sporting goods chain,
will be entering California this year, with four stores opening in
the Los Angeles area by fall, McGee said. Oshman's is expanding in
Southern California this fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Sportmart, which was purchased by sporting goods retailer
Gart and already competes with Sport Chalet in Southern California,
has gained clout thanks to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   After losing money in 1996, Sport Chalet lured Craig Levra _
former vice president of store operations at Sports Authority _ to
become president and chief operating officer. He's led the effort
to improve operations.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year 1998, the 19-store Sport Chalet reported a
39 percent increase in profit to $3.2 million (49 cents a diluted
share) from $2.3 million (35 cents) a year ago. Sales rose 3.9
percent to $143 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, earnings dropped to $281,000 (4 cents)
from $347,000 (5 cents) a year ago on sales of $37.1 million vs.
$34.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sport Chalet also is drawing plans to build a new corporate
office at the same La Canada location, to be completed by the
summer of 1999. The 70,000-square-foot project will encompass a
50,000-square-foot store and the rest for corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than $7 million, the project will be part of a
$31 million shopping center complex to be built on 11 acres on
Foothill Boulevard east of Angeles Crest Highway. &QL;

DAMAGE-LIMIT LAW DOES NOT APPLY TO FLIGHT 800 LAWSUITS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A law that limits damages in high seas accidents will
not apply to lawsuits filed on behalf of the passengers killed in
the crash of TWA Flight 800 two years ago, a U.S. District Court
judge ruled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could have a significant impact on the 145 cases
filed on behalf of passengers' families and estates. The Death on
the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920, says that plaintiffs can only
recover damages in proportion to monetary losses caused by a
person's death. Such losses typically include lost income or
financial support provided to a spouse or children.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by Judge Robert Sweet of U.S. district court in
Manhattan, comes in response to a motion filed by defendants in the
lawsuits, including TWA and Boeing. The defendants had asked the
judge to limit possible damages under the law.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800, which took off from Kennedy International
Airport en route to Paris on July 17, 1996, exploded in the air and
crashed into the ocean off Long Island, New York. All 230 people on
board were killed. Investigators have said the Boeing 747's center
wing fuel tank exploded, but the reason for the explosion is still
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Had Sweet applied the Death on the High Seas Act to the TWA
Flight 800 cases, the plaintiffs would have been forbidden to sue
for emotional pain on behalf of the families of those killed in the
crash. But Tuesday's ruling means that plaintiffs will be able to
seek higher damages, particularly in the cases of children and
other people who did not earn large amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a child's case, where the child is not contributing any
money to the parent, there is little pecuniary loss,'' said Lee
Kreindler, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. ``All the
non-monetary losses can now be essentially recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 25-page decision, Sweet said the act did not apply
because the TWA Flight 800 crash occurred within U.S. territorial
waters. Referring to a 1988 proclamation by President Ronald
Reagan, Sweet said territorial waters extended 12 nautical miles
from the shore at the time of the TWA Flight 800 disaster.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, TWA Flight
800 crashed 8 nautical miles from the southern shore of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet's decision, the first to consider the law's application in
such circumstances, turns on his legal interpretation of the words
``high seas'' within the law. Although the term is not clearly
spelled out, Sweet interpreted it to mean waters outside the
country's territorial jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, spokesmen for TWA and Boeing declined to say whether
the companies would appeal. Doug Webb, a Boeing spokesman, said the
company was ``reviewing our legal options.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA's damages in any lawsuits are already limited by the Warsaw
Convention, which limits legal damages in airline disasters to
$75,000 per passenger. The only way the damages could be increased
is if the plaintiffs could prove that the airline acted with
willful misconduct. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the airline
said, ``There has been no finding in any of the extensive
investigations of any deficiencies in TWA's operations that caused
this tragedy.''

POLITICIANS VICTIMIZE SCHOOLKIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - The courtroom filled up 20 minutes befo re gavel
time, starched collars all around, fine silk ties. The players
entered amid much hand-shaking and many hiyas. Everyone knew
everyone. The room buzzed with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   You could sit through a thousand court proceedings and never
hear
</P>
<P>
   such a noise.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was special, though, a reunion. The politicians and
their lawyers have been gathering at the Arizona Supreme Court
building every few years, all decade long.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion: Fixing Arizona's public schools. The r esult:
Always more shame.
</P>
<P>
   This sad past went ignored as the room filled up _ same as 1993,
same as 1996, same as 1997. The same as every other time the
Arizona Supreme Court shot down a school-funding fix.
</P>
<P>
   The people we elect have ne ver been much for history,
understand. Not much for observing it, not much for making it. And
surely not much for teaching it.
</P>
<P>
   The gavel slapped twice. In filed the justices, five black
robes. The gavel slapped again, beginning Round Four.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer argued for Students FIRST, Gov. Jane Hull's $371
million plan to build schools. Next stood three lawyers opposed,
there for poor school districts and rich, and for the state
superintendent of schools. They hate the plan's ``opt-o ut''
provision and its limits on bonding.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, the five on the bench asked questions. The lawyers
talked and banked a few hundred bucks more. We'll have a winner in
a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The loser I can name right now.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona 's schoolkids.
</P>
<P>
   They lost because it's been seven years and still this lawsuit
stands unresolved. They've lost thanks to seven years of
legislative ignorance, legislative gutlessness and legislative
delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of subpar schoo ls. Seven years of dragged wingtips.
Seven years of press conference lies.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing wasn't the debate, or the thought that
Students FIRST might die and leave an entire school system again at
Square One. It was that politicians l ike House Speaker Jeff
Grocost and Senate President Brenda Burns had the nerve to show
face. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Said Burns, a legislator since 1987: ``I don't feel like there's
any failure at all. ... It is very difficult to change so
drastically the wa y we do things. There's a comfort level there.
The court clearly wanted a major change. We have provided that, and
it takes a lot to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   So true, so true. It takes a lot of kids flushed like waste, a
lot of hopes snuffed. Seven years' worth, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of that wasted time can be found on Durango Street,
in another kind of courtroom. The juvenile kind.
</P>
<P>
   There, wheat fabric covers the walls and the sound of sobbing
dominates. I've heard it often, an d did again Tuesday, with Burns'
boast fresh in my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Day in, day out, eight courtrooms brim with delinquents and
parents, losers current and losers future. Every day, Arizona fails
some more.
</P>
<P>
   Lousy schools _ thanks mostly to lous y legislators _ deserve
much of the blame. Figure lame education ranks in the top three on
the causing-criminals scale, beside garbage parents and poverty.
Figure better schools would save kid after kid. Not all, not most,
but some.
</P>
<P>
   I watche d kids in need of saving for hours. Every minute felt
like, oh, seven years.
</P>
<P>
   One boy, 12 years old, sat hands and ankles cuffed, his mother
to his left. He was slender and flame-eyed. The charge: He'd drawn
a picture of himself gunning down students and staffers. He'd spent
three weeks in county detention, awaiting a shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go home,'' he begged.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said no, not yet. That answer made sense given the
charge, but it would've been better to have no ne ed of the
question. For seven years, our politicians could've helped make
sure. They couldn't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   They patted backs, instead, and had reunions. Always, and again
Tuesday, they stood in the wrong courtroom. &QL;

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO SPYING FOR EAST GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of three former campus radicals arrested in
October in an espionage sting has agreed to plead guilty to spying
for East Germany, lawyers in the case said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Clark, who worked as a private investigator and an Army
paralegal, would plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence.
He and his co-defendants, Terry Squillacote, a former Pentagon
lawyer, and her husband, Kurt Stand, who was a representative of an
international workers' union, face life sentences on charges of
spying for Communist intelligence services since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said all three were spies for East Germany.
Stand, enlisted by his father, recruited Clark and then his wife,
the indictment said. Clark was charged with espionage and
conspiracy to commit espionage by delivering top secret defense
documents to East Germany between 1979 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI obtained old files from the East German spy service in
1995 and decoded them; the FBI says it found the three defendants'
names in those files. The agency then devised a sting operation to
trap the three into admissions of espionage, setting up a ``false
flag'' operation designed to make them believe that the South
African government wanted them to work as intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Clark succeeded Stand as chairman of the Communist Party's youth
wing at the University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus in 1974,
where Stand met Ms. Squillacote. All three were dedicated lifelong
Marxists, but their lawyers and defenders said after their arrest
that they were guilty of nothing more than loyalty to that
ideology.

AKINWANDE LOOKS FOR REDEMPTION AGAINST HOLYFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (ja)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many American boxing fans, Henry Akinwande is
known chiefly as the boxer who was disqualified for excessive
clinching in his title fight against Lennox Lewis last July 12.
There are few cardinal sins in boxing, but refusing to fight, which
many consider an act of cowardice, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   So as Akinwande heads into his second heavyweight championship
bout in 11 months, the popular thinking is that Evander Holyfield
will mop up the Madison Square Garden ring with him on Saturday
night _ if Akinwande does not run away first.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime Event
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're in for a surprising fight,'' said Emanuel
Steward, Holyfield's former trainer, who became Akinwande's trainer
after Don Turner had to decide between training Holyfield or
Akinwande for this fight. ``He's not coming to run. He's coming to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in Akinwande's background to suggest a lack of
desire. He defied his strong-willed father to become a boxer, and
was disowned by him. He worked at a McDonald's and was a street
sweeper in London's Trafalgar Square to support himself en route to
making the British Olympic boxing team in 1988. As a professional,
he went to Germany twice to fight Axel Schulz, losing a
controversial decision the first time and winning a unanimous
decision the second time. They were both tough fights. And he won
the World Boxing Organization heavyweight championship with a
third-round knockout of Jeremy Williams in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure what prompted him to clinch Lewis to the
point of being disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never asked him,'' Turner said. ``Whatever he said, it
wouldn't have made a difference. I kept telling him to fight. He
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande (33-1-1) said he is not embarrassed by the
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the fight you'll see that I wasn't the one
who initiated all of the holding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot believe that that single incident can cloud people's
opinion of him as a boxer, raise questions about his courage and
cast such a large shadow over his career two fights after the fact.
He defeated Orlin Norris Jr. in his last fight, a World Boxing
Association bout to determine the No. 1 contender to fight
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of people, since I've been boxing, that
say that I'm not good enough,'' Akinwande said. ``I use that to
motivate myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande's life is full of motivational material.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Dulwich, England. His father, Joseph, was in the
import/export business and moved the family back to Lagos, Nigeria,
when Akinwande was 7. When he was 14, Akinwande fell in love with
boxing. But his father wanted him to go to college to take over the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Africa, where if you try to go into sports you're
an outcast,'' Akinwande said. ``Also, if your dad told you to do
something, you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande said that when his father found out he was working out
at a local gym, he came to the place and found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He nearly killed me,'' Akinwande said. ``But that only made me
more determined to box.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande, 27, said his father disowned him, telling him that if
he left home he could never come back. Akinwande left, traveling
back to England and settling in the south London suburb where he
was born. He joined a boxing club called Lynn and set about making
himself into a successful amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande secretly kept in touch with his mother, Josephine, by
telephone calls and letters. But he did not speak to his father for
five years after he left home.
</P>
<P>
   While in London, he supported himself with odd jobs. Meanwhile,
his boxing skills were improving. He won an amateur boxing
championship, equivalent to the American Golden Gloves, and he made
the British Olympic team, fighting in the 1988 Games in Seoul,
South Korea. He did not win a medal, and he turned pro in 1989. It
would be nearly 10 years before he lost another boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   As his pro career took off in England, Akinwande made money. He
returned to Lagos, but he did not set foot in his old home.
Instead, he built his own.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his father came to his home, and the two men
reconciled a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his friends started talking to him,'' Akinwande said.
``They said they would like to have a son like me. They said: `Your
son would not have made this much money by going to school and
working in your business. Your son is richer than you. How do you
measure success?'''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling overshadowed in London by other heavyweights like Lewis,
Frank Bruno and Herbie Hide, Akinwande made another move in 1994.
This time he came to America to fight. He signed with the promoter
Don King and settled in Tallahassee, Fla. He now lives in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going smoothly until he was disqualified for hugging
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield represents his chance for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say I don't have any heart, I don't have any guts,
they don't know,'' Akinwande said. ``If they had lived through what
I have lived through, then they would realize how much
determination and courage I have. They would be with me.'' &QL;

TRUMP BACKERS TRY TO SELL PART OF PROJECT ON HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: China)  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Southeast Asia's real estate market in turmoil
and New York's soaring, the Hong Kong investors who financed Donald
Trump's Riverside South development in Manhattan are trying to sell
the first two apartment buildings at the $2.5-billion project.
</P>
<P>
   New World Development Co., which led the consortium that bought
the 75-acre waterfront parcel on the west side of Manhattan in
1994, has hired Salomon Smith Barney to solicit bids for the two
buildings. The consortium had hoped that construction would begin
in 1995, but the project, which stretches between 59th and 72nd
Streets near the Hudson River, moved slowly and the first two
apartment buildings are only now nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, interest rates in Hong Kong have climbed and real
estate prices have plummeted as a recession rumbled through
southeast Asia. New World, unlike some other Hong Kong real estate
companies, is not in danger of collapse, but with apartment rents
and prices in Manhattan soaring, a sale in New York would allow the
consortium to raise a pile of cash quickly. That money, in turn,
could be used to finance the rest of the project, which stretches
between 59th and 72nd Streets, near the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney has pitched the properties to the Resnick
real estate family, Related Cos., Vornado Realty Trust and several
other real estate investment trusts, according to executives
involved in the potential deal. The sale price could go as high as
$350 million to $400 million, the executives said, but New World
may still elect not to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``New World is not under nearly the same pressure as some of the
other real estate companies,'' said Jack Shaffer, managing director
of international sales for Sonnenblick-Goldman Co., a real estate
investment bank. ``But New World does need cash to do things here,
particularly at the Riverside South project.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Trump and the Hong Kong companies are
continuing longstanding talks with CBS about selling a 10-acre
parcel at the south end of Riverside South, near 59th Street, for
$100 million. CBS would build a 1.5-million-square-foot television
studio there, according to an executive who works with Trump
Organization. But the prospects of a deal are hobbled by a lengthy
city review process, potential community opposition and CBS'
interest in several other options.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for Riverside South call for 5,700 apartments in 16
apartment buildings, 1.8 million square feet of commercial space
and a 21.5 acre public park. Trump and his Hong Kong partners are
just completing the first two buildings: a 40-story, 366-unit
apartment house between 68th and 69th Streets and a 46-story tower
between 69th and 70th Streets, with 440 condominiums, on what will
be an extension of Riverside Drive. The condominium tower would
probably be converted to a luxury rental building if it is bought
by a real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has opened a rental office and is completing the
condominium plan. Tenants, both retail and residential, are
expected to be moving in by the end of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New World has to make a decision whether to take its profits on
the buildings immediately through a sale or over time. For Trump, a
sale might be a public relations setback in that Riverside South
would no longer be associated exclusively with his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the buildings should generate a lot of
revenue. After taking a sharp plunge in the early 1990s, the
residential market has been white hot in recent years. In the last
year alone, prices for apartments in Manhattan jumped 20.7 percent
over all, and 40 percent on the west side, according to Corcoran
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Two executives from different companies who talked with Salomon
Smith Barney said that New World, rather than Trump, had initiated
the process and ``was calling the shots'' on the potential deal.
</P>
<P>
   Trump confirmed that the partners were exploring a sale, though
he doubted that any potential buyer could match ``the numbers we
could get ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the possibility of selling the two
buildings,'' Trump said, ``because of the tremendous activity in
the residential market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian investors were drawn to New York real estate in the
mid-1990s by bargain prices and a relatively stable market when
compared with the speculative fever in Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The Lai Sun Group bought the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th
Street for $190 million, a fabulous bargain considering that the
hotel had cost $477 million to develop. But faced with large debts
and falling property prices in Hong Kong, Lai Sun now is selling
the hotel, albeit for nearly double the original purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, Ong Beng Seng, the billionaire from
Singapore, was recently forced to sell his stake in the Hotel
Pennsylvania, across the street from Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's Riverside South project was languishing in 1994 when New
World and four other Hong Kong companies paid $88 million for a
$250 million mortgage on the land that was held by Chase Manhattan
Bank. Trump remained as the developer and he got a 30 percent stake
in the project after development costs. Under certain conditions,
his stake could grow.

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, on Tuesday
raised the prospect for the first time publicly that he may send to
Congress an impeachment referral against President Clinton in the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in papers he filed with the Supreme Court
urging it to quickly resolve efforts by the Clinton administration
to block the testimony of several officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be blunt,'' Starr wrote in replying to the White House
contention, raised again on Monday, that some of the testimony
being sought by investigators is protected by the attorney-client
privilege. ``The Nation has a compelling interest that this
criminal investigation of the President of the United States
conclude as quickly as possible _ that indictments be brought,
possible reports for impeachment proceedings issued, and
non-prosecution decisions announced. This Court's immediate review
would powerfully serve that vital goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President's response,'' Starr added, ``treats this as a
matter-of-fact investigation. But the unhappy fact is that, at the
determination of the Attorney General herself, a President is under
serious criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and lawyers, following Starr's investigation of
whether the president had a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and urged her to lie about it, have speculated for months
about the possibility of an impeachment report. However, the filing
on Tuesday marked the first time that Starr has publicly signaled
that he is moving in that direction. Such a report would inform
Congress that the independent counsel had found evidence of an
impeachable offense, compelling Congress to consider whether to
exercise its authority under the Constitution to remove the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be months before such a report is completed. Starr
and his staff must first face a crucial decision about whether to
prosecute Ms. Lewinsky, a former intern at the White House, for
perjury and other charges. And they remain embroiled in a series of
legal disputes with the administration _ over the testimony of a
top White House aide, Bruce Lindsey, as well as several Secret
Service agents _ that may take months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the White House on Tuesday called Starr's brief
``an act of public relations, not a work of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr's filing today serves as a vehicle for rhetoric in
the place of legal substance,'' said the statement, which was
issued by Jim Kennedy, a special adviser to the White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who on Tuesday jettisoned her flamboyant
California lawyer, William Ginsburg, in favor of two seasoned
criminal defense lawyers from Washington, is under investigation
for perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. In the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, she and Clinton denied under
oath that they had a sexual relationship, although she is said to
have contradicted her sworn testimony in secretly recorded
conversations with a former colleague, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the new legal team by Ms. Lewinsky raised the
prospect that negotiations over a possible plea agreement or
immunity deal, which had stalled in recent months, could be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing to short-circuit the normal appeals process, Starr on
Tuesday asked the Supreme Court for the second time in two weeks to
bypass the Court of Appeals on the administration's challenge to
grand jury testimony by top aides and Secret Service officials.
Starr asked the justices to expedite the administration's appeal of
a Federal District judge's order compelling three employees of the
Secret Service to answer questions about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, two uniformed officers and the agency's chief
counsel, had declined to answer the questions citing a new kind of
privilege that the Secret Service maintains is essential to ensure
the safety of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Starr asked the Supreme Court to quickly consider
Clinton's appeal from the same judge's order compelling the
testimony of two senior presidential aides, Lindsey and Sidney
Blumenthal. On Monday, Clinton abruptly dropped the executive
privilege claim that had blocked Blumenthal's testimony, but he
continued to assert the attorney-client privilege claim to limit
the testimony of Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel and one of
the president's closest confidantes.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have urged the Supreme Court to let the
appeals process run its normal course, prompting Starr to reply on
Tuesday that it was in the national interest to quickly resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the President himself (among others) is under criminal
investigation, the grand jury, this Office, the President, the
Congress, and the Nation have a compelling interest that the matter
be resolved quickly and definitively,'' Starr told the justices.
``More months of protracted litigation are inimical to the Nation's
well-being. The facts are needed, and they are needed now.''

SHUTTLE BEGINS LAST MISSION TO OUTPOST OF RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Discovery blasted
through hazy, hot Florida skies on Tuesday on the last American
mission to the Mir space station, a flight eagerly anticipated by
the astronaut Dr. Andrew Thomas, who has spent more than four
months on the Russian outpost and is ready to come home.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle, carrying a crew of five Americans and a Russian,
lifted off at 6:06 p.m. at the beginning of a narrow launching
window and rose on a thunderous plumb of tan smoke to start its
two-day sprint to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the flight's getting off on time arose this weekend
when Mir suffered a computer malfunction and began a slow drift,
which would have prohibited rendezvous and docking by the American
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   But American and Russian space officials said Tuesday that Mir's
crew had replaced the computer and managed to stabilize the craft.
Controllers predicted that the station would be ready to receive
guests when the Discovery arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a mechanical engineer who has been aboard Mir since Jan.
25, is the last of seven Americans who lived and worked on Mir in
the last three years as training for the planned international
space station. Thomas, who has closely followed preparations for
the Discovery's flight and has expressed his readiness to head
home, Tuesday selected items for his first meal upon return to the
Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lasagna would be in order,'' Thomas said. ``Lasagna
and possibly some Oreo ice cream, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is commanded by Col. Charles J. Precourt of the
Air Force, who is making his third trip to Mir, and is piloted by a
space rookie, Cmdr. Dominic L. Gorie of the Navy. The other
Americans in the crew are Cmdr. Wendy B. Lawrence of the Navy, who
is on her third shuttle flight and second trip to Mir; Dr. Franklin
R. Chang-Diaz, a veteran of six shuttle flights; and Dr. Janet Lynn
Kavandi, a chemist making her first flight.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the crew is the Russian astronaut Valery V. Ryumin,
a veteran of three previous flights who has not been in space since
1980. The 59-year-old administrator has been in charge of the
Russian end of the shuttle-Mir program and got the Russian Space
Agency to select him for the last flight of the program, one in
which he is supposed to make a detailed inspection of Mir's
interior.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery's 24th trip into space was the first flight for a
new, lightweight fuel tank designed to increase the cargo capacity
of space shuttles assembling the new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version of the giant, rust-colored fuel tank, which
rides under the belly of the shuttle during the early part of its
flight, is 7,500 pounds lighter than its 65,500-pound predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The new tank, which carries 537,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen to feed the shuttle's three main engines, is made
of a new aluminum-lithium alloy that engineers said was just as
sturdy as the old ones, which were made entirely of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers said the tank, plus other weight-saving
measures, meant that shuttles assembling the new space station over
the next five years would be able to carry more than 15,000 pounds
of additional payload into space than earlier orbiters.
</P>
<P>
   The new station will fly in an orbit similar to Mir's, which is
angled higher in relationship to the Equator than most American
flights. Shuttles need more energy to reach these
higher-inclination orbits, and this has meant carrying less
payload.
</P>
<P>
   The final docking mission to Mir will be the first linkup with
the Russian station for the Discovery. The two craft are to join up
on Thursday 240 miles above Earth and to stay linked for four days.
Shortly after opening the hatches between the spacecraft, Thomas
will bring his belongings aboard the Discovery and join the
American crew.
</P>
<P>
   During the time the spacecraft are docked, the crews will
transfer about 2,600 pounds of Russian supplies and equipment to
Mir, including storage batteries, food, clothing, experimental
equipment and personal items for the Russian crew. In addition,
more than 1,400 pounds of fresh water made by the Discovery's
electricity-producing fuel cells will be loaded into containers and
transferred to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back on the shuttle will be more than a ton of cargo
taken off Mir, including Thomas' personal gear and much of the
scientific equipment used by visiting Americans for more than two
years. Also returning with Discovery will be scientific samples and
data from continuing experiments, including several that will go on
after the Americans depart.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is also carrying the first high-energy physics
experiment to go into space, called the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer, which is designed to look for the missing mass of the
universe.

EXCERPTS OF COURT PAPERS FILED BY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-STARR) 
 (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from court papers filed with
the Supreme Court on Tuesday by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, in response to President Clinton's court motions against
Starr's appeal for an expedited review of privilege claims by the
Supreme Court in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The critical fact justifying this Court's review _ and review
before judgment in the Court of Appeals _ still remains: by
asserting a purported privilege for governmental attorney-client
communications, the President of the United States has directly
challenged the ability of the Federal grand jury to obtain evidence
of possible criminal acts by the President and others. This is,
save for Nixon, without parallel in the history of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Because the President himself (among others) is under criminal
investigation, the grand jury, this office, the President, the
Congress, and the nation have a compelling interest that the matter
be resolved quickly and definitively. More months of protracted
litigation are inimical to the nation's well-being. The facts are
needed, and they are needed now.
</P>
<P>
   This is not our view alone. To the contrary, the President
himself stated in January of this year that the American people are
entitled to more rather than less, sooner rather than later. That
is still true. We will be blunt: the nation has a compelling
interest that this criminal investigation of the President of the
United States conclude as quickly as possible _ that indictments be
brought, possible reports for impeachment proceedings issued, and
nonprosecution decisions announced. This Court's immediate review
would powerfully serve that vital goal.
</P>
<P>
   The President's response treats this as a matter-of-fact
investigation. But the unhappy fact is that, at the determination
of the Attorney General herself, a President is under serious
criminal investigation. That unfortunate circumstance is a rare
occurrence in our nation's history. A President who invokes
governmental privileges that have the effect of thwarting such an
investigation is even rarer. (Only 2 of 42 Presidents have seen fit
to do so.) And issues involving the President that arise during the
course of such an investigation are necessarily vital to the
functioning of the executive branch and to the people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, few issues more directly implicate the rule of
law than a President using, or appearing to use, newly asserted
governmental privileges that serve, at least in part, to protect
the personal interests of the President himself (and his close
associates.) . . . The President argues that, unlike in Nixon,
there are no impeachment proceedings under way. The leadership of
the House of Representatives has indicated that it awaits a report
from this office before it will consider whether to hold
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House has stated that the specter of
such proceedings substantially impacts the orderly administration
of the executive branch. In this regard, the Court may wish to
consider the need submissions presented to the District Court. The
evidence contained therein demonstrates the importance of Mr.
Lindsey's testimony to the investigation and to the weighty
statutory responsibility imposed on this office.

 &HT;    Three students charged after pop-bottle bombs explode at Ohio
school
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco and Joanne Huist Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Three students were charged with a total of 13
delinquency felony counts after they built and detonated three
pop-bottle bombs at the Trotwood-Madison High School in suburban
Dayton, Ohio Monday, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The students, two aged 15 and one 16, remain in Montgomery
County Juvenile Detention Center. Trotwood-Madison School District
Superintendent Samuel C. Brewer said the students have been
suspended and may be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   With school shootings across the country since October _
including those in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., Pearl,
Miss., Jonesboro, Ark., and Edinboro, Pa. _ school officials can't
afford to take chances with students and weapons, Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unfortunate incident,'' Brewer said. ``It was
certainly disturbing. Youngsters need to learn that decisions that
they make can be harmful to themselves or to others.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such case in a southwest Ohio school since
Friday, when police discovered a crude explosive device in a
student's bookbag at Little Miami High School in Morrow, Ohio,
between Dayton and Cincinnati. Police said the teen who made it
showed off his handiwork to friends.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, police said the students had no intent to harm
others. It was more of a ``look what I can do'' scenario, Trotwood
Police Lt. Fred Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Morrow incident,''we and the police believe the
student had no intent to use the device to harm himself, other
students or staff,'' Little Miami School Superintendent Michael
Verelli II said. ``It appears to be a case of when you create
something you want to show it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Miami school staff heard about the homemade bomb after
three students told them the student held a private ``show and
tell'' for a group of students.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured and no property damage was reported in either
case. In Trotwood, the students made the devices by combining
household cleaning products into three plastic soda bottles, then
went outside and threw them. One landed on school grounds, two
others on a nearby lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Jim Borland said the chemicals become unstable
after they are mixed and could have exploded in the students'
hands. The acid formed would have burned them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials heard loud ``pops,'' investigated, then sent
the students to the principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   The three students were shocked when police arrived, Borland
said. ``They didn't realize it was going to be such a big deal,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The students were charged with delinquency by reason of
possessing a dangerous ordnance on school grounds and manufacturing
a dangerous ordnance, Borland said.
</P>
<P>
   The three appeared Tuesday in Montgomery County Juvenile Court,
where Judge Nick Kuntz entered denials of responsibility for each
boy. The Montgomery County Prosector's Office has not decided
whether to ask Kuntz to transfer the boys to adult court, said
spokesman Jim Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Two are in the temporary custody of foster parents through
Montgomery County Children Services, Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley Crime Lab is testing the device found at Little
Miami to determine how dangerous it is, Warren County Prosecutor
Tim Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Morrow student made the device after a friend
called him on a boast that he could make a bomb, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow police took the student into custody Friday. He remains
in the Warren County Juvenile Detention Center, where he will
undergo psychological testing. He was suspended from school and
could be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   In Trotwood, Brewer said he is waiting for a report from the
school principal before deciding whether to expel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes kids just don't think. You see the apologetic look
on their faces after the fact, but by then it's too late,'' said
Verelli, the Little Miami school superintendant.
</P>
<P>
   Educators across the Miami Valley look forward to the end of a
school year marred by violence and threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to pull out all the stops to show kids it's still
safe to go to school,'' said Robert Bixler, principal of Little
Miami High School. ``Our parents know what's going on. When they
call, we invite them to come in walk down the halls and see that
everything is okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer break for Trotwood and Little Miami begins Thursday
afternoon, but school officials are preparing for September
</P>
<P>
   After many school violence incidents around the country, people
later said there were warning signs. Trotwood-Madison
Superintendent Brewer said the district plans to develop a list of
warning signs to help staff determine if a student is headed toward
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents are like a cry for help and attention,''
Brewer said. ``We as a society have to decide if we value our
children more than guns or weapons.''

RODMAN A KEY TO BULLS' CHANCES AGAINST JAZZ  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Dennis Rodman sauntered into the Delta Center
and stood before everyone like a neon sign. No wonder Las Vegas is
such a lure for him. He can hear the dice rolling from the shadows
of the Wasatch Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Vegas being so close, you can't control his appetite for
it,'' Michael Jordan said on Tuesday before the Bulls practiced for
Game 1 of the NBA finals on Wednesday against the Jazz. ``I can't
tell Dennis not to be Dennis. You just have to ask him to be Dennis
on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been Rodman's problem when the court is occupied by
Karl Malone. Rodman has been unable to slip around Malone's shadow
for rebounds, incapable of nudging him outside his range and
hard-pressed to stay out of foul trouble. His ineffectiveness was
obvious during the National Basketball Association's championship
series last year. So Rodman created drama off the court by darting
off to Nevada and by throwing darts at the Mormons. ``I feel like
I'm home,'' Rodman said. ``It's good to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not like last year, when the Bulls had a safety net
for the unfocused Rodman: Brian Williams. He is not there to save
the Bulls this year. He's with the Pistons. It's up to Rodman to
make Malone work for his shots in what has always been a difficult
matchup for the Bulls' jumpy forward. It seems Rodman's usual blend
of elbows and mind blows ricochet off Malone's steel vault-like
frame. It is tough to get under the skin of a man who appears
stuffed with boulders, and harder to sneak inside the head of
player wise enough to ignore you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch some of the things Dennis does to other players,''
Malone said after the Jazz's practice. ``And it seems like a lot of
the young players want to show him how tough they are. I just take
this approach: play the game. I've seen it all. I've heard it all.
I've done half of it. I also realize for us to win a championship,
I can't allow someone to take me out of my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman failed in this attempt to divert Malone's game during
last year's final. Malone simply walked away from Rodman's act,
leaving the spring-filled forward crestfallen with a frustrating
2.3 points and 7.7 rebounds a game. In turn, Malone puffed out his
Popeye chest for 23.8 points and 10.3 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   As little as Rodman accomplished, his disappearance was not
catastrophic. Williams was there in the low post, shadowing Malone
on the fast break and keeping him occupied underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodman will be asked to do the same. The Bulls need him to
limit Malone just enough to keep them from having to send two men
to him, which only opens up the 3-point opportunities for Bryon
Russell and Jeff Hornacek. It is Rodman's chore to protect the
Bulls from an impact that could turn the series in the Jazz's
favor. Malone certainly altered the regular-season outcome for the
Jazz as Utah won both games this season against the Bulls. He
averaged 32.5 points and 9.5 rebounds in two games. Rodman came up
with 2 points and 9 rebounds for the series.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman is not ready to spew credit Malone's way. Instead, he
continued his tirade on officials Tuesday. ``It's hard to guard
Malone,'' Rodman said. ``Just the slightest touch, and you get
called for a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   This was referee bashing, Part II. In the Bulls' series with the
Pacers, Rodman attributed the rebounding success of Antonio Davis
and Dale Davis to the officials, too. After averaging 16 rebounds a
game in the first two rounds of the playoffs, his output fell to an
average of 9.9 against the Pacers in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The more Rodman struggled, the more he pouted. Part of his angst
was over his in-and-out role in the starting lineup. Toni Kukoc was
Coach Phil Jackson's choice to start with a favorable matchup
against the Pacers. This time, with Malone posing such a menacing
presence, Jackson is leaning toward making Rodman his starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Dennis is ready,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``We have to
have him playing at the level that we're used to seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   In case he is not, Jackson could opt to bring Dickey Simpkins
off the bench or slide Pippen over on occasion to face Malone.
Kukoc has little chance of defending Malone. And there is no
Williams to save them. Rodman knows all of this, of course. He
realizes what kind of pressure is on him. Whatever he does in his
spare time, the Bulls will need his full-time attention on Malone
whose ability to block Rodman out with his body and mind has so
often turned the Bulls' neon star into a wallflower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to stop Malone,'' Rodman said. ``I have to limit him to
18 or 20 points a game, and not give him 35. It's time to roll. And
not make excuses.''

THROUGH NUCLEAR CRISIS, PAKISTAN PUBLICIZES KASHMIR STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN KIFNER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan is hoping to turn the crisis over
the South Asian nuclear tests into Western, and particularly U.S.
pressure to wrest the disputed territory of Kashmir from Indian
control, government officials and foreign diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel, after all, Kashmir is the core issue,'' Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain said on Tuesday night, acknowledging the
government intentions. ``Otherwise it would be like staging
`Hamlet' without the Prince of Denmark. It is Kashmir that has been
the cause of war.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an open secret here that the Afghan mujahadeen, veterans
of the struggle that drove out the Soviets, have been operating in
Kashmir under the auspices of Pakistan's shadowy Inter-Service
Intelligence. The agency, which operates outside the military chain
of command, gained enormous power in the 1980s as the conduit for
channeling hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. aid and weapons
to the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   To Indians and Pakistanis, Kashmir is an issue as symbolic,
passionate and intractable as Jerusalem is to Israelis and
Palestinians. And it is Kashmir _ and not the dueling nuclear tests
_ that has become the leitmotif of Pakistani statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government has begun a campaign, sending envoys
abroad and arranging officials' appearances on U.S.television, to
turn the furor over the tests to its advantage in the struggle for
the contested mountains and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Goher Ayub Khan of Pakistan framed the position
when he said on Sunday on a talk show on CNN that ``America can
play a leading role'' by bringing ``Pakistan and India to the table
to solve the Kashmir dispute, from which everything is now
stemming.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for a third day, neither country issued bellicose
statements about the other, suggesting that both are trying to ease
their way back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   But their different approaches to restoring calm pointed up how
intractable the issues are and how difficult any solution will be.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian overtures do not mention Kashmir. Instead, an Indian
communique on Sunday focused on an offer of a ``no-first-strike
pact'' between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Pakistanis the ability to launch a nuclear weapon is
viewed as a vital deterrent, because the military _ half the size
of India's and with increasingly worn and obsolete equipment _
would be quite unlikely to last more than a week, some experts
said, in a conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   Indian troops control two-thirds of the largely Muslim Kashmir
and say they are there to suppress Islamic insurrectionaries whom
Pakistan covertly backs. In 1994 the Indian Parliament by a
unanimous vote asserted that New Delhi's goal was to extend its
rule to all of what it called ``Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With independence in 1947, the 664 princely states that made up
British India were given the choice of which country they wanted to
join, Hindu-dominated India or Muslim Pakistan. Nearly all the
people of Kashmir were Muslim, but its Maharaja was Hindu. When
Pathan tribesmen challenged his rule, he appealed for help to
India, which sent in forces that still occupy a large part of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, Kashmiris, Pathans and others who are fighting under
Islamic banners have stepped up the war in Kashmir, leaving 300,000
dead. With the victory of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party in the Indian election last year, the tensions have sharpened
on both sides. The new government put Kashmir under the Interior
Ministry, meaning not only that it had the status of a regular
province, but that it was also under the administration of Interior
Minister L.K. Advani, a Hindu hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
   After the Indian nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, Advani
increased jitters by announcing a ``pro-active policy'' on the
insurgents, widely interpreted as meaning hot pursuit of rebels
into Pakistani territory. Another Hindu hard-liner, Tourism
Minister Madan Lal Khurma, said India was ready for a fourth war.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, an expert on Pakistan at the University of
Illinois, suggested that there was a ``deeper conflict between the
two states, a conflict that is in part an ideological or
theological one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So even if Kashmir was resolved,'' Cohen said, ``there would
still be conflict. But Kashmir is the greatest symbol. It still
revolves around Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the same breath that Pakistani officials say that
their nuclear tests were necessary to match and deter India's, they
link the arms race to Kashmir.

SMALL BREEDER, SMALL HORSE AND LARGE SHOT AT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The breeder of Real Quiet doesn't think the colt was
an ``ugly duckling,'' as racing people say. And he doesn't agree
that his mother was ``a blue-collar mare.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't deny that Real Quiet was born with crooked legs and
had operations on both knees as a yearling, or that he grew so thin
from lack of exercise that he was nicknamed ``The Fish.'' Or that
he was sold for the giveaway price of $17,000 because it looked as
though he might break down. And he certainly doesn't think his colt
is a ``freak'' who has outraced his pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   So, the breeder, Eduardo Gaviria of Bogota, Colombia, will fly
to New York to join the crowd on Saturday at Belmont Park when his
underprivileged horse tries to win the 130th Belmont Stakes and
sweep the Triple Crown. It is a feat accomplished only 11 times,
the last by Affirmed 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If he does it, Real Quiet will top off his journey from rags to
riches. He has already banked $1.9 million, and he would earn
$600,000 more for a victory in the Belmont plus a $5 million bonus
offered by the Visa corporation for sweeping the Triple Crown,
which comprises the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding shares in Real Quiet are already being offered for
$525,000 each, with an ultimate syndication value of $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I kick myself for selling him so cheaply?'' Gaviria asked
on the telephone the other day from his office in Bogota.
``Absolutely not. I have no regrets. I am so proud of Real Quiet
and what he's achieved. If I had kept him, he wouldn't be where he
is today. The money aspect is not very important at this time. I've
been rewarded far beyond my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody close to Real Quiet has been rewarded beyond their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who was training quarter horses until he switched
to thoroughbreds 11 years ago, thought his big horse this year was
Indian Charlie, who won the Santa Anita Derby. But Real Quiet ran
second there, then outran Indian Charlie in the Kentucky Derby and
took over the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram, the owner of Real Quiet, said: ``My reaction to the
criticisms of Real Quiet? Give me the cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in buying horses with the best pedigrees.
I don't have the money. I get nervous when the price gets over
$100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram had no reason to get nervous when Baffert went to the
huge Keeneland auction in Kentucky in September two years ago.
Other successful race horses have come from humble beginnings:
Cigar and Holy Bull, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Quiet walked into the sales ring on crooked legs. His
sire was Quiet American, who won the NYRA Mile in 1990 at Aqueduct,
and his mare was Really Blue, who raced for two years and earned
just $31,290.
</P>
<P>
   The mare was one of five kept by Gaviria and his wife, Ann, at
Little Hill Farm, their 20-acre farm in Ocala, Fla. They send the
mares to Kentucky to be mated, and usually keep the mare and her
foal in Florida until the foal is old enough to be raced or sold.
</P>
<P>
   They met at the University of Michigan, where Gaviria studied
mechanical engineering. They also own an 85-acre farm outside
Bogota, where Gaviria runs his business in chemicals and industrial
paints.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last quarter-century he has been studying pedigrees
and breeding race horses, and now keeps the official stud book in
Colombia. ``In a way,'' he said, ``I'm a little guy in the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   But he bought Really Blue at Keeneland in 1991 after noticing
that ``she was young and came from an outstanding family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This pedigree,'' he said, ``has produced the winners of the
French and English Derbies, and Majestic Prince, who won the
Kentucky Derby, and Real Quiet, who won this year's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a mating to produce a stakes horse. I wasn't
thinking of the Kentucky Derby. But there were limitations of
money. I couldn't send her to high-quality stallions in Kentucky. I
didn't even know if they would accept her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consulted John Werk in Kentucky, and he gave me 15 or 20
names of stallions to choose from. I chose Quiet American, who is
from the Prospector line. On the bottom line, the mare goes back to
Raise a Native, which I wanted. And that's how she was sent to
Quiet American.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was foaled at Susan Forrester's Glen Ridge Farm, and
a month or so later was sent home to the Gavirias at Little Hill
Farm, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have great conformation,'' Gaviria remembered, ``and
he was thin. So, we sent him to the veterinary center at the
University of Florida, where they implanted screws into both knees
and attached wires in both knees to force them to grow in the right
direction. The operations took place in April two years ago, and he
stayed thin because he was confined to his stall for two months or
more until they took the wires out and he didn't get the chance to
develop his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he wasn't in his best flesh when he went to the auction
that September. My best friends in Ocala advised me to get rid of
him. He might break down. We didn't even set a reserve price, the
price we had to get or we take him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to get $30,000 or $40,000 for him. But Bob
Baffert showed up and took him for $17,000. It was the cheapest
price I ever got for a horse. But I was kind of happy that he went.
I was almost sure he was going to break down. I thought: I'm glad I
didn't keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, who has made a fortune in fast-food franchises, doesn't
know how the story will end. But he shares Gaviria's feeling of
great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will tell us how great he is,'' Pegram said. ``And his
history won't be written for a long time.''

 &HT;    Georgia golfer returns home with game in top form
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Larry Nelson's comfort zone probably hasn't been this
wide since the 1980s, when he won three major championships and
made his third Ryder Cup team. Three days ago in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
the affable man from Marietta, Ga. captured his second wire-to-wire
win on the Senior PGA Tour this year, taking the tournament by five
shots. A day earlier, Nelson built a record-tying 36-hole lead of
eight strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson ran his 1998 winnings to $713,670, for a total of
$1,0267,127 since turning 50 in September. If that's not a wake-up
call to Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan, who thought they had the
copyright on Senior Tour domination, then what is?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really not my thinking,'' a typically modest Nelson
said Tuesday. ``I'm just excited to be playing well. My iron game
seems to be getting better, and that's kind of what's held me back
the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be just the beginning. On Friday at the Golf Club of
Georgia, Nelson plays as a senior in the Atlanta area for the first
time, at the $1.35 million Nationwide Championship. Next week's
BellSouth Senior Classic at Opryland in Nashville, Tenn. is played
on the Springhouse Golf Club course that Nelson designed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing golf courses for the first time, which is the routine
for Nelson in his first full season as a senior, he estimates a
disadvantage of two or three shots. Playing last week on a course
new to everyone, Sewickley Heights Golf Club in Pittsburgh, Nelson
separated himself from the field. To those who have watched Nelson
firsthand the last nine months, his rise is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a (multiple) major winner,'' South African John Bland
said. ``He knows what it's all about. He's got all the shots. He's
a very complete player. You don't have a record like his without
knowing what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's familiarity with the Golf Club of Georgia is limited to
a few corporate outings. He remembers demanding par 3s and
undulating greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite TPC-style, but it's not quite Atlanta Country
Club, either,'' Nelson said. ``I could go out there without a
practice round and pretty much know which way the holes go.''
</P>
<P>
   With 30 percent of his PGA Tour victories in the majors _ two
PGAs and a U.S. Open _ Nelson is using such background material as
handy reference. Last week, Nelson geared back his aggressiveness
and found an immediate reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been kind of an aggressive player,'' he said,
``and it's kind of been feast or famine. On a golf course where you
have to be a little more conservative, like last week, I've played
more like it's a U.S. Open or a PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the approach is working.

STARR URGES SUPREME COURT TO INTERVENE IN SECRET SERVICE DISPUTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to speed up what he calls a ``serious
criminal investigation'' of President Clinton, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to intervene in
his dispute with the administration over testimony from Secret
Service employees.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants the high court to take the case on an emergency
basis and decide it along with his request to force Bruce Lindsey,
the president's most trusted White House adviser, to cooperate in a
federal grand jury investigation into whether Clinton obstructed
justice by urging a cover-up of his sexual misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The request by Starr sets the stage for a constitutional
showdown _ possibly this summer _ over creation of a so-called
``protective function'' privilege to shield the Secret Service from
having to disclose what they see or hear while protecting the
president.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr continued his efforts to accelerate the investigation,
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern at the center of the
sex-and-perjury probe, dumped California lawyer William Ginsburg
and hired two Washington lawyers who have experience with special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, whose tactics had stirred controversy from the
earliest days of the investigation, is turning the case over to
Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, a move that renews Lewinsky's
chances of securing a deal to avoid prosecution in exchange for
testifying before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to claim a special exemption against testifying for
Secret Service agents is uncharted legal territory
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service Director Lewis C. Merletti has asserted that
forcing agents to testify about what they observe of the
president's private life would severely damage the agency's ability
to provide close protection. Clinton and former President Bush
endorse Merletti's position.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed with the Supreme Court, Starr said he ``has
reason to believe that the `privileged' observations that Secret
Service is currently withholding from the grand jury would
constitute important evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson last month
issued two rulings ordering Lindsey, two Secret Service officers
and a Secret Service attorney to testify before Starr's grand jury.
The Clinton administration moved to appeal both decisions, which
prompted Starr to seek expedited review by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In his pleadings seeking to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals and
have the Supreme Court review the case late this month, Starr
argued that this is no ordinary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unhappy fact is that ... a president is under serious
criminal investigation,'' the prosecutor said. ``That unfortunate
circumstance is a rare occurrence in our nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be blunt: The nation has a compelling interest that
this criminal investigation of the president ... conclude as
quickly as possible _ that indictments be brought, possible reports
for impeachment proceedings issued, and non-prosecution decisions
announced,'' Starr wrote. ``This court's immediate review would
powerfully serve that vital goal.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy accused Starr of ``trying to
end-run the rules and leap-frog the legal process.'' He
characterized the briefs filed by Starr as ``an act of public
relations, not a work of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's decision to seek new counsel comes just days after
Ginsburg issued his latest blast at Starr, in an open letter to a
legal journal that implied that his client and the president has a
sexual relationship. Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied such
allegations under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Stein is a former special prosecutor who investigated but did
not file charges against President Reagan's attorney general, Ed
Meese, during a corruption investigation. He also represented
former Sen. Robert Packwood, a Republican who resigned amid charges
of sexual harassment. He worked closely with Starr on that case.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris's clients have included CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames,
President Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell and Fawn Hall, a
secretary who was accused of removing documents related to the
Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is one of two former White House employees who
allegedly had sexual encounters with Clinton. Despite her denials,
Lewinsky reportedly has admitted having sex with the president in
conversations secretly tape recorded by former colleague Linda
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether Lewinsky and Clinton lied. Also
being examined by Starr is whether Clinton, Lindsey or Vernon
Jordan were involved in efforts to convince Tripp to help cover up
an encounter between the president and Kathleen Willey, who alleges
that Clinton kissed and groped her outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to keep Lindsey from having to answer Starr's questions
before a federal grand jury, the White House is arguing that
attorney-client privilege protected him from having to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, an attorney and close personal friend of Clinton's for
the past 30 years, has interviewed witnesses who appeared before
Starr's grand jury and also met with Tripp.

SEN. MCCAIN'S ANTI-SMOKING BILL IMPERILED BY ``MACHO'' AMENDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republic Washington Bureau &QL; 
WASHINGT ON _ Sen. John McCain's anti-smoking bill is in peril
because of ``macho'' amendments senators are pushing to punish the
tobacco industry and score political points, McCain said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of knocking this thing way out of bal ance,
if we haven't already,'' the Arizona Republican said in an
emotional speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, McCain placed the stalled bill's prospects
for passage at ``still better than 50-50. But you know me, I'm an
eternal
</P>
<P>
   optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, McCain said, is that some senators want to toughen
the bill, apparently for political posturing, to penalize
cigarettemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see going on here _ interestingly from both ends of the
political spectr um _ is such punitive amendments that we will
drive the tobacco companies out of business,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers must decide whether to pass his legislation, McCain
said, or whether simply to ``vote for amendments to show how macho
and toug h we are on the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks cast McCain, if only fleetingly, in the unlikely
role of a tobacco industry defender. The tobacco companies have
accused him of trying to orchestrate their demise.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding tha t he is no fan of the cigarettemakers,
McCain has denied that his goal is to tax the industry out of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill is designed to reduce youth smoking through stiff
cigarette price increases and sales and marketing curbs. The measur
e would cost the industry at least $516 billion in tobacco-related
health costs and anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also proposes a ban on outdoor advertising by tobacco
firms, and that may violate free speech, says the American Civil
Liber ties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers hope to shut off debate and proceed to a vote
on the measure by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Senate must consider amendments that are
worrisome to McCain and the bill's other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One amen dment, by Richard Durbin, D-Ill., would toughen the
penalties on tobacco companies if youth smoking-reduction targets
were not met.
</P>
<P>
   The Durbin amendment _ combined with an earlier, passed
amendment eliminating a limit on the industry's legal l iability _
``could be the death knell of the whole bill'' because it exacts
such a great toll, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that if cigarette companies started going under, the
nation would be deprived of billi ons of dollars of tobacco
revenues that could go toward trying to persuade teens not to
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies began closing, McCain said, 40 million adult
Americans would still find ways to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be a Marlboro, or a Camel o r another operating out of
Mexico, El Salvador or whatever, and they would be exporting
cigarettes into the United States, which we would not have nearly
as much control over,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news Tuesday on the tobacco bill
</P>
<P>
   for McCain. The Senate approved his amendment to add $3 billion
in funding for veterans tobacco-related health-care costs. Veterans
groups have been angered at Congress for recently taking away a $17
billion benefit program for former service mem bers who contracted
smoking-related ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the tobacco bill is scheduled to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders said they feared the Republican majority was
losing interest in the bill; as evidence, they cited the Senate's w
illingness to move on to other business Tuesday while the tobacco
measure was still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the message seemed to
be, ``If Democrats behave, we'll probably be able to come back to
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   T he Senate is out of session today (Wednesday) so that members
may attend the funeral in Tempe of the late Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater.  &QL;

BID TO RENAME JUSTICE DEPT. BUILDING DERAILED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite indications that there would be no
opposition, a drive to name the Justice Department headquarters
after Robert F. Kennedy to mark the 30th anniversary of his death
Saturday has been derailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look likely,'' Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for
House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of House members, including 40 Republicans and nearly
every Democrat, have signed letters that support naming the
building. But House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia decided not to
bring the measure up for consideration this week because of
opposition from some House GOP leaders, said lawmakers who back the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich did not tell the supporters who opposes the measure,
but the lawmakers said the speaker is reluctant to anger
conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said Tuesday that the prospects are
dim for quick House passage of the bill memorializing his brother,
a former attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own sense is I don't think it is going to pass at this
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he was unaware of a specific opponent to the bill,
but said the partisan atmosphere in the House makes it difficult to
honor his late brother. The Senate is waiting for a House vote
before acting on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Elmendorf, the chief of staff to House Democratic leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said Gephardt is committed to getting
the measure passed this year and will continue trying to get the
bill to the floor this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure is not brought up this week, Gephardt would
consider filing a so-called discharge petition to circumvent House
leaders and force a vote, said Elmendorf.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to name the Justice Department building could be
considered by the House at any time this year, but supporters were
pushing to get it approved by the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Armey had assured supporters of the bill months ago
that they would not block it if a majority of House members
supported the measure. Two other House leaders _ Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas and Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner of
Ohio _ signed the letter of support last month.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy named his brother and campaign
manager, Robert Francis Kennedy, attorney general in 1961. RFK held
the position until 1964, when he resigned to make a successful run
for the Senate from New York. He was a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for president in 1968 when he was shot by Sirhan Sirhan
on June 5, the night he won the California primary. He died the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department building at 10th Street and Constitution
Avenue has never been named. The FBI building across the street is
named for longtime FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was Kennedy's
nemesis for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Congress renamed Washington National Airport
after former President Reagan. And when the House returns to work
today after the Memorial Day recess, it will consider six
noncontroversial bills, including four to name post offices.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dorothy Stickney, who created the role of the mother
in ``Life with Father'' and also appeared in many other Broadway
hits during a career that spanned more than 50 years, died on
Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life with Father,'' by Howard Lindsay (Miss Stickney's
husband) and Russel Crouse, opened at the original Empire Theater
on Nov. 8, 1939. When it closed after seven years and 3,224
performances, it was _ and it still is today _ the longest running
nonmusical show in Broadway history.
</P>

   The Lindsays, who were among the most celebrated acting couples
in the United States, played the leading roles of Clarence and
Vinnie Day for five years. Based on Clarence Day's reminiscences
about his youth in New York in the 1880s, the play told the story
of a large family, led by a frequently exasperated father tempered
by his charming wife who put up with all his crotchets.
</P>
<P>
   The play was turned down by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne and
many other stars. Finally it was tried out in summer stock at the
Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan, Maine, with Lindsay and Miss
Stickney thrust into the leading roles. As Miss Stickney said: ``We
weren't at all sure we were good enough for the parts. We had never
originally intended to play them ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Success in summer stock eventually led to Broadway, and opening
night was filled with minor disasters. In the first scene the
actress playing the maid accidentally dropped a tray of dishes,
and, later, several actors forgot their lines. As Miss Stickney
remembered, she and her husband went home and cried: ``Little did
we realize that the play would last through World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay attributed the phenomenal success to the fact that the
play was not just a comedy but also had a tender, familial side:
``People who see `Life with Father' are emotionally moved as well
as amused. They see so much of themselves in the characters on the
stage. Booth Tarkington summed it up well when he said the play is
in reality `promptings to memory.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the play _ and of its tenderness _ was Miss
Stickney's performance as the wise and patient mother, Vinnie, who
was understanding without being overly sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that
her portrait was ``brilliant acting, both sweet and witty, with a
supple response to the storminess of her domestic economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lindsays returned to their roles in 1947 _ when the play set
a record of 3,183 performances _ staying in the cast for several
weeks. The following year, they played the Days again, in the
sequel, ``Life with Mother,'' and that play ran for a year. When
the Empire Theater (where both plays first opened) was demolished,
the couple salvaged two red plush orchestra seats and placed them
in their elegant East Side town house.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Stickney was born in Dickinson, N.D. Her father, Victor
Hugo Stickney, a doctor who made calls on horseback, was one of the
first 10 members elected to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.
Stage-struck from an early age, she studied at the North Western
Dramatic School in Minneapolis, sang and danced as one of the four
``Southern Belles'' in vaudeville, and acted with various stock
companies.
</P>
<P>
   When she came to New York in the 1920s, she was turned down for
so many roles that she wrote a poem about the experience. The poem,
called ``You're Not the Type,'' was published in Liberty magazine
and was the beginning of her sideline literary career.
</P>
<P>
   For two summers, she was the featured ingenue in summer stock at
the Lakewood Theater, then returned to New York to look for work.
In New York, she met Lindsay, who was writing vaudeville sketches.
When he was hired to direct the next summer at Lakewood, he was
told he could choose his own company, except for the ingenue, a
role reserved for the popular Miss Stickney. They were married in
1927.
</P>
<P>
   After making her Broadway debut in 1926 in a small role in ``The
Squall,'' she soon became known for playing eccentric characters
and was in one hit after another. She was Liz, a mad scrub woman,
in ``Chicago,'' the first Broadway show directed by George Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Front Page,'' she created the role of Mollie Molloy,
the woman who jumps out an open courthouse window. That was
followed by George Kelly's ``Philip Goes Forth,'' Rose Franken's
``Another Language'' (her first important role), Paul Osborn's ``On
Borrowed Time'' and many other plays. She was a character actress
who had become a star.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as playwright and director, her husband was
himself enjoying halcyon days. He and Crouse had collaborated on
the book for ``Anything Goes'' and other musicals, before they
began writing their adaptation of the Clarence Day stories.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Life with Father,'' Miss Stickney was in, among other
plays, ``The Small Hours,'' ``To Be Continued,'' ``Kind Sir'' and
``The Honeys.'' Her films included ``The Little Minister'' and ``I
Never Sang for My Father.'' On television she played a bootlegger
in the first episode of ``The Waltons.''
</P>
<P>
   As an admirer of Edna St. Vincent Millay, she wrote ``A Lovely
Light,'' a one-woman play based on Millay's poetry and letters. As
with ``Life with Father,'' she tried it out in summer stock before
bringing it to Broadway in 1960, in a production directed by her
husband. The actress toured the show at colleges and universities
and later brought it back to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, she did a revival of ``Life with Father'' at City
Center, with Leon Ames as co-star.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1968. No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Miss Stickney returned to the stage and made her
Broadway musical debut in ``Pippin,'' taking over the role of
Berthe after the death of Irene Ryan. She sang one song, ``No Time
at All.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, she had been in several musicals on television. She
and her husband played the king and queen in Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Cinderella'' in 1957, and in 1968 she appeared in
Stephen Sondheim's ``Evening Primrose.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 1979 memoir, ``Openings and Closings,'' Miss Stickney,
who seemed to be the most quietly confident actress onstage, wrote
about her lifelong battle with stage fright. She said that she had
learned one lesson: ``When panic overtook me and I felt absolutely
unable to go on, I would tell myself, `You don't have to do the
whole play _ you don't even have to play the next scene _ all you
have to do is say the next line.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although she never fully conquered that fear, she was always
able to say the next line and the next line, and in so doing found
a lifetime of accomplishment in the theater.

SEN. MCCAIN'S ANTI-SMOKING BILL IMPERILED BY ``MACHO'' AMENDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Resending to change slug from MCCAIN to TOBACCO)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Repu blic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republic Washington Bureau &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's anti-smoking bill is in peril
because of ``macho'' amendments senators are pushing to punish the
tobacco industry and score political points, McCain said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   `` We are in danger of knocking this thing way out of balance,
if we haven't already,'' the Arizona Republican said in an
emotional speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, McCain placed the stalled bill's prospects
for passage at ``st ill better than 50-50. But you know me, I'm an
eternal optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, McCain said, is that some senators want to toughen
the bill, apparently for political posturing, to penalize
cigarettemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see going on here _ interestingly from both ends of the
political spectrum _ is such punitive amendments that we will drive
the tobacco companies out of business,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers must decide whether to pass his legislation, McCain
said, or whether simp ly to ``vote for amendments to show how macho
and tough we are on the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks cast McCain, if only fleetingly, in the unlikely
role of a tobacco industry defender. The tobacco companies have
accused him of trying to
orchestrate their demise.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that he is no fan of the cigarettemakers, McCain
has denied that his goal is to tax the industry out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill is designed to reduce youth smoking through stiff
cigarette pri ce increases and sales and marketing curbs. The
measure would cost the industry at least $516 billion in
tobacco-related health costs and anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also proposes a ban on outdoor advertising by tobacco
firms, and that may violate free speech, says the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers hope to shut off debate and proceed to a vote
on the measure by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Senate must consider amendments that are
worrisome to Mc Cain and the bill's other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment, by Richard Durbin, D-Ill., would toughen the
penalties on tobacco companies if youth smoking-reduction targets
were not met.
</P>
<P>
   The Durbin amendment _ combined with an earlier, passed ame
ndment eliminating a limit on the industry's legal liability _
``could be the death knell of the whole bill'' because it exacts
such a great toll, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that if cigarette companies starte d going under,
the nation would be deprived of billions of dollars of tobacco
revenues that could go toward trying to persuade teens not to
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies began closing, McCain said, 40 million adult
Americans would still find ways to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be a Marlboro, or a Camel or another operating out of
Mexico, El Salvador or whatever, and they would be exporting
cigarettes into the United States, which we would not have nearly
as much control over,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news Tuesday on the tobacco bill for McCain.
The Senate approved his amendment to add $3 billion in funding for
veterans tobacco-related health-care costs. Veterans groups have
been angered at Congress for recently taking away a $17 billion
benefit program for former service members who contracted
smoking-related ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the tobacco bill is scheduled to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders said they feared the Republican majority was
losing intere st in the bill; as evidence, they cited the Senate's
willingness to move on to other business Tuesday while the tobacco
measure was still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the message seemed to
be, ``If Democrats behave, we'll
</P>
<P>
   probably be able to come back to tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is out of session today (Wednesday) so that members
may attend the funeral in Tempe of the late Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater.  &QL;

BOY WITH HEART CONDITION DIES AFTER CLIMBING STAIRS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx teen-ager with a heart condition died in the
hallway of his school on Tuesday morning after running up five
flights of stairs to a class, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Matthew Bandoo, 15, climbed the stairs at Harry S.
Truman High School in Co-op City after attempting to console a girl
who said she was worried that some students were going to beat up a
friend of hers, school officials and family members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the child did not go to his third-period
class, which was physical education,'' said Karen Crowe, a
spokesman for the Board of Education. ``Instead, he went into an
unoccupied office on the second floor, then went up the stairs
after helping his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew's mother, Pamela Bandoo, added that her son was hoping
to warn the friend of the girl he had been consoling of approaching
danger. ``He was on his way to tell her to be careful, that someone
was going to jump her,'' she said. ``But he didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandoo was running up the stairs with another student while on
his way to a 10:30 a.m. class and began to complain of chest pain
after reaching the seventh-floor hallway, Ms. Crowe said. He
collapsed after a few steps. A teacher who was nearby ran over and
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the youth while another
teacher dialed 911, Ms. Crowe said. Bandoo was pronounced dead 45
minutes later at Jacobi Medical Center, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bandoo said that her son had heart surgery to repair a
congenital defect when he was 5, but officials said that he had no
restrictions on his record indicating that he could not participate
in physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crowe said because of this Bandoo was not eligible to
receive a pass to ride on the school's four elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bandoo said that while her son knew that he had to monitor
his condition, he had maintained an active life since his surgery,
playing basketball with his school friends and nursing a dream of
someday being a Knick. ``He loved basketball and wanted to be like
them, to play on the team.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bandoo said her husband died of cancer five years ago and
that Matthew was the rock that had settled her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk about his father's death, kept it all inside,
but I used to tell him all my problems,'' she said, describing how
her son was lining up summer jobs to help out with the family's
finances. ``I always looked forward to coming home, sitting and
talking together. But that part is gone now, a part of me is
gone.''

COMMENTARY: SEMANTIC ANTICS, TRANSLATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Gore recently offered me a chance to
repent. He sent me a Forgiveness Coupon. (He really did.)
</P>
<P>
   The postcard-sized coupon reads: ``The Vice President of the
United States Hereby Issues this Forgiveness Coupon to Maureen
Dowd. We learn from Our Mistakes. It is easier to get forgiveness
than permission.'' It was signed ``Al Gore.'' (Really.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore introduced Forgiveness Coupons into government to encourage
employees to take risks. If they make a mistake, they can submit a
coupon to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was offering me the chance to win absolution, should I
write a column that irritates him.
</P>
<P>
   While I was delighted to see a flash of Gore's old
mischievousness, I did begin to fret that he was Reinventing
Government in some flaky, huggy New Age way.
</P>
<P>
   But my faith in him was restored on Monday when he announced
that the White House had sent out a directive urging bureaucrats to
drop their long-winded, jargon-ridden humbug and use ``plain
language'' when writing forms, letters, memos and rules. Or, as
Orwell wrote, use English to reveal rather than conceal.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop at federal agencies? Why not apply this new
common-sense standard to the semantic dodges of the White House
itself?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Controlling Legal Authority, that is where the government
really needs to speak to the American people in unvarnished
English. So let us, as Gore asks, translate some scandalese into
plain talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will undoubtedly be folks out there who will suggest,
`Oh, oh, this must be some great scheme to delay.' ... That's just
nonsense.'' _ White House Counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Delay rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lindsey told the grand jury ``that he had no information
that anyone had committed perjury or obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Bug off. I'm never telling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service asserted a new ``protective function
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``We've seen some truly amazing stuff. And we need
to stay in close. Wouldn't you like to know how the president
really got that cut on his forehead?''
</P>
<P>
   William Ginsburg justified writing that Kenneth Starr ``may have
succeeded in unmasking a sexual relationship between two consenting
adults'' by saying he was just being sarcastic.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Sure they did it. Sure I'm an incompetent nitwit.
That's why Monica dumped me.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that the decision to drop
executive-privilege claims for Bruce Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal,
while asserting attorney-client privilege for Lindsey, was ``based
on the law and based on principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``We'll sacrifice Sidney. He doesn't know much. And
he doesn't know when to stop. Anyway, he's Hillary's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the concern I've heard the president and Ruff raise
with respect to this matter is an institutional concern that
relates to this president and future presidents,'' said Mike
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``We'll do anything to save our own skins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is of high moment,'' said Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``I'm a crazy, obsessed person who messed up this
whole case by not getting Lewinsky's testimony when I had the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the advantages of this project outweigh this
risk, and that we can effectively rebut criticism of the waiver,''
Sandy Berger wrote to the president in a memo urging Clinton to
give the go-ahead to Loral, headed by the Democrats' top donor,
despite the fact that the company was under Justice Department
investigation for giving the Chinese militarily useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Don't worry. We've got cover. Take the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As with Nixon. ... This litigation involves fundamental
constitutional issues arising out of the doctrine of separation of
powers.'' _ Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: (A frothing sound.)
</P>
<P>
   McCurry told reporters their questions on executive privilege
were a distraction as the president was ``focusing on a very real
question of the balance of forces on the Indian subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Hallelujah! Maybe the prospect of thermonuclear
war will get their minds off Monica!''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made repeated promises to cooperate with the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Kiss my grits.''

KIN EARNED RICHES, SAYS NEW LEADER OF INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also INDONESIA-HABIBIE, INDONESIA-WORLD-BANK)  
 (JT)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost immediately after becoming president of Indonesia, B.J.
Habibie pledged to create ``a clean government, free from
corruption, collusion, and nepotism.'' But one of the biggest
threats to his rule may be growing concern that he and his family,
following the model of former President Suharto, used public office
to amass a private fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two weeks since he replaced Suharto, Indonesian
economists and political activists have begun to document the
sprawling business holdings of Habibie's children and close
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Habibie family does not have anything approaching the wealth
of the Suharto clan. But Indonesian analysts say its worth might
reach $80 million. That, however, does not factor in the
wealth-destroying effects of the country's economic crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that in this respect he is an A student of
Suharto,'' says Rizal Ramli, an Indonesian economist who has
collected data on the business holdings of top government
officials. ``We no longer have Suharto but we still have
cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday with The New York Times, Habibie
defended his own wealth and that of his family members, saying
nepotism had not played a part in their apparent success. He
acknowledged that some of his relatives have grown rich, but said
they did so because of their strong education and work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his brothers, sisters and children do business with
government agencies, Habibie said. But he insisted that they do not
get special treatment. And he appeared to reject calls to force his
family to give up government contracts or dissolve business
partnerships that have come under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people become rich if you work hard and you are
educated,'' Habibie said. ``And now they have to stop because I am
the president for two weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   In his long political career, Habibie supervised some of
Indonesia's highest-profile development projects. His purview
included the state aircraft maker, a natural gas project, the Batam
island development zone, and the state technology agency.
</P>
<P>
   Potential conflicts of interest between the offices Habibie has
held and his family's holdings are not hard to spot. Habibie's two
sons have business ties to the aircraft company, while one has
contracts connected with the natural gas project. Two of Habibie's
brothers and a brother-in-law have close ties to Batam island
development project. His sister plays a key role in the state
technology agency, while her husband has worked as a contractor
there, according to officials at each company.
</P>
<P>
   The best known Habibie-linked company is controlled by his
youngest brother, Timmy. Timsco Holdings has several score
subsidiaries operating in many different businesses, some of them
dependent on government contracts or licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Several Indonesian economists compare Timmy Habibie's operating
style to that of Bambang Trihadmodjo, Suharto's middle son, which
is characterized more by personal contacts than any particular
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's long involvement in the Batam island project has
raised the most conspicuous conflicts. Though Suharto appointed
Habibie to supervise the conversion of Batam, located near
Singapore, into a manufacturing center and export zone, Habibie has
governed it like a personal fiefdom, says investors and employees
on Batam who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie long worked hand-in-hand with his brother-in-law,
Sudarsono Darmosuwito, now retired, the zone's chief executive.
When Habibie took the office of vice president earlier this year,
he appointed a younger brother, Effendi (Fanny) Habibie, to succeed
him as chairman of the Batam Island Development Authority, the
island's main governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny Habibie told Indonesian reporters last month that he will
step down from the chairmanship. But that only begins to address
the Habibie family interests there. Sudarsono, for example,
controls two companies that have benefited from exclusive Batam

HITCHCOCK RECALLS SELF-DESTRUCTION AND WHAT BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE
DARKNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPPELL, Texas _ On an early summer afternoon, Ken Hitchcock
sits placidly at his home on the patio overlooking the sparkling
pool and the small neighborhood lake beyond, and once again feels
the chill bumps crawl up his spine.
</P>
<P>
   He is sipping iced tea and talking about the worst day of his
life _ the day he began to understand that his world was about to
spin out of control _ and he can still see his dying father's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They are seared into his worst nightmares, feverish,
black-rimmed, sightless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes of death,'' he calls them.
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand the man who leads the Stars, start there, in
a hospital room 32 years ago, and follow that 14-year-old boy's
attempt to overcome the demons that began eating at him that day.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly something of a chameleon _ it's his salesman
background _ the Stars' coach is many things to many people.
</P>
<P>
   To fans, he is the lovable, teddy-bear-like coach of the NHL's
best regular-season hockey team that's playing in the Western
Conference finals, the Captain Kangaroo look-alike who always
stands with his arms crossed behind the Stars' bench, wearing his
lucky suit with the dark shirt and red tie.
</P>
<P>
   To his players, he is equal parts Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi,
a master defensive strategist and an in-your-face taskmaster who
demands everything his players have to give, then asks for more.
</P>
<P>
   To team president Jim Lites and general manager Bob Gainey, the
men who hired him and entrusted their team, he is the workaholic
coach.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy now to forget that this is a man who never really
wanted to be an NHL coach; to forget that this was a boy who was
once the best youth hockey player in Edmonton, Alberta, a western
Canadian town full of promising young players; that he was a
scratch golfer and yet grew up to be a man who once weighed almost
500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions are the stuff of a psychologist's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to know, however, the difficulty of a man's walk
through life until you've strapped on his skates, or slipped into
the size 50-something pants he once wore, or taken a bus ride to
the hospital to find a father who would never be coming home again.
</P>
<P>
   It starts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never called it cancer,'' Hitchcock remembers.
</P>
<P>
   He was 12 1/2, the eldest of Ray and Janet Hitchcock's three
children, when he learned that the father he worshiped had
something wrong with his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always this growth, this tumor, was the way it was
described to me,'' Hitchcock remembers. ``There was not one day
that went by that I didn't think my dad was going to come home and
be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were periods of time when he did come home. I
remember taking the door off my bedroom to put between his mattress
and the box springs to help his back.''
</P>
<P>
   But one day Ray wasn't coming home anymore and the son who had
followed his father to the hockey rink he had managed for as long
as he could remember, who had carefully listened as his dad taught
him the intricacies of the golf swing, couldn't wait any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last six weeks before he died they wouldn't let me see
him,'' Hitchcock says. ``I was really upset about that, but I
didn't let anyone know it, I hid it really good. I decided on my
own that I knew how to get to the hospital. You had to take three
buses to get there, but I knew how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that bus and I walked into his room in the hospital.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the boy thought he might find, whatever his fears, the
reality was much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was hanging from a sling, or a hammock, eight feet
up in the air in his room,'' Hitchcock says. ``He looked at me with
these eyes that had death in them. He never knew who I was, never
even knew I was standing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left that hospital, but to this day I can't tell you how I
got home. I just don't remember. I never told anyone about that day
until I told my mom years later, and I don't even know why I told
her then.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months after that, I would wake up with those eyes staring
at me. He was hung up there and he turned his head and I saw those
eyes and it was like a skeleton, and I knew what hell was like.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Ray Hitchcock died. Sometime during those five
days the boy who had been Ken Hitchcock disappeared, never to
return. What was left was a mass of pain, anger and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any letup for the Hitchcock family. At 15, Ken's
girlfriend was hit by a car and killed after they had had a
quarrel. He had gotten off the bus one stop before she did.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, cancer also took his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family just blew up,'' Hitchcock says. Younger brother
Keith and younger sister Barb went separate directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we were this tight-knit family, and it just went
`Poof!'... I needed to be responsible to somebody, and there was
nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock doesn't remember consciously deciding to kill himself
after his father died, though he can look back now and see that he
was on a path of self-destruction. Mostly, he just quit caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really bitter,'' he says. ``Like a lot of kids, my dad
was my best friend. He meant everything to me. He took me
everywhere, any place I wanted to go, anything I wanted to do. We
had bonded and had a very tight, personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day he was gone and all that changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's sister, Barb Marshall, now a computer consultant in
Vancouver, British Columbia, remembers how angry her brother was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see him saying to himself, `Why did this happen to
us?' It had a real impact on our whole family, naturally,'' she
says, ``but without question I think Ken was the one who suffered
the most by my dad's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends did the best they could to help, ferrying the
children to their sporting events, but it was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me angry afterward was when I'd go to a baseball
game and there would be 11 players with 11 dads and me,'' Hitchcock
says. ``It always seemed to be everybody else and me.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's illness and subsequent death triggered an emotional
response in Hitchcock that needed an outlet, a release, but there
was none to be had. A big youngster anyway, he began to put on
weight at an alarming rate. The boy who had been the best player on
his team at 14, an elite athlete who had skated with boys two years
older in Midget Hockey and led his league in scoring, couldn't even
make the team as a defenseman two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see pictures of myself back then, I looked like all the
other 12-year-old kids,'' he says. ``But when my mom started to
work and I was out on my own, I really started gaining weight. I
was eating 5,000-6,000 calories a day; a lot of fried foods and a
lot of late-night meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, the woman Ken married a year ago in June, sees photos of
him then, eating his way to 478 pounds _ he's around 240 now _ and
she almost cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at those pictures, I see someone who was in great
pain,'' she says, ``someone who was trying to hurt himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he handed himself a death sentence. A lot of people
who suffer terror and trauma like that resort to something in
excess. For some people it's drinking, for some people it's drugs.
For him it was food and solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   There were friends and even surrogate families, like Wilf Brooks
and his wife, Shirley, who still own United Cycle, the sporting
goods store in Edmonton where Ken worked for nine years before
leaving to coach hockey full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Ken the family guy, who had no problem bridging three
generations in my family,'' Wilf Brooks recalls. ``He had the
ability to communicate with a variety of people on their level.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was Ken, the hockey guy. That's the guy who puts
absolutely nothing in front of himself and his game of hockey. He
had two loves when he worked with us: working at United Cycle and
coaching hockey. The hockey Ken would block out everything else and
focus on getting that hockey situation settled. Any team that gets
Ken, on any level, gets all of him.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends knew the pain inside Ken Hitchcock, but he had built
a wall and no one was allowed inside it. So they tried to help him
with his increasing weight problem.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Brooks fixed him healthy lunches when he worked at
United Cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Gale, now the director of Canada's Forest Service in
Ottawa, and his family all but adopted Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife had a big wooden spoon she kept handy,'' Gale says.
``He's probably still got bruises on his hand from reaching into
the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, `Take a walk down Jasper Avenue and see how many
people your size you see. You won't see any of them because the
rest are dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock thought as long as he could sell sporting goods,
as long as he could coach hockey, as long as he didn't have to look
in a mirror and could block out the insults he'd hear walking down
the street, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I lived like I didn't care whether I lived or died,''
he remembers. ``I lived very hard. I drove fast, I drove
recklessly. I was careless. I thought at times I was invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did it with an attitude that my only focus was on today.
I never thought about tomorrow. I never spent one minute thinking
about the future. I never cared.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hockey that ultimately saved Ken Hitchcock. The game he
loved found a way to pay him back for his devotion.
</P>
<P>
   It started in Kamloops, British Columbia, where he was coaching
juniors. Hitchcock was enormously successful with the Blazers,
winning the West Division five times in six years and twice being
selected Western Hockey League coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Needing funds for a new arena, someone came up with the idea of
spurring contributions by tying them into a promotion that would
include a Hitchcock diet. The more pounds he lost, the more money
fans would pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would follow him around in the grocery store to make
sure he bought the right stuff,'' Gale recalls. ``If he bought a
dozen doughnuts, everyone in town knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock went along with the promotion more out of community
spirit than any passion about losing the weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally went on the diet more to get people off my butt than
anything else,'' he says with a shrug. ``It was like, `Well, OK,
I'll give it a go.' I played the game with everybody. `Yeah, yeah,
yeah.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I started losing this weight and all the competitive
fires that I'd had when I was younger, they just started taking
over. All of a sudden, exercise became enjoyable. All of a sudden
having people say good things about how I looked became enjoyable.
I learned a lot about myself as a competitor, and that's what
really turned it around for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the saving of Ken Hitchcock came when he met
Nancy, a TV producer in Kalamazoo, Mich., during a Toys-for-Tots
campaign three years ago. They were married last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was generous, kind, positive,'' she says. ``He can turn the
bad things around quickly and show me how there's an opportunity in
everything. He's generous of spirit, with me, the children (Emily,
Alex and Noah), everybody he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   She also quickly discerned the demons that still haunted
Hitchcock's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really helped me deal with those problems, to talk them
out, to deal with them and to put them emotionally where they
belong and to not put this wall up all the time,'' Hitchcock says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when you're thinking about sharing your life
with someone,'' Nancy says. ``You're looking at the realities of
coexistence. There were just things he hadn't thought about, things
he should have been working on all along but didn't really have to
because the strength of his personality and his coaching kind of
carried him through; things like the weight issue and permanent
relationships and family.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any good partnership, Ken and Nancy have learned to rely
on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of at opposite ends,'' Ken says, laughing. ``In my
personal life I'd been kind of this sloppy, Oscar Madison-''Odd
Couple'' type of person, where nothing is exact or focused. I'm
into coaching and the details of that, but everything else is kind
of fly-by-night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy is a very organized, efficient person, and we have a
good mix.''
</P>
<P>
   From having no family at all _ though he and Barb and Keith
visit and talk often now _ Hitchcock finds it both delightful and
perplexing to be at the center of a family of five again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't have down days, and they don't really care if
you've had a down day,'' he says. ``They want to see you, and they
want to see you at your positive best. That's been really good for
me because it's made me take stock of, not just of the importance
of coaching, but also the fact that you're a better person and a
better coach if you learn to shelve it, put it on the back burner,
deal with it tomorrow, and don't carry it with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways Ken Hitchcock has come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster he wanted nothing so much as to be a coach and a
teacher, like his father was, and he has reached the pinnacle of
his profession. He wanted a loving, closely knit family, and Nancy
and the children have provided that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have some skeletons and I don't know how long it'll be
before they go away,'' he says. ``Maybe they never will. But a lot
of them have left the closet now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is peace in understanding, finally, that he has put the
worst day in his life behind him now, and that the best is still
ahead.

ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN MCCAIN EMULATED GOLDWATER'S QUALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People wonder a lot who Sen. Joh n McCain is these
days.
</P>
<P>
   His musings about running for the presidency have created a
virtual cottage industry of journalists atempting to look into the
Arizona Republican's soul.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits might be advised to look at McCain's desk. I t once
belonged to the late Barry Goldwater. The desk, like Goldwater, is
in the old style.
</P>
<P>
   It was bequeathed to McCain, and when he sits at it, he says,
it's hard not to think of its former owner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is to address
</P>
<P>
   mourners at Goldwater's funeral today, says he often recalls the
Arizona icon's candor and adherence to principles. And McCain, who
is not ashamed of adopting heroes and role models, said he tries to
emulate those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a
</P>
<P>
   rare combination of one who adhered to his ideology, but yet
also achieved legislative results,'' McCain said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, who died Friday, is credited as a champion of
national conservatism. But he also created a prototyp e for future
Arizona Republican senators such as McCain.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy for his successors might be to be outspoken, adopt
national concerns, but above all never forget who elected you.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who says he will consider running f or president in
2000, learned the lesson. He has adopted the Grand Canyon and
American Indians as primary issues _ in addition to loftier matters
such as telecommunications and national defense.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he can't credit Goldwater
</P>
<P>
   for one trait the two shared: a penchant for salty, off-the-cuff
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Goldwater for that failing,'' McCain said,
laughing. ``I think part of that is my own homegrown intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends often said of Gol dwater, and later of McCain, that he
seemed genuine because he didn't adopt the politician's trick of
tailoring his message to suit a particular audience.
</P>
<P>
   But his candor sometimes got Goldwater in trouble. So, too, for
McCain, who once got criticized for jokingly referring to Leisure
World as ``Seizure World.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater really was a loose gun at times. Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., who also will address mourners today, recalled how
Goldwater's former office had some some su spicious dents in it.
``Barry had an air pistol at his desk, and he took pot shots at the
brass plate and door knob,'' Kyl said. The partially patched holes
are visible today.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he actually has two other Arizona role models bes
ides Goldwater. They are former Rep. Mo Udall, D-Ariz., and John
Rhodes, the former U.S. House Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits have speculated that part of McCain's appeal is his
willingness to admit to imperfections, and to the need to seek
</P>
<P>
   out guides. McCain is happy to enunciate what he acquired from
each of his mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Goldwater, obviously, it would be stand up for what you
believe in. From Rhodes, it's the importance of working together
with your colleagues on
</P>
<P>
   both sides of the aisle. From Udall: environmental, Native
Americans and humor,'' McCain said.

$7.3 BILLION DEAL TO COMBINE 2 TELECOM GEAR COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (Editors: This is an added starter on the NYT business dress page) 
(bl) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Combining two fast-growing telecommunications equipment
companies, Tellabs Inc. has agreed to acquire Ciena Corp. for $7.3
billion in stock, people close to the deal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is expected to be announced Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The deal illustrates that the forces driving consolidation in
telecommunications are affecting makers of arcane equipment as well
as the companies that actually sell services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Tellabs and Ciena have been looking to bulk up to
compete against much larger rivals, including Lucent Technologies,
Northern Telecom of Canada and Siemens of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when telecommunications carriers are engaged in
wars of technological superiority, telecommunications equipment
providers have come to resemble arms dealers. Even smaller
companies like Tellabs and Ciena can generate tremendous growth
from specialized technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs makes equipment that allows circuits to communicate with
one another without being soldered together. Tellabs, which was
founded in the mid-1970s, had grown to $1.2 billion in revenue last
year from $494.2 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena has been one of the most closely watched networking
companies in recent years. Ciena helped develop and popularize a
technology that allows long-distance carriers to increase the
capacity of their networks by 16 times or more without putting new
cables underground.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena had sales of $373.8 million last year. The company has
come under pressure from Lucent, which turned the muscle of its
Bell Labs operation to the task of beating Ciena's systems.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs, which makes many of its sales to the regional Bell
companies, may have wanted to acquire Ciena with the thought that
the Bells may soon win entry into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Ciena's shareholders will receive
one share of Tellabs stock for each of their shares of Ciena.
Tellabs' shares closed at $65.875, up $0.0625, in Nasdaq trading,
while Ciena's shares closed at $57.5625. While that does not appear
to be a huge premium for Ciena's stockowners, Ciena's stock rose by
$6.1875 on takeover speculation Tuesday and is up from a low of
$37.25 this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is a possibility, said a person not involved in the deal,
that Cisco Systems Inc. could make a play for Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, it is expected that Ciena
shareholders will own about 35 percent of the company, which will
be located in Lisle, Ill., and keep the Tellabs name, a person
close to the talks said. Michael Birck will remain chief executive
of the company and Ciena chief executive Patrick Nettles will be
named president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs will have eight seats on the board. Ciena will have four
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Both boards were expected to have approved the merger Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in the
discussions. Tellabs was represented by Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.

CHILDREN GRILL SURGEON GENERAL ABOUT SMOKING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's 14 years old, in the eighth grade, and he says
he smoked for two years. He quit recently, and now, he says, he
wants to help other teenagers do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia pupil, Omar Bugg-Bey, got right to the
point when he interviewed Surgeon General David Satcher Tuesday.
``Since cigarettes are still being sold illegally to children, what
needs to be done to stop this and help keep children from
smoking?'' Bugg-Bey asked.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher is used to being grilled about tobacco regulation, but
usually the questions come from reporters, politicians, or
lobbyists. However, Bugg-Bey and other students ages 9 to 14 had
Satcher in the hot seat to ask about tobacco concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 students from three local public schools were in the
American Cancer Society's smoking-prevention program. They asked
articulate questions, and like Bugg-Bey, they did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why has Congress not passed the tobacco-regulation bill, and
what are you going to do about it?'' asked Aaron Stroman, 13, a
sixth grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you fight to have no tobacco, cigarettes, or cigars
so nobody dies from it or gets sick from it?'' Danielle Falardeau,
9, wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kids really ask tough questions,'' Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general assured Stroman that he wants the
tobacco-regulation bill passed, too. ``I'm doing my best to help
people understand that this bill is important, because it will let
the Food and Drug Administration have much more authority to
regulate the tobacco industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate continues to debate a tobacco bill, the sponsor,
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he might try to
limit debate and bring the issue to a vote next week. The bill
would cost tobacco companies at least $516 billion over 25 years,
raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over five years, and
allow the FDA to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   To answer Danielle's question, Satcher said wiping out tobacco
in this country is not a realistic option. ``The United States is
known for free enterprise and for letting people have the freedom
to make their own decisions about what they want to do with their
lives,'' he said. ``So we're pushing for regulating the tobacco
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to passing legislation, Satcher said the government
is trying to educate the public, especially children, that smoking
damages one's health and to prevent children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to reach the children with this message,''
he said. ``About 80 percent of people who smoke started when they
were younger than 18, and many of them will become addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bugg-Bey said that helping young smokers quit is as
important as prevention. ``But some don't want to stop smoking
because they're addicted to it, or they think they don't have any
real reason to stop,'' he said. ``It's hard to quit for some
people, but it is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit smoking, he said, after he was in the prevention
program, and after his mother told him he had a heart condition.
``I realized that my smoking could kill me,'' he said.

ABC CHIEF LEAVES DISNEY TO DIRECT COMCAST CABLE
</HEADLINE>

BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ABC Broadcasting's chief has resigned Tuesday, the
latest in a string of top-level departures at The Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Burke, a 12-year Disney veteran, became president of
Philadelphia-based Comcast Cable Communications on Tuesday, and
senior vice president of Comcast Corp. He had overseen 10 ABC
stations, 27 radio stations, eight radio networks and Disney's
domestic syndication arm.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, son of former Capital Cities/ABC chief Daniel Burke,
joined Disney in 1986 and helped develop the Disney Stores chain.
He became president of Euro Disney in 1992 after the French theme
park had performed below expectations and took the ABC post after
Disney bought Cap Cities two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Recent departures from the Burbank-based entertainment giant
include Richard Nanula, chief financial officer, chief strategist
Lawrence Murphy and cable programming chief Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have cited Chairman Michael Eisner's tendency to
micro-manage as a reason but others contend such turnover is
typical for a large corporation.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC spokeswoman said a replacement for Burke probably will be
named this summer. Disney stock fell 11/16 to 110 1/8. &QL;

SHUTTLE RACES TOWARD FINAL RENDEZVOUS WITH MIR SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The shuttle Discovery rocketed into space
Tuesday and raced toward a final U.S. link-up with Russia's Mir
space station.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery roared from the Kennedy Space Center launch pad at
6:06 p.m., EDT.
</P>
<P>
   On course to reach Mir on Thursday, the shuttle's five Americans
and a Russian trailed the orbital outpost by nearly 5,500 miles as
they began their pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting Discovery's arrival are Andy Thomas, the seventh and
final U.S. astronauts assigned to live on the aging station, and
his two cosmonaut hosts. Thomas, 46, is in the homestretch of a
nearly five-month journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we head uphill into space, we're going to make you proud
and bring our good friend Andy back home,'' said Discovery
commander Charles Precourt.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas asked NASA personnel to prepare a meal of lasagne and
Oreo cookie ice cream for his June 12 return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing fine,'' Thomas assured NASA personnel in Russia's
mission control center as he awaited the liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle escaped sweltering Florida heat. By late afternoon,
the temperature flirted with a 99-degree limit that would have
forced a postponement. Shuttle engineers did not design their
machinery for a sustained exposure to such high temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the launch was in jeopardy when Mir's
computer-driven steering system faltered, setting the 120-ton
outpost adrift. By Tuesday, the network of electrically-driven
turbines that keep the station's power-generating solar arrays
bathed in sunlight were back in working order.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's mission is the last in a succession of nine dockings
with Mir inaugurated in mid-1995 to prepare the former Cold War
rivals for the upcoming assembly of a new international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's launch, however, was the first for the shuttle's new
fuel tank. The towering, orange, silo-shaped tank was fashioned
from a light weight alloy of aluminum and lithium, shaving 7,500
pounds. The savings will permit shuttles to lift the heaviest
components of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you fly a new piece of equipment we give it a little
extra attention,'' said Don McMonagle, who chairs NASA's mission
management team. ``All of us breathed a little sigh of relief,
whether it was overtly or covertly.``
</P>
<P>
   Precourt's crew includes pilot Dominic Gorie, flight engineer
Wendy Lawrence and mission specialists Franklin Chang-Diaz and
Janet Kavandi. They were joined by Valery Ryumin, 58, a former
Russian cosmonaut and most recently the manager of his country's
cooperative human spaceflight program with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ryumin plans an engineering assessment of Mir, parts of which
have weathered more than twice their five-year design life.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement formally struck last weekend, the Russians
plan to drop the big station through the Earth's atmosphere and
into the ocean by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With shuttle visits drawing to a close, the Russians will lose a
crucial supply line that has enabled them to keep Mir operable
despite their faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   On their final visit, U.S. astronauts will deliver more than a 1
1/2 tons of food, clothing, water and other supplies to cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin. They will leave with more
than a ton of equipment, including frozen medical specimens that
offer a record of physical changes in the space travelers as they
became accustomed to the weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's visit to Mir will draw to a close Monday, with a
final novel exercise.
</P>
<P>
   With Gorie at the controls, Discovery's crew plans to separate
to a point 240 feet from Mir and hold its position. At the same
time, Mir's cosmonauts will inject a tracer gas into the station's
sealed off Spektr module.
</P>
<P>
   Spektr bore the brunt of a near-disastrous, June 25, 1997,
collision with an out-of-control Progress cargo capsule. The module
decompressed from a breach in its hull. Though suspected to reside
at the base of a solar array, the source of the seepage has never
been precisely pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   The escaping gases should glow a greenish-blue shade when they
encounter sunlight, potentially revealing the site of the leak to
the shuttle's cameras.

2 HEAVYWEIGHTS AND A BOXER 
MAXIMUM TROUBLE 
CELEBRITIES FOR CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a marriage made in courtroom heaven or an unholy legal
alliance? Raoul Lionel Felder, the New York divorce lawyer, and
Johnnie Cochrane Jr., who is living in New York these days to tape
his daily show on Court TV, have teamed up to defend Riddick Bowe,
the former heavyweight champion. Bowe, once famous for wearing the
pictures of his wife, Judy, and their five children on his warm-up
T-shirt, is now being sued for divorce in Baltimore. Enter Felder.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bowe was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Charlotte, N.C., and charged with abducting Mrs. Bowe and the
children from their home in Cornelius, N.C., where they had moved,
and attempting to drive them to his home in Fort Washington, Md.
Bowe, who faces a maximum sentence of 10 years, denies the charge.
Enter Cochrane.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers, who have never teamed up before, have been
coordinating their efforts this week during hours of discussion.
``It's the best duet I've ever danced with anybody,'' Felder said.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON TERM FOR POP-ART KING
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Max, whose psychedelic pop art of the 1960s
made him an icon of the art world, was sentenced in federal court
on Tuesday to two months in prison for concealing more than $1.1
million in income from the IRS in connection with sales of his
works.
</P>
<P>
   Max was also fined $30,000, ordered to pay his back taxes, and
to perform 800 hours of community service by teaching art to
disadvantaged children in four public schools in the Washington
Heights section of New York under supervision of the court and the
Children's Aid Society.
</P>
<P>
   In court, one of Max's lawyers, Roy Black, told Judge Kimba Wood
that his client had been extraordinarily generous, donating
millions of dollars of artwork to charitable causes. At one time
his distinctive, surrealistic swirling figures seemed to be
everywhere, adorning coffee mugs, T-shirts, and posters.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Robert Cramer, did not dispute his charitable
efforts, but argued that his contributions were a ``powerful
marketing device'' for his commercial endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion, Max, 60, could
have received up to 14 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very very sorry for what I have done,'' he told Wood. ``I
know in my heart that nothing like this will ever happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   HALE, HALE, GANG'S ALL HERE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm not the celebrity, the children are,'' said Dr.
Lorraine Hale, a founder of Hale House, the Harlem agency that
cares for infants who are born to mothers addicted to drugs or
alcohol, or who have the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   She said it with a wink, since a few other guests turned up for
the recent Hale House benefit at the Plaza. There was Spike Lee,
who discovered Hale House while shooting ``Do the Right Thing.''
And Rosie O'Donnell, who spoke about the value of teaching children
social consciousness. And Evander Holyfield, who recalled growing
up the youngest of nine children in a single-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was paparazzi time, and the Hale House children watched
the celebrities become children. Ms. O'Donnell stood next to
Holyfield, waited until the camera barrage, then pretended to take
a bite out of his ear. The Tyson ear.

CIVIL WAR `FASCINATES' HITCHCOCK INTO TAKING UP ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the ice he's the head coach, but when he pulls on his navy
tunic, blue pants, and shoulder bars and insignia, Stars boss Ken
Hitchcock is just another officer in the Union Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian-born-and-raised Hitchcock is an avid student of the
Civil War. He has taken part in several summer re-enactments since
his first introduction to it when he toured the Gettysburg
battlefield in 1992 during the NHL All-Star break while he was an
assistant coach with the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This old guy in his 70s spent five hours in a golf cart taking
me around the whole Gettysburg battlefield,'' Hitchcock said.
``From that day I couldn't get enough information about it. I
became involved in round-table discussions about the Civil War, and
from '92 to '95 I'd go to a re-enactment every summer as a
participant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his first re-enactment, Pvt. Hitchcock has climbed in the
ranks to his present post as second lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became involved with the conflict and the struggle between
the Confederacy and the Union and how strong each other's beliefs
were,'' Hitchcock said. ``It fascinated me, not the political
aspects but the military and psychological strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to understand how people could get people to do the
things they did unconditionally. I couldn't believe the commitment
that people made toward their leaders, their states, their
countries. I became fascinated by the actual military process.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has used what he has learned about the Civil War as
motivation techniques when he coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shown video, I've shown clips of movies,'' Hitchcock
said. ``After we didn't make the playoffs here my first year, I
showed a movie clip from ``Gettysburg,'' about seven or eight
minutes long. There were some features in there that I thought were
terrific. I showed them to the players, just to emphasize the
points of being part of a group and on values.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has empathy for both sides in the war, there was no
question that he and his reproduction rifle would fight for the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by state's rights and the belief in the
Confederacy,'' Hitchcock said, ``but I feel strongly about the
Union side in a lot of areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get a clear understanding of what people were
thinking, what their thought processes were. I really try to
understand both sides, but I'm still a Union person.''

 &HT;    Florida diocese leader resigns after molestation admission
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bishop J. Keith Symons resigned Tuesday
as spiritual leader of the Catholic Palm Beach, Fla. diocese,
admitting he sexually molested five boys early in his long career
as a priest.
</P>
<P>
   His stunning confession brought a crisis of faith that reaches
from here to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Symons, 65, is the highest-ranking American Catholic to be
forced out of church office for molestation of minors.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation Monday morning,
moving with uncharacteristic speed to name Bishop Robert N. Lynch
of St. Petersburg the temporary administrator over the 200,000
Catholics in the five-county diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch would not disclose the names of the victims, and he called
for any others who may have been molested by Symons to come forward
and contact the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painful as it is for me and for others, I feel it important
to make public the reason for my resignation,'' Symons said in a
written statement. ``Early in my 40 years of priestly ministry, I
was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the church became aware of Symons' abusive past five
weeks ago when one of the victims came forward to an undisclosed
church official. Symons admitted to assaulting him.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, Lynch confronted him about other assaults,
and Symons gave the names of four more victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claims strongly and vehemently that there are no victims in
Palm Beach County,'' Lynch said. ``He has said these are the only
ones. I want to believe him, but sometimes people with this disease
are in such deep denial that they don't remember what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged man who came forward to accuse his assailant
told church officials he was abused by Symons for about two years.
All the molested boys were parishioners, and all are believed to be
former altar boys.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said Symons assured him he had not participated in sexual
activities for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to believe that,'' Lynch said. ``But I don't know for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons did not attend the press conference at St. Ignatius in
Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. that made public his disgrace. Church
officials said he would be sent to the St. Luke's treatment
facility in Suitland, Md., where many fallen priests have undergone
therapy for their sexual abuses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be sent away for evaluation,'' Lynch said. ``The therapy
protocol could be nine months to a year _ even longer, depending on
the depth of his disease. I don't know what his future as a priest
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and attorneys familiar with sexual abuse cases
believe it unlikely that Symons could be held accountable in the
courts for crimes that were committed four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1972, we could not go after someone who molested a male
because the language of the law made rape a capital offense but
applied it only to female victims,'' said Assistant State Attorney
Scott Cupp, head of the crimes against children unit at the Palm
Beach County State Attorney's Office. ``If these victims were over
11 years old, then the crime wouldn't be considered a capital
felony, rather a life felony, and the statute of limitations would
have run out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Block, a West Palm Beach attorney who has tried civil
cases against sex offenders, said the statute of limitations would
be a difficult hurdle to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without doing any research on the specific case, I believe
that this happened too long ago,'' Block said. ``The plaintiff has
a duty to come forward within four years of the date of the
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Block believes a case can be made only if a victim successfully
argues recent recovery of repressed memory. ``That would be
difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has been increasingly plagued by incidents
of priests forced to resign for molesting minors. But Symons'
resignation was the first by a bishop in the United States, Lynch
said. Two archbishops _ Robert Sanchez of Santa Fe, N.M., and
Eugene Marino of Atlanta _ quit after admitting sexual affairs with
adult women.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' name has surfaced in a recent lawsuit involving a
Catholic priest who was accused of molesting 10 boys.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco D'Angelo, now 75, a priest at St. Mark's Church in Boynton
Beach, Fla. in the 1960s, in court papers admitted being a
molester. The Archdiocese of Miami promised victims' parents that
D'Angelo would not be permitted to continue working with children,
but he subsequently was transferred to St. Petersburg, Fla. _ where
Symons served as diocesean chancellor. Victims charged church
officials moved D'Angelo to the Tampa Bay, Fla. area, knew about
his past and did nothing to monitor him.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sidaway, a Lake Worth, Fla. victim who is now 42, pursued
criminal charges against D'Angelo on learning in 1993 he was still
in the priesthood. Last week, the victims and the Church reached an
out-of-court settlement in a civil case, the terms of which were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway is continuing a separate action against D'Angelo, who is
believed to be at the treatment facility in Maryland, where Symons
was sent.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he wasn't aware of any links between D'Angelo's
victims and Symons'. No known legal action is pending against
Symons, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation at St. Ignatius greeted the news of
their bishop's fall with anger and disappointment, yet they also
expressed faith in their church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very big scar for the parish to have a bishop make
such a mistake,'' said Marie Rollande Leclerc of Palm Beach
Gardens, a retiree who makes altar clothes at the church. ``The
priests are supposed to be examples for the kids and everyone. It
was something terrible for the bishop to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Francis Lachiara, the diocese vicar of education, has
been a friend to Symons for 39 years. He found out only Monday
about the impending resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with him for about 20 minutes,'' Lachiara said. ``I
was very saddened and disappointed. It's a terrible thing. We all
need a lot of healing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons was made bishop of the Palm Beach diocese in July 1990,
coming here after seven years in the Pensacola-Tallahassee, Fla.
diocese. He replaced Bishop Thomas V. Daily, who was transferred to
Brooklyn, N.Y., after becoming the first spiritual leader of the
newly created Palm Beach diocese in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Symons was known as an energetic leader who
worked to bring the diverse community here closer together. He
started an annual Cultural Awareness Mass seven years ago, inviting
priests from outside the diocese _ usually minorities _ to join him
in celebrating the sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an absolute workaholic,'' Lynch said. ``He had a great
reputation and interest in helping young people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lynch met with Symons Saturday, he ordered him to be
forthcoming about his past. ``I don't want any more surprises,''
Lynch said. ``Let me know what I face.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons was at first ``depressed and disappointed'' when he was
informed last week that Pope John Paul II would accept his
resignation effective 6 a.m. Tuesday, Lynch said. But then he
seemed relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have the sense this ugly, dirty little secret has
come out,'' Lynch said of the emotional meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Symons became bishop here, he was asked what his
goal would be for the sprawling diocese with 50 parishes, 40
schools and the growing Florida populations of Indian River,
Martin, Okeechobee, St. Lucie and Palm Beach Counties.
</P>
<P>
   He answered: ``It's important that I let people know the bishop
is human.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that Symons may have achieved this in the most
horrible way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any level of good that comes from this,'' Lynch
said, ``it shows people that we're not gods. Priests are flawed
like all human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who turned 57 last week, said he will set about the task
this morning of restoring the faith within his new flock. He will
celebrate Mass, and he will look to the highest power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my faith is properly placed, it is not in human beings but
in Jesus Christ,'' he said. ``Our faith is in God, and God has
never abandoned his people.''

   TORONTO _ ``You can study here and be home for supper,''
declared an advertisement for the University of Windsor published
recently in The Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case that was not inducement enough, officials of
the university _ in Windsor, Ontario, on the Detroit River opposite
Detroit _ are lowering tuition for Americans beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a tremendous deal for U.S. students,'' said
Dr. Ross Paul, the university's president. ``With this new tuition
fee, we are offering young American men and women access to a solid
education at a competitive price.''
</P>
<P>
   The price is $3,500 (U.S.) a year for American undergraduates,
compared with about $6,500 for other foreign students and about
$2,500 for Canadians. Information has been sent to more than 4,500
high school seniors in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, eliciting
several hundred inquiries. With only 10 American undergraduates out
of 10,000 at the University of Windsor this year, administrators
are hoping for a windfall by the September application deadline for
the coming school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me was the small number of American students we
have enrolled here now,'' Paul said. ``Crossing the border both
ways is an everyday occurrence for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive marketing strategy comes in the wake of
deregulation of foreign student fees by the Ontario government,
along with severe cuts in money from Ottawa over the last five
years. The cutbacks have forced a more corporate mindset, with the
United States seen as a largely untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Americans study in Canada every year, compared with
23,000 Canadians in the United States. ``The deregulation of
international fees has really changed the climate,'' said David
Scott, senior adviser for government and community relations at the
Council of Ontario Universities.
</P>
<P>
   While recruiting foreign students is not a new idea, Scott said,
the strategy is. ``Business tactics become fuzzy when talking about
academic institutions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities are also looking to the United States to
increase their visibility, enrollment and income. In 1996 the
University of Toronto teamed with McGill University in Montreal,
and Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, for a 15-city
marketing tour of the United States, visiting high schools and
college fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple economics,'' said Paul Beel, McGill's recruitment
activities officer. ``There is great opportunity for American
students to come up to Canada. Our dollar makes it a lot less
expensive, plus they can study in a foreign country without facing
cultural shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications from American students were up by 30 percent this
academic year. McGill now has the highest number of American
students of any university in Canada _ 1,500, or 15 percent of
students.
</P>
<P>
   All three universities, among the most prestigious in the
country, considered last year's marketing effort a success, and a
similar endeavor is planned for this fall. But none intend to lower
fees for non-Canadian students, though they are watching Windsor's
experiment closely.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian students are concerned about the shifting
priorities. ``This is nothing short of a cash-grab to make up for
federal government cutbacks,'' said Brad Levigne, national chairman
of the Canadian Federation of Students. ``Part of the problem is
that costs have become so prohibitive for southwestern Ontario
residents that they have to turn to American students. They're just
cash cows.''
</P>
<P>
   With government cutbacks of more than $7.5 billion for
post-secondary education since the 1993-94 academic year, the
proportion of a university's operating revenue financed through
student fees has increased to 40 percent this year from 25 percent
in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition has always been regulated by Canada's provincial
governments, largely because it has been so heavily subsidized by
taxpayers. But two years ago the Ontario government deregulated
foreign student tuition, allowing schools to set their own fees. It
has just announced the deregulation of fees for graduate programs
and professional colleges for the coming academic year.
</P>
<P>
   While tuition for Canadian students has risen to $2,500 (U.S.)
at most institutions from about $1,000 in 1991, fees for foreign
students have remained stable at about $6,500 until Windsor's
discount to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, Windsor's president, is excited about the initiative, but
he is not immune to a certain amount of hand-wringing over the
changes that the university's decision signifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be really aware of the danger of focusing on the
short term just to get bodies in here,'' Paul said. ``If I denied
there were strong market forces at work behind this decision, you
wouldn't believe me. But we've watched the same thing happen in the
United States and learned some lessons. When the arena gets more
competitive you can over-subsidize students. You can almost buy
them. But we know if we lose our academic integrity we are lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sees, assistant vice president of Wayne State University in
Detroit, Windsor's closest competitor, says he does not feel
territorial about a Canadian university dipping into the American
student pool. Nonetheless, Wayne announced last month that it was
lowering its tuition, to $2,500 from $7,000, for Canadians as well
as for Ohio residents in four counties bordering Michigan. ``We're
looking at this as a sort of good-neighbor policy,'' Sees said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Canadian students attended Wayne this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't look at your students as consumers,'' Sees said,
``you are not going to stay in business much longer.''

   NEW YORK _ Commencement speakers this year are turning to Nelson
Mandela for words of inspiration to share with graduates. Hillary
Rodham Clinton quoted the president of South Africa in her address
to Howard University, as did the astronaut Mae Jemison in her
speech to Duquesne University. Johnnetta Cole, the former president
of Spelman College, cited him to Mount Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom: ``Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our
light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Mandela never said it. Daniel Ngwepe, a spokesman at
the South African Embassy in Washington, says he has been trying to
set people straight since the words were posted on the Internet and
attributed to Mandela's 1994 inaugural address.

 &HT;    Pain of bishop's resignation far-reaching
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bishop J. Keith Symons left a diocese in
tears, disbelief and disarray Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clergy wandered aimlessly about the grounds of the Cathedral of
St. Ignatius Loyola after Symons' resignation _ in disgrace _ was
announced at a morning press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pain was evident in most faces. Tears streaked some. Expressions
of sorrow were quietly uttered for those hurt by the bishop, for
the bishop, for the faithful and for the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like the disciples after Good Friday,'' said the Rev.
Timothy Lynch, pastor of Mary Immaculate Church in West Palm Beach,
Fla. ``We have more questions than answers.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost eight years as leader of the Diocese of Palm Beach,
Symons was known as a man of vision formed by prayer and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   He built churches, raised money, said Mass daily, ran a diocese
of 250,000 people, more than 20 churches and more than 15 schools.
In that vast ministry, he endeared himself to countless Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he admitted in a resignation statement that, more than
25 years ago, he was involved in ``inappropriate sexual behavior
with minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons has left the diocese for an unnamed location to undergo
psychological evaluation and treatment, according to Bishop Robert
Lynch of St. Petersburg, Fla., who was appointed by Pope John Paul
II to fill in for Symons until a new bishop is appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religion is scarred,'' Bishop Lynch said. ``This is a
tough day for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent events in the Diocese of Palm Beach are cause for
all of us bishops to reflect again on our pastoral
responsibility,'' Bishop Anthony Pilla said in a statement. ``All
of our Catholic people must be able to approach the church with
absolute confidence in the integrity of her ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his home diocese, Symons was being remembered almost as
someone who had died. He was a man of prayer. He served the diocese
well. He presided over considerable growth in numbers of people,
churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves a lot of our sympathy,'' said Sterling
Tremayne, 80, a member of St. Paul of the Cross Church in North
Palm Beach. ``He really served us very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were quick to recall that all people, even bishops, can and
do sin. Ordination may give a special gift to priests in Roman
Catholic teaching, but it does not remove feet of clay, the Rev.
Timothy Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work became reparations,'' Lynch said. ``He has atoned for
the harm he has done by the good he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   The parish priest and others were deeply concerned for the
victims of Symons' abuse and for the faithful whose trust in church
leadership has been shattered. Sister Breda Eustace of Our Lady of
Florida Spiritual Center in North Palm Beach, Fla. mourned both the
children and the innocent faithful who were victims of Symons'
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the poor people that I feel most for,'' she said. ``Their
faith is so simple. Their trust is complete. They believe in their
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many continued their respect and love for the bishop
despite news of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was a lump in my throat,'' said Nancy
McDonald from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. ``Even though what he did
was horrendous, even when I was going head to head with him on some
issues, I was always moved by a strange love for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding trust in priestly leadership and in the church itself
is the difficult task that lies ahead for clergy and people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where community comes into play,'' McDonald said. ``We
have to help each other. If we don't, we lose everything.''

 NEW YORK SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR EXHORTS GRADUATES TO PUBLIC SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew exhorted City College
graduates Tuesday to pursue ``the beauty'' of public service, but
he did not remark on the issue dominating talk on campus: the
decision by the Board of Trustees of the City University of New
York to phase out remedial courses at its four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement address at the college that is the top
supplier of teachers for the school system, Crew found a receptive
audience among the 2,550 graduates for his call to public service.
The college says that about 90 percent of the 800 recipients of
bachelor's and master's degrees in education either already work in
New York City public schools or are going on to jobs in them.
</P>
<P>
   With the rousing cadence of a preacher, he salted his remarks
with references to hope and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world that we shape must be filled by people who
ultimately understand the quality, the beauty and the dignity of
public service,'' Crew said, urging the graduates to ``suspend
their disbelief'' when confronted with the array of seemingly
insurmountable challenges that accompany public jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's remarks received vigorous applause, though not as much as
that garnered by the valedictorian, Anita Dhawan, whose speech was
a rallying defense of City College and remediation.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees voted last week to adopt a plan pushed by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki to phase out remedial
education at the 11 senior colleges by 2002 as a way to raise
standards in a system they believe should focus its mission solely
on students prepared for college work.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to increase pressure on the public schools
to improve the academic caliber of its graduates, many of whom go
on to CUNY. Several City College graduates afterward said they were
surprised Crew did not take up the subject, but a spokeswoman for
the chancellor said he was complying with a request from college
officials _ made months before CUNY's vote _ to speak on his
personal views of public service in keeping with the theme of the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the chancellor, who has long had a good rapport with
Guiliani, said he regretted the trustees' decision but promised
that the school system would improve enough to insure graduates are
ready for college work.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Dhawan did not shy away from the topic. She,
too, knew her audience and whipped them into hearty cheers with her
criticisms of Giuliani and Pataki, who she believes have tarnished
the name of a college that has turned out Nobel laureates and civic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ability to live up to the City College name and
the City College tradition and give those who graduate 20 years
from now a name to be proud of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brooklyn College &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If public colleges continue to lose the support of voters and
legislators at the present rate, they could become like ``dead
spacecraft, with no new missions to fly,'' Vernon Lattin, the
president of Brooklyn College, told 3,000 graduates seated in the
leafy quadrangle of the Flatbush campus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, he said, the 50 United States ``are
now spending $23.1 billion less for higher education than they were
20 years ago.'' New York state, he added, ranks 49th in the funding
of higher education for every $1,000 of personal income.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, he said, is that public institutions will become
``smaller, more-expensive, semiprivate colleges and universities
for those who can afford the higher cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lattin concluded by urging the graduates to ``do what you can to
make sure that others may have the opportunity that you have
enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   An honorary doctorate of humane letters was also awarded Tuesday
to Harry Belafonte, who brought the audience to its feet with a
resounding rendition of ``Daaay-O! Daylight come and you
graduate!'' It was an adaptation of the song that became his
signature calypso piece in the 1950s. --WILLIAM H. HONAN
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bernard M. Baruch College &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Protests over its new remedial policies have been a recurrent
theme at CUNY graduation ceremonies this year, but Baruch College's
commencement Tuesday at Madison Square Garden was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Although two faculty members stood and turned their backs when a
CUNY trustee spoke, and many faculty wore yellow stickers saying
``Stop the War on CUNY,'' there was little sense of embattlement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there were repeated accolades for Baruch's president,
Matthew Goldstein, who is leaving this month to take the helm at
Adelphi University and who helped turn Baruch into one of the
most-respected colleges at CUNY during his seven years as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even CUNY's critics have taken unmitigated pride in Baruch,''
said Richard Stone, a CUNY trustee, who called the college ``the
ornamental jewel in the City University system.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Baruch alumni, Bernie West, a writer who worked on the
sitcoms ``All in the Family,'' ``The Jeffersons'' and ``Three's
Company,'' and Miguel Fuentes Jr., the president of Bronx-Lebanon
Hospital Center, were given honorary doctorates.
</P>
<P>
   West kept the audience chuckling with an address that borrowed
from his days as a comic in the Catskills. While many commencement
speakers ask the graduates to look ahead, West had them looking
ahead to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a man of leisure,'' he told the 2,000 graduates and their
guests. ``I do nothing all day and sometimes I don't finish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult to wax nostalgic,'' he added, ``if you can't
remember anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he mentioned that he had turned 80 last weekend, the
graduates rose and sang ``Happy Birthday'' to him. --KAREN W.

</P>
<P>
   Princeton University's class of 1998 made its ceremonial exit
through the hallowed FitzRandolph Gate Tuesday, capping Princeton's
251st commencement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,110 undergraduate degree recipients, who
followed tradition by filing out of the university through the
ornate gate onto Nassau Street, 620 graduates received advanced
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The honorary degree recipients were Howard Gardner, a professor
of education at Harvard University; Robert Kahn, president of the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives, who is considered a
founder of the Internet; Matthew Perry Jr., the only black federal
district court judge in South Carolina's history, and John Wilder
Turkey, a Princeton professor and a leading statistician.
Princeton's president, Harold Sharpiro, delivered brief remarks to
conclude the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Neitzke, the valedictorian, said, ``For 21 years we have
basically been living with the training wheels on; everything we've
done we've done with other people looking out for us, carefully
nurturing our potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've brought us to this critical juncture, and now we are
finally ready to put all that preparation to work. Just like the
kid on the bike, I'm sure we'll find that life without the training
wheels is more exhilarating than we ever expected, and I'm sure
we'll do our benefactors proud.''

MURDER TRIAL OPENS FOR FIRST SCHOOL SHOOTING DEFENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA, Miss. _ At the very beginning of the terrifying
national string of school shootings is a 17-year-old boy who began
a day of violence by stabbing his mother to death one morning
before school because he believed she did not love him.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped confession shown to stone-faced jurors on the
first day of his murder trial here in this eastern Mississippi
town, a sobbing Luke Woodham described how he put a pillow over his
mother's face as she lay sleeping last Oct. 1 and stabbed her
repeatedly with a butcher knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never loved me,'' he said in the taped confession, when
asked why he killed 50-year-old Mary Woodham at their home in
Pearl, Miss. As his image appeared on tape, the real-life Woodham
buried his face in his hands at the defendant's table and cried.
</P>
<P>
   After killing his mother, state prosecutors say, Woodham went on
a shooting spree at Pearl High School just outside Jackson, killing
two classmates and injuring seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Those killings were the first in a troubling trend that would be
played out in West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield,
Ore., as students, for as little apparent reason as petty grudges
and bruised feelings, turned guns on schoolmates, teachers, and
their own parents.
</P>
<P>
   Woodham, whose trial was moved from the Jackson area because of
that community's anger and the publicity the case has drawn, is the
first of the students charged in these rampages to go on trial.
</P>
<P>
   But this trial will not even address the broader picture of
school violence. Here, Woodham is only on trial for the murder of
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A second trial is scheduled next week in Hattiesburg, in
southern Mississippi, to decide his fate in the Pearl High School
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as the jury of nine women and three men looked on, a
steady stream of witnesses described how they found Mrs. Woodham
dead on her bed with the blood-soaked pillow on her head, her chest
and arms punctured and slashed as she apparently tried to fight off
her son.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators wove a terrifying tale throughout the day of
testimony as the jurors looked on, their faces showing no more
emotion than the elderly bailiff, who worked on her needlepoint as
the story unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators could not mention the school shootings,
it was clear from their testimony that they found out about the
killing of Mrs. Woodham only after Woodham had been arrested at the
school for those killings and was about to be questioned in the
police station.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Ray Dampier testified that he noticed a bandage on the
boy's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you cut your hand?'' he said he asked Woodham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing my mom,'' Woodham answered, according to Officer
Dampier's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dampier said Woodham did not seem troubled about anything that
had happened to him that morning,
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared to be very proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodham's offhand comment about his mother sent investigators to
the student's home in Pearl, where they found Mrs. Woodham.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, prosecutors introduced into evidence the bloody
knife, a blood-soaked lace pillowcase, a blood-stained, slashed
pillow and a baseball that they claim Woodham used to break bones
in his mother's face, after she had already been stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators went into the house, they found the knife and
bat lying on Woodham's bed.
</P>
<P>
   In confessions, both taped and written, he said he had ``just
stopped caring about anything'' the night before his mother's
death. He said his mother often stayed out late but would not let
him stay out late, and that she said mean things to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I was the reason my father left,'' said Woodham,
between sobs, in the taped confession. Mrs. Woodham raised her son
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I wouldn't amount to anything,'' he said in his
confession. ``She told me I was fat, stupid and lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Oct. 1, ``I woke up, I got the butcher knife and
the pillow. I put the pillow over her head and I stabbed her,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always against me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had joined a group of other young people who considered
themselves outsiders, a group that called itself ``the Kroth'' and
had planned a takeover of the school, to be followed by a bizarre
escape to Cuba, investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those young men arrested and charged in the aftermath of
the school shooting testified on Tuesday, but the presiding state
court judge would not allow reporters inside the courtroom for the
minor's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys declined to make an opening statement, and
will wait until they begin their own case later this week. The
trial is expected to last about a week, followed by the Hattiesburg
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl case is the most complicated of the recent school
killings because of the number of students involved.
</P>
<P>
   Six other boys _ one so young that he cannot be charged in state
court _ were arrested after the school shooting and accused of
plotting to murder other students.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Woodham have claimed that he was under the
influence of the group's leader, Grant Boyette, 19. They are
expected to argue that Boyette was the force behind Mrs. Woodham's
murder, and that Woodham was not mentally stable at the time of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   In jury selection, prosecutors asked potential jurors if they
would automatically consider someone insane for killing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of the investigators, Det. Aaron Richard
Hirschfield, said he believes Woodham was not under the influence
of anyone else as he walked into his mother's bedroom with the
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luke was in complete control of his actions,'' he said.

NASSAU COUNTY LEGISLATOR TO RUN AGAINST MCCALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Blakeman, presiding officer of the Nassau
County Legislature, was selected by Republican leaders Tuesday to
challenge state Comptroller H. Carl McCall in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman's selection was made during a conference call among New
York Republican leaders, led by U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, also of
Long Island; Gov. George Pataki, and William Powers, chairman of
the state Republican Party. The selection completes the Republican
ticket and came two days before state Republicans start a two-day
convention in New York City, where they are expected to ratify the
slate.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman, in an interview, described his selection in a way that
also provided a glimpse into the tight operating style of the
state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called to a meeting today with my county chairman, Joe
Mondello,'' Blakeman said Tuesday. ``Mondello informed me he had a
conference call with Bill Powers, Gov. Pataki, Mike Long, the
chairman of the Conservative Party, and Sen. D'Amato, and during
the telephone conference call he recommended me for the state
comptroller's nomination. They agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican leaders, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, confirmed Blakeman's account.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two and a half years, Blakeman has been the head of
the Nassau County Legislature. Before that he was a member of the
Hempstead Town Board and he previously worked as a private attorney
in Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman's selection was instantly seized on by Democrats as
evidence of bossism in the Republican Party. When the state
Democrats held their convention last week in Rye Brook, they made
no effort to agree on a single candidate, realizing that they could
not, and instead set up primaries for governor, lieutenant governor
and U.S. senator. As of now, it appears there will be no Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato's absolute control of the Republican Party is
perfectly evident in his convincing Bruce Blakeman to accept the
role of sacrificial lamb against the unbeatable Carl McCall,'' said
Matthew Hiltzik, press secretary for the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman said Hiltzik's attack showed that Democrats were
worried about his strength as a candidate. ``Their panic is
encouraging,'' he said. ``It sounds to me like a pretty hysterical
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little evidence of concern Tuesday among Democrats and
McCall's advisers to the prospect of a Blakeman candidacy. He is
barely known outside of Nassau County, and party leaders said they
would not be providing him with money to finance a campaign, though
they said he has some family wealth that could help him pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   And even some Republicans acknowledged privately that Blakeman,
who is 42 years old and has been in public life for only five
years, had little chance against McCall. From that perspective, his
selection seemed to underscore the cordial relations between the
Republican governor and the Democratic comptroller. Pataki and
McCall traveled together to Israel last month, for example, leading
some members of both parties to suggest that the two men had
something of a nonaggression pact, which would not be unusual
between comptrollers and governors of opposite parties during
election years.
</P>
<P>
   And on a more pragmatic level, several Republicans have said
they were wary of running an aggressive campaign against McCall,
the highest-level black elected official in the state, that could
serve to draw McCall's supporters to the polls, and perhaps then
help other Democrats running on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Blakeman insisted his candidacy was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running to win and I expect to win,' he said.

REPORTS FINDS BASIC FLAWS IN U.S. INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs to expand 12th graf with additional info)   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. intelligence ``needs to be scrubbed'' from the
top down, from its spies to its analysts to its bureaucratic
barons, according to a classified report into the intelligence
agencies' inability to foresee India's May 11 nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle revealed chronic failures of imagination and
personnel, flaws in information-gathering and analysis, and faulty
leadership and training, said the report's author, retired Adm.
David Jeremiah, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   His investigation, requested by the Central Intelligence
Director George Tenet provided a core sample of the structural
weaknesses in U.S. intelligence that go far beyond the question of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah said these included some sobering realities about the
CIA and its sister services:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA had no spies worthy of the name in India.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its ability to pry information out of people is weak
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nation's spy satellites typically produce far too much
information for overworked and undertrained intelligence analysts
to handle.
</P>
<P>
   _ In India, satellites and analysts alike failed to focus on the
nuclear test site, despite clear clues that a nuclear test was
coming. Senior intelligence officials discounted those clues and
did not order their underlings to examine them.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. policy-makers and intelligence officials had an
``underlying mind-set'' that India would not test its nuclear
weapons, he said. That fixed idea was unaffected by the fact that
India's newly elected Hindu nationalist leaders openly and
repeatedly vowed to deploy the bomb. The United States never
understood that they were driven by ``national pride and psyche''
to go nuclear, Jeremiah said. As a result, he said, its $27
billion-a-year intelligence eyes and ears were blind and deaf to
the test, which ignited nuclear tensions and an arms race between
India and its regional rival, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah, a former commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific,
described a kind of intellectual laziness at the intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fall into a pattern; you start to expect things to
happen,'' he said. ``You need to have a contrarian view.'' The
CIA's managers were passive, he said, instead of taking command and
saying: `` `Who's in charge? Take charge. Make things happen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has talented people capable of great work, he said, and
it ``has had a startling number of successes'' over the years. But
it needs many more analysts with better training and sharper
skills, he said. It should bring in outside experts to analyze
major events. It must be ``much more aggressive in thinking through
how the other guy thought'' _ breaking out of American political
and cultural patterns to grasp the ways in which the rest of the
world thinks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of the criticism in Jeremiah's report is particularly new.
The House Intelligence Committee, for instance, reported last year
that the CIA and its sister services lack ``the analytic depth,
breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic
developments worldwide.'' But rarely has a report commissioned by
the CIA drawn such swift and sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Other veteran intelligence officers concur with Jeremiah's
judgments. Gordon Oehler, who retired last year as director of the
CIA's Nonproliferation Center, said the group of intelligence
analysts responsible for interpreting spy satellite photos is a far
less skilled group than it was at the end of the Cold War. The
analysts now have an average of about 18 months' experience in
their highly technical tasks, said Jeffrey Harris, a recently
retired director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency
that builds spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Oehler said the ``contrarian views'' that Jeremiah called for
are sometimes disregarded by senior officials, which discourages
fresh thinking. Clinton administration officials dislike
inconvenient facts about nuclear weapons, he said, and sometimes
disregard information that does not fit ``a preconceived view of
what the world ought to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah, whose report remains secret, said he would recommend
that the the director of Central Intelligence make changes to
improve the ways the CIA and other intelligence agencies gather
information, analyze that information, manage their employees and
train new people. Tenet, who said he discussed Jeremiah's report
with President Clinton on Tuesday, immediately accepted these
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said that, in a perfect world, the CIA would never again
miss an event that changes the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I could say that it'll never again occur,'' he said.
``But given the problems we face in the world, and given the kind
of resources and commitments we have around the world, U.S.
intelligence is stretched and we have to do the best we can.''

EDITORIAL: KIM DAE-JUNG COURTS NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following editorial will appear in The New York Times on
Wednesday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming South Korea's president earlier this year, Kim
Dae-jung has brought a new tone to diplomacy with the communist
North. Instead of emphasizing historic grievances, Seoul now tries
to draw Pyongyang toward cooperation. Just days before departing
for a state visit to the United States, Kim is calling on
Washington to reinforce his efforts by ending American trade
sanctions against North Korea that date back to the Korean War. His
plea deserves a serious hearing, especially from congressional
Republicans inclined to treat any American overture toward
Pyongyang as a mortal threat to the security of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is a better judge than anyone in Washington of South Korea's
security needs, and by championing a less confrontational approach
to his northern neighbor he effectively erases the argument that an
adjustment in American policy would undermine Seoul's interests.
Kim understands well enough that North Korea remains a harsh
dictatorship and a potential military threat. But he recognizes
that the best way to promote positive and peaceful change in the
North is not by clinging to Cold War sanctions but by expanding
economic and diplomatic links. The Clinton administration partly
agrees, which is why it negotiated the 1994 agreement to close down
North Korea's bomb-fuel-producing nuclear reactors in exchange for
international assistance in building alternative power sources in
the North, including two safer nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts at engaging the North brought complaints and
occasional obstruction from the previous South Korean government.
The nuclear agreement has also encountered funding problems in
Congress, where Republicans have resisted paying for some of the
fuel oil promised to North Korea while the new reactors are being
built. North Korea, in turn, has said it might repudiate the whole
nuclear deal if those oil supplies are interrupted. Congress should
have the good sense to avoid a dangerous round of nuclear roulette
in the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Closely coordinated efforts between Washington and Seoul will be
required to steer North Korea toward a safer path. Kim Dae-jung
comes to America offering a more constructive and effective
partnership.

 &HT;    Lynch appointed to post after Symon resignation
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Most Rev. Robert Lynch was appointed
Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Palm Beach in the wake of
Bishop J. Keith Symon's resignation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Symons resigned after admitting to charges of sexual misconduct
with minor boys more than 25 years ago. Pope John Paul II accepted
his resignation and named Lynch to fill in until a new bishop is
appointed for the diocese. That may take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, 57, continues as the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese
of St. Petersburg, Fla. where he was appointed two years ago. He
will spend three days a week in the Palm Beach Diocese to help the
community begin to heal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has wide experience in staff work for the church but has
had less than a year's experience as a priest in a local church.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordained to the priesthood in the Archdiocese of Miami,
Fla. in 1978 and served St. James Church in North Miami for less
than two months.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1978, he left to work for the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Washington, helping plan the pope's first visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He then became president-rector of St. John Vianncy College
seminary in Miami for five years before returning to staff work in
Washington in 1984. There, he served as associate general secretary
and then general secretary of the Catholic Bishops conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch was appointed pastor of St. Mark's church in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. in June 1995, six months before he was named the
fourth bishop of St Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in West Virginia, educated in Ohio schools and
studied for the priesthood at Pope John XXIII National Seminary in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He taught school in Ohio and worked for the Washington
conference as a layman for three years before attending seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt for him (Symons),'' Lynch said. ``I hurt for the
victims. I hurt for the church in Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has the authority of a diocesan bishop but will use his
power cooperatively with local church officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are five known victims of Symon's sexual misconduct whose
names have not been released. In a prepared statement, Lynch
assured others, if any, that he stood ready to be of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary task at this time is to help all overcome the shock
of the moment and to promote the healing of those who are
hurting.''

STARR URGES SUPREME COURT TO TAKE UP CLINTON CASE QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, focusing on
yet another pressure point in his investigation of President
Clinton, asked the Supreme Court Tuesday to quickly affirm whether
a federal judge ruled correctly that Secret Service agents must
testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In that request, and a parallel plea to have the court rule on
Clinton's attempt to use attorney-client privilege to shield deputy
White House counsel Bruce Lindsey from grand jury testimony, Starr
summoned the specter of Watergate and compared Clinton's legal
tactics to those of former President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are needed, and they are needed now,'' Starr
declared in a court filing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We will be blunt: The nation has a compelling
interest that this criminal investigation of the president of the
United States conclude as quickly as possible _ that indictments be
brought, possible reports for impeachment proceedings issued, and
nonprosecution decisions announced.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development Tuesday,  &UR;  &LR; Monica S. Lewinsky dismissed
her outspoken attorney, William H. Ginsburg, replacing him with
Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, two well-known criminal defense
lawyers schooled in the ways of Washington and the high-profile
legal battles that dominate much of the capital's culture. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's decision to sever legal ties with Ginsburg, a
longtime family friend from Los Angeles who specializes in medical
malpractice lawsuits, removes one of the most ubiquitous figures
from the case and ends one of the more curious pairings in
Washington's recent collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   With a mix of paternal concern, roguish charm, and an outsider's
naivete, Ginsburg stormed through the capital in late January,
sending constantly changing signals on the nature of Lewinsky's
relationship with Clinton and his own relationship with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On one particular Sunday, Ginsburg achieved the public relations
feat of appearing on all five network public affairs shows. More
recently, he gave Lewinsky permission to pose on a Southern
California beach for a glossy magazine photo spread, and he wrote a
highly critical column on Starr for a California journal. All the
while, he has been sharply criticized for his nuts-and-bolts
representation of Lewinsky _ primarily his inability to win her
immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting to the point where his representation was like
watching a car crash over and over and over again,'' said Jonathan
Turley, a Washington lawyer and law professor at George Washington
University. ``Mr. Ginsburg succumbed to largely self-inflicted
wounds. His performance has come as close to self-immolation as an
attorney can reach.''
</P>
<P>
   By bringing in two well-known defense lawyers, Lewinsky either
is actively preparing for her own indictment in the case or
possibly trying to repair her tattered relationship with Starr in
hopes of reopening immunity talks and winning a new deal, analysts
said. Lewinsky could be facing charges including perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris has represented such high-profile figures as
Iran-Contra figure Fawn Hall and convicted spy Aldrich Ames. Stein
comes equipped with a reservoir of knowledge of how such
investigations work, having served as an independent counsel
investigating former Attorney General Edwin Meese in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious opportunity created by change of counsel is
to reopen immunity negotiations,'' said Turley.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand, a Washington defense lawyer, said, ``Plato is a
real trial guy. He knows how to go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuvering continued across the spectrum of the
Lewinsky case Tuesday, as Starr submitted another filing to the
Supreme Court asking for an expedited ruling on the issue of
whether Secret Service agents should testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr won a crucial decision on the question from US District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson last month, a ruling that the Clinton
administration said Monday it would appeal. By asking the Supreme
Court to consider the case later this month, Starr is attempting to
prevent Clinton from delaying the investigation with legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service has argued that by allowing agents to
testify, future presidents and others who receive protection may be
endangered by trying to distance themselves from agents and
inadvertently putting themselves in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Starr last week asked the Supreme Court to expedite a hearing
into the issue of executive privilege, after also winning a federal
judge's ruling on the matter. The White House on Monday decided not
to appeal the denial of executive privilege to Lindsey, who is
perhaps Clinton's closest confidant, and to communications aide
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Clinton decided to appeal the decision on Lindsey's
testimony on the issue of attorney-client privilege. Because
attorney-client privilege involves no constitutional issues,
Clinton hopes the justices will decide not to hear the case,
instead letting the matter wind through the routine appeals
process.
</P>
<P>
   In arguably his sharpest language on the case yet, Starr wrote
in Tuesday's filing, ``By asserting a purported privilege for
government attorney-client communications, the president of the
United States has directly challenged the ability of the federal
grand jury to obtain evidence of possible criminal acts by the
president and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is, save for Nixon, without parallel in the history of
the republic,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House fired back that Starr, in Tuesday's court
filings and a speech on Monday, was offering up rhetoric in the
place of legal substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr himself has said, `In court there are a lot of rules
and you'd better play by them.' That's exactly what we're doing in
going to the court of appeals,'' said White House spokesman Jim
Kennedy. ``Mr. Starr's trying to end-run the rules and leapfrog the
legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   On Lewinsky's decision, Ginsburg had taken to virtual open
warfare with Starr, even in the face of growing indications that
the independent counsel might seek her indictment. Last week, in an
article he wrote for a California legal journal, he asked Clinton
to use his presidential powers to fire Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the case in January, Ginsburg's tack was far different.
Then, he teased the news media, and thus the public, with hints of
Lewinsky's potentially lurid story of Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, he said in a television interview, ``She wants to
talk to the independent counsel and unload everything she has.
Everything.'' That day, amid widespread reports that Lewinsky kept
clothing with a semen stain from Clinton, Ginsburg talked of the
existence of a ``dress that might be forensically important in
terms of DNA evidence.'' No such evidence is known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Many news outlets have reported that Ginsburg offered Starr a
proffer, saying Lewinsky would testify to the existence of a sexual
relationship with Clinton, but denying accusations that Clinton
tried to influence her testimony in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 1, Ginsburg publicly changed his story, saying, ``It'll
pass. The president will remain in office, he'll do a good job,
we'll all, hopefully, have a sound economy, keep our jobs, and I
think everything's going to be fine.'' On March 4, he said
pointedly, ``There was no sexual relationship with the president.''

PANEL TO QUIZ AIDES TO 3 PRESIDENTS OVER SATELLITE EXPORTS TO
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's chief investigator looking into
whether China gleaned from American satellites secret information
that may have jeopardized U.S. national security said on Tuesday
that he would summon top officials from the Reagan, Bush, and
Clinton administrations to testify in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said that the panel would examine the practice of
issuing presidential waivers to allow the export of American
satellites for launching on Chinese missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the waivers have been required as a result of
sanctions imposed after the killings in Tiananmen Square. President
Bush issued waivers for the export of nine satellites. President
Clinton has issued waivers for 11 satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at the historical perspective, from Reagan and Bush
to Clinton,'' Shelby told reporters. ``We'll look at what the
policy was then and how it changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the panel would seek testimony from former Bush
officials including James Baker, the secretary of state, and Brent
Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser. He said the panel
would also seek testimony from past and present aides to Clinton
such as William Perry, the former defense secretary; and John
Deutch, the former director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said he might also summon Gen. Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who served as the national
security adviser to Reagan from late 1987 until early 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1988, Reagan approved the first plan to allow the
export of American communication satellites to China for launching
on Chinese rockets. Clinton administration officials said they only
followed a waiver practice started by Bush and insisted that no
sensitive information has been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican critics say that officials in the Clinton
administration adopted a more freewheeling approach to exporting
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence committee on Tuesday listed some of the
questions it would try to answer: Which specific Chinese launches
of U.S. manufactured satellites, if any, facilitated the
transmittal of technical knowledge to the Chinese launch industry?
Did such information enable China to develop more effective
missiles?
</P>
<P>
   The panel will also look into allegations that the Chinese
government sought to influence elections in the United States in
1996 through political donations. A Democratic fund-raiser, Johnny
Chung, has told investigators that he received much of the nearly
$100,000 he gave to Democratic causes from a lieutenant colonel in
the Chinese military, according to officials familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's committee action, endorsed by an advisory group of
Republican senators led by Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, marked the latest step in a multi-pronged congressional
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The House plans to create a select committee, headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., to investigate the accusations. But
Democrats and Republicans are still wrangling over the makeup of
the panel and its procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate intelligence panel is to hold closed hearings on
Thursday and Friday with George Tenet, the director of central
intelligence; Attorney General Janet Reno, and Louis Freeh, the
director of the FBI.

   MERRILL LYNCH SETTLES SUIT BROUGHT BY ORANGE COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay $400 million to Orange County,
Calif., to settle the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's
history. The settlement means that the county has recovered more
than $621 million so far, and analysts expect it could end up
recovering more than $800 million over all out of a total of more
than $1.6 billion lost.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SALES SOAR
</P>
<P>
   Low interest rates and strong consumer confidence helped push
sales of new single-family homes up 5.2 percent in April, to an
annual rate of 888,000 units. In another report, the index of
leading economic indicators increased one-tenth of 1 percent in
April. Both are signs that the economy is expected to keep growing
in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER SALES JUMPED 27 PERCENT IN MAY
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks soared 27 percent in May,
making it the best month ever for the No.3 United States automaker.

   REGULATORS PONDER CONRAIL TAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   Federal railroad regulators are holding hearings Wednesday and
Thursday on plans by Norfolk Southern and CSX to take over Conrail.
Although they are expected to approve the takeover, analysts say
they will move cautiously because of the rail tie-ups that resulted
from the merger two years ago of Southern Pacific with Union
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS MIXED AS NASDAQ REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks slipped, but technology issues rebounded from
steep losses Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.13
points, to 8,891.24. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted
with technology issues, rose 14.97 points, to 1,761.79.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices slipped. The 30-year yield rose to 5.79 percent
from 5.77 percent.

   DISNEY OFFICIAL LEAVES FOR COMCAST
</P>
<P>

television unit as it moves toward selling digital TV service and
Internet access through cable lines. Burke had been president of
Walt Disney's ABC Broadcasting division. He helped found the chain
of Disney Stores, led the revamping of Euro Disney and was
considered by some as a possible successor to Michael Eisner as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   LITIGATOR SAID TO SEEK INTEL SUIT

PRESERVING COLLEGE PRIDE IN A TEMPEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' heralded the City
College class of 1998 as they filed past cheering friends and
relatives and into Lewisohn Plaza. The music was as fitting as the
smiles and high-fives they shared with friends and relatives. Even
the school's custodial crew was clapping. For the sons and
daughters of working people who never dared go to college, there
was nothing common about graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism abounded, down to the chief marshal who preceded the
college president carrying a mace. In medieval times, a bodyguard
wielded it to protect officials. It might still come in handy,
considering how the City University of New York has endured
withering criticism for lax standards, lazy students, and devalued
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against those attacks was in the crowd and on
the VIP stand, like Angela Goan. She started at City as an Irish
immigrant who took remedial math to bolster her confidence and
ended up six years later with a perfect average and the honor of
being named salutatorian.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that her degree is worth less than those bestowed
in a storied past angered her. She worked as a nursery school
teacher's aide full time by day and studied by night. Her financial
aid was a modest reimbursement from her job and her credit card,
which helped her defer tuition payments. She earned a bachelor's
degree in education, summa cum laude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good professors, we work hard and it's not like you
come here and are guaranteed an A,'' said Ms. Goan, who will study
for her master's degree at City. ``It's demeaning for somebody to
think you could work so hard and put in so much effort and then
they say it's not worth what it was before. That it's not special.
This is special.''
</P>
<P>
   At 35, she is the first in her family to go to college. Her
mother, who still lives in County Donegal, Ireland, does not grasp
the full impact of her accomplishments, although she is proud. She
was the one who suggested to Ms. Goan that she visit New York,
hoping that the girl would get her wanderlust out of her system and
come home.
</P>
<P>
   But home had its limits for someone like Ms. Goan, who went from
high school to factory work. ``College is not expected of you,''
she said. ``You could very well go into a dead-end job.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager for change, she had come to the states as a live-in nanny
13 years ago. In the early 1990s, she was caring for children and
decided she wanted to become a teacher. She took a job as an aide
at a nursery school and enrolled in college. Worried that she had
been out of school for a decade, she took a remedial math class,
although she had passed the placement test.
</P>
<P>
   Her remedial work was voluntary, yet she saw it as a necessary
morale booster. Unlike the City University of New York board that
voted to eliminate it at the senior colleges, she defended its
place in the four-year schools. Shunting remedial courses to the
community colleges would add one more step to discourage people
from pursuing an education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody goes to college at a young age, and not all of
them took high school seriously,'' she said. ``When you're older,
you realize the value of an education. But maybe you don't have the
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   She developed a slew of time- and money-saving skills to get
through college _ most of which involved having no social life, no
spare income and no time to read or do much else for fun with her
husband, Aliou Coulibaly. But she considered that easy, compared
with the cooking, cleaning and child-raising that classmates had to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they're going to be productive and contributing to our
society,'' she said. ``And that's the part I don't understand when
people and politicians criticize us. It all comes back into the
pot. If you give something out, it all comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it public college karma. That theme echoed in the ephebic
oath that Ms. Goan and her classmates intoned at the end of
commencement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We men and women graduating from the City College of New
York,'' they began, as they pledged to be dutiful and diligent,
respectful and reverent. ``We will never bring disgrace to our city
by any act of dishonesty or cowardice nor ever desert our suffering
comrades in the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time that vow was uttered by the many was not at City
College but during Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's inauguration in
January. The mayor led the crowd in what he called the Athenian
Oath of Fealty. The words were the same, except for the part about
City College.

USC RECEIVER RECRUIT ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wide receiver Windrell Hayes, one of USC's top
football recruits, has been arrested in Lodi on burglary charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, 21, was arrested May 22 with two other men on suspicion
of writing bad checks for merchandise, which they would then return
for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Derrick Small, 20, a student with Hayes at
San Joaquin Delta College and Curshawn McCurn, 18, from Lodi.
</P>
<P>
   Lodi police officers believe the trio wrote more than $15,000 in
bad checks. They purchased clothes, shoes and electronic
merchandise in at least six different cities, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detectives are still talking to a number of people and
number of victims,'' said Scott Fichtner, Lodi deputy district
attorney. ``Police reports are still being prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   A pretrial conference is scheduled for today, but with the
investigation ongoing, Fichtner said little is expected to be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes (6-foot, 200 pounds) is considered one of USC's impact
recruits. He started two years at San Jose State, leading the
Spartans in receiving both seasons. In 1996, Hayes was named
All-Western Athletic Conference second team, after catching 58
passes for 848 yards and four touchdowns. He is in San Jose State's
top 10 for career receptions with 97 catches for 1,383 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes attended San Joaquin Delta in Stockton this year but did
not play football and has two years of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett was out of the office Tuesday and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was expected to assume a significant early role for USC
because Hackett suspended star wide receiver R. Jay Soward from the
Trojans' season opener against Purdue for poor academic
performance.

EDITORIAL: SENATOR QUID PRO QUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following editorial will appear in The New York Times on
Wednesday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who glories in the nickname ``senator
Pothole,'' appears to be planning another re-election campaign in
which New Yorkers will be regaled with populist yarns from
constituents who have had their roads repaired, immigration
problems resolved, their insurance carriers whipped into line.
</P>
<P>
   Being of service is the core of D'Amato's sales pitch, and as he
himself said when announcing his candidacy for a fourth term, ``the
little people have needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But as an article in Tuesday's Times points out, D'Amato, the
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is too modest about his
attempts to deliver and too vague about for whom. For every
beleaguered widow and irritated homeowner who has marveled at the
senator's willingness to be of aid, there appears to be a long line
of Wall Street executives, investment brokers and credit card
companies that have asked D'Amato for assistance and sealed the
request with a contribution. Corporations, it seems, have needs too
_ very expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman, D'Amato has denied that his eagerness to
help out a multibillion-dollar business with a merger problem or
limited partnerships in need of a tax break has anything to do with
the fact that the beneficiaries of his legislative zeal were also
big campaign contributors. The real connection, she said, is that
``Senator D'Amato is always fighting for New Yorkers and New York
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   (When the needs of local businesses are completely fulfilled,
the senator appears to occasionally have enough spare time to
devote to fighting for the needs of campaign contributors in
Delaware or Puerto Rico as well. So many big guys to help, so
little time!)
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of accuracy, D'Amato's re-election ads should
feature a more realistic mix of beneficiaries. For every man on the
street who got a hand from senator Pothole, we would like to see a
$100,000 donor from the financial services industry describing, in
moving detail, how D'Amato was there when he was needed.

MEXICO ARRESTS 2 ACCUSED OF FLOODING U.S. WITH `SPEED' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In what U.S. and Mexican authorities called one of
Mexico's most important narcotics arrests, anti-drug agents
detained two brothers accused of being Mexico's largest producers
of methamphetamines, or ``speed,'' and of being the leading
distributors of the drug in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, Luis and Jesus Amezcua Contreras, both of whom are
wanted on felony charges in California, were arraigned here Tuesday
on federal money-laundering and racketeering charges, said Mariano
Herran Salvatti, the director of the country's anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these arrests Mexico's largest methamphetamine cartel has
been practically taken apart,'' Herran said at an evening news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had been pressing for action by the Mexican
authorities against the brothers since 1995, blaming the Amezcuas'
aggressive methamphetamine distribution networks north of the
border for a speed epidemic that swept the American West in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   They are two of the most prominent traffickers arrested in
Mexico since cocaine trafficker Juan Garcia Abrego was detained and
then expelled to the United States in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amezcua brothers run the largest methamphetamine and
chemical trafficking organization identified by U.S. law
enforcement,'' said Thomas Constantine, the head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Mexico should be commended for the actions
of their law enforcement agencies,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amezcuas' arrest, he said, ``should significantly disrupt
the established methamphetamine trade which is carried out by
organized crime leaders in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Herran said that Luis Amezcua, 34, was arrested in the western
city of Guadalajara on Monday and flown to Mexico City, where
Jesus, 33, was arrested separately.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA statement put Jesus' arrest in Mexico City at just past
midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A third brother, Adan, 28, was arrested in the Pacific coast
state of Colima in November. Although Adan has been imprisoned
since then, his legal situation remains murky. His lawyers maintain
that he is being held illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Herran said that there had been ``good interchange of
information'' among U.S. and Mexican officials during the
investigation leading to Monday's arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus and Luis Amezcua were indicted separately on drug charges
in California in 1993, and Luis was also charged that year with
murder, according to American court records.
</P>
<P>
   But Herran said Tuesday that U.S. authorities had not requested
the extradition of any member of the Amezcua family.
</P>
<P>
   Herran said that Mexican agents had seized 125 properties from
the brothers in their money-laundering investigation, including
ranches, drug stores and travel agencies in the states of Jalisco,
Colima and Baja California and in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the drug stores, he said, were in Tijuana, where they
were used to facilitate the export of illegal methamphetamines and
to help in the illegal import of ephedrine, the main precursor
chemical in the manufacture of methamphetamine.

AGAIN, NEW YORK CITY READING SCORES ARE UP  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second year in a row, scores by elementary
and middle-school students on citywide reading tests improved
slightly, just shy of the national average, according to Board of
Education figures released on Tuesday. Scores went up in each of
the city's 32 community school districts, though the gains across
the board were smaller than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 418,000 students in the third through eighth
grades who took the California Testing Battery Reading exam in
April, 49.6 percent scored at or above grade level; the national
norm is 50 percent. Last year, 47.3 percent scored at or above
grade level.
</P>
<P>
   But, as was the case last year, not all students were required
to take the test, a practice that had raised questions about the
reliability of the figures. Students who demonstrate on a separate
language proficiency test that their knowledge of English is
limited are exempt from the citywide reading examination, in
keeping with state Education Department regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time that policy was applied. The
exclusion, critics had said, artificially raised scores, although
the board adjusted 1996 scores in order to make valid comparisons.
This year, no such adjustments are necessary, since limited English
speakers were exempt again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, 4,300 fewer students with limited English skills were
exempted from the reading test, and 1,300 fewer students were
absent on the days the tests were administered _ offering some
reassurance to testing experts, since scores can be inflated by
exempting more limited English speakers or urging low-performing
students to stay home on the day of the test.
</P>
<P>
   A new form of the test was administered this year, reducing the
chance that scores rose simply because students grew accustomed to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got fewer kids who are being eliminated and the
scores are going up, that's a good sign,'' said Dr. Thomas Fisher,
an expert on evaluating test scores who is assessment administrator
for the Florida education department. ``That means you are being
more inclusive and achievement is going up. That's good, especially
if you're giving a new form of the test.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing at Board of Education headquarters on Tuesday
afternoon, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has far greater
control over each district now than he had in the past, was
jubilant. The two-year gain of nearly 6 percent was the largest in
16 years. ``This system cannot only perform but it has done this
two consecutive years,'' he said. ``This is not a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied by nearly all his district superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Crew expressed unequivocal support on Tuesday for the district
superintendents; under state legislation passed last year, he can
end their contracts if he finds persistent educational failure in
their districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have said all along was this is about incremental,
sustained progress,'' he said. ``I am not worried that gains in any
particular district are not as high as we wanted them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Berne, a New York University vice president who
specializes in studying the city school system, said on Tuesday
that the chancellor's new power over school boards meant that city
and state officials would be looking closely at what action he
takes with low-performing districts whose scores have not risen as
much as the rest.

NEW YORK BUSINESS OWNERS WELCOME RESTRICTIONS ON FOOD VENDORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three decades ago, a rail-thin immigrant from Greece
raised an oversized umbrella on the corner of William and John
streets and staked his claim to a piece of lower Manhattan
concrete. From now on, the gesture said, George Markopoulos will be
selling hot dogs and sauerkraut from this location.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every weekday since then, he has plied his trade,
presenting each foil-wrapped hot dog to the customer as though it
were a gift.
</P>
<P>
   But just up John Street, another Greek immigrant named Tom
Tsolomytis has spent the last two decades running the Roxy Food
Shop, a 24-hour diner that advertises its specials _ ``shrimp-salad
sandwich, $3.50'' _ on paper plates. And he has no appreciation for
the panache, or the plight, of street vendors, whose numbers have
grown in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know is they hurt my business,'' Tsolomytis
said, a toothpick nestled behind his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The inherent conflict between rent-paying business owners like
Tsolomytis and street vendors like Markopoulos will reach a
crescendo on Wednesday when hundreds of vendors are expected to
participate in a morning-long demonstration to protest the Giuliani
administration's decision to ban food carts _ as well as vendors
selling items like clothing _ from 144 streets throughout the city,
beginning in July. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said the ban is
needed to ease congestion on busy sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors plan to meet at Liberty Park in lower Manhattan at 9
a.m., hold a news conference, then walk down Broadway to rally in
Battery Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shutdown for the whole day, and it's going to be a
great turnout,'' said Jeff Cicio, the president of the Big Apple
Food Vendors Association. ``We want the public to know that we have
a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many customers interviewed on Tuesday said that the
vendors did no harm in their current locations. And they said they
liked the low prices, tasty if nutritionally questionable fare, and
New York ambiance that the food carts represent. ``I've been coming
here for two-and-a-half years, two times a week,'' said Anthony
Pepe, a city employee who frequents Markopoulos' stand. ``I think
it's terrible that he'd have to move. I've never seen a pedestrian
problem as far as where he stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban focuses on many of the narrow streets in the financial
district of lower Manhattan. On the city's map, for example, the
intersection of William and John streets has become an ``X'' over
the livelihood of Markopoulos, 58.
</P>
<P>
   The city and several business-improvement districts contend that
the restrictions are needed to ease congestion on the sidewalks.
They emphasize that the number of street vendors is not being
reduced _ only the number of locations where they can operate. But
Markopoulos countered that the city's argument defies basic
economics: if hundreds of vendors move to sanctioned,
out-of-the-way locations, the combination of less traffic and more
vendors will hurt business for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't make any money, and I don't make any money,''
Markopoulos said. ``After all these years, I don't want to go
someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown
New York _ a business-improvement district that filed many of the
complaints that led to the restrictions in lower Manhattan _ said
that in addition to congestion, another element is at play in the
debate: competition. ``There is the ongoing issue of complaints
from retail establishments that pay rent and property taxes and
whose owners look outside to see vendors who don't,'' he said.
``And they are in direct competition right outside their own
stores.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And if the travails of Markopoulos have resonance, so too do the
experiences of Tsolomytis. Every morning, before dawn, he walks up
John Street to see coffee carts everywhere, poised to sell coffee,
bagels and doughnuts at discount prices. By 11 a.m., he said, those
carts are sold out _ and his unsold doughnuts are turning stale
near the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Tsolomytis, 54, who says he hasn't taken a vacation in a decade,
said that he used to sell 15 dozen bagels a day; now he sells about
four dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The same tension could be found in midtown on Tuesday between
retail owners and food vendors, all vying in the same market of
feeding people cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   John Poulos, the owner of the Deli-Burger Restaurant, on West
45th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, called the impending
restrictions ``a miracle,'' then sounded a familiar refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place costs me $6,000 a month in rent, I have six
employees, and utility bills to pay,'' he said. ``And those guys
pay nothing. I have to compete with these guys selling coffee and a
bagel for $1. I sell it for $1 and lose 20 cents every time. But
what am I going to do? I can't sell it for more than them or nobody
will come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind seeing one guy here, and one guy there, as long
as they are spread out,'' he added. ``But on this street, they are
everywhere. I hope the restrictions are going to go through and I
hope that Giuliani will stick with them. It's a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the restrictions are a curse for Mohammed Kueder, a hot-dog
vendor who has stationed himself at the northwest corner of West
56th Street and Avenue of the Americas for the last four years.
Like so many vendors, he pays no rent, but incurs other expenses
that eat into his small profit margin. He said he saw no recourse
but to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take care of my family,'' he said. ``Maybe Giuliani
will listen to us if enough people show up. I don't think the
protest will work _ the mayor has probably made up his mind _ but I
hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Giuliani's comments on Tuesday, it is doubtful that
the protest will affect his opinion on the matter. ``The fact is
that there are some parts of the city that are too overcrowded,''
he said. ``There have been some food vendors that have engaged in
unsanitary conditions _ more than a few. So we need some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments by the mayor _ particularly the references to
``unsanitary conditions'' _ infuriate Cicio, who is organizing
Wednesday's protest. He said that Giuliani was trying to sway
public opinion by categorizing the vendors as ``dirty, smelly
terrorists running nontaxpaying businesses,'' when ``in fact we're
the heaviest-regulated business in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the vendors hoped the protest would prompt the City
Council to enact legislation to create more balance in establishing
the locations where the vendors can operate. Last night, two
council members, Stephen DiBrienza and Anthony Weiner, said they
would present a bill to disband the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel,
which is controlled by the mayor and developed the new
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vendors have only the sympathies of some
customers to ease their concerns. ``Giuliani does great things, but
sometimes I think he gets carried away,'' said Miguel Diaz,
stopping for a knish at a stand on Church and Vesey streets that
will be required to move. ``These stands have been a part of New
York since Day One.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ARE THE BULLS TRUE UNDERDOGS OR JUST PLAYING
POSSUM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ It is one thing for Bulls Coach Phil
Jackson to address his team about losing and seeing its run of
championships possibly end. But Michael Jordan, a man who needs
barely seven-tenths of a second to resurrect his franchise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I've had enough success to know you can't win every
time,'' said Jordan, a day before the Chicago Bulls meet the Utah
Jazz in the Wednesday opener of the National Basketball Association
finals. ``At the end of the season, if you lose a game, that's it.
It doesn't stick with me. It doesn't drive me nuts and it doesn't
keep me from sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can deal with losing. I just don't want to lose.'' Scottie
Pippen added: ``Everyone is expecting the Jazz to walk away with
this series. We're underdogs, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you believe, the Bulls are either playing
possum before they run the Jazz off the floor for their sixth
title, or sincerely believe that they are in danger of losing their
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, for one of the few times in their five-title run,
the Bulls are not overwhelming favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jazz of Karl Malone and John Stockton, Chicago meets a
rested, veteran team that has had nine days off between games and
has the experience of getting a second shot at Chicago in the
finals _ a chance none of the Bulls' other championship opponents
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation seems to say we were vulnerable and not as
invincible as we have been in the past,'' said Jackson, who had
addressed his team about the prospect of losing Game 7 to the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first finals rematch since 1989, when the Detroit
Pistons swept the Los Angeles Lakers for their first of two
back-to-back titles. Like the Pistons, the Jazz has spent what
seems like a millennium trying to climb to the pinnacle _ only to
lose in six games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Jazz's experience will lend itself to a more poised
team than last season's squad is unclear. But home-court edge
cannot hurt. Utah went 36-5 at the Delta Center in the regular
season, and has gone 7-1 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have been a subpar road team all season, and did not
win a game at Indiana's Market Square Arena in the conference
finals. The only NBA building with more decibels? The Delta Center,
where observers could not hear the person sitting next to them for
five minutes after the Jazz pulled out Game 4 of the finals last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have done well in the 2-3-2 format, which moves to
Chicago on Sunday for three games. In fact, they beat Phoenix
without home-court advantage in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But that was five years ago, the distant past in Jordan's
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature says you can't win every time you make it to the
finals, and we've done that,'' Jordan said. ``But I like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bulls' castle is dilapidated, having taking a
monstrous hit in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bulls were celebrating their resolve and heart to
overcome Indiana in Game 7, the rest of Jordan-viewing America saw
a beaten-down and beleaguered champion struggling to his corner for
the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Two days is not a lot of recovery time for taking on the huge
biceps of Malone and the Jazz, who are simply bigger inside and
have more capable reserve players than the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series to me is going to be won with our big guys,''
Malone said. ``I'm putting pressure on myself and our big guys. If
you allow Michael, and Dennis and Luc and Scottie to catch the ball
in the medium-range post and do what they want to do, it's going be
a short series.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan has any end-of-career sentiment on his side, his Jazz
counterparts, John Stockton and Malone, have more.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton has played in more playoff games (141) than any other
player in league history without winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is right behind (131). Throw in Jeff Hornacek and Antoine
Carr, who have combined for 210 playoff games without a
championship, and you've got the NBA's equivalent to Susan Lucci,
the perennial Emmy also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   To stop Malone, Jackson is expected to start Dennis Rodman and
hope his irascible, offbeat power forward can somehow stop one of
the NBA's strongest men.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is one or two wins here, and the series will be
over,'' Rodman said. He also allowed: ``We're not 25- or
26-year-old antelopes anymore. It's going to be difficult to
maintain the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz will try to pick-and-roll the Bulls over, with Stockton
and Howard Eisley either creating a shot for themselves or their
teammates off Utah's offensive staple.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will counter, of course, with the two-sided triangle:
Jordan or Pippen isolated away from their teammates, telling
everyone to get out of the way so they can operate. It's a familiar
scene, one that is beginning to proceed in slow motion as their
careers wind down.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when every film is broken down and every scouting
report compiled, the Bulls still have the greatest player in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider that to be pressure,'' Jordan said. ``It's an
ace in the hole. It's something I've always been intrigued with
about Michael Jordan, and about the things he does. No one knows
what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a loss would force his re-retirement, he added:
``It won't have any impact. At the end of the season, it's about
evaluations, evaluating the players, the organization and the
decision making they need to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost at the end of the season and won at the end of the
season and continued to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played up the underdog theme, but with a peculiar
asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider us the underdogs, but yet I still consider us to be
champions,'' Jordan said. ``They still have to take it away from
us, no matter what people are predicting.'' &QL;

REGULATORS DECLARE CONN. REACTOR READY TO RESTART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ After completing one of the most intensive
safety reviews in the history of the nuclear power industry,
federal regulators said Tuesday that one of the three Millstone
nuclear reactors in Connecticut was ready to restart and brushed
aside criticism that they had failed to investigate a number of
problems at the plant sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Unit 3 has been idle for more than two years, and while the
proposal to allow it to begin operating again is not final _ the
recommendation comes from the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and still must be approved by the four commissioners _
it was seen as a pivotal moment. Shirley Ann Jackson, the NRC
chairwoman, called it a ``watershed point.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to restart Unit 3 has been closely watched by
operators of nuclear plants nationwide. Not since Three Mile Island
has there been such an ambitious effort to turn around a troubled
nuclear plant, many industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it had used the equivalent of 70 full-time staff
people working on Millstone for more than two years. And a team of
outside consultants spent more than 160,000 engineering-hours
conducting the most thorough review of a reactor's design that
regulators said had ever been done.
</P>
<P>
   With the report issued Tuesday by a special projects office,
formed two years ago to address a host of safety problems at
Millstone, Hugh Thompson, a deputy executive director at the NRC,
said, ``The staff is confident that Unit 3's licensing and design
bases have been established, the staff is confident that an
adequate corrective action program has been established, and Unit 3
is ready to transition into an operational mode and begin restart
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the eight-hour hearing Tuesday at NRC headquarters
included testimony from many who did not want it to start. Critics
cited a host of problems as evidence that the Unit 3 reactor should
not be authorized to restart. They noted that a recent leak in one
safety valve had not been repaired, that the consultants' review
had discovered more than 100 calculating errors in the plant's
design and that federal regulators and the outside team of
consultants had not looked at enough of the plant's safety systems.
</P>
<P>
   And David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer with the Union of
Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group, said that while Northeast
Utilities, the operator of Unit 3, had made substantial
improvements, he was not convinced that the NRC would be poised to
shut the unit down again if problems arose.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC asked the commissioners to file their votes by Tuesday,
though there is no set deadline for the ballots. Three votes are
needed to approve the restart of Unit 3. If Jackson and the three
other commissioners give their approval, it would still take some
time _ perhaps four to six weeks _ before the reactor was running
and producing electricity. Northeast Utilities desperately needs
the additional power for the hottest days of summer, when
electricity usage is at its yearly high.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even then, regulators noted, the unit's final go-ahead would
still turn on the resolution of some outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when Unit 2 would be restarted, as it is at
least several months behind Unit 3 in repairs. All work on Unit 1,
the oldest and smallest Millstone reactor, has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to get the reactors back on line is critical to the
survival of Northeast Utilities, which has spent almost $1 billion
to fix the Waterford, Conn., plant and has seen its revenues
plummet as a result of the reactors' shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Connecticut Department of Utility
Control has ruled that Northeast must cut the rate it charges
consumers by $14 million a month if Unit 3 is not producing power
soon. Such a rate reduction could throw Northeast Utilities into
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort to improve Millstone has repercussions beyond
Northeast Utilities and may be a telling sign of the NRC's ability
to deal with its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only one year ago, the General Accounting Office issued a report
that found that the agency had been too lax in enforcing
regulations and had been too cozy with the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Millstone became the poster child of all that had gone wrong at
the NRC, and the agency acknowledged that it had made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a decade, the agency had allowed the plant to
operate out of compliance with its licensed design, and regulators
did not heed a host of safety complaints that were raised by
employees. Instead, the NRC actually handed over the names of
employees who raised complaints to Northeast Utilities and took no
action to protect them when the company harassed and even fired
those whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after the NRC recognized these problems and
then levied the largest fine ever against a nuclear plant _ $2.1
million last December _ there are still questions about the
agency's ability to avoid another Millstone.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as if to underscore the difficulties the agency faces,
Jackson held a news conference after Tuesday's hearing in which she
disclosed that a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, the Energy and
Water Development Subcommittee, had proposed eliminating 500 of the
1,400 positions in the agency that dealt with regulating nuclear
reactor safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating to the agency,'' Jackson said, noting
that the proposal was very much ``in flux.''
</P>
<P>
   But aside from that potential setback, Jackson insisted that the
the agency had made substantial progress in the last two years,
bringing in a new management team, ratcheting up safety standards,
requiring more oversight of inspectors in the region and beginning
considerations on a new system to evaluate reactor safety.
</P>
<P>
   Lochbaum remained skeptical. In the review of the reactor's
design, he noted that the outside team of consultants that the NRC
had brought in only looked at 15 of the 88 safety-related systems,
and that it discovered that Northeast had made 158 calculation
errors in its evaluation of how its design would work.
</P>
<P>
   While regulators dismissed such mistakes as minor, Lochbaum
maintained that these problems could suggest a more widespread
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jackson said that if Millstone were authorized to restart,
the agency would be ready to shut it down again quickly if the old
problems returned, saying ``Many, many things have changed at the
NRC.''

COMMENTARY: WALL STREET TURNS HOSTILE TO CHAINSAW AL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chainsaw Al is getting cut up by Wall Street, which is beginning
to suspect that there is more to corporate success than a
willingness to fire people.
</P>
<P>
   Chainsaw Al is the nickname given some time ago to Al Dunlap,
who became a corporate legend after he was hired as chief executive
officer of Scott Paper Company and dismissed thousands in the
course of turning around the company, which eventually was sold to
Kimberly-Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most CEOs are ridiculously overpaid,'' he wrote in his memoir,
``Mean Business,'' which became a best seller, ``but I deserved the
$100 million I took away when Scott merged with Kimberly-Clark.''
Modesty and understatement have never been among his prime virtues.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996, when a struggling Sunbeam Corp. turned to him as a
savior, there was cheering on Wall Street. One analyst compared the
move to the Los Angeles Lakers signing Shaquille O'Neal. Sunbeam's
stock price leaped 49 percent the day the move was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, whose memoir proudly notes that his nicknames, in
addition to Chainsaw Al, have included The Shredder and Rambo in
Pinstripes, set about dismissing bosses and workers. And it seemed
to work.
</P>
<P>
   For 1997 the company reported sharply increased sales and
profits, and in February its board rewarded Dunlap with a 100
percent pay increase, guaranteeing him an annual salary of $2
million. He also got a grant of 300,000 shares and such management
perks as financial planning advice and country club dues. The
company's stock price, at $18.63 after the leap following Dunlap's
hiring, soared to $53 in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bad news arrived. It turned out that the profits for
the final three months of 1997 had gotten a big boost from the sale
of barbecue grills _ not normally a big winter item. Sunbeam had
offered phenomenal terms to customers such as Kmart and Wal-Mart to
buy grills early. That had the effect of making 1997 profits look
better, and of taking sales away from the first half of 1998.
Results this year are dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap met with analysts last month to explain what had
happened. ``I take full responsibility,'' he said, before making
clear it was everyone's fault but his. He blamed the weather. He
blamed a retail chain for messing up grills that had to be
recalled. He explained that because he had been working on a series
of acquisitions, ``I left a marketing guy in charge of operations.
Mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the grills being sold in December, he denied it was an
effort to ``artificially pump up'' 1997 profits. It was, he
explained, ``a well-intentioned market-driven strategy that simply
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam is now integrating those acquisitions _ First Alert,
Coleman and Signature Brand _ and promises to make big savings
through plant closings and the dismissals of 5,100 workers. Dunlap
has fired some of his top aides and brought in replacements from
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   But burned investors no longer seem to trust him. The stock
price has dropped 58 percent, and Wall Street analysts who once
lionized Dunlap now seem unimpressed. ``We would like,'' wrote one
analyst who no longer is recommending Sunbeam, ``to have heard a
more tension-easing tone of humility from top management.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Dunlap, who declined to be interviewed, is
that he appears to be in no danger of losing his job. The new
contract he signed before the bad news hit guarantees him $2
million a year for at least three years. Chainsaw Al is doing just
fine, even if his shareholders aren't.

SECOND THOUGHTS EMERGE ABOUT NEW RULES FOR NEW YORK TAXIS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than half the members of the city's Taxi and
Limousine Commission say they are having second thoughts about at
least one of the measures they approved last week in cracking down
on taxi drivers, and they criticized the Giuliani administration
for pressuring them to vote so quickly on sweeping new rules to
overhaul the industry's safety practices.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the eight commissioners said in interviews that they
would like to reconsider one crucial rule that makes it much easier
to suspend cabbies over safety violations and other infractions.
And even though Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he would not back down
on any of his proposals, several commissioners said their concerns
were growing about two other major safety measures that were tabled
last week in the face of industry opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash at the commission is potentially significant
because five votes are needed to pass _ or reconsider _ any rules,
and some of the commissioners are clearly upset by the
bare-knuckled nature of the mayor's recent attack on the taxi
industry.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the commissioners _ who have often been
criticized as being too protective of the industry _ were venting
frustration at being caught in this battle. But the mayor's aides
are still lobbying them hard, and even some industry lobbyists say
they doubt the commissioners have the gumption to reverse
themselves or stand in the way of the mayor's determination to
shake up the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commissioners also disclosed Tuesday that in
addition to a closed-door meeting of the board just prior to
Thursday's vote, the commission held an unpublicized meeting two
weeks earlier to discuss the mayor's proposals. Legal experts have
said that Thursday's meeting probably violated the state
open-meetings law, and spokesmen for industry groups said on
Tuesday that they planned to cite the meetings in suits seeking to
overturn the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   While leveling the criticism, the commissioners agreed there was
a need to improve taxi safety and said they stood behind most of
the 15 new rules, which would increase fines on drivers and require
higher insurance coverage for accident victims. Some also
acknowledged that in many ways, they were simply painting
themselves as reluctant rubber stamps for the mayor and that they
should have had a better understanding of the rules before they
voted.
</P>
<P>
   But several commissioners accused the agency's staff of leaving
them largely in the dark as the new rules were developed and then
failing to fully explain them, especially one that authorizes the
suspension of any cab driver for as little as one moving violation
and one administrative infraction within 18 months. Several
commissioners said that they had no idea that the regulation could
be just as strict as one they had tabled on Thursday because some
felt it was too harsh and could penalize average drivers as well as
bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the commissioners who expressed serious qualms, Sandra
Silverman and Marvin Greenberg, were the crucial swing votes in
favor of the mayor's proposals last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverman said the way the administration had pushed the
commission for a quick vote ``really deeply offended me.'' She said
she agreed to vote for the rules only because she did not want to
see another month of antagonism between the mayor and the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been dismayed from the beginning by the mayor's
rhetoric,'' said Ms. Silverman. She added that she thought the
commission needed to revisit the issues involving driver
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who also was worried about suspending drivers too
quickly, said he was especially concerned about the other tabled
proposal, which would require every person or company that owned a
yellow cab to post a $100,000 bond for accident victims. Many
independent drivers have said it would be impossible for them to
come up with the money for the bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that I've learned in my years with the commission is
that you don't promulgate rules you can't enforce,'' he said. ``So
if people can't come up with the equity that the bonding companies
claim they do require, then we're beating a dead horse and I don't
want to get involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's internal politics are volatile because only
three of the commissioners were appointed by Giuliani. The other
five, including Ms. Silverman and Greenberg, were appointed either
by former Mayor David Dinkins or by City Council members. Another
complication is that only six of the eight commissioners were
present for last Thursday's vote, where the measures were approved
by five of them with one member, Alberto Torres, abstaining in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor's aides predicted confidently that the bond
proposal and the tabled measure involving driver sanctions were
sure to pass when the absent commissioners, Ramona Whaley and Elias
Arout, returned, neither commissioner seemed supportive of the
mayor's package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just thrown upon us too fast, this reform,'' said
Arout, who called the bond proposal ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the proposal on sanctions for traffic
violations, which which would lower the threshold for suspensions
to six Department of Motor Vehicle points from the current 11. ``I
personally feel that six points is very low and 10 points is
sufficient,'' he said. ``You get six points, the man gets suspended
for 30 days, he can't buy food _ that's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver penalty rule that did pass last week sets up a
separate point system for violations of TLC rules and calls for
suspension after five penalty those points within 18 months. A
driver could accrue five points by getting one ticket for following
too closely _ a summons that several commissioners said could
justifiably be issued against just about any car in midtown traffic
_ and another for failing to give a passenger a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whaley, who left Thursday's meeting before the vote, saying
she had just returned from Africa the night before and was tired,
said on her way out the door that she opposed stiffer penalties for
cabbies. ``Things are already hard enough on the taxi drivers,''
she said.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Watching a disaster movie is a little like imagining your own
funeral. You would not be able to witness your own funeral, of
course, but in your mind's eye you can. And no matter what happens
to Earth in the final reel of a disaster movie, when the popcorn
has all been eaten and the audience is feeling a little salty, the
observer's eye persists.
</P>
<P>
   You would not have made it to high ground if a comet splashed
into the Atlantic and sent a half-mile-high tsunami cantilevering
over New York, but in ``Deep Impact'' you do. In a real epic of
global destruction, you would be one of the extras, incidentally
squashed by Godzilla's tail as it gouged an office tower in
passing. But in the movies _ especially now that the megatonnage of
disaster films seems to be increasing _ you watch with an
omnipotent eye, an effect that does not diminish when you walk back
into the city streets and the night is still sticky and scented,
the way it was two hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The threat in recent disaster movies seems to be nothing less
than global extinction or the demise of the human species. The
emotion in a horror movie is intimate, because the audience is
asked to imagine the detailed slicing and dicing of its personal
flesh. But the emotion in a disaster movie is somehow more social
and more diffuse. Its origin isn't just giant lizards or
unrepentant comets or, in the upcoming ``Armageddon,'' an asteroid
the size of Texas. Its origin is human nature. That explains why
disaster-movie makers love the scene in which the whole population,
fleeing the city, causes a traffic jam the size of New Jersey. The
audience is asked to imagine in each stalled auto the flicker of
personal fear. But what is really being shown is the breakdown of
civilization, echoing, in a summer drive-in kind of way, the darker
vision of Jean-Luc Godard in ``Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The only subject Hollywood has ever had is redemption. What
ratchets up the scale of destruction in modern disaster movies is
the sense that the redemption we really need these days is national
or global. The whole edifice is flawed, and so it takes a colossal
threat to restore perspective or the destruction of the edifice
itself in order to clear room for a new beginning. Night after
summer night, we go to the movies and watch a hero rise up, among
the unheroic little people, to save the planet, or Manhattan. Night
after night, we are that hero, wandering through the cinematic
wreckage toward the promised land.

RED STORM AND JARVIS TALK, BUT COACH'S SALARY IS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis boarded a train Tuesday morning bound for Washington
from New York. He was headed back to his office at George
Washington University and possibly out of the running for the St.
John's basketball coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to the negotiations, Jarvis wants a
salary of at least $800,000 a year. He currently earns $600,000
coaching George Washington. That figure includes work with
basketball camps, radio and television jobs, as well as a contract
with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they offer $700,000, he won't leave GW,'' the person said.
``Mike has got a great job. He doesn't need this job. If he doesn't
take this job, he's ultimately looking to move to the NBA. If the
money is right, he will go to St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis met with St. John's athletic director, Ed Manetta, and
St. John's executive vice president in charge of finance, Bob
Crimmins, on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He then met with St. John's president Donald Harrington. While
the meetings went well, the two sides are at an impasse. St. John's
does not want to tender an offer to Jarvis unless certain that he
would accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. John's is a wonderful institution, one of the premier
college basketball coaching jobs in the country,'' said Rob Ades,
Jarvis' agent. ``Any coach would be happy to work there under the
right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is the highest-profile candidate of the four coaches who
have met with Manetta; he has reached the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament four times in his eight seasons at
George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's believes that it can bring in one of the other three
candidates, Davidson's Bob McKillop, St. Bonaventure's Jim Baron,
or Siena's Paul Hewitt for about half of what it would cost to hire
Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have an NCAA tournament victory among them, but all
three coaches are well regarded and would love to have the job,
even at the discount price.

FEDS SAY SALSA IS NOT A VEGETABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY GEORGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Salsa: ``a hot sauce made with chilies, tomatoes,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Webster's defines it. But the federal government has
other ideas. Listen up, students. Salsa is now officially a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department recently decreed that salsa may
be counted as a vegetable in school lunches under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be loaded with spices, stabilizers or other
non-vegetable ingredients. Also, a mere spoonful splashed atop a
taco won't do _ it has to be at least one-eighth of a cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for me because I love salsa,'' said Gaia Fisher, a
senior at Bothell High School, north of Seattle, where the drippy
red stuff was offered along with taco salads Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the usual offerings of carrots and corn, salsa is a
great vegetable, added junior Micael Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   Bothell High, like many other schools in the area, has long
offered salsa as a seasoning. But will they now start offering it
as a vegetable?
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue, Renton and Federal Way schools are likely to do so,
but Seattle and Northshore schools probably will not, according to
nutrition directors in those districts.
</P>
<P>
   For Linda Hoel, food supervisor for Bothell's Northshore School
District, calling salsa a vegetable doesn't quite ring true. ``It's
always been just kind of a side condiment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high honor for a condiment to make the USDA's list of
school vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ketchup, salsa's more established sister in the tomato
sauce family. It never reached that height.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Reagan administration's 1981 proposal to count
ketchup as a vegetable in school lunches was so widely scorned that
it was quickly dropped _ like a rotten tomato.
</P>
<P>
   But salsa is ``not at all'' like ketchup, says Carla Kaser,
Renton's school nutrition director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually see the big chunks of tomato in it,'' said
Kaser, who confessed to being a salsa aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup, on the other hand, oozes with sugar and vinegar and is
much more highly processed, nutrition experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts started hearing about salsa's ascendancy
two weeks ago, when the state superintendent of public instruction
issued a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salsa may now be credited as part of the fruit/vegetable meal
component for child nutrition programs,'' says the bulletin, which
is posted on the Internet on SPI's homepage,
http://www.ospi.wednet.edu
</P>
<P>
   ``When USDA first disallowed salsa from receiving credit in the
school meals program, it was because salsa was used as a condiment
or garnish and served in amounts smaller than one-eighth cup,'' the
bulletin says. ``As salsa has become more widely accepted by
children, it is used more as a vegetable side dish in amounts
greater than one-eighth cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin explains that only the vegetable content of salsa,
not starches or stabilizers, may be counted as part of the
one-eighth cup.
</P>
<P>
   And that portion alone won't satisfy all nutritional
requirements. Each meal still has to include a total of at least
three-fourths of a cup of fruits and vegetables, said Skip Skinner,
the state's food distribution manager.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said the USDA ruling on salsa was requested by schools
around the country. For years they were frustrated that the USDA
distributed salsa to schools, but wouldn't let them count it as a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Another driving factor, Skinner said, is salsa's growing appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overtaken ketchup as the most popular tomato product,''
he said.

CHANGING FUTURE FOR PHARMACEUTICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the future, pharmaceutical drugs as we know them
will be changed forever by the merging of two exploding scientific
fields _ genomics, or the study of the human genetic blueprint, and
information sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs will be safer, and more tailored to treat specific
diseases with fewer side effects, scientists said Tuesday at the
Nasdaq International Science and Technology Summit in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, patients will be able to tell before they take a
drug if it will work for them, given their particular genetic
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Such advances, which are only 10 to 30 years away, are being
made possible by applying the vastly increasing computational power
of computers to unraveling how genes interact in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fundamental paradigm change has occurred,'' said Leroy Hood,
chairman of the department of molecular biotechnology at the
University of Washington, and a leading figure in the emergence of
this new hybrid field. ``It is the simple idea that biotechnology
is an informational science.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently biologists have concentrated on understanding
single genes by studying them in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   But genomics is the study of hundreds or thousands of genes at a
time, Hood said. ``What we really want to know about genes is not
how they act in isolation, but how they operate in networks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this ``systems biology,'' or informational sciences
approach that yields the most promise for applications in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But to reap the full benefit of that approach, researchers from
universities, companies, non-profit institutes and government labs
are going to have to find innovative ways to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hood is in the final stages of organizing a new
biotechnology institute that will assemble computer scientists,
engineers and molecular biologists to work together on these
complex problems. The institute would bring together academicians
with large and small industrial partners to work in collaboration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The private and public sectors are interdependent, said Edward
Lazowska, chairman of Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of Washington. ``The complex interplay among government,
academic and industrial labs has driven progress forward in both
information sciences and biotechnology.''
</P>
<P>
   Without that interaction, neither field will progress.
</P>
<P>
   The technology summit, which runs through Wednesday, attracted
biotechnology executives, academics and investors from around the
United States and Europe, all seeking to understand a complex field
that is morphing daily into something new.
</P>
<P>
   The same advances that enabled computers to double in speed
every year are now enabling molecular biologists to decode the
human genome at rates unimaginable even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is ``the most incredible software program ever
developed,'' Hood said. Each gene is made up of nucleotides, or
basic building blocks denoted by the letters A, T, C and G. The
task of the Human Genome Project, a world-wide, multi-institutional
effort started in 1990, is to discover the sequence of the more
than 250 million letters in the code.
</P>
<P>
   That sequence ultimately governs the interactions of more than
100,000 human genes, and dictates how a single cell divides and
develops into the billions of cells that make up a human being.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, scientists had decoded about 2,000 genes, or only about
2 percent of the total genetic material contained in the human
genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biologists haven't been playing with a full deck,'' said
Randall Scott, president of InCyte Pharmaceuticals, a genomic
database company in Palo Alto, Calif. Understanding how the genome
works to program the body with that information is like ``trying to
play a game of spades with three or four cards in the deck.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, scientists have nearly the full deck of cards,
he said. The next task is to decipher exactly what those genes do,
how they interact, and how they are regulated in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Doing that will require applying many of the tools used by
computer scientists to analyze, model and decipher information.
</P>
<P>
   As scientists figure out what certain genes do and how those
genes differ from person to person, they will have a better
understanding of why people are predisposed to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they will be able to look for drugs that work
specifically on the actions of those genes, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ultimate goals of genomics is preventive medicine,
Hood said. ``By identifying genes that predispose to disease and
using preventive therapy, we can keep people well.''

LEON LIANIDES, 81, OWNER OF NEW YORK'S COACH HOUSE RESTAURANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Lianides, the demanding owner of the Coach House
restaurant in Greenwich Village, died on Monday at his home in
Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in declining health since suffering a head injury in
a car accident in 1991, his wife, Aphrodite, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, when fine dining in America meant French cuisine,
Lianides started his restaurant, determined to create a first-class
establishment devoted primarily to American food. ``He'd say,
`Everybody thinks that to be elite you have to go to a French
restaurant, but we have great food in America, too,' '' his wife
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coach House won accolades for its clubby, intimate setting
and for signature dishes like black bean soup with Madeira, crab
cakes, triple lamb chops, pecan pie, and the corn sticks that were
served to guests as soon as they sat down.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, those gastronomically
ingenuous days when goat cheese was unheard of and radicchio could
have been mistaken for a virulent form of crab grass, the Coach
House epitomized the pinnacle of sophisticated dining,'' wrote
Bryan Miller, the restaurant critic for The New York Times, soon
after the Coach House closed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lianides, the son of tobacco planters, was born in 1916 on the
Greek island of Corfu, where he attended private school. He
immigrated to the United States in 1929, initially living with
relatives in Worcester, Mass., where he shortened his name from
Napoleon and worked as a soda jerk to earn money for college. He
attended New York University, studying literature and history.
</P>
<P>
   Lianides would often pass by the Lane Restaurant, a tearoom at
110 Waverly Place, a site that had been a carriage house and
hayloft for Wanamaker's. ``He told me, `I have so many ideas about
that place,' '' his wife said. Lianides, with a group of backers,
bought the Lane, renamed it, and set about creating a warm, elegant
restaurant. Retaining the heavy beams and brick, he added red
leather banquettes, spindly brass chandeliers, and 19th-century
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant quickly developed a reputation as one of the
finest restaurants in the city. It was a favorite of James Beard,
who lived nearby and made a ritual of dining at the restaurant on
Christmas Eve. In a 1977 review by Mimi Sheraton, the restaurant
critic at the time for The New York Times, the Coach House was
awarded four stars, the highest rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lianides has developed a repertory of dishes that reflects the
world crossroads that New York is, and the period in which we
live,'' Ms. Sheraton wrote. ``The best American products and dishes
such as chicken pie, corn sticks and Maryland crabmeat, are in
perfect harmony with such European classics as veal piccata a la
Francaise, quiche Lorraine, gazpacho, or steak au poivre. What may
well be the world's mellowest crunchy Mississippi pecan pie does
not seem out of place alongside an equally exceptional Grand
Marnier Bavaroise. Above all, it is the consistency of excellence
that makes this restaurant worth four stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Lianides, a stern taskmaster with a relentless eye for detail,
involved himself in every aspect of the restaurant's operation,
from wine selection and menu planning to decor. He tested recipes
endlessly at home and delivered lectures on food and wine at daily
staff meetings. In a pinch, he could stand in for the chef at the
restaurant, a sight that might have shocked his patrons.
</P>
<P>
   A trim man with a bold mustache, Lianides cut a dapper figure in
his tailored suits. He drove a Jaguar, collected fine art, and
every night at 10 sat down to an English cut prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time and the rise of newer restaurants, some
of them pushing deep into the terrain of American food that
Lianides opened up, the Coach House lost some of its luster. A New
York Times review in 1984 demoted it to one star, more in sorrow
than in anger. A year later, Miller upgraded the rating to two
stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1993, the Coach House closed for the summer,
and in December 1993 it was put up for sale. In January, it was
announced that a new Mediterranean restaurant, Grillo, would open
there.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Lianides is survived by a son, Ronald, of
Brooklyn, and two sisters, Victoria Chicolas, of Athens, and Olga
Marulis, of Albania.

NEW YORK HOLDS HEARING ON DOMESTIC PARTNERS' BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council held its first public hearing on
Tuesday on legislation that would give domestic partners the same
rights as spouses, prompting about 150 opponents of the measure to
storm out of the meeting, complaining that the bill's supporters
were allowed to monopolize the time at the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   By the City Council's tally, 24 people testified in favor of the
bill during the three-hour hearing and eight spoke against it. But
among the 200 that showed up for the hearing of the General Welfare
Committee, the overwhelming number came to oppose the bill, many of
them massing on steps of City Hall to continue their protest after
they walked out of the meeting in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went upstairs and we've been waiting and waiting and
waiting,'' said the Rev. Ruben Diaz, president of the New York
Hispanic Clergy Organization, which is based in the Bronx. ``The
chairman is laughing in our face.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Democrat from Brooklyn and the
committee chairman, said he allowed people who had pre-registered
to speak first, as is customary. Many of the bill's opponents said
they showed up early on Tuesday morning to get in line, not
realizing they were already too late.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual groups said the measure would provide a historic
guarantee of their rights, but it would also apply to heterosexual
couples who register as domestic partners with the city clerk's
office. The bill would insure that the domestic partners of city
employees would have the same rights as spouses and also guarantee
the rights of domestic partners who live in city housing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fervent opposition from some religious groups, the bill
has widespread bipartisan support on the council, thanks in large
part to the stances of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who proposed the
legislation, and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, the measure's
sponsor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee plans to hold one more hearing on the bill before
it is sent to the full council for a vote later this month. But it
was clear from the start of Tuesday's hearing that there was broad
support for the measure among some of the more influential council
members.
</P>
<P>
   DiBrienza opened the hearing by calling the mayor's championing
of the bill ``a courageous act.''
</P>
<P>
   The first witness was Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor for
operations, who said that Giuliani was keeping a campaign promise.
Mastro also noted that most of the rights granted by the bill
applied to domestic partners under executive orders already in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about insuring that New York City law does the right
thing by all of its citizens,'' he said. ``The mayor believes that
this is the right thing to do _ that as a matter of fairness and
equity, we should be codifying the letter and spirit of these
executive orders.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mastro began his testimony, a man in the audience, who would
not give his name, shouted, ``Giuliani is a liberal turncoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ettelbrick, the legislative counsel of Empire State Pride
Agenda, a statewide homosexual political organization, testified
that the measure ``insures that thousands and thousands of
disabled, old, gay, lesbian, and straight New Yorkers and our
children will receive the economic, emotional, and social support
necessary for our families to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the testimony he had prepared, Diaz of the Hispanic pastors'
group said: ``This law diminishes the meaning and sanctity of
marriage. It eliminates the incentive for a couple to marry,
motivating a life that goes against that which was established by
God as stipulated in holy scriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz handed out copies of his statement before the meeting but
left without reading his text because he had to wait so long to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, used one of
his Sunday homilies last month to warn of the bill's possible harm
to society. No representative of the archdiocese of New York
appeared at the hearing, but at its request, the cardinal's homily
was placed in the hearing record and DiBrienza read one passage.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Thomas Duane, who is openly homosexual, was
unapologetic that most of the speakers were in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If on this one occasion, supporters of a civil rights bill for
lesbian and gay New Yorkers got to go first, I don't think that's
going to change the balance sheet in terms of public discourse,''
said Duane, a Democrat from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements did nothing to mollify many of the bill's
opponents, who sat in the hearing for about two hours and then went
outside City Hall to hold a second rally, forfeiting their chance
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck was stacked,'' said William Devlin, director of the
Urban Family Council, a pro-family organization. ``If this bill is
about fairness and equity and tolerance, he should have taken one
speaker in favor, then one speaker opposed.''

WELLS PITCHES YANKEES TO 6-3 VICTORY OVER WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells' perfect game and near-perfect record
have been tough to overshadow. But Tuesday night, when Wells took
the mound against the White Sox, he was not exactly the center of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, practically Ruthian in his presence since his perfect
outing on May 17 against the Minnesota Twins, was reduced to a
supporting role when it seemed that a twinge in his pitching
shoulder could open the way for the major league debut of the Cuban
defector Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque, as Cuba's one-time national team great is known,
arrived from Columbus on Tuesday with a $6.6 million, four-year
contract, a 7-1 minor league record and many great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of attention to overcome. But Wells managed in his
own inimitable way. He proved healthy enough to start, as Hernandez
was relegated to a seat in the general manager's box in the upper
environs of Yankee Stadium. Then Wells showed he was also more than
good enough to win an eighth straight decision as the Yanks cruised
by Chicago 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (8-1) and the Yankees thus resumed their normal routine,
confounding yet another luckless American League opponent and along
the way sweeping the two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, now 39-13, erased the minor concerns raised when
the team lost the final two games of a four-game set with
second-place Boston this past weekend. The Yankees have now won
eight of their last 11.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wells has been a major part of the Yankees' dominance. Unlike
the perfect game against the Twins, Wells did not prove to be
unfathomable Tuesday night, just unbeatable as he pitched eight
innings and allowed just three runs on seven hits. Mariano Rivera
got his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox left fielder Albert Belle did manage to homer of the
left-hander twice in his first three at-bats, bringing his season
total to 13 and his series total to three. And Chicago first
baseman Wil Cordero also found the seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees and Wells were saved because the Yankees
hitters, quiet in the homer department early in the season, are
also finding the proper range of late.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill hit a two-out solo homer off Sox starter Mike
Sirotka in the first inning. After Belle tied the score in the
second and Cordero homered to put the Sox up in the third, the
Yankees regained the lead with a four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Yankees tied the score, bunching singles off the bats
of the ageless Tim Raines, Chad Curtis and Scott Brosius. Then the
team that entered the game ranked ninth in the league in homers
unleashed more power, in the form of a three-run homer off the bat
of Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, hit with two outs, was the Yankees' fifth in the
series and sixth in three games. Jeter, now with eight, tied for
the Yankees' lead with the idle Darryl Strawberry. O'Neill improved
his total to five.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive support and Wells' ability to limit the White Sox
to solo home runs enabled the pitcher to remain in impressive
cruise control. Wells has not lost a game since his season debut on
April 2. He has not allowed more than three runs in any of his last
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The last team to score more than three runs against Wells was
Texas, on May 6. That game proved a watershed of sorts, because
Wells brought unwanted attention by failing to convert a 9-0 lead
into an easy victory. Wells left that game leading only 9-7, then
took up residence briefly in Joe Torre's doghouse as the manager
openly speculated about Wells' physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such questions now. With his winning streak intact,
the shoulder in place, Wells cannot be overlooked for long. Even on
a day when there was an El Duque spotting. &QL;

 VICTIM'S FATHER CRITICIZES RELEASE IN RACIAL KILLING  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The father of Yusuf Hawkins, the black teen-ager who
was murdered nine years ago during a racially motivated attack by a
large crowd of white youths on a Brooklyn street, harshly
criticized state officials on Tuesday for the release of Keith
Mondello, one of the men convicted in the case, from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Moses Stewart, spoke at a news conference in Harlem
on Tuesday at which he echoed a call by the Rev. Al Sharpton for a
march this Saturday at noon on Bensonhurst, the neighborhood where
Hawkins, 16, was fatally shot twice in the chest on Aug. 23, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be sure he doesn't have a happy homecoming,''
Stewart said of Mondello, who served eight years of a 12-year
sentence in the Attica state prison after being convicted of
rioting, unlawful imprisonment, menacing and possession of a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grant, a spokesman for the New York State Division of
Parole, said Mondello was released because state law requires
prisoners with records of good behavior to be freed after serving
two-thirds of their sentences. Mondello was denied parole in 1994,
1995 and 1997, Grant said. Though not considered to be on parole,
Mondello will remain under the parole board's supervision until the
rest of his term is completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In their decisions to refuse parole, board members called
Mondello the ``organizer and leader of a bat-wielding mob'' that
attacked Hawkins, who had gone to Bensonhurst to look at a used
car. Parole board members said Mondello had never expressed remorse
about the attack and would probably commit more crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bensonhurst killed my son and spit in my face,'' Stewart said
at a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who in the months after the murder of Hawkins acted as
a spokesman for the victim's family and organized emotionally
charged marches through Bensonhurst, vowed on Tuesday to stage

sense of outrage as some welcome him home,'' Sharpton said of
Mondello.

GIULIANI REVAMPS CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the most dramatic revamping of New York City's
child welfare system in over a generation, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
announced Tuesday that he would put hundreds of millions of dollars
in foster care contracts up for competitive bidding in an effort to
care for abused and neglected children in their own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, New York City will allow churches, child
care providers and other nonprofit groups to bid for slices of the
city's $614 million child welfare contracts. The organizations will
be required to create networks of neighborhood-based services _
foster homes, health care, counseling, drug rehabilitation _
instead of sending the vast majority of children for foster care
and counseling services outside their communities and boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The city also plans to adopt new measures to judge the
performance of the neighborhood-based contractors, focusing on
assessing the experiences of the children in their care. Those
agencies that fail to reduce complaints of abuse and neglect _ both
in foster care _ who fail to ensure that children receive timely
medical care and who fail to carefully monitor children returned to
abusive or neglectful parents may ultimately lose their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The changes had long been sought by city officials, advocates
for children and foster care agency workers as a way to provide
easy access to children and troubled families. They reflect a
national movement toward neighborhood-based programs as increasing
numbers of cities and states seek to stabilize the lives of
children in foster care and to extend that assistance to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, city officials had repeatedly renewed contracts with
virtually the same group of child welfare agencies that have
dominated the foster care business for decades. And child welfare
officials often criticized the system that routinely sent battered
children to foster homes far from their neighborhoods, schools and
biological parents, even though about 75 percent of abused and
neglected children ultimately return to parents or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer scale of change stunned officials in the child
welfare field, who had expected Giuliani to roll out the
initiatives gradually, neighborhood by neighborhood, over a period
of three or four years, as he made good on his promises to overhaul
the city's child welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the city will release applications for contracts in the
Bronx Wednesday and for the rest of the city in the fall. City
officials say children expected to enter foster care in the Bronx,
which has a high concentration of the city's abused and neglected
children, will be placed in their neighborhoods starting in January
of next year. Newcomers to foster care in the rest of city will be
placed in their own communities by July 1999; children currently in
foster care will not be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a radical and dramatic transformation of how child
welfare services are delivered in New York City,'' said Nicholas
Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for Children's
Services, who was hired by Giuliani to improve the city's long
troubled child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to strengthen neighborhoods and reduce the abuse
and neglect that is now all too pervasive and make life safer and
better for kids,'' said Scoppetta, who stood alongside Guiliani
during a news conference at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The city released few details Tuesday of the changes to come.
And while many child welfare specialists cheered the long-awaited
initiatives, they worried about many questions left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Will the city, the child welfare specialists wondered, provide
enough dollars for agencies to put the new plan in place? Will
children in foster homes in their neighborhoods be endangered by
aggressively abusive parents? Will parents in poor neighborhoods _
which have historically lacked desperately needed services like
drug rehabilitation programs _ end up with fewer options than they
had when agencies sent them to programs across the city?
</P>
<P>
   Scoppetta tried to allay those fears Tuesday, saying the city
had no plans to reduce child welfare spending. In fact, he said,
the city has already added an additional $13 million to finance
more counseling and drug treatment programs. He added that the
contracts would allow children at risk from further abuse from
aggressive parents to be sent to foster homes outside their
neighborhoods.

   LOS ANGELES _ In marking the 30th anniversary of Robert F.
Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles, Councilman Nate Holden said
he wants to rename a stretch of Wilshire Boulevard after the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in front of the Ambassador Hotel, where Kennedy
was shot June 5, 1968, Holden said Tuesday he will ask the City
Council to designate a one-block strip of Wilshire as Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The council is scheduled to vote on the motion Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be assured that at this site, where we lost one of our great
leaders, we are going to have a sign that says he stood here and he
died here,'' Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   If the motion passes, the parkway would consist of a 100-yard
stretch along the 3400 block of Wilshire, between Kenmore and
Alexandria streets. The hotel is on one side of the street, and
Koreatown businesses are on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Former Los Angeles Rams football star Rosey Grier, who was with
Kennedy the night of his death, led a prayer in front of the hotel
Tuesday but refused to go inside for a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there, and I don't want to go through it again,''
Grier said. ``It's painful enough just standing out front.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden stumped for his motion as he walked through the
Ambassador Hotel ballroom and the kitchen pantry where Kennedy was
shot by Sirhan Sirhan. The hotel has been closed for nine years,
but is still rented out for location filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always there when America needed him,'' the councilman
said. ``We should have honored him here a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the local business community also came out to show
support for Holden's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This streetscape site should stand as a tribute to Robert F.
Kennedy for years to come,'' said Richard McDermott, past president
of the Wilshire Chamber of Commerce. &QL;

NEIGHBORHOOD CARE WORKS, ADVOCATES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (See NY-CHILD-WELFARE)  
 (ATTN.: Calif., Ohio, Mo., Pa., Ore.)  By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, most government agencies around the
country placed children in foster care homes on a first-come,
first-serve basis _ even if it meant moving children from their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, though, a growing number of cities,
counties and states _ hoping to improve the quality of care for
foster children _ have been moving toward using neighborhood groups
to provide basic services such as foster homes, health care and
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, children's advocates said Tuesday, the
approach has worked. And now, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday,
New York City will try the new approach.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 children around the country are in foster
care, according to Michael Petit, deputy director of the Child
Welfare League in Washington, which represents the nation's child
welfare commissioners. But of that number, perhaps half are in
homes located at least an hour or so away from the child's family _
a logistical nightmare that children's advocates say is disruptive
to the child, to the family and to social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, the Youth Law Center, a public interest law firm
in San Francisco, sued Los Angeles County for supervising foster
children inadequately, in part because the children were spread all
over the area and social workers were not seeing the children.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the two sides settled, with one of the provisos
being that the county establish neighborhood-based programs, said
Carol Schauffer, director of the Youth Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of foster parents being happier, and kids having much
less disruption, it has worked,'' said Ms. Schauffer, about the
county's pilot programs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a nonprofit organization in Baltimore, the
Annie E. Casey Foundation, began organizing neighborhood-based
programs in Ohio, Philadelphia and other places, quickly attracting
attention across the country, Ms. Schauffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, for instance, has been moving toward
neighborhood-based programs for about three years, and now St.
Louis, Kansas City and about two-thirds of the state have such a
policy, said Carmen Schulze, director of the Missouri Division of
Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   This has entailed opening up the foster care process to
competitive bidding _ similar to what New York is proposing _ and
enlisting help from groups like the Salvation Army, Ms. Schulze
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Oregon, the State Office of Services to Children and
Families has just launched two pilot programs in the Portland area
designed to keep foster children not only in the same neighborhood,
but in the same school, said Kevin George, the program's
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this idea will work in New York, though, will depend not
so much on the principle _ which children's advocates say is
generally unassailable _ but on the implementation by the city's
beleaguered Administration for Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it good or bad?'' said Petit. ``Well, it really depends. If
it's executed well, and done properly with sufficient resources,
and it's monitored, then it can work.''

GREEN ACCUSES D'AMATO OF ACTING IN RETALIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Green, who is seeking the Democratic nomination
for the Senate, accused Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the man he wants to
unseat, Tuesday of trying to dismantle a federal board that
regulates a system of mortgage banks, in retaliation for the firing
of one of his political allies by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Green, New York City's public advocate, also charged that
D'Amato was pushing federal legislation that would allow mortgage
banking policies that would benefit large banking corporations and
wealthy investors, groups that have been major contributors to the
Republican senator's campaign account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. D'Amato is more interested in expanding corporate welfare
for banks and his lobbying friends than in increasing housing for
working families,'' Green said in a news conference at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for D'Amato denied that the senator was
retalilating against the Clinton administration for removing
Lawrence Costiglio as a director of the Federal Housing Finance
Board in March. Costiglio, who was appointed to the board by
President Bush, is a longtime D'Amato supporter who, along with his
wife, has contributed $6,600 to the senator's campaigns since 1992,
according to Green.
</P>
<P>
   Lisette McSoud Mondello, D'Amato's spokeswoman, said his bill
was intended to update an archaic and ineffective regulatory
system, and she described Green as ``still bitter'' about losing
decisively to D'Amato in the 1986 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This once again demonstrates that Mark Green is a desperate
candidate,'' Ms. Mondello said. ``It's sad that he has to resort to
such negative tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's latest attack on D'Amato underscores one of the
fundamental differences between him and the other two Democratic
candidates for the Senate, Geraldine Ferraro and Rep. Charles
Schumer. While the other two candidates have sought to portray
D'Amato as out of touch with New York's political mainstream, Green
has vowed to make an issue of D'Amato's ethics and voracious
campaign finance machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Green's news conferece also demonstrated the Democratic
candidate's efforts to turn one of D'Amato's political strengths,
his chairmanship of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, into a
weakness. Green contends that D'Amato has consistently used his
position to attract campaign contributions from wealthy
special-interest groups, and do favors for them in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been his entire career,'' said Joseph DePlasco, Green's
campaign spokesman. ``He's always been more inclined to work for
large contributors and special interests than for potential
homeowners and constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a fight in Washington over the future of the Housing
Finance Board, which regulates the Federal Home Loan Bank system.
The 12-bank system was created by Congress during the Depression to
provide low-cost funds to retail banks to help them underwrite
long-term mortgages for home buyers. The system helped create the
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage that has made home-ownership possible
for a broader spectrum of people.
</P>
<P>
   In April, D'Amato proposed legislation that would abolish the
Housing Finance Board and transfer its regulatory duties to the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which also oversees
two other federally chartered corporations that underwrite home
mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has said that he introduced the legislation to abolish
duplicative federal offices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Green and Bruce Morrison, chairman of the Housing Finance
Board, contend that D'Amato's bill includes language that would
require the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks to pay dividends to their
shareholders high enough to make their stock ``a competitive
investment.'' The Home Loan Banks are cooperatives that are owned
entirely by retail banks that make mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Morrison said that language would allow the
Federal Home Loan Banks to make investments that might be more
profitable than home mortgages, but that would divert the system
from its central mission of making home ownership available to more
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits would be likely to end up in the pockets of
shareholders, not borrowers,'' said Morrison, a former Democratic
congressman from Connecticut who was appointed to the Housing
Finance Board by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Green's campaign also contends that D'Amato's bill could fatten
the profits of the retail banks that own shares in the Federal Home
Loan Banks. And many of those retail banks are contributors to
D'Amato, they said.

L.A. TIMES PUBLISHER APOLOGIZES FOR COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The publisher of The Los Angeles Times sent an
unusual memorandum to his staff on Monday, apologizing for causing
offense by suggesting that the newspaper could increase its female
readership by offering more emotional and less analytical articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some comments that seemed to stereotype women in an
exceptionally unfortunate way,'' Mark Willes, the publisher, said
in the message. ``The plain fact is, I misspoke. And for this I
feel doubly badly and extend my profound apologies to anyone whom I
offended.''
</P>
<P>
   The apology came about three weeks after Willes was confronted
by more than 200 angry staff members in a meeting that was among
the biggest in the memory of that newsroom. The gathering came in
response to Willes' suggestions, published in The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times, that editors might start counting
the number of minority and female sources quoted in articles, to
make the newspaper more appealing to these groups. And he suggested
that women would respond to articles told in a more personal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gratified to see it,'' Bettina Boxall, a metropolitan
reporter, said of the message. ``But I was somewhat surprised. At
the meeting we attended, he stood by his comments and didn't
understand that what he said would be offensive. This is a step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The message on Monday, however, had less to say directly about
the latter issue. ``He did not in any way address the enumerating
issue,'' Henry Weinstein, the newspaper's legal affairs writer,
said of the proposal to count sources. ``Obviously a lot of people
are very concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Parks, the newspaper's editor, called Willes' message
``a fairly courageous statement,'' and said, ``I think he saw quite
quickly that his intentions were misunderstood and he wanted to put
things right.''

   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is
holding 22 other Chinese men from the same boat on charges of

COMPAQ TO SHIFT A KEY ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ammirati Puris Lintas unit of the Interpublic
Group of Companies in New York will soon lose a crucial assignment
from Compaq Computer Corp. _ primary responsibility for the
strategic and creative development of traditional advertising
campaigns worldwide _ to the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom
Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ammirati Puris and Compaq announced late Tuesday that they had
``mutually agreed to end'' their relationship on that assignment.
Ammirati Puris will continue to handle interactive advertising for
Compaq as well as direct marketing and media duties. The combined
billings on the account were estimated at more than $200 million;
it was not immediately clear how they would be divided between the
two agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is effective when Compaq completes a deal to acquire
the Digital Equipment Corp., which could come later this month.
Ammirati Puris, which has worked for Compaq since 1991, has been
developing a brand campaign for several months. DDB Needham, the
Digital Equipment agency since 1994, jumped in with proposals for a
campaign that would promote the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unusual, perhaps, for the incumbent to not be carrying
forward,'' said Andrew Salzman, vice president for advertising and
brand strategy at Compaq in Houston, ``but the DDB Needham creative
approach best represented the brand image and personality we
wanted.''

PARIS _ The latest issue of GQ magazine features on its cover
Martina Hingis wearing a short, stunning white dress that's tighter
than, if possible, her groundstrokes. Hingis doesn't look like a
17-year-old in the photograph. No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she hardly looks 17 in a tennis dress, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a tennis dress, she is the oldest teen-ager in the history of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other girls, even some practically as young as her, have won
big. Hingis' pending hurdle in the French Open semifinals, Monica
Seles, once held the record for Grand Slam precociousness that
Martina broke. But none of them, Seles included, did it as she does
it, with a game evolved far beyond her linear years.
</P>
<P>
   Martina's tennis instincts defy logical explanation because such
sophisticated shot-making is presumably learned, not genetically
programmed at birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has never played teen-age tennis,'' says Heinz Gunthardt,
who coaches Steffi Graf, a former teen queen of some note. ``The
first time I saw her, she played adult tennis. When you see a
teen-ager, you see incredible shots. When I saw Martina, I did not
see her make incredible shots. She made it look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And she did it again Tuesday, putting her ``rivalry'' with Venus
Williams on hold until another day. It becomes a rivalry when
Williams spanks Hingis in a tournament that matters. That's when,
and only when, this thing between them turns into something.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Martina rules. Unequivocally. She's 6-2 against Venus
and leads 4-0 in Grand Slam tournaments won.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on appearances alone, Venus appears to be at the very least
Hingis' equal. After all, she is taller, faster, stronger and more
athletic, besides being 105 days older.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the match starts. The woman and the girl quickly
identify themselves. There's no absolutely no confusion as to which
is which.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Williams swatted a whole slew of more incredible
shots, hitting balls hard enough on occasion to make you wonder if
she belonged in the men's draw instead. But when they totaled up
the score of a much-anticipated Roland Garros quarterfinal, Hingis
was again an easy winner 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, she remains comfortably on track to complete a career
Grand Slam before she obtains her driver's license. Mon dieu!
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always leading,'' she said. ``I never thought if (Venus)
can beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   L'equipe, the French sports daily, tagged Williams ``La Menace''
to Hingis in its headline on a story previewing the match. As it
turned out, Venus proved a menace just to herself, committing
frequent double faults and 38 unforced errors. She was among the
first to concede she never stood a chance.
</P>
<P>
   A tough concession, by the way, given her plan to take over the
No. 1 ranking from Martina by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to have to get a little more serious,''
Williams said. ``It's probably good for me to lose, so I can really
see what I'm doing wrong, to really look at myself and say, `Venus,
you're not there.' That's what I have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have the opportunity. What is it, three weeks before
Wimbledon? I have all the time in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Three weeks is hardly long enough for her to learn how to
paint like Monet, which is basically how Hingis plays tennis.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case, Williams hit some of the best shots you
will ever see Tuesday _ and also some of the worst. On one serve,
she lost her grip on the racket and tossed it almost into the net.
She whacked several balls 20 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I got a little too excited,'' she admitted, ``really
wanting to hit a winner, maybe sometimes prematurely, also. Of
course, I have to do away with that. I have to take steps to make
sure it doesn't happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive points early in the match, as early as the second
game, summed up the difference between Hingis and Williams. Serving
after Hingis held, Venus had belted a ferocious, I mean truly
awesome, forehand down the line for a 40-15 lead, only to have
Martina counter with a delicately placed inside-out crosscourt
backhand that barely clipped the chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis got to deuce and wound up breaking as Williams chased
another ``my God!'' forehand winner with a pair of ``good God!''
net errors before swatting a backhand several feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The die was cast. You sort of sensed Venus was already dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to give Seles decent odds, either, despite a history
of French Open triumphs in her first tennis-playing life. Monica's
game, post-stabbing, never has rounded out to the extent Hingis'
already has. Seles remains a two-fisted slam-bammer and therefore
vulnerable to receiving a lopsided lesson in court geometry from
the kid.
</P>
<P>
   The kid, that is, who isn't one.

FBI GROUNDS FAKE ASTRONAUT WHO GAINED ACCESS TO SECURE NASA AREAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Texas, Ala., Fla.) 
 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ By falsely claiming to be an astronaut, a 48-year-old
Texas man gained access to NASA's most secure area, federal
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Alan Whittredge, who was arrested Sunday morning in his
Galveston County, Texas, home, faces charges of impersonating a
federal employee and of lying to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit by NASA special agent Joseph Gutheinz,
Whittredge used false credentials to gain access to Mission Control
at Marshall Space Center in Alabama during a November shuttle
mission, was given training on a flight simulator and attempted to
gain access to a fighter jet in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Besides claiming to be an astronaut, Whittredge also told
investigators and personnel from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration that he was a Medal of Honor winner and a CIA
official, the affidavit states.
</P>
<P>
   The biographical claims are repeated on an official looking
Internet Web page, beneath the title ``National Aeronautics and
Space Administration/Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center,'' in which
Whittredge is identified as a NASA astronaut and CIA agent.
</P>
<P>
   Gutheinz stated that NASA personnel records establish the
suspect was never an astronaut, military records show he never
received the Medal of Honor and a CIA official said that Whittredge
was never an employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When told it is a crime to lie to federal agents conducting a
criminal investigation and when presented information refuting his
story, Whittredge said that he understood the nature of the crime,
but that all his claims are true,'' Gutheinz wrote. ``He
subsequently repeated those assertions in his written statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Such claims led to a security breach in November at NASA's
facility in Huntsville, Ala., according to the affidavit by
Gutheinz. According to Gutheinz, who works for NASA's office of
Inspector General, Whittredge used his home computer to identify
himself as a CIA regent and astronaut on Nov. 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whittredge requested a tour of the facility based on the false
credentials,'' Gutheinz wrote. ``Whittredge claimed he would be
flying on a shuttle mission and was interested in payload
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, Whittredge was, on November 21-22, 1997, granted
a tour of Marshall Space Center and access to Mission Control. Mr.
Whittredge was permitted to sit at the console of NASA Mission
Control (NASA's most secure area) at Marshall Space Flight Center
during a shuttle mission.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, 1998, the affidavit continues, Whittredge gained
access to technical data on a space shuttle thrust propulsion
system that is not available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the affidavit states, Whittredge lied his way into a
meeting with senior pilots and the executive officer of the
Kingsville Naval Air Station in Texas. As a result, he was given
training on a T-45 Aircraft Flight Simulator, Gutheinz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Also in May, Whittredge attempted to obtain permission to fly a
T-45 aircraft at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla. The
affidavit does not state whether he was successful or not.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Moss, FBI special agent in Houston, could provide few
details on the case. ``We don't know what prompted him to do what
he's done _ it'll take a while to sort things out,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, spokespersons for NASA released no details about the
case, referring inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gutheinz's affidavit, released by that office, states that the
suspect has a plane, but no friends or job in the community. It
also states that he lives in a recreational vehicle, with a
permanent address in Florida, and has moved twice in the last eight
months, living in both League City and Galveston in southeast
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Web page that features the apparently fake biography of
Whittredge states that the suspect operated as an undercover agent
for the CIA for more than 20 years, including assignments in Japan,
Russia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that Whittredge is a Top Gun trophy winner for
his flights for the Navy, and has flown UH-1 Huey helicopters in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It states that he continued to work for the CIA but was assigned
to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``NASA Experience,'' the Web page states:
``Jerry was selected as an astronaut by NASA in March 1998 and will
report to NASA when his contract is issued. He will then complete
his training as a pilot/commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutheinz, in the affidavit, stated that Whittredge stuck by his
story _ even when confronted with facts to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg, a 22-year veteran of the Johnson Space Center and
now a private space consultant, said that there have been numerous
astronaut imposters in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been about a dozen over the last 30 years,'' Oberg
said. ``They usually show up in fake flight suits and give speeches
and sign autographs. They do it for wanting to indirectly bask in
that glory. Sometimes they use their own names, and sometimes these
people use the names of real astronauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say that if convicted on the most serious
charge _ impersonating a federal officer _ Whittredge could receive
five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. He made an initial
federal court appearance Tuesday and will have a bond hearing
Friday.

JAZZ NOT BUYING BULLS' `UNDERDOG' CLAIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utah Jazz appears to be the right team in
the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests, however, the Chicago Bulls are the wrong
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While the rested, ready and rolling Jazz talked up its genuine
chance to dethrone a dynasty in the NBA Finals, Michael Jordan
added fuel to his perpetual fire by pronouncing his five-time
champions as underdogs entering tonight's crucial Game 1 at the
Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're underdogs, sure,'' Jordan said. ``Utah has its house in
order. They've got what we've had over the years while we're
battling a lot of differences like age and losing focus because
we've been here so many times. To me, it's an added incentive
because this role is unfamiliar for us. Winning this one would be a
lot more gratifying, because it's going to be the toughest to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Added teammate Scottie Pippen: ``The pressure's not on us
because no one expects us to win. It's a different feeling for us
in that we've been sort of written off, but I like our position.''
</P>
<P>
   While the weary defending champs limp into the Finals after
surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers, the Jazz has
been patiently waiting 10 days since sweeping the Los Angeles
Lakers. Utah, which lost a close six-game series to the Bulls last
season, admits to having the talent, the game plan, the motivation
and the encouragement to beat Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Jazz forward Karl Malone isn't buying into
Chicago's mind games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all keep saying they're vulnerable, but I'm not falling for
it,'' Malone said. ``Underdogs? Yeah, right. I heard Michael say he
may be tired, but he's still got heart. Coming from him, that's all
I needed to hear. They're still the champs until we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   If not enthusiastically accepting the role of favorite, the Jazz
admits that this is the ideal situation for Utah to win the first
championship in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I imagine a better scenario to win a title?'' Jazz guard
Jeff Hornacek said. ``No. Well, yes, only if Michael had retired
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   While logic, statistics, trends and momentum point to a Jazz
triumph, Jordan emerges as The Great Equalizer. Almost every Jazz
advantage can be countered, if not erased, with ``Yeah, but the
Bulls have Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to say it,'' Utah's Shandon Anderson said. ``We
wanted the Bulls. Not only to win a championship, but to beat the
best team and the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan _ considering retirement after the season _ is to lose
a Finals series, this seems to be the best chance. A look at Utah's
top five apparent edges over a Bulls team that appears more
desperate and ripe than at any time during their run through the
'90s:
</P>
<P>
   Rust over fatigue. One of those two excuses will be used after
tonight's Game 1. Only once has a team headed into the Finals after
a longer layoff than Utah's 10 days. The '82 Lakers defeated the
76ers, 4-2, after sitting for 12. The Bulls, meanwhile, admit to
being physically drained after outlasting the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they'll be nice and tender for us,'' Malone said.
``I know Game 1 is the one they want. It's huge to the series. If
we can get it, our rest may kick in and so will their fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailman on the loose. With Brian Williams's speed and Jason
Caffey's bulk no longer in Chicago, the Bulls must try to guard
Malone with a combination of Dennis Rodman, Dickey Simpkins and
even Pippen. It was a disaster during the regular season, with
Malone averaging 33 points on 62 percent shooting after getting the
lighter Rodman in early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win this series with our big guys, so I'm putting
the pressure on them and myself,'' Malone said. ``I played like a
C-plus last year. This year I've got to bring my A game against
Dennis or whoever. I've seen it all, heard it all and done about
half of it myself. I respect Dennis, but I'm not amused or bothered
by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sucking air. The Jazz has three defenders _ Hornacek, Anderson
and Bryon Russell _ to run at Jordan. The Jazz, hoping Malone and
Jordan cancel each other out, plans on winning the series with its
deeper bench.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, is yet to have one of his trademark defining
games in these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the ace in the hole,'' said Jordan, who will attack Utah's
smaller defenders with post-ups. ``I can't say I'm not tired
physically, but my mind and my heart are refreshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jazz coach Jerry Sloan: ``We've got to keep a body between
him and the basket and make him shoot the jumper. Even then, you've
only got a 50 percent chance he'll miss. The real trouble comes
when you start letting him drive and then fouling him.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat offender. This will be the first time Chicago faced the
same opponent twice in the Finals. The Jazz shouldn't be
intimidated by the Bulls anymore, having beaten them twice in the
regular season, including a rally from 24 points down Feb. 5 at the
Delta Center. Last seasons, Utah lost three Finals games by two,
two and four points. And the past five Finals rematches have been
won by the team who lost the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   Home sweet home. The Bulls might be the best team ever on the
road in the Finals, but the Jazz is 43-6 at the Delta Center this
season and have won 10 of their past 11 playoff games. Chicago,
which failed to win in Indiana during the Eastern Conference
finals, will have to win at least once in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Home teams have won 206 of the 259 seven-game series since 1984.
Of the seven teams to sweep conference finals like the Jazz since
1977, six went on to win the title. And of the eight teams that
needed seven games to win the conference finals, only two won the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uphill battle and we know it,'' Jordan said. ``Some of
our swagger is probably gone, but nobody has taken anything away
from us yet.''

PIRATES TOP METS 5-2

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Brian Bohanon escaped a bases-loaded jam with a 3-0
count on the batter Tuesday night. Doing it twice was too much to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, who had been nicked for the tying run on back-to-back
bloop hits with two outs in the fourth, struck out Turner Ward with
one out and the bases loaded in the fifth after falling behind 3-0
in the count.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Young golfed a low and inside 3-0 pitch inside the
third-base bag into the left field corner for a three-run triple as
the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied for a 5-2 victory, their second in
as many nights over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Not even John Olerud's first stolen base in over two years could
prevent the Mets (31-22) from losing their second straight game. It
was the first time the Mets had lost two straight games since May
14-15.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon _ the self-described ``short/middle/long reliever'' _
has been one of the team's most valuable pitchers. He entered the
game after a 58-minute rain delay with a 2-1 third-inning lead and
a 1.58 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tied the game on Jose Guillen's two-out, inside-out
bloop double to right and Doug Strange's cracked-bat bloop single
to center. But Bohanon had no one to blame but himself for the
Pirates' winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran left-hander walked the pinch-hitter Jermaine
Allensworth with one out in the fifth. Tony Womack followed with a
single to left just inside the line. And then Bohanon hit Al Martin
with a 1-2 pitch to load up the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Ward, the No. 3 hitter in the Pittsburgh lineup, who
quickly took three balls. Bohanon fought back with a called strike.
Ward fouled three consecutive pitches off, before taking a called
third strike on the outside corner, the pitch registering just 78
mph on the Three Rivers Stadium radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon needed another out to escape the jam, but he quickly
fell behind Young, 3-0, too. Young responded by drilling what
probably would have been ball four down the line and into the
corner. And Bohanon (2-2) was headed for his second defeat of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Bohanon was pitching for the second time in
three days was because of the rain delay. Before the game, a
torrential thunderstorm with ping-pong-ball sized hail had pelted
the artificial turf. But it subsided, and the Mets held a 2-1 lead
on the strength of a Mike Piazza first-inning run-scoring single
and a Butch Huskey second-inning home run when it began to rain
again in the top of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storm passed, it had taken Mets starter Masato Yoshii
with it. Yoshii, who had allowed an unearned run in the first,
thanks to a two-base error in left by Bernard Gilkey, had thrown
only 24 pitches over the first two innings. But Manager Bobby
Valentine figured the almost hourlong wait was too much.
</P>
<P>
   So on came Bohanon, who either ran out of gas or out of luck
Tuesday night. &QL;

REAL QUIET WORKOUT IMPRESSES BAFFERT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ A relieved Bob Baffert said he was pleased with
Real Quiet's final workout before Saturday's Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based colt, who has been training at Churchill
Downs in Louisville, Ky., went 5 furlongs in 1:00 4/5 under
exercise rider Dana Barnes on Tuesday morning. Real Quiet is
scheduled to arrive at Belmont Park today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous this morning, but we're ready to party now,''
said Baffert, Real Quiet's trainer. ``He wanted to go too fast, so
(Barnes) had to take hold of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's recent strong workouts suggest he has recovered
from his post-Preakness fatigue. He'll try Saturday to become the
first horse to sweep the Triple Crown race since Affirmed 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The number of confirmed opponents grew to nine Tuesday when
Hanuman Highway was upgraded from ``possible'' by Kathy Walsh, the
gelding's California-based trainer. Decisions haven't been
announced on two other ``possibles,'' Grand Slam and Limit Out.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas indicated that if Grand Slam runs, Jerry
Bailey might ride him, leaving stablemate Yarrow Brae to Mike
Smith.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ Like anything that is left to hang around too long
_ milk, cheese, old shoes _ even the greatest sports dynasties will
go bad.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where, after all these years, we are with the mighty
NBA franchise from Chicago, a sour, spoiled bunch that this spring

   The great Michael Jordan slips and falls and complains the refs

a grudge for the past four years.

injustice and paints complex pictures of conspiracies hiding behind
every backboard and never gives his opponents credit.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a team more closely lived up to its nickname than the
Bulls, who in the waning days of their reign over our sports in the
'90s are dropping so many cow patties on their legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody else sick and tired of the Bulls and the bull?

   Not of Jordan and the magical way he can elevate his body and
his game at the most critical of times. But of Nike and Gatorade
and agent David Falk and all of the rest of the corporate carnival
sideshow that follows basketball's version of Elvis on and off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Talented but troubled
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to admire the way the Bulls reach down into
their vast well of playoff experience to extricate themselves from
the tightest of situations. But it is something else to be forced
to follow along with the soap-opera travails of a dozen
rich-beyond-imagination young men and their manipulative,
condescending coach constantly whining about a lack of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Cindy Crawford complaining about the mole on her cheek,
and you are on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to stay up nights fretting for Pippen, who
insisted on getting a long-term contract extension and now
considers himself grossly underpaid at $2.8 million per year and
might have to flee Chicago to find justice in a cold world.
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to be sympathetic that Jordan _ who earns $33
million for a single season of playing basketball _ might be be
asked to play next year for a different coach. One who might not
simply sit on the bench clipping his fingernails while turning over
the de facto running of the team to His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to be outraged that the coach _ Jackson _ has
spent the past half-dozen years publicly and personally ridiculing
the general manager who hired him and now might be told to look
elsewhere for employment. Before the season, Jackson said wild
horses could not drag him back to the Bulls after this season. Now,
he sniffs and moans and does a weepy little tap dance to say he's
being reluctantly pushed out the door.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, what happens when we turn great athletes
into off-the-court idols who are bigger than Godzilla. Eventually,
the cold-blooded lizard will turn and bite you.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is a burden these days for the Bulls _ management,
the media, the referees, their opponents. It is tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls exude arrogance
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls win a game, the worshipful Chicago media usually
genuflect in the direction of Jordan and call it divinely inspired.
When the other team wins _ as Indiana did three times in the last
series _ it is written off in satanic verses as some kind of
hellish conspiracy concocted by the NBA and NBC, who we are told
would inexplicably like to kill off their golden goose.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have come to believe they've been cast in the
permanent role of the good guys, preordained to always win. It is
an arrogance that emanates from Jackson, the luckiest man this side
of Ringo Starr, who by happenstance fell into greatness.
</P>
<P>
   They have bosses they don't love. How original. They have jobs
that force them to get up by the crack of noon. How terrible. They
have agents who make them get by on six figures a month. How
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they must face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals for the
second straight year, and we'll listen to complaints about the
dearth of entertainment options from Rodman. Just call it Mormons
vs. moron.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone and John Stockton await. Never has all that Jazz
seemed such an appealing alternative to so much Bull.

HASEK DOMINATES, AND SABRES ARE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Buffalo Sabres, sixth-place finishers in their
conference and 23 years removed from their only appearance in the
Stanley Cup finals, averted another elimination from the playoffs
Tuesday night and kept their championship hopes flickering.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres defeated the Washington Capitals, 2-1, at the MCI
Center in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals. By winning, the
Sabres cut the Capitals' lead to three games to two, forcing the
four-of-seven-game series back to Buffalo for a sixth game on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley, a former draft pick of the Capitals, kept the
Sabres' season going with a brilliant unassisted goal that broke a
1-1 tie with 4 minutes 26 seconds to play in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Two more victories and the Sabres will have provided another
stunning notch to their season by reaching the final round for the
first time since the 1974-75 season, which is the season the
Capitals began play in the National Hockey League. Two more
victories, and Buffalo will be looking to add either the Dallas
Stars or the defending champion Detroit Red Wings to its list of
playoff victims this season.
</P>
<P>
   After both teams scored in first period Tuesday night, neither
team was able to score in the second period and for most of the
third. Dominik Hasek would not allow the Capitals to, and the
Sabres just couldn't. Until Woolley split the Capitals' defense,
skated in alone on Olaf Kolzig and put the puck between the
goalie's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Sabres were even in a position to win the
game so late in the third period was the heroics of their
goaltender, Hasek, who made 34 saves in what was his best game of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who poked fun at himself at practice on Sunday, taping a
sign to his back that read ``Swiss cheese,'' was stellar Tuesday
night. After allowing two soft goals in Game 4, one from 70 feet
out, Hasek was spectacular in doing what he does best _ steal a
game with timely saves. His heroics in the second and third periods
kept a lifeless Sabres team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, with the score tied, 1-1, Hasek stopped the
Capitals sniper Peter Bondra on a clean breakaway for the second
time in the game. Then he stuffed Adam Oates' wraparound attempt,
the second time Hasek stuffed Oates from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   When the momentum in this series shifted to Washington last
Saturday in Buffalo, so did the pressure to win _ for both teams.
The Sabres' Game 4 loss at home put them down by 3-1; it meant they
were no longer expected to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the onus fell on the Capitals. Now they had to close
the deal. But the Capitals had been in this position many times.
And yes, there was a large bone stuck in Washington's throat in
those past series.
</P>
<P>
   Five times they had taken a two-game lead in a playoff series.
Three of those times they led by three games to one but choked,
failing to win the series. Tuesday night's game was their first
chance, and maybe their best, to put away the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the ice was a team that had already
accomplished more than expected. After qualifying as the
sixth-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, the Sabres beat a very
talented Philadelphia Flyers team in the first round. They followed
that upset with a sweep of the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams looked uneasy during the first few minutes Tuesday
night. Missed passes and misfired shots led to many blown
opportunities. The score was tied, 1-1, after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres got the game's first break. Darryl Shannon scored on
a weak shot from the top of the left circle that somehow got behind
Kolzig. It gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead 6:33 into the game. Kolzig
never saw the puck as it went through a maze of sticks and skates
before sneaking through his pads.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Nikolishin's power-play goal at 16:29 tied the score at
1-1. Nikolishin intercepted an errant pass as he skated hard to the
net. With the puck on his stick, and no one between him and Hasek,
Nikolishin put the puck through on the short side. &QL;

EQUINE PSYCHES TOUGH TO FIGURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The crowded stables at most U.S. racetracks look
nothing like rolling Montana ranch land. And few racehorse trainers
and owners will be mistaken for Robert Redford and Kristin Scott
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The Horse Whisperer,'' the Redford movie based on the
Nicholas Evans novel, is not about racing. Sorry, if you hoped to
see a man reach into the darkest recesses of a horse's psyche and
pull out a winning exacta combination.
</P>
<P>
   But the film has struck a chord with racehorse handlers, who
frequently must play equine psychologist to their flighty charges,
trying to ease fears or soften violent natures or solve the
infinite riddles in between.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, the jockey for Triple Crown hopeful Real Quiet,
referred to ``The Horse Whisperer'' in discussing his lifeline
affinity for the animals. ``That's exactly what I am,'' Desormeaux
said. ``I'm a person who tries to get in touch with a horse with
nothing but hand and vocal (signals).''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, few racing horsemen would claim to be horse
whisperers, the legendary figures who (as Evans wrote) ``could see
into the creature's soul and soothe the wounds they found there.''
But all would say the task of keeping horses in shape between the
ears is at least as important as keeping them physically fit, the
part of a trainer's job with which fans are familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two are very much intertwined,'' said Neil
Drysdale, the trainer of five Breeders' Cup winners, at his
Hollywood Park barn. In that way, he said, horses are like young
human athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major (difference) is that horses can't talk to you. But
if they could talk,'' Drysdale said with a laugh, ``they'd lie to
you just as much as human athletes do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, horses' most debilitating quirks would be gone before
they get to a racetrack, the rough edges smoothed by the people who
``break'' them (the word being left over from less-enlightened
times when whip lashes and brute force were the accepted ways of
teaching horses to be ridden).
</P>
<P>
   But when horses do arrive at the track with problems, they are
likely to be deeply ingrained. In fact, trainer Mike Machowsky
estimates that 60 to 70 percent of racehorses have idiosynchrasies
that, if if not dealt with, would limit their racing potential.
</P>
<P>
   Some horses are afraid to step onto their black, rubber bathing
mats, which appear to them to be bottomless pits. Some mistake a
topiary shrub in the Hollywood Park saddling paddock for a real
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed,'' said Tim Yakteen, an assistant to Real
Quiet trainer Bob Baffert, ``how many colts nicker at that thing
and get turned on.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale had an otherwise well-behaved filly at Santa Anita who,
every time she was led out of the barn, would shy from, well,
!ital!something!off!.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never figure out what she was shying from,'' the
trainer said. ``But five years later, we had her daughter. And the
only thing she ever did wrong was to shy at that exact same spot.
It must have been genetic memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But those are relatively minor problems.
</P>
<P>
   One stall-walking filly mystified Ron McAnally, the trainer best
known for his success with the belligerent gelding John Henry and
the anxiety-ridden mare Bayakoa. One day, a McAnally friend, who
happened to be an astrologer, visited the barn to watch the trainer
work. The man was fascinated by the nervous filly. He pointed to an
empty horse pen outside and said, ``Why don't you put her out
there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said it was, was that she was claustrophobic,''
McAnally said.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, McAnally tried it, and the filly settled down. Since
then, he has used outdoor pens for lots of horses, including the
current stakes mare Alzora, who seems to be reassured by watching
the races from a spot above the Hollywood Park backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it doesn't take an astrologer to solve ``problem
horses'' _ or, as Redford's horse whisperer would say, ``horses
with people problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's as simple as an equipment change, like adding or
removing blinkers, or finding the right exercise rider, which seems
to have helped Drysdale's unpredictable turf star Labeeb.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, if, say, the horse fears the starting gate, forcing
him to go through the gate repeatedly could make it second nature.
</P>
<P>
   The first step with a problem horse, the trainers say, is to
make sure the misbehavior isn't a sign of injury or illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they're just outsmarting us'' by refusing to run,
Yakteen said. ``Sometimes they're trying to tell you something.
People don't give these horses enough credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the personality quirk might be the result of heredity, of
mishandling or misadventure early in life, or of the abrupt change
in scenery from a farm to a racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a country boy coming to the big city,'' said trainer
Carla Gaines, who, appropriately, counseled juvenile delinquents in
her native Alabama before indulging her love of horses.
</P>
<P>
   Herd animals by nature, horses frequently dislike the
confinement of a racetrack stall. To cure a restless mare, Gaines
lowered a side wall so the horse could ``talk'' to her neighbor. To
amuse a filly who busied herself piling her straw in the middle of
the stall, Gaines bought a big, purple, rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get very, very creative,'' said Gaines, who once
cheered up a lonely horse by putting a mirror in the stall.
</P>
<P>
   Outsmart us, will they?
</P>
<P>
   At trainer Richard Mandella's Hollywood Park barn, the mare
Advancing Star was soothed by the companionship of the goat that
shared her stall for three blissful years. Then, one morning in
April while Advancing Star was at the track, the goat staggered out
of the stall and dropped dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella's assistants scrambled. They fetched another horse's
goat and put it in Advancing Star's stall before the mare returned.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing Star never seemed to notice it was a different goat.

49ERS SURVIVE AND ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Imagine if Dave Snow ever decided to market his
Dirtbag playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Why, there'd be teams all over the country with patches on their
knees, their ace pitcher going out for the biggest game of his life
with his finger glued
</P>
<P>
   together, and then knocking off some bigtime spit-and-polish
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Long Beach State did on Tuesday, adding high and
mighty Miami to the growing list of giants to fall victim to the
49ers, who continue to dance merrily along in the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we are - Dirtbags,'' right fielder Chuck Lopez
said, proudly, just after delivering the key hit in the 49ers'
improbable three-run, ninth-inning rally that beat, Miami, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't know what Dirtbag baseball is all about by
now, they never will,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past week and a half, at the West Regional at
Stanford and here at the CWS, the 49ers have eliminated Stanford,
Alabama, Florida State and Miami - every one one of them, at one
time or another this year, ranked among the top five college teams
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange sight indeed at the post-game press conference
- a quartet of high Miami draft picks, including the No. 1 player
taken Tuesday, Pat Burrell, trying to explain what went wrong, then
the 49ers showing up with, among others, Mike Hota, who had more
hits Tuesday (three) than he did his first two years
</P>
<P>
   at Long Beach State (two).
</P>
<P>
   How long can the 49ers (43-22-1) keep it going?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to keep it together one more day,'' said Snow, the
49ers' coach, ``and the day after that ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The next test will come this evening: Arizona State, one of two
undefeated teams remaining in the CWS (Louisiana State is the
other). The 49ers have to beat ASU twice, tonight and Friday, for a
crack at Saturday's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible?
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to thrive on beating better teams,'' Lopez said,
anxious for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It was another staggering season-ender for Miami relief ace
Robbie Morrison, the victim of the 49ers' flurry of ... well, stuff
</P>
<P>
   , in the ninth inning. It was nowhere near as dramatic as when
he was tagged for a two-run, two-out homer in the bottom of the
ninth by LSU's Warren Morris that cost Miami the CWS crown, but,
from the sound of it, no less painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Morrison said of the '96 Series, ``was a big moment in
my life ... and my goal, all of our goals, was to win the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Morrison who blew away the 49ers in the ninth inning of
Game 2, striking out three of the four batters he faced. And it was
Morrison again on Tuesday, who entered the game in the eighth and
promptly erased a 49er threat with a pickoff and a strikeout, then
started the ninth with the score tied, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hall, who earlier in the game slugged his seventh homer -
but also committed two errors - started the ninth with a single.
Then, Sam Monroy, a pinch hitter, and one of the 49ers' better
bunters, first showed bunt, then pulled back and slapped a bounder
toward second. The second baseman, Manny Crespo, fielded the ball,
but shortstop Bobby Hill was on the right field side of second
base, and Hall slid under his tag. Two on, nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Terrmel Sledge bunted to first baseman Rick Saggese, who,
unwisely, tried to force Hall at third. His throw wasn't close.
Bases loaded, nobody out, and Lopez the batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get some pitch that was up,'' Lopez said
later. ``I was trying to hit a fastball, that didn't work, so I hit
a good curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   A 0-2 curve, bouncing it over the Hurricanes' drawn-in infield,
scoring two runs and sending Sledge to third. Sledge then scored on
a wild pitch for a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the little things, we didn't,'' said Miami coach Jim
Morris. ``The little things got us . . . the hit-and-run, putting
guys in motion, their defense on the bunt plays . . . they got it
done when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not right away. The 49ers, despite 11 hits over the first
six innings, managed just two runs while stranding seven runners,
four of them in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``One inning I thought our offense was pressing a little,'' said
left-hander Mike Gallo, the 49ers' starter, ``so I was going around
the dugout trying to pump up everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo needed some pumping himself; the index finger on his
pitching hand had two painful blisters. The 49ers put in a call to
Bill Buhler, the former longtime Dodger trainer, who prescribed . .
. super glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Nu Skin but, I swear, it smells like super glue,''
said Gallo, who had a new layer applied each inning and said it
didn't bother him at all on the mound. Gallo worked six innings,
striking out eight, and making just one slip: the 2-2 pitch he
threw to Aubrey Huff in the second inning he hit for a two-run
homer to tie the score. Dennis Kordich, the third 49er pitcher, got
the win, and Jason Marr pitched the ninth for his ninth save and
second in the CWS.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes broke the tie with a run in the fifth, then the
49ers got even again in the sixth, and in typical Dirtbag style.
Hota led off with an infield single. Scott Redfox, whose three-run
homer beat Florida State earlier, bunted Hota to second. Then Jason
Yount, who little by little is emerging from his late-season slump
- he's 4-for-9 in the CWS - singled Hota home.
</P>
<P>
   Said Miami's Morris: ``They made all the plays.''

 &HT;    Four Georgians go in first round
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Corey Patterson's youthful devotion to the hometown
Braves ended Tuesday when the suburban Atlanta's Harrison High
School baseball star was drafted by the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, the third player selected in the amateur draft,
became the highest Atlanta-area draft pick since 1970, and was one
of four Georgians selected in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder J.D. Drew of Hahira, Ga., who would not sign with the
Phillies after being selected No. 2 last year, was chosen fifth by
St. Louis. Shortstop Adam Everett, another Harrison High product
who played college ball at South Carolina, was taken by Boston with
the 12th pick. And outfielder Rick Elder of suburban Sprayberry
High was taken 26th by Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the big reasons for the upgrade in talent in
this state is the coaches have gotten much better, and that
reflects on the players,'' said Paul Snyder, the Braves' director
of scouting and player development.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Philadelphia selected University of Miami third
baseman Pat Burrell with the top pick, and Michigan State pitcher
Mark Mulder was selected second by Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, without a first-round choice, took right-hander Matt
Belisle of Austin, Texas (McCallum High), with their first pick,
52nd overall.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson hit .560 for the Class AAAA state champion Hoyas with
22 home runs, 61 RBIs and 36 stolen bases. The last area high
school player to be selected that high was Decatur's Mike Ivie, who
was picked No. 1 by the Padres in 1970. In 1967, Ron Blomberg of
Druid Hills was taken No. 1 by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson knows he's stepping into a pressure-cooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I have talked about (the pressure), and the only
thing I can do is go out and experience everything and act like a
professional,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who had signed a letter of intent to play at Georgia
Tech, is expected to get a signing bonus of about $2 million. He
got the call from Cubs general manager Ed Lynch just after 1 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been waiting to play professional baseball since I was
a little kid,'' Patterson said. ``I'm just glad the Cubs showed
interest. Now I have to go out and help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are expected to convert Burrell into a first
baseman, because they already have last year's rookie of the year,
Scott Rolen, at third. ``I've had experience with that position
before,'' Burrell said, ``and it's something I'm comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis may have taken a chance on Drew. He turned down a
potential $6 million deal _ $3 million was guaranteed _ from the
Phillies last year. Drew wants a signing bonus of $10 million. The
Cardinals may be willing to give Drew more than the Phillies
offered, but it's unlikely they'd agree to his current demands.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Burroughs, son of former Braves player Jeff Burroughs, was
taken ninth by San Diego. Burroughs, from Long Beach (Calif.) High,
is a power-hitting third baseman.

 &HT;    Student drops grievance against school after NHS entry denied
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Amanda Lemon has decided against pursuing a
formal grievance with Xenia High School about its decision to
exclude her from National Honor Society because she has a baby.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 18-year-old said Tuesday she still plans to fill
out forms she received from the Office of Civil Rights for the U.S.
Department of Education in Cleveland to see whether discrimination
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon said she hopes that may help future students. But as for
herself, she said she is ready to move on with her life.
</P>
<P>
   She'll participate in Xenia High School's commencement at
University of Dayton Arena tonight and plans to attend Sinclair
Community College in the fall with the goal of becoming an
occupational therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I made my point. I got so much support, it was
amazing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon, who had a 3.8 grade point average, was accepted into the
National Honor Society earlier this spring but was later told the
five-member faculty council reversed its decision after learning
she has a 11-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon, who spent her days at the Greene County Career Center,
initially wrote a letter filing a grievance with the principal
because she believes the faculty council's decision violated a
federal law (Title IX of Educational Amendments of 1972), which
prohibits schools from keeping pregnant or parenting students from
membership in organizations like the National Honor
</P>
<P>
   Society.
</P>
<P>
   The principal upheld the faculty council's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Superintendent Judy Hennessey said Lemon hasn't filed
the grievance form. ``We haven't heard anything from her,''
Hennessey said.

YANKEES' HERNANDEZ TO START WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez, the pitcher who defected from Cuba
in December with an adventurous high-seas escape, came very close
Tuesday to achieving his goal of reaching the major leagues. But
his highly anticipated debut, unnecessary Tuesday night, instead
will come Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has been playing in the Yankees' minor league
system, was brought to Yankee Stadium and told to be ready to pitch
in case the pain in David Wells' left shoulder kept him from
starting. Wells was able to pitch, but now a minor injury to David
Cone's pitching hand will give Hernandez his first major league
start.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman said after the game that Cone was
bitten by his mother's dog and will have to miss his scheduled
start Wednesday night against Tampa Bay. So, Hernandez is starting
in Cone's place.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, meanwhile, pitched eight innings Tuesday night and Derek
Jeter hit a three-run homer as the Yankees beat the Chicago White
Sox, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   When told that he would start, Cashman said that Hernandez said:
``Great, great. OK, OK. Everything has happened so fast.'' After
being told, Hernandez the first five innings of the game then went
to an undisclosed hotel to rest. To make room on the roster for
Hernandez, reliever Todd Erdos was optioned to Class AAA Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who was nipped on his right index finger Sunday night by a
Jack Russell Terrier puppy owned by his mother, said: ``I thought
about lying, sure. And I was worried I wouldn't remember how the
lie goes. It's extremely frustrating. Obviously this affects other
people in the clubhouse. A puppy's dog bite affects people's
careers, some good, some bad. It's just a freak thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the decision to pitch Hernandez Wednesday night,
Cone said, ``From a team standpoint it's better to let him know
than to have him pitch on short notice''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in Yankee Stadium will be the realization of the dream
Hernandez envisioned when he set out to sea with seven countrymen
last Dec. 26. After a harrowing journey in which they sustained
themselves on crabs, the defectors were rescued by the U.S. Coast
Guard and delivered to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Hernandez, the older brother of Florida Marlins
pitcher Livan Hernandez, went to Costa Rica. While he was there, on
March 6, the Yankees signed him to a four-year, $6.6 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the minors he whet appetites by compiling a 7-1 record with
Class A Tampa and Class AAA Columbus, and his promotion to the
majors _ blocked by the Yankees' strong starting pitching staff _
was eagerly awaited. But the uncertainty over Wells, and now Cone's
injury, has put the right-hander on baseball's biggest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yankees tried to keep Hernandez's introduction to the
major leagues a muted one. The team was cautious and about bringing
the pitcher aboard, having learned its lesson a year ago when its
organized coronation of Hideki Irabu nearly smothered the Japanese
pitcher. The announcement of his promotion came early in the day
and was low key, and he was shielded from the news media before the
game because of the possibility that he might pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shared a few quiet words with his teammates, coaches
and Manager Joe Torre, saying tentative hellos in English while
conversing mostly in Spanish with the Yankees' large contingent of
Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a buzz in the air,'' Yankees catcher Joe Girardi said
as the crowd of reporters swelled in the Yankees clubhouse because
of the mere possibility that Hernandez might pitch.
</P>
<P>
   There was a buzz, not to mention genuine appreciation of
Hernandez, the person as well as the pitcher. Deprived of the right
to play baseball after Livan defected, Hernandez, whose age has
been estimated from 28 to 32, broke from his internal exile and
made a decision not many Yankees could even contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brave man,'' Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base
coach and fellow Cuban who left his country as a legal immigrant
equipped with a visa in 1961. ``If I was in his shoes, I don't feel
I would jump into a little fishing boat and risk my life. When
you're desperate you'll do anything. God bless him, he was
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who have dreams sacrifice something sooner or
later,'' said Torre, ``but in baseball where age is so important,
you have to make that decision to go for it. It's scary when the
known is scarier than the unknown. It must have been horrible over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez would follow not only his brother but celebrated
Cubans like Tony Perez, Luis Tiant and Cardenal. ``What I would
really like to see is El Duque face Arrojo,'' Costabile said,
referring to Rolando Arrojo, the young Cuban defector who know
anchors the rotation of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the expansion
team that will make its debut at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the dreams already associated with Hernandez. The
Yankees cannot prevent such anticipation. They can only attempt to
better control it than they did last year with Irabu, proceeding
slowly rather than sensationally.
</P>
<P>
   So even before Wells warmed up and was judged ready to go, Torre
was laying out the thinking on Hernandez. Even if the Cuban had
been activated, and had pitched brilliantly, Torre said, ``I think
this is just the one start. There's still no spot for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? A team that started the day 38-13 has few flaws, and
even fewer struggling starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that has struggled has been Andy Pettitte, and you're
not going to eliminate him from the rotation,'' said Torre. As for
the lessons learned from Irabu's rugged entry, Torre said: ``If the
need was crying I have a sense he would have been up here sooner
than now, but they want to be cautious.'' &QL;

COYOTES TO BUILD ARENA?  
 NEW FACILITY POSSI BLE IF AWA STAYS AS IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes are pursuing the possibility of building
an arena in the Valley if efforts to renovate America West Arena
fail, according to team president Shawn Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter emphasized the team's first option is to stay at America
West Arena, where it ju st completed the second year of a five-year
lease. The Coyotes, the city of Phoenix and arena management are
considering a plan to renovate the facility to eliminate the 4,300
obstructed view seats for hockey.
</P>
<P>
   That plan could cost around $20
</P>
<P>
   million and possibly shut down the arena for at least a portion
of two summers. The exact cost of the plan, and who would pay for
it, have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Coyotes ``are not putting their eggs in one
basket,'' said Hunter , who declined to reveal specifics of the
Coyotes' pursuit of a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is find a situation that allows us to be
successful in the long term,'' Hunter said. ``We continue to
explore all of our options, some of which are exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving out of Arizona is not one of those options, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our options are in the Valley of the Sun,'' he said.
``I think the fans have proven that this is going to be one of the
premier markets in the lea gue.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Richard Burke said last fall that if the team did decide
to build an arena, it would be done with little or no burden to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very creative,'' Hunter said. ``I'm not saying
we would eliminate this a s an option, but we would prefer not to
go to the public and say, `Vote on building us an arena.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But arenas today cannot be built 100 percent on private
dollars. The key is, how can you get to a model that is good for a
city and good for a team?''
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the Coyotes are expected to announce they will
not raise ticket prices for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average ticket price in the NHL increased 6 percent
last year, it's not ``terribly unusual'' for a team to hold the
line on prices for a year, said Sean Brenner, editor of ``Team
Marketing'' Report''.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of teams budget ticket prices in two- or three-year
increments,'' he said. A team that doesn't raise prices one year
might hike them s ubstantially in following years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ticket price announcement, Hunter and Burke
are expected to discuss arena issues at an open house later this
week at their Scottsdale facility, the Cellular One Ice Den.
</P>
<P>
   They
</P>
<P>
   maintain the Coyotes cannot be financially successful if they
stay in America West Arena under present conditions. The obstructed
view seats and a lease that limits their revenue from advertising
and sponsorships are issues that need to be addresse d, Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes would like to have a renovation plan in place before
next summer, when construction would have to start. If the plan
falls through, the team probably would increase its efforts to
build its own facility.
</P>
<P>
   T here are inherent problems with that, however. Burke has
expressed reluctance to enter the arena business. Financing such a
structure is always complicated, and it's questionable if the
Valley could support another arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are no longer considering becoming a part of the
Cardinals plans to build a new complex in the East Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The city wants to keep the Coyotes at America West Arena,
provided it makes economic sense, said Dave Krietor, the city's
director of communi ty and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coyotes bring about 700,000 people into downtown Phoenix
each year and are a significant generator of both people and
excitement,'' Krietor said. &QL;

WILL RODMAN'S ACT HURT BULLS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salt Lake City - He has a glimmering chance to show his worth ,
rescue his teammates, prove he isn't just a self-obsessed moron
fading into pop culture oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis Rodman is going to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't relax in Utah,'` Rodman said. ``It's not my scene
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, it's OK,'` Bulls Coach Phil Jackson said. ``If it
helps him get to bed and to sleep at night, then fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Everyone goes to Vegas to catch up on his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Just once, it would be nice to see Rodman pour all his focus
into basketball , recognize the ``scene'' he abhors happens to be
the quest for an NBA championship. But more than anything, it would
be nice if Jackson dropped the peace pipe and put down his foot.
Just once.
</P>
<P>
   So it is somewhat ominous that the Bulls need Rodma n more than
ever. They are porous in the post and need someone to stop Karl
Malone. They are a tired bunch that needs an infusion of energy,
which happens to be a Rodman specialty. At least it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very exhausting,'' Rodman sa id. ``We're not 25,
26-year-old antelopes anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So it makes perfect sense to fly to Vegas after Game 1. Or
during the off-day. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for a couple of hours,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Last year during the Finals, Rod man was allowed to leave his
teammates and bolt to Las Vegas. It was a move that infuriated both
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, and why not?
</P>
<P>
   After all, when Rodman wasn't calling the natives a bunch of
bleeping Mormons and throwing colored
</P>
<P>
   chips around a casino, he was getting absolutely flattened by
Malone. And if it wasn't for Jordan crawling out of a sickbed to
steal Game 5, it's likely the Jazz would be the defending champions
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   So what'll make this any differ ent?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this year is going to be a little less talk, a lot
more action,'' Rodman said. ``It's very difficult to play Karl
Malone. The slightest touch, and they call the foul. But this year,
I'll be more aggressive, more useful. Karl Mal one is no different
than anyone else. He just has less hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Rodman has not been paying attention to Rogaine. As
for his plan to stop the semi-trailer in shorts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, brother,'' Rodman said. ``I'm going to have to t
ell his wife to go somewhere else and let me sleep with him for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Malone will hear Rodman's comments, and he will shrug
them off. If there's one person immune to Rodman's antics, it's
Malone. He remembers Rodman long before the hair dye and nose
rings, before he became the most celebrated Madonna wannabe in
history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Malone knew Rodman when he was a lanky, introverted kid
only a few years removed from his job as an airport janitor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Jazz d on't need any added incentive to end
Chicago's reign. Their coach, Jerry Sloan, is a hard-nosed leader
who recently cleansed himself of any loyalty to the Bulls. They are
2-0 against Chicago this season, and have won 10 of 11 games. They
will not su ffer from stage fright; they are the first opponent to
get a second crack at Chicago in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Logic will tell you that the Jazz will win the series. Except
nothing logical has ever applied to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   For all the analysis over U tah's prolonged layoff, this much is
true: Whether it helps or not, the Jazz are under tremendous
pressure to win the first two games at the Delta Center. Because of
the rest. Because they are facing the least potent Bulls' team to
grace the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no Brian Williams, no Jason Caffey, no time for
the champions to catch their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need to do is win Game 1 or Game 2 here,'' Rodman said.
``And the series is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Rodman will have much to do with the outcome. He
might surprise us. Or he might leave his game at the craps table,
fiddling like a fool while Rome is burning. &QL;

ASU'S MILLS DRAFTED IN FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It was an odd place to learn about the rest of
</P>
<P>
   your life, on a practice field in the heart of Nebraska with
cars and freight trains rattling nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But tuning out distractions has been Ryan Mills' forte, and the
Arizona State pitcher seemed at peace Tuesday after learning he was
sele cted sixth overall by the Minnesota Twins in Major League
Baseball's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' Mills said. ``It's an exciting time
for me, but it's also a little weird because I didn't expect to be
in a College World Series when I found out. My mind's been on other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I know where I'm going. I'm a Minnesota Twin, and I'm
ready to roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills is the highest Sun Devil to be drafted since Antone
Williamson went with the fourth pick to the Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   Brewers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Five other ASU players were selected Tuesday. Pitcher Phill
Lowery was taken by the Florida Marlins in the sixth round. The
remaining four went to National League West teams: infielder Andrew
Beinbrink, Colorado Rockies (10th
</P>
<P>
   round); infielder Dan Meier, Diamondbacks (14th); pitcher Aaron
Kramer, San Diego Padres (18th); and infielder Richy Leon, Rockies
(23rd).
</P>
<P>
   Mills is close to agreeing to a contract that includes a $2
million signing bonus. The left-hander turn ed down $575,000 from
the New York Yankees in high school, a decision many criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will show the nature of things is rapid-fire or slow
as molasses,'' said Jeff Moorad, Mills' adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been afraid to step up a nd set a market. Our
preference is for a quick process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' top pick last season (No. 9 overall), Michael
Cuddyer, signed a $1.85 million deal. The No. 6 pick overall last
year, Geoff Goetz, received $1.75 million from the New York M ets.
</P>
<P>
   Mills feels confident a deal will be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   He was not surprised by the news. He had been on the phone
Monday night with Moorad, who suggested this was the scenario that
was likely to unfold, despite an indication by the Chicag o Cubs
that they might select him with the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the deal is pretty close to being done,'' Mills said.
``This whole thing just hasn't sunk in yet. I probably don't
realize what it means because there are so many other things I' m
thinking about right now. I'm excited and just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins have had odd relationships with their top draft picks.
They lost Travis Lee to the Diamondbacks after Moorad, also Lee's
agent, took advantage of a loophole that allo wed Lee to become a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Mills will start with the Twins in Class A ball, with either
their upper-level club in Fort Myers, Fla., or their lower-division
A team in Fort Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Mills learned the news Tuesday during practice for today's
College World Series game against Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately called his parents and was later approached by
many of his teammates, who offered their congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's well-deserved,'' outfielder Mikel Moreno sai d.
``He's been through a lot. He's a great pick and will be an impact
player pretty soon. He's worthy of that high pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery knew little about the Marlins but enough to be pleased
with the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're world champions ,'' he said. ``I'm really
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier watched two of his teammates get selected by Colorado, his
home state, while he will stay close to his new home since the
Diamondbacks picked him in the 14th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised,'' he sa id. ``I was told by three or
four scouts that I'd go between 10 and 15, but until you hear it. .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Pat Murphy was pleased how the day went for his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very satisfying for any coach,'' he said. ``You love to
see th e players get a great opportunity after coming to college. I
think this program, because of the schedule it plays and how it's
upheld its expectations, that's helped the players along.''
</P>
<P>
   More ASU players, including Moreno, Greg Halvorson and Jer emy
Jones, likely will be selected as the draft continues today and
Thursday.  &QL;

DRAFT STEALS SPOTLIGHT FROM SERIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Omaha, Neb. - This is what Major League Baseball should have
done: Hold the amateur draft next Tuesday. Invite the top players
and their parents. Televise the first round live, with Bud Selig at
the podium introducing each pick, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sixth pick, the Minnesota Twins select
</P>
<P>
   left-handed pitcher Ryan Mills, from Arizona State . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mills ascends the stage, like a graduating senior. He puts on a
Twins cap. Flashes his youthful smile. Baseball promotes the fresh
faces of the future to millions of TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how baseball does it.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:45 p.m. Tuesday, a reporter told Pat Murphy the news. The
ASU coach, seated in the dugout, asked, ``Who should we have tell
Mills?''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy turned to the kid seated next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go tell him, Chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Gosewisch, an ASU player on the injured list, knows Mills
well. They were teammates at Horizon High School.
</P>
<P>
   Gosewisch left the dugout and began the long walk around the
University of Nebraska-Omaha ballpark , where he found his friend
sitting alone in a patch of shade in right field, his back against
the chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   The two spoke, shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mills found a pay phone and called his parents. &QL; 
At least it's over &QL; 
Moments later, the Sun Devils ace was looking into TV cameras,
fielding questions. How about the Twins? How much is your bonus?
How soon will you sign? Who is your agent?
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Mills doesn't have an agent. He has an adviser,
which is what an agent is ca lled until Ryan completes his college
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened as ASU was practicing for today's College
World Series game. If the Sun Devils beat Long Beach State, they
will play for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved it's over,'' Ryan
</P>
<P>
   said of the draft watch.
</P>
<P>
   But how about his teammates? The draft may influence some of
their lives, too. ``Half our team is affected by it,'' Murphy said.
Players who were passed over in the first round had to wait and
wonder. Would their na mes be called? The full list of drafted
players won't be released until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have the draft during the College World Series,''
Murphy said. He knows, of course, that Major League Baseball can _
and will _ do whatever it wan ts.
</P>
<P>
   Why hold the draft during college baseball's showcase event?
It's not fair to the participating players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The draft can disrupt teams and affect players negatively.
Disappointed over being overlooked or chosen later than
</P>
<P>
   projected, some kids brood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't affect my pitching,'' Mills assured all. Hopefully
not. But you wonder how any bonus baby even can see home plate with
dollar signs in his eyes?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to start managing his after-life toda y,'' ASU Athletic
Director Kevin White said of first-round picks. ``I think the draft
is very disruptive. (ASU's) players already are dealing with pretty
substantial challenges. They don't need more to think about this
week.'' &QL; 
Dealing with it &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being 20 years old and learning you just became a
multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like learning that your interview for an entry-level
job with Allstate was successful,'' White said. No offense to
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before Miami was ousted from the Series, Hurricanes
All-American Pat Burrell learned the Phillies had selected him with
the top pick. The news was expected. Burrell said he would stay
focused on the Series. Still, how does a kid wipe the g rin off his
face?
</P>
<P>
   ``My only consolation,'' Murphy said, with Burrell in mind, ``is
that every other (World Series) team has to deal with it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, Major League Baseball has waited five years and nine
months and still hasn' t named a commissioner. Yet it won't
postpone the draft for a week?
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. &QL;

OREGON WELCOMES NEWMAN TO BASKETBALL STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don Newman believes he proved beyond any d oubt last
season he deserves to be a head coach, and that one day he again
will be a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, Newman is an assistant coach, at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who as Bill Frieder's interim replacement last season
led Ariz ona State to an 18-14 record that surpassed most
expectations, was officially named an assistant to Ducks Coach
Ernie Kent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully pursuing some head coaching vacancies,
Newman decided this would be his best opportunit y. He would have
been allowed to remain at ASU another year, but with new Coach Rob
Evans and his staff firmly in place, that wasn't appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was very important to stay in the loop,'' Newman
said. ``And staying in the Pac-10 wa s very important to me. If I
had to leave, this will be very good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best part for Newman is he can resume his search for
a head coaching job as early as next season. Kent said he wouldn't
stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If th at were to happen, I'll do everything I can to help him
get that job, and wish him the best,'' Kent said. ``He's smart
enough to know what to look for in his career. If the opportunity
comes for him, if he feels it's the right job, the University of
Oregon will still have been a lot better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, himself a rookie coach in the Pac-10 last year, said he
first thought about hiring Newman when he replaced Jerry Green at
Oregon after the 1996-97 season. But by that time, Newman, forme
rly the head coach at Cal State-Sacramento, had been hired by
Frieder.
</P>
<P>
   When Oregon assistant Jay John recently left to take a similar
job at Arizona, Kent called again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don's an outstanding guy,'' said Kent, whose team went 13-14
and
</P>
<P>
   tied ASU for fifth place with an 8-10 record. ``I talked to some
outstanding people who inquired about the job, but Don fits in so
well. He has a passion for the game and a passion for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent said he knows how ASU's players rallie d around Newman,
describing Newman as ``somebody that kids can trust and believe in
and count on.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as having a former head coach next to him on the bench,
Kent said, ``I don't fear hiring good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, whose family i s moving for the second time in two
years, will tie up loose ends in the Valley and report to his new
job within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from going there, I can tell everybody's excited about
their Ducks,'' he said. ``They're the only game
</P>
<P>
   in town, and they want to be good.'' &QL;

Jazz favored; let gamesmanship begin
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ With the inferiority complex the Chicago Bulls are
hauling around, you almost wonder if they stand a chance against
the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is expecting us to win,'' the Bulls' Scottie Pippen
said Tuesday. ``Everybody is expecting the Jazz to walk away with
this series. It's a great feeling, being the underdog. You want to
go out there and prove everybody wrong. The pressure is not on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since when did George Costanza, the Seinfeld character with the
defeatist attitude, sign a 10-day with the Bulls?
</P>
<P>
   This small and insignificant feeling isn't what we've come to
expect from the two-time defending NBA champions, the formerly
untoucha-Bull dynasty that is 5-for-5 in the NBA Finals this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the Bulls have gone from the 800-pound gorilla
to road kill in the short span of one shaky playoff series. Even
Michael Jordan, the confident one, believes it is fair and just to
declare the Bulls long shots to win the NBA Finals that begin
tonight at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went seven games, and they're rested,'' Jordan said.
``They have the home-court advantage. What we've had over the
years, when we won our championships, people look at that as an
opportunity to succeed. So I consider us an underdog (because Utah
now enjoys those advantages).''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the gamesmanship started before the games in the
Finals. The Bulls had been in Utah only an hour when Jordan, Pippen
and friends started talking about how the Jazz has the advantages
entering the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had to go seven difficult games to beat Indiana in the
Eastern Conference finals. Utah swept the Los Angeles Lakers in
four games in the West. Chicago has had only one practice to get
ready for the Jazz. Utah has waited on its next opponent since May
24. Karl Malone, John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek are rested. Jordan
and Pippen are not.
</P>
<P>
   Boil it down, and what do you get? One skeptical Utah team.
Malone laughed at the notion the Jazz is the clear favorite to win
this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls? Underdogs? Not as long as the greatest player in the
universe tugs on those baggy britches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't buy any of that, absolutely none of it,'' Malone
said. ``I did watch some of the game when they played Indiana in
the seventh game, and I saw an interview with Jud Buechler who said
they're the underdog. Yeah, right. I don't buy any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael summed it up. After everybody said what they said, he
said, `But we have heart.' And coming from him, that's all I needed
to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan admitted Tuesday that the Bulls aren't coming into the
Finals with their hats in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also consider us champions to be beaten,'' he said. ``So
they have to take it away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Jazz is confident this rematch of last season's Finals
is the perfect time when the Bulls can be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put their sneakers on like us,'' Malone said. ``We're
athletes, and they are, too. You think I'm just back in the Finals
just to be here? I'm back to win a championship. It's going to be
tough. But I'm looking forward to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game is important. We understand how important it
is. That's the game they want. Of course, they want both of them.
But I think they realize that the first game is important. And I
think if we can take care of business in the first game, I think
our rest will kick in the longer the series goes.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Malone added, the Jazz won't be short on motivation as it
seeks the first NBA title in franchise history while the Bulls try
to make it six rings in eight seasons. Only the two Rockets
championships during Jordan's try at baseball interrupted the
Bulls' run of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In life, sometimes you never have an opportunity to try to
correct something,'' Malone said. ``Sometimes, these opportunities
never come back. Or it's two or three or four years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an opportunity the next year to try to correct
something that you didn't finish last time, I'm glad. In sports or
life, it's not supposed to work out that way. And I'm looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Utah is cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I happy to have the Bulls? I don't know if anybody would
be happy having to play the Bulls,'' Stockton said. ``On the other
hand, they are the best team in basketball, and that certainly
presents a challenge that, hopefully, everybody will rise up for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have the opportunity to play here again in this
situation. It was a great situation last year for this franchise to
get there for the first time. I'm equally excited this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the world champs, and they didn't get there by having
stuff given to them. You can downplay how they're playing all you
want, but they're the world champs and they fought through a tough
series (against Indiana). I think people thought they were down and
out there. And they just find a way to win. That's what makes them
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz players believe they have one key advantage going into
the series, and it is neither the home court nor the extra rest.
It's the experience gained by going against Chicago last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came off a big series against Houston last year and stepped
right into a pretty unique situation for all of us,'' Stockton
said. ``And this year, it's probably the opposite end of the
spectrum. We've had a lot of time to stop, think about it and get
ready for it. Whether we gain anything from last year's deal, I
can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   But coach Jerry Sloan can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more experiences you get, good or bad, they are going to
make you better,'' Sloan said. ``If you're willing to try to become
better, those experiences will help anybody. It helps everybody to
have a little better idea of what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls have something working in their favor. Even though
they lost twice to the Jazz in the regular season, the Bulls are
battle-hardened. Even though they lost all three road games in the
Indiana series, they are road-tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is predicting that the Jazz will win because they
have the rest and the home-court advantage,'' Jordan said. ``But we
feel like we're going to come in here and win some games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prove we can win on the road against a team that
had the best record in the league. Their hunger may be stronger
than ours. There's a lot of things that might make people say,
`Well, maybe this is Utah's year.' But we look at the pressure as
not really being on us. But I like our chances either way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Pippen said, the desire to prove the Bulls again can
beat the odds is something that stokes their desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about this team,'' he said. ``Even though
they beat us in the season series, we feel like right now, it's our
time to go out and prove that we can win a series without having
the home-court advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that passion to disprove doubters that keeps anybody from
believing the Bulls rate as true underdogs in this series. &QL;

RATTLERS CRUSHED BY DEATH OF EX-PLAYER VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Milton Vaughn, who battled heart d isease for two
years while hoping to return to the Rattlers, died Monday in his
Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death has not been determined. An autopsy is
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, 27, was discovered in the evening by his roommate and
former t eammate, Richard Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive catalyst of the Rattlers' 1994 championship
season, Vaughn left the team's annual charity golf tournament in
Ahwatukee on Monday morning, complaining of nausea after playing
four or five holes, Coach Danny
</P>
<P>
   White said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after his second Rattlers season, Vaughn was
diagnosed with cardio myopathy, which causes swelling of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Vaughn was on a heart transplant list at the
University of Arizona's Medical Cen ter, said Gene Nudo, Rattlers
vice president of administration.
</P>
<P>
   White said Vaughn, who played for Arizona State in 1993, chose
an alternative method of treatment and seemed to be doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, he had lost 70 to 80 pound s,'' White said.
``But he gained it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was a receiver and defensive back whose interception
helped beat Albany in the Arena Football League semifinals in '94.
In two seasons, he had 117 tackles and six interceptions, which
rank s second on the team's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who worked as a season ticket account executive for
Phoenix Arena Sports, never gave up hope of playing again. He
recently received clearance to begin light workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn attended every Rattlers home game and most of the
practices, remaining close to the players and coaches. A younger
brother, Brian, a Scottsdale Community College student, videotapes
the practices for the Rattlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really tough for me,'' quarterbac k Sherdrick Bonner
said. ``He was the first person I was really close with on the
team. I'm just stunned right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's practice was canceled, but the players met to console
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Milt was ill, but everyt hing was encouraging that
he was getting better,'' Nudo said. ``I saw him (Monday) at the
golf tournament. That morning, I've got my arm around the guy. That
evening, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find a better person than Milton Vaughn. He was a
lways there to help a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Nudo said the team will honor Vaughn by wearing his number (7)
on their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a precious treasure, and today is a great tragedy,''
Rattlers receiver/linebacker Hunkie Cooper said. ``Milton will
always be missed dearly physically, but spiritually, he will be
with us every day.'' &QL;

   Martinez like clockwork in win No. 243
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Stinson
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wisc. _ Twenty-three years, 3,955 innings and one
interrupted retirement into the chase, Dennis Martinez finally
caught up to Juan Marichal late Tuesday night. On Turn Back The
Clock Night at County Stadium, El Presidente was never more a part
of the present.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pole-axed Milwaukee 9-0 behind Andres Galarraga (a
pair of homers and five RBI) and Andruw Jones (a pair of triples
and a homer) but the night really belonged to Martinez, who won his
second game as a Brave but his 243 as a major leaguer, tying the
sky-kicking Marichal for most victories by a Latin American
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   How do you throw a curve with your fingers crossed?
</P>
<P>
   Having endured two winning chances last month which were torched
late by the bullpen, Martinez left little to chance in this one,
working nine innings while allowing 10 singles, a double, striking
out three and walking one. Every play he needed, he received, from
three double plays to Dave Nilsson retiring the side early on with
a liner directly into Jeromy Burnitz's leg as he tried to advance
to second.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga became the first Brave to reach 20 homers with
a two-run, 435-foot blast to center field in the fifth, giving
Atlanta a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was his second in three games, his fifth in 12 games
and all but guaranteed it would take more that 24 to lead the club
by season's end, as Ryan Klesko did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who opened the night with four career triples _ two this
season _ hit his second triple of the night in the third, sending
Marquis Grissom vainly into the center field wall for a ball that
missed going out by three feet. That gave the Braves and Martinez a
second chance to complete a play they flubbed in the second inning,
when Martinez missed a sign and swung through a squeeze play with
Jones half-way down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez fouled that pitch. In the fourth, he was perfect,
laying down a bunt to the right side to bring in Jones for a 3-0
lead. That run gave the Braves pitching staff 11 RBIs and 15
sacrifices this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves broke out to a 2-0 lead in the second on an extremely
rare play _ a Grissom misplay.
</P>
<P>
   After Javy Lopez and Michael Tucker strung together consecutive
singles, Andruw Jones sent a hard liner into center field that
initially brought Grissom in a couple steps.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The ball was hit deep enough to reach the warning track
and Grissom never made it back in time, jumping fruitlessly as the
ball sailed over his head to the wall. As County Stadium broke into
a round of boos, both Lopez and Tucker scored and Jones ran until
he reached third base. The error was Grissom's second of the season
and only added to his early season frustration. He has missed 19
starts this year, most recently limited by a strained buttock.

D-BACKS USE 1ST PICK ON UA FOOTBALL RECRUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks have cultivated a sincere
</P>
<P>
   and positive relationship with their neighbors to the south in
Tucson, establishing spring training headquarters and a Triple-A
affiliate there.
</P>
<P>
   But their latest move might not play so well in some parts of
the Old Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   With thei r first pick in Major League Baseball's amateur draft
on Tuesday, No. 103 overall, the Diamondbacks took Darryl Conyer,
an 18-year-old outfielder from Mission Bay High School in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous athlete,'' scouting director Don M itchell
said. ``An outstanding runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was referring to Conyer's ability on the basepaths and
roaming center field. But Conyer runs well on the football field,
too. So well, in fact, that he signed a letter of intent to attend
the
</P>
<P>
   University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he believes the 5-foot-10, 195-pound Conyer will
pick the Diamondbacks over the Wildcats and not attempt to play
both sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to him, and he expressed a 100 percent interest in
base ball,'' Mitchell said. ``He knows if he devotes all his time
to baseball, he's going to be a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Rich Tomey, the son of Arizona football Coach
Dick Tomey, works for the Diamondbacks in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Conyer, wh o was not available for comment, was picked in the
third round, where the going rate is a signing bonus in the
$200,000-$300,000 range. Plus, the Diamondbacks would pay for his
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be fun to watch,'' General Manager Joe Garagiola
Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he hasn't really concentrated on baseball. If we can get
him to be a 12-month a year baseball player, this is going to be a
guy who brings things with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyer's high school coach, Dennis Pugh, said
</P>
<P>
   Conyer ``is the best prospect I've had in 24 years of coaching.
He runs, hits for power. He's got potential written all over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Relegated to waiting until the third round because of the
free-agent signings of Jay Bell and Willie Blair, the Diamondbacks
nevertheless made some interesting picks. Conyer wasn't the only
one. They also took right-handed pitcher Brian Sager, a high
schooler from Branford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sager has signed with national power Stanford, where pitchers
thri ve. That explains why he was available for the Diamondbacks in
the 13th round. But he could end up being a steal. One publication
had the Diamondbacks taking him with their first pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of surprising he slid as far as he did,'' M
itchell said. ``We're glad, and we have interest in him. We've
already talked to him, and he's anxious to see where the
Diamondbacks are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Sager and his family ``are taking some time to reflect on this
experience,'' Mitchell s aid. ``They're disappointed, like anyone
would be. But we told them specifically we're not going to come in
and talk about 13th-round money.''
</P>
<P>
   With their fourth-round pick, the Diamondbacks took left-handed
pitcher Javier Lopez from the Univ ersity of Virginia. Mitchell
said Lopez has good control, an effective change-up and the
potential to throw harder than he does (88 to 90 mph).
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks dipped into the local pool by taking infielder
Dan Meier (14th round) from Arizo na State, left-handed pitcher
Christopher Cervantes from Pima Community College in Tucson (15th
round) and right-handed pitcher Bret Prinz (18th round) from
Phoenix College.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Meier, Mitchell said, ``He's been on and off as far
as
production, but we really like the way he swings the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the limitations, Mitchell said he was pleased with how the
draft progressed on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenging spring for us,'' he said. &QL;

EAGER TO PLAY TOUGH-GUY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It is not simply a mound to Richy Leon, but a
stage , where he can shed his placid exterior and play the bad guy
for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a different person when I pitch. It's kind of neat,'' he
said. ``I kind of like that I can play the role of the rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   This rebel has a cause today when h e starts for Arizona State
against Long Beach State in the College World Series. A victory
advances the Sun Devils to Saturday's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was an emotional one for Leon. He learned about the
start and also that he had been dra fted by the Colorado Rockies in
the 23rd round.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't quite sure how scouts perceived him. During the
regular season, he started 24 games as a second baseman, 10 as a
shortstop, two as a designated hitter and 10 as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He also
</P>
<P>
   can play third base _ which he did in the Cape Cod League last
summer _ and the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only guy who felt his job was safe this season was
catcher Jeremy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the consummate team player,'' ASU Coach Pat Murphy
</P>
<P>
   said. ``He's done everything we ask as the program has grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Said outfielder Mikel Moreno, ``He's invaluable. He can play
second, third, shortstop. He's a big-time pitcher. Whatever Coach
has asked him, he's always done it, and he does it real well.''
</P>
<P>
   But would his versatility work for or against him? Would scouts
like his ability to fill a variety of roles? Or would they feel
that he failed to specialize and perfect one position?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, apparently, perceived it as a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really hesitated whenever (Murphy) would tell me do
something,'' Leon said. ``Sometimes I would think, `Am I ever going
to get a shot at this or that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I look at it, I think it helped me. If I'm versatile,
it
</P>
<P>
   means I can help them in many different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno believes ``it's been tough on him at times. Any time
you're on a team, you always want to get playing time every single
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, a right-hander, doesn't have the overpowering fast ball of
Ryan Mills or Phill Lowery, but he finds ways to win, even if he
has to work a little harder to do it. He is 3-0 in 10 starts this
season with a team-high (among starters) ERA of 6.67.
</P>
<P>
   He went seven innings in ASU's Midwest Regional vi ctory over
Oklahoma State, allowing five runs (two earned) and 10 hits while
striking out 10.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy would be comfortable with only four or five good innings
from Leon today because the Sun Devils' relievers _ particularly
Chad Pennington _ have been so effective in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a great experience,'' Leon said. ``Not many
people get to pitch in the College World Series, so I'll have
something to tell my grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he gets to be tough-guy Richy Leon f or a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit more take-charge, aggressive on the mound,''
he said. ``It's a different mentality. On second base, you have to
be a little more controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon is a semester away from graduating. He hopes to pursue a
mas ter's degree and coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, his mind is on Long Beach State, which eliminated
Miami, 6-3, from the College World Series on Tuesday, avenging a
first-round loss to the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are considered the surprise tea m of the tournament.
Third baseman Paul Day was the Big West Player of the Year with a
conference-high .438 batting average and 96 hits. &QL;

UA THROWER SET FOR CHAM PIONSHIP  
 KNOWS DISCUS FIELD'S VERY TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best college disc us thrower in the country isn't taking
anything for granted in the NCAA Track and Field Championships this
week in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Doug Reynolds has lost only twice, but despite having
the nation's top collegiate throw of 206 feet, 1 1 inches, there
are four others _ all from the Pac-10 and including a teammate _
who aren't too far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Waltz of Washington State has a throw of 206 feet, with Ben
Lindsey of Washington (202-7), Arizona's Chima Ugwu (202-5) and
Luke
Sullivan of UCLA (197). Waltz and Ugwu have gotten the better of
Reynolds, but the former Greenway High star likes his chances at
the meet, which begins today and runs through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas has won six straight men's titles and is favor ed to
make it seven, but ``Track and Field News'' predicts their toughest
challenge to come from Arizona. In the women's competition,
Louisiana State is going after its 12th consecutive women's title,
but its reign is expected to come to a close, with Texas and UCLA
battling for team honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good chance,'' said Reynolds, who also
qualified in the shot put after placing sixth in the Pac-10 meet
with a throw of 57-10 \.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that two of them have beate n me, none of that
matters. I'm really confident with the training we've put in, and
I'm ready to go. I think we can beat anybody out there, the team
and myself. We're really well prepared. If I lose, it won't be
because I wasn't prepared. It will
</P>
<P>
   be because someone out there is a better thrower.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the fact that he competes daily against the 6-foot-4,
304-pound Ugwu has helped him progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good of a competitor as anyone out there,'' Reynolds
said. ``You can't
</P>
<P>
   count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, a 6-foot-4, 275-pound senior, has aspirations that go
beyond a collegiate championship. He hopes to be a member of the
U.S. Olympic team in 2000, and he'll get a better handle on things
when he competes in the U.S . Championships in New Orleans (June
19-21).
</P>
<P>
   He says he's not sure how long he will compete, but he's
planning his future. With a major in community health education,
Reynolds hopes someday to design health care strategies for clinics
and corp orations.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is one of 11 Wildcats who have qualified for the men's
meet. Ugwu is ranked second in the shot put and fifth in the
discus, Abdi Abdirahman is second in the 10,000 meters and fifth in
the 5,000, Esko Mikkola is third in th e javelin, Dominic Johnson
is third in the decathlon and fourth in the pole vault, and Patrick
Nduwimana is sixth in the 800.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona women qualified four athletes. Amy Skieresz is the
defending champion and favorite in the 5,000 and 10, 000 meters. &QL;

FEDS SAY SALSA IS A VEGETABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY GEORGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Salsa: ``a hot sauce made with chilies, tomatoes,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Webster's defines it. But the federal government has
other ideas. Listen up, students. Salsa is now officially a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department recently decreed that salsa may
be counted as a vegetable in school lunches under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be loaded with spices, stabilizers or other
non-vegetable ingredients. Also, a mere spoonful splashed atop a
taco won't do _ it has to be at least one-eighth of a cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for me because I love salsa,'' said Gaia Fisher, a
senior at Bothell High School, north of Seattle, where the drippy
red stuff was offered along with taco salads Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the usual offerings of carrots and corn, salsa is a
great vegetable, added junior Micael Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   Bothell High, like many other schools in the area, has long
offered salsa as a seasoning. But will they now start offering it
as a vegetable?
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue, Renton and Federal Way schools are likely to do so,
but Seattle and Northshore schools probably will not, according to
nutrition directors in those districts.
</P>
<P>
   For Linda Hoel, food supervisor for Bothell's Northshore School
District, calling salsa a vegetable doesn't quite ring true. ``It's
always been just kind of a side condiment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high honor for a condiment to make the USDA's list of
school vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ketchup, salsa's more established sister in the tomato
sauce family. It never reached that height.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Reagan administration's 1981 proposal to count
ketchup as a vegetable in school lunches was so widely scorned that
it was quickly dropped _ like a rotten tomato.
</P>
<P>
   But salsa is ``not at all'' like ketchup, says Carla Kaser,
Renton's school nutrition director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually see the big chunks of tomato in it,'' said
Kaser, who confessed to being a salsa aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup, on the other hand, oozes with sugar and vinegar and is
much more highly processed, nutrition experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts started hearing about salsa's ascendancy
two weeks ago, when the state superintendent of public instruction
issued a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salsa may now be credited as part of the fruit/vegetable meal
component for child nutrition programs,'' says the bulletin, which
is posted on the Internet on SPI's homepage,
http://www.ospi.wednet.edu
</P>
<P>
   ``When USDA first disallowed salsa from receiving credit in the
school meals program, it was because salsa was used as a condiment
or garnish and served in amounts smaller than one-eighth cup,'' the
bulletin says. ``As salsa has become more widely accepted by
children, it is used more as a vegetable side dish in amounts
greater than one-eighth cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin explains that only the vegetable content of salsa,
not starches or stabilizers, may be counted as part of the
one-eighth cup.
</P>
<P>
   And that portion alone won't satisfy all nutritional
requirements. Each meal still has to include a total of at least
three-fourths of a cup of fruits and vegetables, said Skip Skinner,
the state's food distribution manager.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said the USDA ruling on salsa was requested by schools
around the country. For years they were frustrated that the USDA
distributed salsa to schools, but wouldn't let them count it as a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Another driving factor, Skinner said, is salsa's growing appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overtaken ketchup as the most popular tomato product,''
he said.
