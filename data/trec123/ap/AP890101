   The celluloid torch has been passed to a new
generation: filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s.
   ``Platoon,'' ``Running on Empty,'' ``1969'' and ``Mississippi
Burning'' are among the movies released in the past two years from
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that
turbulent decade to the screen.
   ``The contemporaries of the '60s are some of the filmmakers of
the '80s. It's natural,'' said Robert Friedman, the senior vice
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at Warner Bros.
   Chris Gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``Mississippi
Burning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and
others to express their feelings about the decade.
   ``Distance is important,'' he said. ``I believe there's a lot of
thinking about that time and America in general.''
   The Vietnam War was a defining experience for many people in the
'60s, shattering the consensus that the United States had a right,
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. Even
today, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``Vietnam Syndrome'' in
referring to the country's reluctance to use military force to
settle disputes.
   ``I think future historians will talk about Vietnam as one of the
near destructions of American society,'' said Urie Brofenbrenner, a
professor of sociology at Cornell University.
   ``In World War II, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in
Vietnam.''
   ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Hamburger Hill'' and ``Bat 21'' all use the
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.
   The Vietnam War has remained an emotional issue in the United
States as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their
experiences. One was Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the
Academy Award-winning ``Platoon.''
   ``I saw `Platoon' eight times,'' said John J. Anderson, a Palm
Beach County sheriff's lieutenant who served in Vietnam in 1966-67.
``I cried the first time I saw it ... and the third and fourth
times. `Platoon' helped me understand.''
   Stone, who based ``Platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a
grunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.
   ``People are responding to the fact that it's real. They're
curious about the war in Vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.
   While Southeast Asia was the pivotal foreign issue in American
society of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. The
civil rights movement reached its peak in the ``Freedom Summer'' of
1964, when large groups of volunteers headed South to help register
black voters.
   In ``Five Corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the Bronx
starring Jodie Foster, her friend, played by Tim Robbins, leaves his
neighborhood to volunteer in the South after seeing the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on television.
   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' focuses on an incident that
clouded the Mississippi Summer Project _ when 1,000 young volunteers
from mainstream America swept into the state to help register black
voters. The movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance
and slaying of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner, Andrew
Goodman and James Chaney.
   They were reported missing on June 21, several hours after being
stopped for speeding near Philadelphia, Miss. After a nationally
publicized search, their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm
just outside the town.
   One of those who recalled the incident was Gerolmo, a student in
the New York public school system at the time. The screenwriter said
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.
   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could
be wrong,'' Gerolmo said.
   The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome
fierce local resistance to solve the crime.
   In a more offbeat and outrageous way, John Waters' ``Hairspray''
discusses integration in Baltimore in 1963 when a group of
teen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance
show.
   Also set in Baltimore is Barry Levinson's ``Tin Men,'' starring
Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding
salesmen in the early '60s. The movie mirrored a squarely
middle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics
and drugs.
   Instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,
writer-director Ernest Thompson takes a more personal approach in
``1969.'' Robert Downey Jr. and Keifer Sutherland star as college
students who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and
the Vietnam War.
   ``I was 19 in 1969. It was a fulcrum time for me,'' said
Thompson, who was a student at American University at the time. ``I
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''
   ``Running on Empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are
much in evidence. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play anti-war
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to
live underground with their two children.
   Naomi Foner, who wrote ``Running on Empty'' and also served as
the film's executive producer, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
daughter of sociologists. Her own experiences made Foner well
qualified to give ``Running on Empty'' its strong political theme.
   ``I lived through that time and I've wanted to find the right way
to present it to this generation,'' said Foner, a member of the
radical Students for a Democratic Society while attending graduate
school at Columbia University.
   Foner, who also taught in Harlem's Head Start program and helped
register voters in South Carolina, said many young people are
curious about what happened in the '60s.
   ``A lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were
sorry to have missed,'' she said.
   Brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of
the general public: ``The principle impact of the media is that they
reflect the values of the larger society.
   ``Film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``I believe it
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming
trends. It's because film writers, like other writers, are
perceptive people. They get the message of what's going on.''

   For students working in a miniature factory at
the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is
now.
   ``When our students go into industry, they will have
state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the
workplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic business
laboratory.
   Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs
the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging
laboratory.
   The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the
only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced
such programs in the country.
   Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms.
Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Students
can see how the factory of the future operates.''
   The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms.
Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.
   In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,
4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a
pivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. The
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe
or milling machine.
   The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. The
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting
shops, Ms. Alptekin said.
   Students learn to program a computer and automated machines
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving raw
materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to
supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the
parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into
finished products at the lathe.
   Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.
   But the product is less important than the process. Ms. Alptekin
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation
and financial consulting.
   In the factory of the future, according to the university's
model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.
   ``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekin
said, referring to programming that allows components such as the
automated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls
the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of
parts.
   Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even
from industries where robots and automated machines have become
almost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasks
in ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the
production line.
   Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile
industry, but she would like to see it expanded.
   ``It should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``It's difficult
to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can
be easily justified.
   ``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and
developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers
and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.
   A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to
altering it to create a new product. Ms. Alptekin said the student
identified what new production components were necessary and
determined how they could be integrated into the system.
   A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will
allow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmed
to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled
component, much as human managers would react.
   Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using is
on the cutting edge of manufacturing.
   ``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level of
expertise,'' he said. ``I know that our lab is one of the best of
its kind in an educational institution.''
   The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on
computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.
   ``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms.
Alptekin said.
   Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. This
past year, the original robot was replaced with one able to perform
more tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector.
   The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. An
estimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.
   International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part
of an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the
country.
   ``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of
instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said
Andy Russell, a spokesman for IBM. ``IBM will benefit because we
will be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing)
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''

   An early morning house fire killed a woman
and a firefighter who was fatally injured as he searched the house,
officials said Saturday. Four other members of the woman's family
were injured.
   Fire Investigator Ray Mauck said the 4 a.m. fire started in the
front room of the house in northwest Wichita but he would not
comment on the cause. ``We are fairly sure at this time that it was
an accidental fire,'' he said.
   Killed were Tilda Sue Price, 53, and firefighter C.C.
Killingsworth, 39, a 17-year veteran of the Wichita Fire Department.
   Mrs. Price's husband, Everett Price, 63, and their daughters,
Corine, 22, and Valrie, 16, escaped and were in serious condition
Saturday night at St. Francis Regional Medical Center, hospital
officials said. Another firefighter was treated for minor injuries
and released.
   Killingsworth's colleagues praised him a dedicated firefighter.
   ``He was a very aggressive firefighter. He loved the work he was
in,'' said acting Fire Chief Larry Garcia said. ``He couldn't be
bested in terms of his willingness and his ability to do something
to help you survive.''
   Firefighters never reached Mrs. Price, who was trapped in her
bedroom, Garcia said. They had to cut short their rescue effort just
before the roof caved in. The woman's daughters escaped from a
second-story bedroom by climbing down ladders put up on the side of
the house by firefighters.

   In the nation's capital, where the federal
government's war on drugs is mapped out, young Washingtonians
fighting over drugs were killing each other at a rate of more than
one a day during 1988.
   The District of Columbia's drug problems dramatize the two
different Washingtons _ the Capitol, the White House and other sites
visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power.
There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn
to the status and money that come from selling drugs.
   In 1988, 371 persons had been killed in the nation's capital as
of Dec. 30, far surpassing the previous high total of 287, set in
1969. Police blame drugs _ particularly the arrival of crack cocaine
_ for about 60 percent of the slayings. As recently as 1986,
drug-related killings accounted for just one-third of the city's
homicide total.
   Although final population and homicide figures have yet to be
compared, Washington and Detroit had the two highest per-capita
murder rates in America in 1988, meaning the nation's capital could
earn the dubious honor of being the nation's murder capital as well.
   Ironically, the absence of organized crime in Washington may be
pushing the murder total even higher. Law enforcement officials note
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug
market, there are fewer drug-related slayings.
   ``What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting
among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner. ``They are just working for themselves.''
   Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough
battle for Turner and his 3,800 officers.
   Earlier this year, police switched to .9mm semiautomatic handguns
out of fear that weapons commonly found on the street were
outclassing the standard .38-caliber six-shot revolver officers have
been carrying.
   The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots
before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted
in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated
weaponry. Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, Turner
called the district's streets ``something out of the Wild, Wild
West.'' Officers will have their new guns by 1990.
   And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects
hasn't sated the city's appetite for narcotics. A highly-touted
anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than
46,000 arrests since its August, 1986, inception.
   However, Turner has complained that the program, which sends
swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make
arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's
already-overcrowded jail and court systems.
   For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according
to Turner.
   ``A lot of these kids are high school dropouts, with few
skills,'' Turner said. ``They can make up to a $1 million a year
selling drugs. What would you do?''
   U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jay B. Stephens, who
can prosecute both local and federal crimes, earlier this month
announced that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work
solely on drug-related killings in the district.
   Turner has also called on city officials to spend more money on
drug education, prevention and treatment programs. Currently, a
three-week wait is common for persons wanting to enroll in the
city's treatment centers.
   What does the future hold? Police hope that as markets are more
firmly established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative,
the murder rate will decrease.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an
infusion of crack,'' Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other
cities, like New York, murder rates went up there too.''

   Revelers rang in 1989 in celebrations ranging from the neon-lit
Times Square in New York City to small square-dance halls in Indiana
and a mountaintop in Colorado, some with champagne glasses, others
promoting abstinence.
   Millions watched the traditional New Year's countdown on
television as the 600-pound wrought-iron ball descended a pole at
Times Square. An estimated 600,000 saw the 81-year-old tradition in
person.
   ``We came here because we watched this on TV every year in
California, and one day I said, `We've got to go there one of these
years,'' said Claudia Zuniga-Mora, 23, of San Diego, who was
visiting friends in New Jersey.
   A 90-minute laser light show in the nation's largest city also
was part of the festivities.
   Many celebrated without such glitz.
   In Martinsville, Ind., three square dance clubs were to do-si-do
until 1 a.m. in the 4-H Building at the Morgan County Fairgrounds.
Betty Conover, president of the Flagtown Steppers, said about 200
people were expected. No alcohol was served.
   ``Square dancers do not drink and dance. You can't drink and
listen to the caller,'' Mrs. Conover said.
   Members of the AdAmAn Club of Colorado Springs, Colo., chose a
more solitary setting to toast 1989. They lit a fireworks display
from the top of Pikes Peak, elevation 14,100 feet.
   The group's 66th annual trek culminated at midnight with 60 giant
starbursts exploding over the snowcapped peak, where temperatures
dipped to about zero and hikers encountered 50 mph winds.
   ``It was difficult going above tree line where the snow depth
reached thigh level,'' said Jim Bates, who made his 34th climb..
   Music played a role in many celebrations. At the Grand Ballroom
in the New Orleans Sheraton, the music of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra
and swing were king.
   ``We're still playing the music Guy Lombardo played,'' said Kenny
Leighton, the leader of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. ```The sweetest
music this side of heaven.' Isn't that corny? But it's true.''
   About 1,000 people had plans to dance 1988 away at a black-tie
affair at Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   They were to step out to the theme of the Broadway musical
``Phantom of the Opera,'' said Mitchell Etess, a hotel spokesman.
   A group of New Jersey senior citizens also had partying in mind.
   Residents at the Jewish Geriatric Home in Cherry Hill planned a
New Year's party with the usual activities and even champagne.
   But the party was scheduled to last only until lights-out at 8
p.m., said spokesman Michael Bucci.
   An estimated 500,000 people jammed downtown Miami for the 55th
Annual King Orange Jamboree Parade to watch flashy floats, bands, 20
circus elephants and television stars such as George Wendt of
``Cheers'' and Susan Ruttan and Raymond Burr of ``LA Law.''
   In Boston, about a half million people wandered the city's
streets and public gardens as part of 13th annual First Night
celebration, which has inspired similar festivals in 23 cities from
Denver to Charlotte, N.C. More than 1,000 artists performed across
Boston.
   Many appreciated the event's no-drinking policy.
   ``We used to go out and misbehave like everyone else on New
Year's, but now we come to this as a family,'' said Joyce LaVecchia.
``I mean, why not? And there's no headache in the morning.''
   Drinking and driving, again, was an issue across the country.
   About 1,000 state troopers in New Jersey were on duty to
encourage motorists to stay at the 55 mph speed limit and reduce the
number of traffic accidents.
   Anheuser Busch Co. in Newark, N.J., offered free New Year's Eve
taxi rides home for about 3,000 drinking revelers in six northern
New Jersey counties, officials said.
   One group also moved to stop a dangerous New Year's Eve tradition
in Detroit.
   Save Our Sons and Daughters, which is made up of relatives and
friends of slain Detroit children, asked residents to end the city's
New Year's Eve skyward shooting spree.
   For several years, at midnight, some residents have shot guns in
the air.
   ``It's an insane practice, a part of the mores of this community
that needs to stop,'' said Fred Williams, a spokesman for the
Detroit Police Department.
   And in Philadelphia, one group eschewed making resolutions.
Instead, they issued predictions _ for last year.
   The Procastinators Club of America released its 1988 New Year
predictions Saturday, as usual when the year is ending.
   ``Somehow,'' said club president Les Waas added, ``we've never
been wrong.''
   The club's No. 1 prediction was that George Bush would be elected
president and then shoot quail over the Christmas holidays while
vacationing in Texas.
   ``That was a real shot in the dark but it was bull's eye,'' Waas
said.

   Illegal fireworks injured hundreds of
people and ignited six fires in Manila, leaving thousands of
families homeless in the New Year, police and doctors said Sunday.
   Hospital officials said seven people died from stray bullets and
stabbings in New Year's celebrations and brawls in Manila and the
city of Cebu, 360 miles southeast of Manila.
   A check with doctors at 20 government and private hospitals in
the capital area showed 1,134 people were injured, mostly by
fireworks, late Saturday and early Sunday.
   ``It's like a war zone here,'' said a government doctor who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Fingers are being amputated. People are
wounded by stray bullets. They are still coming in, and our records
are still in shambles from last night.''
   Fire raged through one slum neighborhood, killing at least one
person and destroying 3,000 makeshift houses, said arson
investigator Cpl. Edmar Espresion.
   Hundreds of houses and apartments also were burned in five other
fires in which no casualties were reported, Espresion said.
   ``All of these fires were started by firecrackers,'' Espression
said.
   In Cebu, the second largest city, at least 86 people, several of
them children, were treated in government hospitals for injuries
from firecrackers.
   In Bulacan province, north of Manila, 33 people were injured in
frenzied revelry on New Year's Eve, hospital authorities said.
   The manufacture, sale and use of firecrackers are illegal in the
Philippines. But the ban is lightly enforced in a nation where
people traditionally explode fireworks to usher in the New Year and
celebrate other festivals.
   On Friday, U.S. serviceman Sgt. Michael Kaleda, 29, of Florida,
and a 10-year-old Filipino boy were killed when a homemade
firecracker prematurely exploded in the American's house outside
Clark Air Base. Four other Filipinos were wounded in the blast.
   An explosion Thursday at an clandestine firecracker factory in
Bulacan province killed 11 people and injured 20.

   A sightseeing cruise boat crowded
with New Year's Eve revelers capsized and sank, and at least 42
people drowned, authorities said Sunday.
   A survivor said foreigners were on board, and Rio morgue
officials said they were calling foreign consulates to help identify
bodies.
   The cruise boat, a popular local sightseeing attraction called
the Bateau Mouche, was taking people to see a New Year's fireworks
display off famous Copacabana Beach.
   ``We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it
was because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the
Rio de Janeiro State Fire Department's Maritime Group, who
coordinated rescue work. He confirmed the figure of 42 dead and said
perhaps 130 people had been on board.
   Earlier, a radio operator for the Fire Department's Sea Rescue
Service said the Bateau Mouche had collided with a private yacht,
the Casa Branca. But Santos said the Casa Branca was simply one of
many boats that stopped to aid Bateau Mouche victims.
   Irineu Barroso, the chief of Rio's 10th Police Precinct, with
jurisdiction over the bayfront neighborhood closest to the disaster,
also said 42 people had drowned.
   ``It seems there was an excess of passengers, maybe 130 to 150 on
board,'' Barroso told The Associated Press. A local radio station
said the Bateau Mouche has a capacity of about 100. ``We understand
the boat was told to turn back but ignored the order,'' Barroso said.
   Maj. Santos said the sinking occurred at 11:45 p.m. Saturday
(8:45 p.m. EST) ``in very rough seas.''
   A Brazilian woman, who said she survived by hanging onto a
floating table, told the privately owned Globo TV network she was
with a group that included Italians and that there were other
foreigners aboard.
   The woman, whose name was not immediately available, also
verified Barroso's statement about the order to turn back. She said
Port Authority officals stopped the Bateau Mouche when it already
was out on the water, seemed to be counting passengers and made the
boat retrun to its bayfront mooring.
   But then, she said, the cruise boat simply set out again 15
minutes later.
   The Bateau Mouche makes daily sightseeing cruises across
Guanabara Bay, where tourists can admire the mountain scenery that
surrounds Rio.
   The New Year's Eve program, widely advertised in newspapers, was
to leave the bay, pass by Sugarloaf Mountain and anchor in the
Atlantic Ocean off Copacabana Beach.
   A fireworks display was set off at the beach at midnight Saturday.
   Rio's New Year's fireworks show, in the Southern Hemisphere's
summer, routinely draws 1 million people to the beach and hundreds
of small craft off shore.
   The Brazilian travel agency that operates the cruise boat,
Itatiaia Tourism, did not answer its phone early Sunday.

   An earthen dike broke early Sunday,
forcing the evacuation of an estimated 1,500 people for several
hours and closure of a major interstate highway, authorities said.
   Police said the 2,500-foot-long dike, a section of the Quail
Creek Dam on the Virgin River about 14 miles east of here, broke
eight minutes after midnight.
   The 50-foot-high dike released a wall of water 10 feet to 12 feet
high, said Mike Brunn, a member of the Washington County Search and
Rescue Team who watched the water gush through the river channel.
   ``If you had had a surfboard, you could have just rode the wave.
It was that forceful,'' Brunn said.
   No injuries were reported. Washington County sheriff's deputies
reported seeing apparently empty vehicles carried along by the
floodwaters, but there were no immediate reports of people missing.
Dispatcher Melody Murdock said deputies reported seeing two
recreational vehicles and a pickup in the river.
   St. George City Manager Gary Esplin said ``numerous'' homes were
flooded in some of the areas evacuated in the communities of
Bloomington, Bloomington Hills, Washington Fields and parts of
Washington city.
   Washington County sheriff's dispatcher Thad Mattson said about
daybreak that people were beginning to return to their homes.
   ``The water pretty well has receded down,'' Mattson said. ``It's
headed down the gorge and into the Arizona end of it. Most of the
people who have been evacuated are returning.''
   Esplin said three bridges in St. George and Washington city were
destroyed or rendered useless.
   St. George Police Chief John Pollei said water was pouring
through an ever-widening gap in the dike, which contains Quail Creek
Reservoir on the south side. He said the dam itself, which is also
earthen and faces southeast, was not damaged.
   The high water forced the closure of Interstate 15 _ the main
route between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles _ south of St. George
where the freeway enters the narrow Virgin River Gorge. The break is
located about 250 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   Utah Highway Patrol dispatcher Shirley Iker said there was no
water on the road, but travel through the winding gorge was
considered hazardous. Mattson said the road would be closed until
later in the day when state officials would inspect a bridge running
over the Virgin River as a precaution.
   Iker said the Nevada Highway Patrol had blocked traffic from
approaching the gorge from the south, and Arizona authorities had
set up roadblocks on side roads that access the passage.
   The south end of the gorge is in Arizona, a few miles from the
Nevada border.
   The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for
areas along the river southward from the dam to the Arizona border.
   Pollei said the Virgin River Bridge on Utah 9 below the dam was
completely under water, severing the highway between the towns of
St. George and Hurricane.
   The cause of the break was not known, he said. A leak was noticed
in the dike as early as 10 p.m.
   Pollei also said he had no precise figure on how many homes had
been evacuated. However, local Mormon Church authorities opened
their chapels to evacuated families and local Red Cross officials
appealed to community residents to open their homes to the displaced.
   Congested traffic was reported on Utah 9 west of the bridge and
on local arteries between Bloomington and St. George as residents
attempted to move their families and livestock out of harm's way.
   Officials said the evacuation effort initially was hampered by
the New Year's holiday. Some residents assumed the city's civil
defense siren was being sounded to herald the new year. Also, many
residents were away from their houses when authorities ordered the
evacuation.
   The flood knocked radio station KSGI off the air. The station's
transmission tower was only 50 feet from the river, said news
director Jules Dinoff.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Male Prime Ministers May Eventually Be Fashionable
Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who made history
in 1979 when she became Europe's first woman prime minister, noted
Sunday she is not alone and joked that male politicians may one day
come back into fashion.
   ``We're getting more women prime ministers,'' she said in a
television interview, referring to the recent election of Benazir
Bhutto as prime minister of Pakistan.
   ``And don't forget ... Mrs. Gandhi was a very able, charming,
formidable prime minister of India.''
   Mrs. Thatcher now is the longest serving leader in the West.
Before she came to power, women had governed in Sri Lanka and
Israel. Part of the British leader's tenure in office coincided with
that of Mrs. Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1984.
   ``I think male prime ministers one day will come back into
fashion,'' she joked with interviewer David Frost on Britain's
commercial TV-am channel.
   Asked about combining her job and her domestic life with her
husband, Denis, a retired oil executive, she said ``women have run
both the home and work for a very long time.''
   ``I mean, every working wife knows that if you decide to have
steak and kidney pie for supper, it's no better if you took 20
minutes thinking about it than if you took 20 seconds.''
   Frost recalled Mrs. Thatcher's comment ``I never did understand
men,'' during an acrimonious meeting last year with fellow leaders
of the European Economic Community. Asked if she understood men
better now, Mrs. Thatcher replied:
   ``It may not be understanding of the deepest kind, but I do know
what they're likely to do and say. So, one has a certain
predictability about it.''

<BYLINE>Students Demonstrate In Tibet; Americans, German Detained ^By JOHN

   Hundreds of Tibetan students demonstrated in
Lhasa, demanding that Chinese authorities respect their culture and
stop carrying weapons, Western witnesses said Sunday.
   During the march, Tibetans beat five police officers who tried to
stop two Americans and one German from taking photographs, witnesses
said. Two of the Chinese police were hospitalized, they said.
   The demonstration, which occurred Friday in the capital of the
remote Himalayan region, was the first known protest led by students
from Tibet University. Buddhist monks have led other protests during
the past 15 months.
   After the incident, the Americans and the German, all men, were
detained for an hour at the Public Security Bureau, Western tourists
said. Chinese fined the two Americans $27 each and confiscated their
film, they said.
   A Lhasa city ordinance prohibits foreigners from taking
photographs of demonstrations.
   An English tourist, contacted by telephone from Beijing, said the
march began at the Potala temple, one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest
shrines.
   The demonstrators were carrying banners in Tibetan and Chinese,
asking for less restriction on the study of the Tibetan and more
respect for Tibetan culture and religion, he said. China in the
past, particularly during the leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
suppressed Tibetan culture and language, but in recent years have
pledged to respect Tibetan heritage.
   Another banner requested that all Chinese in Tibet stop carrying
firearms and treat Tibetans peacefully, he said.
   It referred to a pro-independence demonstration on Dec. 10 when
at least two Tibetans, including a monk and a child, were killed in
Lhasa. A Dutch woman was among the 13 people wounded in the protest.
   At least 38 people were killed during anti-Chinese demonstrations
in March 1988 and in October 1987.
   Tibetans activists seek independence from China's 38-year rule.
China claims Tibet has belonged to Beijing since the 13th century.
   Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, fled Lhasa
in 1959 and sought refuge in India after an aborted anti-Chinese
uprising.
   An American said the marchers walked down the city's main road
and around the city, passing several hotels frequented by foreign
tourists.
   The protest ended an hour later at Tibet University.

<BYLINE>India To Start Withdrawing Peacekeeping Troops ^By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India will start pulling its
peacekeeping troops out of Sri Lanka this week at the request of
President-elect Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Indian government
announced Sunday.
   Premadasa, who takes office Monday, promised during the election
campaign to send the Indian soldiers home.
   India sent an estimated 50,000 troops to the Indian Ocean island
in July 1987, hours after an accord was signed to end an insurgency
by Tamil rebels demanding a separate homeland in the north and east
provinces.
   India will withdraw two battalions in the next few days, the
Indian High Commission, or embassy, in Colombo announced at a news
conference.
   ``I cannot give you the mathematics of how many troops will be
involved but from what I know, from 2,000 to 3,000 troops, making up
two brigades, will be withdrawn, said H.M. Dixit, the Indian high
commissioner.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lanka's outgoing
president, Junius R. Jayewardene, discussed the withdrawal Saturday
during a summit of seven South Asian countries in Islamabad,
Pakistan, Dixit said.
   Opponents of the peace accord had feared Indian troops sent to
the island to disarm the Tamil rebels and enforce a cease-fire might
remain on the island indefinitely.
   ``The withdrawal is being done because we respect the public
sentiments in Sri Lanka, and this is sincere declaration that we
have no intention of staying permanently in Sri Lanka,'' Dixit said.
   India, the regional power, got involved in the conflict because
60 million Tamils living in southern India are sympathetic to the
rebels' cause. More than 626 Indian soldiers have died while trying
to enforce the agreement.
   Tamils, like the Indians, are mostly Hindus. They make up 18
percent of the island's 16 million people.
   Tamils have long accused the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese of
denying them jobs, education and money for development. The
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the country's population,
control the government and the military.
   Militant Tamils have been demanding an independent nation in the
north and east provinces, where Tamils concentrate. They have
rejected the government's offer of limited autonomy if they
surrender their weapons and end the 5-year-old guerrilla war that
has left more than 8,500 people dead.
   The accord also enraged Sinhalese radicals, who contend it grants
too many concessions to the Tamils and brought Indian troops across
the narrow 18-mile Palk Straits to Sri Lankan soil. Militants have
been blamed for the deaths of more than 900 people, most supporters
of the agreement.
   But Dixit said that during the last few months the ``process of
normalization has commenced ... And matters can be resolved in a
reasonable and amicable way.''
   ``As the situation improves further, as the devolution of powers
becomes effective. As the Indo-Sri Lanka agreement gets
progressively implemented, and as the mischief-making potential of
extremist elements opposed to the agreement is reduced, the
government is hopeful of making further withdrawals,'' Dixit said.

   Israeli soldiers with powerful binoculars
peer into the rocky expanse of southern Lebanon after warnings that
Palestinian guerrillas opposed to the PLO's peace overtures may try
to infiltrate Israel.
   Armed Palestinians have approached the barbed wire fence along
the border twice, on Dec. 26 and Dec. 28, and six of them were
killed by Israeli soldiers. Several rockets were fired into the
region from Lebanon on Friday.
   Army officials say they believe radical factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization may step up their attempts to infiltrate and
attack Israeli civilians to sabotage the PLO's movement toward
negotiation after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat recognized Israel.
   Maj. Gadi, commander of a battalion stationed in this northern
village, sees another new danger in a peace treaty signed in Beirut
lass than two weeks ago by the PLO and Amal, the Lebanese Shiite
Moslem militia.
   ``The Amal are acting as guides and bringing the terrorists up to
the border,'' says Gadi, whose last name cannot be used under army
regulations.
   To 25-year-old Capt. Yossi and other soldiers, all infiltrators
are terrorists whose purpose is to attack civilian settlements, many
of them collective farms that grow apples.
   There have been more than 20 major attempts to sneak into Israel
from Lebanon this year, some of them by sea. Battles between
infiltrators and Israeli troops have claimed the lives of five
soldiers and more than 25 guerrillas.
   In the more than two months Gadi's soldiers have been stationed
in Avivim, they have fought two battles with Lebanese guerrillas.
Three guerrillas were killed, Gadi said, but ``we are lucky there
are no casualties on our side.''
   The three infiltrators carried Soviet-designed Kalashnikov
rifles, grenades and rocket-propelled launchers.
   In the border sector next to Gadi's, Israeli soldiers escaped
injury in two recent battles with Palestinian guerrillas. Army
officials say the guerrillas' target was Kibbutz Manara, a
collective farm visible from a hilltop lookout post near Avivim.
   Gadi, who at 29 has served 11 years in the army, says 23 civilian
settlements lie in the 12-mile border strip under his command.
   Israel's elaborate border defenses against guerrilla attacks
includes a security zone on the Lebanese side patrolled by Israeli
soldiers and an Israeli-backed Christian militia in Lebanon.
   Near Avivim, the zone stretches from 1{ miles to seven miles
north of the border. Mines are buried just inside Lebanon, and
rusting rolls of concertina barbed wire are strung along both sides
of the border.
   Touching the electronic border fence sets off alarms that army
officers say can indicate to within about 100 yards where the
trouble is.
   On the Israeli side, a road is patrolled by Israeli trucks and a
dusty strip is swept frequently so that any footprints can be
detected.
   Still, says Yossi, both Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite
guerrillas keep trying to penetrate the barrier. ``It takes only
five minutes to cut the fence,'' he says.
   Yossi says the infiltrators' trick is to try to sneak up as close
as possible during the day, then cut through the fence at night.
   ``There are teen-agers sent into the border who don't stand a
chance,'' he noted.
   The army says Palestinian guerrillas have carried leaflets saying
they want to take civilian hostages to trade for colleagues jailed
in Israel. Claims of responsibility often call for liberating Arab
land lost with the creation of Israel in 1948.
   About 300 yards from the border, an Israeli collective farm
called Kibbutz Malkiyya is protected by a soldier at the gate, a
nearby army lookout post and rolls of concertina wire.
   Across the fence, Lebanese farmers can be seen tending fields
neatly divided by stones and herding sheep. Arab villages sit on
hilltops in the distance.
   ``It's green and nice until the shooting starts,'' says Gadi.

<HEAD>Nation's Largest DA's Office Wracked by Scandal over Informants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers deride them as ``snitches,''
``swine,'' and ``creeps,'' an underworld of jailhouse informants who
curry favor with prosecutors and win rewards for incriminating
testimony.
   Now, a disclosure by one informant of how easily a prisoner can
frame someone with bogus testimony has exploded into scandal for the
nation's largest district attorney's office. Though prosecutors say
only a tiny fraction of cases involve jailhouse informants, they are
reviewing more than 130 cases of the past decade for possible taint
by lying informants.
   Among the convictions being reviewed are such high-profile
prosecutions as those of the so-called Hillside Strangler, Angelo
Buono; the Freeway Killer, William Bonin; and Skid Row Slasher Bobby
Joe Maxwell. Also under scrutiny is the ongoing McMartin preschool
molestation trial in which an informant was a key witness against
defendant Raymond Buckey.
   The district attorney's office also is re-evaluating its policy
on use of jailhouse informants as witnesses. And two attorney groups
have asked the grand jury to appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate the situation.
   ``It's a corruption of the system. ...,'' said Leslie Abramson,
president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. ``They
(prosecutors) shouldn't be using these people because they should
know that they're lying.''
   Assistant District Attorney Curt Livesay, third-ranking official
in the office, said most prosecutors abhor the use of informants,
but they provide valuable information.
   ``Jailhouse informants are liars, thieves, murderers, criminals.
They would put their mothers in prison in their stead if they
could,'' he said. ``But they help us solve crimes we wouldn't
otherwise solve.''
   The incident that spurred the debate in Los Angeles' legal
community involves Leslie White, a repeat offender and longtime
informant who frequently testified against other prisoners.
   In return, he said, he received furloughs from prison, a
recommendation for parole, a reduction of bail and $1,800 from ``a
witness protection fund'' as well as $900 for his wife's relocation.
   Then, in October, White demonstrated to authorities that by using
a jail telephone and posing as a bail bondsman, a prosecutor or
police detective, he could gather enough information about a murder
case to concoct a confession by a defendant he had never met.
   A defense lawyer who heard of the demonstration took the story to
the media and White became a cause celebre. He admitted he had
committed perjury in more than one case and suggested that some men
may have gone to Death Row partly because of informants' false
testimony.
   With his newfound celebrity status, the 31-year-old White
reportedly has hired an agent to represent him for book and movie
deals.
   The district attorney's office has been under fire since White's
disclosures.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner, who heads an 800-prosecutor agency,
promised an investigation that would be ``one of the most
thoroughgoing and most forthcoming inquiries that any department has
ever made.''
   He also defended the use of informants, saying: ``Informants tell
us where the body is buried. They tell us where the gun that was
used in the killing can be found. ... You can't turn the other ear,
nor should you responsibly turn the other way.''
   Attorney Robert Berke, who filed a lengthy brief for California
Attorneys for Criminal Justice in its campaign for a special
prosecutor, says Los Angeles County has paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars to jailhouse informants, which may constitute malfeasance
by public officials. Prosecutors generally describe any payments as
expenses, to relocate people who are leaving jail for example.
   ``When incentives like this are available to people under
sentence in jail, desperate people, you get unreliable testimony,''
said Berke.
   Attorney Gigi Gordon, head of the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Bar
Association's Informant Investigation Committee, equated such
payments to bribery.
   ``Where did anyone get the idea that they have to give an
informant anything?'' she asked.
   ``The real tragedy,'' said Ms. Abramson, ``is that they only use
these guys in cases where the evidence is weak. So they are
increasing the risk of convicting the innocent.''
   Livesay said the number of cases in which informants testify make
up little more than 1 percent of the total felonies filed by his
office each year, and agreed that the cases are often the weaker
ones.
   ``There's not a public prosecutor in the world who wants to call
a jailhouse informant as a witness,'' he said. ``It detracts from
the case. Typically, they're called when you have a case with a hole
in it.''
   But the prosecutor expressed skepticism about the role of defense
attorneys, saying they sometimes offer to have their own clients
turn informant.
   ``While we have defense attorneys lamenting the use of jailhouse
informants, when the informant is their client, they're the first
ones in our office,'' he said.
   ``That's the most despicable thing I've ever heard,'' Ms.
Abramson responded. ``When you run around offering immunity to
murderers, you have no right to get on a moral high horse.
   ``My clients are not informants. I do not represent professional
snitches.''

<HEAD>North Korea Leader Invites South Korean President To Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung on Sunday invited
his South Korean counterpart, Roh Tae-woo, and six other political
and religious leaders to a political conference, official North
Korean media reported.
   The Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, said Kim
proposed a ``political consultative meeting of leadership-level
people from the North and South'' to discuss the reunification of
Korea.
   Kim made the proposal in a New Year's speech. He did not name
Roh, but extended the invitation to the head of the governing
Democratic Justice Party, the agency said.
   Kim said the meeting also should be attended by the leaders of
the three main South Korean opposition parties: the Party for Peace
and Democracy, the Reunification Democratic Party and the New
Democratic Republican Party. The three parties are led,
respectively, by Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
   Kim also invited Cardinal Kim Su-hwan, the leader of South
Korea's Roman Catholic Church; the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan and Mr. Paek
Ki-wan, the leaders of a popular movement that has played a
prominent role in past struggles against authoritarian governments.
   Korea was divided into North Korea and South Korea in 1945, when
Soviet and U.S. troops ended Japan's colonial rule over the
peninsula at the end of World War II. Communist North Korea invaded
the South in 1950 to begin the three-year Korean War.
   In recent months, the two Koreas have traded new proposals for
dialogue, and lawmakers from the two sides have met in a series of
talks, the latest on Thursday in the border village of Panmunjom.
   North Korea also has called for political and military talks on
arms reductions and other tension-easing measures. It also has
called for three-way talks among the two Koreas and the United
States, which has 42,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
   Kim Il Sung's message called for an end to the annual U.S.-South
Korean military exercises, called ``Team Spirit.'' The joint
exercises held each spring are in preparation for a possible North
Korean invasion.
   ``If the South Korean authorities are ready to bring about a new
turn in their policy in response to these endeavors of ours, they
should, at least, clearly express their attitude not to stage the
... joint military exercises this year,'' Kim said.
   South Korea says the exercises are defensive maneuvers, but North
Korea maintains that they are a threat to its security. The North
last week made a halt to the joint exercises a condition for
progress in the lawmakers' talks.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels Reportedly Agree To Negotiate With Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eritrean rebel group that has waged
Africa's longest civil war has agreed to negotiate with the
Ethiopian government for an end to the 26-year-old rebellion, a
Sudanese newspaper reported Sunday.
   Omar Reyh, chairman of the Eritrean Liberation Front-Unified
Organization, said Sudan proposed the talks after a recent visit to
Khartoum by an Ethiopian delegation, the Al-Siyassa newspaper
reported.
   The newspaper quoted Reyh as saying he met Saturday with Sudanese
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, who suggested Sudan as the site for the
negotiations.
   ``Sudan proposed that there be a preparatory meeting between the
Eritrean and Ethiopian sides to prepare for an official negotiating
delegation,'' the rebel leader was quoted as saying. ``We have
accepted this proposal.''
   There was no immediate word from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian
capital, about the Marxist government's position on the proposal.
   The governments of Sudan and Ethiopia often have exchanged
charges of harboring each other's rebels, but relations have
improved recently.
   Three factions of the Eritrean Liberation Front _ which have been
fighting 26 years for independence of their northern Ethiopian
region _ joined forces on Jan. 23, 1985, as the Eritrean Liberation
Front-Unified Organization.
   The Eritrean revolt, exacerbated by famine, has forced about
850,000 Ethiopians across the border into Sudan in search of safety.

   In the year since an oil spill fouled two
rivers and threatened drinking water in three states, the company
responsible has been indicted, inspectors have been fired and new
laws proposed.
   And still in question is the long-term environmental damage of
the spill that killed millions of fish in parts of the Monongahela
and Ohio rivers.
   ``We have had a major change in the river that has to be studied
and watched. These are of grave concern,'' said Tom Proch, fish
biologist with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources.
   But Dr. Edgar Berkey of the Center for Hazardous Materials
Research at the University of Pittsburgh, who supervised a $750,000
study funded by Ashland Oil Inc., said the most significant effects
of the spill occurred ``over the short term, and these are largely
past.''
   Last Jan. 2, a rebuilt Ashland Oil storage tank holding more than
3.8 million gallons of diesel fuel collapsed at the company's
terminal 25 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   A tidal wave of 705,000 gallons of oil surged into the
Monongahela, which was swollen and swift from heavy rains.
   Emergency workers recovered about 30 percent of the fuel. But
most of the oil entered the Ohio River at downtown Pittsburgh and
kept moving into Ohio and West Virginia, threatening drinking water
supplies for millions of people.
   About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents lost tap water for
nearly a week until the heaviest pollution passed their water
companies' intakes, and several businesses and schools were closed
for a few days.
   An apologetic Ashland Oil took the blame and paid the bills. It
agreed to clean up the soil and ground water at the terminal,
inspect its 150 facilities nationwide and pay damage claims
associated with the spill.
   The Ashland, Ky.-based company so far has paid $17 million, or
about 80 percent of 6,000 claims, said Ashland spokesman Roger
Schrum.
   But the company's contrition didn't spare it from criminal
charges, particularly after engineers determined a dime-sized flaw
in the steel wall of the oil tank caused its collapse and a state
task force concluded Ashland was negligent.
   On Sept. 15, a federal grand jury indicted Ashland on two
misdemeanor counts for allegedly violating the federal Clean Water
and Refuse acts, and a state investigation is still under way.
   Ashland reacted bitterly to the charges and produced a 1986 memo
from the Allegheny County fire marshal's office confirming the
company's claim that it had approval to begin construction of the
rebuilt tank. County officials had long denied that any permission
was given.
   Three people in the fire marshal's office, including the chief,
resigned or were fired over what their superiors called shoddy work
practices.
   Meanwhile, a flurry of federal and state legislation pertaining
to above-ground storage tanks has been proposed, but nothing has
been enacted. Rep. Doug Walgren, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said he
plans to reintroduce his bill to regulate aboveground storage tanks
when Congress returns this month.
   The spill killed roughly 2,000 ducks nesting along the rivers in
Pennsylvania and injured others. Few ducklings hatched in the spring.
   It is believed the kill in Pennsylvania was limited to about
11,000 fish. But downriver in West Virginia, about 3 million dead
fish were counted, a state report said.
   The higher count in West Virginia is believed to be due to a
slower current and the oil mixing with sediments and sinking to the
river bottom, where fish feed in the winter, explained Berkey.
   Berkey said heavy rains that began around Jan. 19 dispersed the
oil deposited on the river bottom, preventing similar problems
downriver.
   ``The rain pretty much cleaned the system,'' he said. ``The bulk
of the spill is south of New Orleans by now ... but in such diluted
quantities that it would be difficult to identify.''
   Despite the kill, Proch said fishing in the Ohio, Monongahela and
Allegheny rivers this year was reported to be good.
   A major cause for concern, however, is an apparent decline of
minnows, a key food for game fish. But Berkey said there have been
extreme fluctuations in the minnow population in the past decade for
reasons not known.
   He agreed that additional studies should be conducted.
   Alan Vicory, director of the Cincinnati-based Ohio River Valley
Water Sanitation Commission, said he does not believe the rivers
pose a health risk to humans.
   ``But I certainly think there is a question about the long-term
impacts,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teen Assumed a Runaway By Sheriffs Found After Lost 6 Days in Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A missing teen whom sheriffs stopped looking for
because they considered him a runaway was found hungry and
disoriented in a national forest where he had been lost and
wandering for six days.
   Andrew Campbell, 15, was found with frost-bitten hands and toes
in an oak grove of Cleveland National Forest by a father and son out
for a drive. Campbell's parents were in another part of the forest,
still searching for their son who had gotten lost returning from a
fishing trip Dec. 24.
   ``How can you give up when it's your own son? You just can't,''
said Leonard Campbell, the boy's stepfather, who expressed anger at
authorities for giving up on the boy.
   Campbell was listed in fair condition Sunday at Sharp Memorial
Hospital, where he was taken Friday by ambulance following his
rescue.
   ``He looks pretty sunken, like he needs to have some food,''
Pauline Renner, a hospital spokeswoman, had said Saturday. ``But
aside from that, he's pretty alert and with it.''
   Renner said the boy had frostbitten feet and toes. Nighttime
temperatures dipped into the 20s for several days while the boy was
missing, according to weather forecasters.
   A staff nurse who refused to give her name said Campbell was
transferred out of the hospital's intensive care unit Saturday
morning and into a general-care ward. The nurse said the family
requested no other information be released.
   Authorities abandoned the search for Campbell on Tuesday after
dogs trailing his scent lost it near a roadside. Despite his
parents' protests, sheriff's officials said they believed Campbell,
who once ran away from home, hitched a ride out of the forest and
was safe.
   The boy initially was listed as a runaway when his mother, Debbie
Campbell, reported to the Sheriff's Department that he was missing.
The department changed his status when his parents complained about
the runaway designation.
   At the hospital Friday, Leonard Campbell said he was upset over
the sheriff's department's decision to end the search.
   ``They have their political situation over there and they have
things they have to do,'' he said.
   A statement issued Saturday by the Sheriff's Department said
officials will review how the search was handled for Campbell.
Volunteer search and rescue units used horses and dogs to look for
the teen-ager, until the hunt was called off. The department ``will
continue to retrace his tracks to determine how he became lost,''
the statement said.
   Campbell was rescued by Bill Orsborn, 60, a retired firefighter
from La Mesa, and his son, Mark, 29.
   ``He was just off under some oak trees wandering around,'' Bill
Orsborn said Friday night. ``He was disoriented. He didn't know
where he was, how long he was out there or what day it was.''
   The boy told the Orsborns he survived by eating snow and fish he
caught but said little else about the ordeal.
   Campbell was reunited with his mother and stepfather soon after
he was found. As the Orsborns drove him out of the forest, young
Campbell recognized the family car in a parking area. The parents
were nearby searching for the boy.
   Campbell said the boy survived because he was resourceful and had
warm clothing.
   ``What saved him was his field jacket because it had a hood on it
and he was able to pull it up around his head to keep himself
warm,'' he said.

   Lucille Hollingsworth House decided about 30
years ago to start collecting, rather than throwing out, anything
she could find ``that was old-looking.''
   Now, after three decades of bringing home everything from gravy
boats to photographs of the Apollo lunar landings, the 79-year-old
Mrs. House has what surely must be west Alabama's finest collection
of, well, stuff. It's all contained in and around Ma'Cille's Museum
of Miscellania.
   The key word there is ``miscellania,'' as in a serving platter
shaped like a fish or the barbed-wire fence exhibit in the rambling,
wooden-frame museum adjoining Mrs. House's rural home.
   The only real advertising Mrs. House does is located along a
two-lane highway near Gordo, about 20 miles east of the Mississippi
line. A faded sign points down the road toward her home, and another
placard at the house lets the curious know they have arrived.
   Mrs. House says she is still collecting things, but there is one
problem. Ma'Cille's museum is getting crowded.
   On top of the building's tin roof are hundreds _ maybe thousands
_ of bottles. An old newspaper clipping about the museum said the
bottles are up there so the sun can clean them.
   Mrs. House has a simpler explanation: ``I ran out of places to
put them.''

   Some children giggle as they sidle up
to the judge's bench to adopt their teddy bears, GI Joes and baby
dolls, but they mean every word of their pledges to be good parents.
   ``The kids come in and I place them under oath, ask them a few
questions and issue a certificate,'' said Clark Superior Court Judge
George A. Jacobs, who conducts the annual adoption proceedings for
new Christmas toys.
   ``It's a fun thing for the kids, but it also has a positive side.
We think it gives a good impression. It shows them that the law is
here to help, not hurt, them,'' said Jacobs, 42.
   Fifty-two children from this southeastern Indiana community
trekked to the courtroom on Saturday to become part of the tradition
Jacobs began in 1984, when Cabbage Patch dolls complete with their
own adoption papers were popular.
   That year, 700 children participated. Since then, Jacobs has
performed 50 to 150 adoptions each year. Some of the children are
themselves adopted, brought to the ceremony by their parents to show
them what an adoption is like.
   The adopted toys tend to become permanent playthings, Jacobs said.
   Instead of losing their luster as the Christmas charm fades, the
toys ``become special, have a new lasting importance.''

   Gunmen killed a 27-year-old man and
wounded a policeman after officers confronted a group painting
anti-government slogans on a wall, the dead man's father said Sunday.
   Police in the northern city of Arica said by telephone that the
incident occurred Saturday night but refused to provide details. A
police spokesman said an official report will be issued, probably
Monday.
   A Santiago radio station, Radio Chilena, called the gunmen
``unidentified civilians,'' an expression often used to refer to
members of the National Information Agency, the military regime's
secret police.
   Omar Cautivo said his son, Salvador, a worker at a local chemical
plant, was shot dead and that a police officer was wounded.
   Cautivo said his son with with a group of friends painting
anti-government slogans on a wall in a suburb of Arica, 1,250 miles
north of Santiago. A police patrol appeared and ordered the group to
stop, Cautivo said.
   A group of civilians watching the scene a few yards away opened
fire with automatic weapons, killing Salvador and wounding one
officer, Cautivo said.
   The man said police later arrested two daughters of his, one of
them at the local hospital where she went to find out about her
brother.
   The independent Human Rights Commission in Arica, which normally
reports on this type of incidents, was closed on Sunday because of
New Year's.

<HEAD>PTL Bankruptcy Judge Calls Bakker `Sawed-Off Runt'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the PTL bankruptcy case
called for stricter scrutiny of religious groups in newspaper
interviews in which he described former PTL leader Jim Bakker as a
``little, sawed-off runt.''
   Rufus Reynolds, who retired Saturday as a U.S. bankruptcy judge,
told the Greensboro News &amp; Record that television ministries are
``wide open'' for mismanagement or corruption. He also said he
received death threats while he was handling the case.
   ``I think Congress should pass a very strong act forcing the IRS
(Internal Revenue Service) ... to make them comply with an
accounting,'' Reynolds said. ``We have all kinds of laws protecting
consumers. Religion is just another consumer item, just the same as
selling soap or washing powders or aspirin.''
   In a separate interview with The Charlotte Observer, the
81-year-old Reynolds said he was amazed at the response to the
travails that brought down Bakker's evangelistic empire.
   ``What puzzled me was why people were interested in that little,
sawed-off runt,'' Reynolds said.
   The PTL founder Sunday criticized the judge's comments.
   ``I am shocked to find Judge Reynolds so prejudiced toward us,
and to hear of him making fun of us and the PTL partners,'' Bakker
said in a statement released by one of his attorneys. ``He should
not have tried the PTL case with these feelings against us.''
   The interviews were published Sunday, the day after Reynolds'
tenure in the bankruptcy case ended with his retirement.
   The ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws
in June 1987, three months after Bakker resigned from PTL amid a
sex-and-money scandal.
   Two months ago, Reynolds ordered Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and
former aide David Taggart to repay PTL nearly $7.7 million in
benefits he found to be excessive. Last month, he approved the sale
of PTL assets to a Canadian businessman.
   It was also last month that a federal grand jury indicted Bakker
and former top aide Richard Dortch on criminal fraud and conspiracy
charges, accusing them of diverting more than $4 million in PTL
money for their own benefit. Bakker is scheduled to appear in U.S.
District Court in Charlotte on Jan. 17.
   Upon his retirement, Reynolds told the Observer that he left the
PTL case discouraged and somewhat cynical.
   For the first time as a bankruptcy judge, Reynolds was guarded by
U.S. marshals. He said the FBI investigated death threats.
   ``I didn't know Christians could be so critical. They would just
chew me out,'' Reynolds said.
   When a woman called the bankruptcy court in Columbia to find out
if he was a Christian, ``I said, `You tell her I was when I started
this case, but now I plead the Fifth Amendment.'''
   In talking with the News &amp; Record, Reynolds said he would like to
see closer government regulation of all not-for-profit corporations,
including churches.
   ``They're handling (money) the way they damn please. They mold a
religion to fit their pocketbook,'' Reynolds said.
   He dismissed arguments that stricter regulation of broadcast
ministries might violate First Amendment guarantees of freedom of
speech and worship.
   ``The First Amendment has no relation to accounting for money,''
Reynolds said. ``When you go stealing other people's money, you
can't say, `The Bible excuses me. I've been forgiven by the Lord.'
That doesn't apply.''

   It may not be everyone's idea of a good time,
especially coming on the heels of New Year's Eve, but the 49 men and
women who plunged into the icy waters of Boston Harbor on Sunday
seemed to enjoy themselves.
   To keep up the 85-year tradition of the L Street Brownies
swimming club, men and women ranging in age from teen-agers to
octogenarians took the yearly New Year's morning dip in the harbor.
   Before they ran down the strip of beach into the water, club
president Paul Levenson apologized to onlookers for ``the mild
weather over which we have no control.'' It was 25 degrees outside.
   ``Not bad,'' said Al Binari, 55, of Somerville, as he exited the
29-degree water wearing nothing more than a brief pair of swimming
trunks.
   ``It was great!'' said Frances Tobin, who appeared to be in her
50s and said it was her first winter swim. ``I said I was going to
do it and I did it.''
   Many of the swimmers are longtime members of the L Street
Brownies, a swimming club which has its headquarters at the L Street
Bathhouse in South Boston. Many, like George Graney, 75, Jerry
Collins, 82, and Joe Alecks, 77, have been swimming year-round for
decades.
   ``We do it for health reasons,'' said Graney. ``It's a
discipline. We do it every day, like joggers. Some days we have to
chop the ice away before we go in.''
   ``They do it for their sex lives,'' retorted Paul Wolan, 78, who
stopped swimming year-round recently but still takes daily dips from
March until November.
   One of the younger club members, Peter Jurzynski, 37, scoffed at
questions about the cleanliness of Boston Harbor, which was an issue
in last year's presidential campaign.
   ``The yuppies go to the Caribbean; we have the crystal clear
waters of Boston Harbor,'' Jurzynski said.
   The group clustered together for a photograph before the swim,
several wearing New Year's Eve hats and others reluctant to discard
their shirts and sweatpants until the last minute.
   Collins, who said he's been swimming on New Year's Day since
1925, walked out of the water smiling.
   ``Really refreshing,'' he said.

   A bespectacled language professor says no
one got his side of the story before mistakenly arresting him
because of a note he found that threatened to blow up an American
Airlines jetliner.
   Now that his ordeal is over, Peter M. Canning, 40, said at a news
conference Saturday, he's headed for a job interview at Yale
University. He was on his way Tuesday to a New Orleans convention,
where he hoped to have several job interviews, when a stewardess
mistakenly thought a note Canning found in his tray-table was a bomb
threat written by him.
   ``I thought it was a nightmare at first. It occurred to me that I
might wake up,'' said Canning, a lecturer at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   He said he hasn't decided whether to sue anyone over the false
charge of making a bomb threat Tuesday aboard flight 240 from San
Francisco to Dallas. He was arrested in Albuquerque, N.M., where the
plane made an emergency landing.
   Charges were dropped Thursday, after an 11-year-old boy admitted
he wrote the note and left it on the plane. The boy took the flight
just before Canning's and had sat in the same seat as Canning.
   When the dropping of the charges was announced, Jim Nelson, the
FBI's top agent in New Mexico, said he regretted ``any inconvenience
or embarrassment suffered by Mr. Canning'' but said the arrest was
justified based on what agents knew at the time.
   Canning's attorney in Albuquerque, Ray Twohig, said he has
advised Canning to wait a week or so before deciding what action to
take.
   Canning, in his first statement since charges were dropped, told
how he handed the note to a flight attendant after it fell into his
lap from a fold-out tray after lunch.
   ``Part of the note said, `There is bombs planted all over this
airplane.' ... Two minutes into reading this, I thought it was
placed there as a prank,'' said Canning, a slightly built man who
wore tinted glasses, jeans and a wool sports coat.
   He told reporters he gave the crumpled, two-page note to a flight
attendant, who walked to the front of the plane.
   ``Thirty seconds later she returned and said `Is this your note?'
and I said `No, it is not.' But before I could say anything else,
she spun on her heels _ she was understandably nervous _ but no one
ever came back to ask me for an explanation,'' he said.
   The plane was diverted to Albuquerque, where Canning was
questioned by the FBI for two hours and arrested. Later, authorities
asked him to supply several handwriting samples.
   ``I didn't start panicking, I started getting angry,'' said
Canning.
   He was arraigned in federal court in New Mexico and released on
his own recognizance.
   He learned that the charges had been dropped while driving back
to Berkeley in a rental car Friday night because no airline would
book him a seat. He had stopped at a restaurant near the
California-Arizona border and saw a newspaper headline.
   ``I'm now relieved, as you can imagine,'' Canning said.
   Before the incident, Canning was en route to the convention of
the Modern Language Association in New Orleans, where the Harvard
doctoral candidate hoped to attend several job interviews.
   Faculty members at Yale agreed to reschedule his interview, he
said, adding that it was too soon to tell whether missing several
other interviews will hurt his career.

<HEAD>Centennial Cattle Drive Faces 20th Century Problems _ Water Quality
Permit?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers hoping to herd 10,000 head of
cattle through south-central Montana to celebrate the state's
centennial are facing problems never dreamed of by cowboys of 100
years ago.
   For one thing, no one in 1889 had to worry about a water quality
permit. For another, they are planning to move an unusually large
number of cattle.
   But organizers say they're not deterred by questions of
environmental impact or such cowboy insider worries as whether the
cattle will balk when driven toward a river crossing at midday.
   The problems will be overcome, they say, and the six-day drive
will come off Sept. 4 through 9, one of a year-long series of events
celebrating Montana's admission to the Union on Nov. 8, 1889.
   Interest in the drive spans several continents, according to Jim
Wempner, a Billings-area rancher and director of the event. However,
only 700 people so far have indicated they will participate, he said.
   Wempner did not know how many cattle that included, but said each
person must consign at least one animal.
   He said he expects the drive to involve 200 wagons and 5,000
cowboys, including 100 experienced trail hands.
   ``It's going to happen,'' Wempner said, despite numerous
obstacles stemming from a state-level review of the drive's
potential environmental impact.
   ``We do the same thing for 2,000 cattle as we would with 10,000
cattle,'' he said. ``There's not that much of a difference. This is
just a larger number.''
   Organizers bill it as one of the largest cattle drives in history.
   But state officials have questioned whether the sponsors will be
able to overcome problems, including the handling of wastes created
by people and livestock along the 58-mile route between Roundup and
Billings.
   Outgoing Lt. Gov. Gordon McOmber, chairman of the state
Centennial Commission, said experienced cattlemen also have
criticized the plan.
   He said they cite behavioral quirks of cattle that could lead to
problems, such as a possibility the animals might refuse to cross a
river during the heat of the day. The angle of the sun may make it
impossible for the cattle to see the bottom, causing them to balk.
   ``Those things are long forgotten in this day and age,'' McOmber
said.
   Organizers need permits and water quality variances to allow
cattle to cross rivers and streams and possibly air quality
variances if cattle are moved along dusty dirt roads, officials said.
   People from across the United States and two from Australia have
applied to participate, Wempner said, adding that filmmakers from
West Germany, France and Switzerland have shown interest in
documenting the event.
   Wempner estimated it would cost $500,000 to stage the drive.
   Among the other events planned for the centennial is a 250-mile
wagon train trek being organized by the Montana Draft Horse and Mule
Association.
   More than 80 wagons, 17 riding groups, 367 horses and 301 people
are registered and about a half-dozen others are on a waiting list
for the trip, planned for June and July.

   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said Sunday
a tax increase probably will be part of a bipartisan budget
compromise in 1989 despite President-elect Bush's pledge to oppose
higher taxes.
   The Illinois Republican, two days before the new congressional
session, said he does not believe there is enough room to cut
spending to meet deficit-reduction targets.
   ``I don't know that there is that much flexibility,'' Michel
said. ``When I served on the budget summit the last time around, we
found we had to take a measure of that (tax increases). I suspect
that down the road a piece that may be part of the answer.''
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he takes Bush's
opposition to more taxes at face value.
   ``My view is the same as the president-elect, George Bush,'' Dole
said. ``I didn't coin the phrase, `read my lips.' But I think he
means it. And I don't see any give in that area at this point.''
   Bush repeatedly stressed his opposition to taxes during the
presidential campaign by urging any doubters to ``read my lips.''
   Michel and Dole were interviewed on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' along with House Majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., and
Senate Majority leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The 101st Congress convenes Tuesday for a swearing-in, with
committee hearings on Republican Cabinet appointees among the first
order of business prior to the Jan. 20 inauguration.
   The congressional leaders expressed agreement that Bush should
make the first move in proposing answers.
   ``The president-elect should go first,'' Dole said ``We know
we're going to have to face it. My own view is it (a compromise)
will come together.''
   Michel, Foley and Mitchell, questioned about the upcoming trial
of former White House aide Oliver North on charges stemming from the
Iran-Contra affair, agreed a sitting president should not be forced
to appear in court to give testimony.
   North's lawyers on Friday subpoenaed both President Reagan and
Bush to testify as defense witnesses at the trial.
   ``There are ways a president can become a part'' of a trial, said
Foley. ``But his actual appearance in court is discouraged.''
   The House members suggested a statement by Reagan or Bush given
out of court might be satisfactory.
   Mitchell said ``there is a strong presumption'' against requiring
a president to testify. But Mitchell said Reagan's legal protection
against appearing in court may be reduced after he leaves office on
Jan. 20.
   Mitchell also challenged the idea that Reagan's testimony would
be helpful to North. The senator said North testified during
congressional hearings that he acted without Reagan's knowledge in
funneling proceeds from Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Mitchell also said it would be improper for Reagan to be
pressured into pardoning North because of the possibility the
president could be required to testify.
   Any special treatment for North would support the idea there are
``two standards of justice'' for government officials and everyone
else, Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Two Men Nab `Suspect,' Wind Up In Jail Themselves</HEAD>

   Two men investigating a house burglary on
their own used a gun to deliver a teen-age ``suspect'' to police,
but it was the two men who ended up charged in the incident, police
said Sunday.
   ``You can't be your own vigilante,'' said Police Lt. James
Gabriel.
   Allen Lane Calvey, 57, and Nikita J. Vambaketes, 36, were charged
by the Madison County state's attorney with aggravated unlawful
restraint, a felony, following the incident Wednesday, said police
in this southern Illinois city.
   Calvey, whose home was burglarized in late November, also was
charged with compelling a confession by force or threat, another
felony, Gabriel said.
   Police said Calvey had apparently been investigating the burglary
on his own when he and Vambaketes went Wednesday to the home of
18-year-old Dennis L. Teague.
   Calvey brandished a gun in the confrontation, and forced Teague
to go to the Alton police station, Gabriel said. Calvey took Teague
inside while Vambaketes, who then took the gun, stayed in the car,
according to Gabriel.
   Gabriel said police had no evidence that Teague was involved in
the burglary, so he was not charged in the incident. But Teague was
arrested on a warrant for a past misdemeanor charge of failure to
appear in court on a retail theft charge, police said.
   Calvey was freed on a $25,000 bond soon after his arrest, police
said. Vambaketes remained in the Madison County Jail in lieu of
$13,000 bond Sunday awaiting a court appearance, said a jail
employee who did not give his name.
   The teen-ager, meanwhile, pleaded guilty Thursday to failure to
appear in court, and was released after being ordered to pay a $100
fine and court costs, Gabriel said.
   Gabriel said he was not sure if anything was taken in the
burglary of Calvey's home.
   Lt. Robert Lahlein, chief of detectives, said the two men
exceeded their authority.
   ``Illinois statute gives certain arrest powers to citizens, but
not under these circumstances,'' he said. ``That's why we have
police.''

   Singer-actor Yves Montand, one of France's
most popular performers, rang in the New Year with a brand new baby,
becoming a father for the first time at the age of 67.
   Valentin Giovanni Jacques was born New Year's Eve to Montand's
girlfriend, 28-year-old Carole Amiel, at a private clinic in this
Riviera city. The baby weighed in at 9 pounds.
   Talking to reporters at the clinic on New Year's Day, Montand
said he felt ``a mixture of joy and worry. It is both strange,
wonderful and moving.''
   The singer admitted ``having first been panicked just before the
birth, then to see this little superb thing, without false modesty,
I was very happy and very happy for Carole. It is a beautiful baby.
... All of a sudden, I feel a new responsibility. I say to myself,
`I have a son,' and at 67, life is beginning.''
   Montand, born Ivo Livi to a poor family in Italy, immigrated to
France with his family at the age of 3. Giovanni, he said, is his
father's name, Jacques is for poet Jacques Prevert and Carole's
father, ``and Valentin simply because we find it a nice name.''
   Montand had no children from his 33-year marriage with actress
Simone Signoret, who died in 1985.

   Singer Eddie Money is booked for a
February festival celebrating improved U.S.-Soviet relations that
will feature rock 'n' roll musicians, dance and gospel groups and
politicians from both nations.
   ``It will be a giant celebration _ a potpourri of Soviet and
American groups,'' said Dixie Belcher, director of Camai, an Alaska
arts organization co-sponsoring the Feb. 24-25 event with the Alaska
State Chamber of Commerce.
   Belcher said the festival was first proposed last summer by Stas
Namin, a Soviet rock musician whose records have sold more than 40
million copies. Camai is still seeking commitments from other groups.
   The Soviet rocker will do the concert for free, while Money,
known for such hits as ``Take Me Home Tonight'' and ``Walk on
Water,'' will expect to get money, Belcher said.
   Namin, grandson of a prominent Soviet politician, began his
career when Leonid Brezhnev was the Soviet leader and rock music was
an underground phenomenon that flourished largely via illegal
records and tapes.
   ``He was not allowed to perform in public,'' Belcher said.
   Under Gorbachev, Namin and many other Soviet rock musicians have
official status as state-supported artists, and some have toured
abroad.

   Woody Allen is back behind a camera, Aretha
Franklin hopes to hit the typewriter keys and singer Lou Reed is
preparing a tribute to Andy Warhol, all part of the coming
attractions of 1989.
   The three are among 36 artists who told The New York Times about
their projects for the new year, the newspaper reported Sunday.
   Their previews:
   _Allen, the director-writer-actor, is filming a ``contemporary
comedy,'' set in New York, featuring himself, Mia Farrow, Alan Alda,
Martin Landau, Anjelica Huston, Daryl Hannah, Claire Bloom and Sam
Waterston. ``It runs a very, very wide gamut from extremely serious
material to comic material,'' he said.
   _Franklin, the gospel and pop singer and songwriter, plans to
write a book about her experiences, particularly her days traveling
with her father and singing gospel from age 14 to 17. She'll also be
performing solo concerts in the East, and she has four new songs in
the works. ``Most of my songs are very romantic,'' she said,
``because I'm very sentimental.''
   _Reed, the rock singer and songwriter, is working on a show
honoring the late artist Warhol that is to be staged in New York in
the fall. ``The piece is about Andy, and some of the songs are from
his point of view,'' said Reed.

   A new trio called Heirloom is aptly
named: The three women in it are each members of gospel music family
groups that have performed for generations.
   Sheri Easter of the Lewis Family, Candy Hemphill Christmas of the
Hemphills and Tanya Goodman-Sykes of the Goodman Family say they
have joined together to form the trio and are in the midst of
finishing an as-yet-untitled LP.
   The album focuses on vocals and each woman contributed a few
songs. The result is a mix of ``polished bluegrass all the way to
contemporary pop influences,'' Ms. Christmas said.
   ``The three of us together make a style of our own that is
unique, but it's not foreign to what we've been doing on our own,''
she said.
   The three, who have all recorded solo projects as well as their
work with their respective families, say they will continue to
record separately and plan a tour together following their debut
Friday at a Nashville concert.

<HEAD>Earthquake, Blackout Bring In New Year In Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Year roared into Lima Sunday with a
strong earthquake and on the heels of a blackout believed caused by
leftist guerrillas, officials said.
   Civil Defense officials said they had no reports of damage or
injury in the earthquake.
   The quake struck at 5:16 a.m. and registered at 5.5 on the
Richter scale, said Miguel Morales, a spokesman for the Geophysical
Institute of Peru. He said the epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean,
70 miles southwest of Lima.
   The New Year dawned with Pervians facing their most serious
economic recession this century, with inflation expected to reach
1,800 percent this year. Last year also brought an upsurge in the
Shining Path guerrilla movement's eight-year insurgency to impose
Marxist rule.
   Saturday was the second New Year's Eve in a row that Lima, a
frequent target of power outages caused by rebels, was hit by a
blackout.
   The problems did not stop Lima residents from enjoying New Year's
revelry, including the widespread use of fireworks and burning
traditional bonfires on dozens of city street corners.
   The state power company Electro-Peru said saboteurs blew up power
pylons about 10 p.m. Saturday to cause a partial power outage.
   It said power was cut to isolated areas in a coastal region
stetching from Chiclayo, 465 miles north of Lima, to Marcona, 270
miles south of the capital.
   About half of Lima was blacked out, but energy was restored to
most areas by midmorning Sunday, Electro-Peru said.
   Both of Peru's major rebel groups, the Mao-inspired Shining Path
and the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, have launched
dozens of blackouts and then used the cover of darkness to carry out
bombings and other attacks.
   Officials said they did not know which group caused the New
Year's blackout, and there were no reports of any related violence.
   Police say the Shining Path sabotaged power pylons three times in
late November and early December in an escalation of its insurgency,
which has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   The blackouts forced this city of 6 million to ration electric
power and water, which is pumped by electricty, for three weeks
before officials could repair the damaged system.

<HEAD>Jail Inmate Strolls By Checkpoints and Out The Door</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A county jail inmate who noticed his cell was
unlocked followed an off-duty sheriff's deputy and wandered past two
checkpoints to freedom, authorities said.
   ``Somebody wasn't paying as much attention as he was supposed
to,'' said Assistant Chief Deputy Bob Knowles, detentions commander
for the Dallas County Sheriff's Department.
   But Arthur Tabor, 47, was back in jail early Saturday, a few
hours after his disappearance. Police found him at the same address
he had given police when he was arrested the first time, a homeless
shelter.
   He faced the original charges of disorderly conduct and public
intoxication plus a charge of escape and was held in lieu of $1,568
bond.
   Tabor was arrested Friday and placed in a holding cell at the Lew
Sterrett Justice Center before changing into jail clothes,
authorities said. Noticing the cell door was unlatched, Tabor walked
out of the cell.
   Wearing a surgical mask because of tuberculosis, Tabor found a
sheriff's officer and apparently followed the deputy because he was
unsure of what he was supposed to do, officials said.
   ``He got into the elevator with the officer, and the officer, not
realizing the man was a prisoner, walked out of the building with
him,'' Knowles said. ``I don't think he intentionally tried to
escape. The charges were so minor. I don't think there was any
motivation.''
   ``They just opened the door and let him walk. It was like, `Merry
Christmas,''' said Sgt. Lonnie Franks, supervisor of the release
section at the jail.
   Franks said Tabor walked through two checkpoints, staffed by
uniformed jailers who are supposed to demand identification.
   The incident embarrassed jail officials, and Knowles said
deputies feel lucky that no violent prisoner escaped.
   ``At least it wasn't someone who went out and hurt someone,'' he
said.

   New Year's fireworks left thousands homeless in the Philippines
and 49 revelers in Rio drowned en route to a pyrotechnics display.
The superpowers swapped warm salutations, but a one-sided truce
failed to silence the guns in Afghanistan.
   The new year came in as the old one went out, with promises of
peace and bursts of tragedy.
   Children orphaned by an earthquake got new toys, one Korea
offered a tentative olive branch to the other, five Hindus were
massacred as they prayed, and the lights went out in Lima for the
second straight New Year's Eve.
   Thousands poured into streets and squares to celebrate the
arrival of 1989, from Times Square in New York to Orchard Road in
Singapore on the other side of the globe.
   Revelers in Warsaw paid 100,000 zlotys per couple, about $200, to
attend a New Year's Eve ball in the Victoria Hotel, scandalizing
many Poles because it was the equivalent of six weeks' pay for the
average citizen.
   An Italian preservation group found Sunday that the tower of Pisa
leaned a little more during 1988, tilting another .0508 inches
toward the ground.
   The Japanese went by the millions to temples and shrines Sunday
to pray for health and prosperity as the year of the dragon roared
out and the snake slithered in.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 55, stood in for his father, 87-year-old
Emperor Hirohito, at annual New Year ceremonies in the imperial
palace in Tokyo attended by family relatives, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and other leading government officials. The emperor has
been ailing since Sept. 19 with internal bleeding.
   About 150 people boarded a cruise ship in Rio de Janeiro and set
sail for a fireworks display off Copacabana Beach. It capsized, and
authorities said at least 49 people drowned.
   ``It seems there was an excess of passengers ...,'' said Irineu
Barroso, a Rio police official. ``We understand the boat was told to
turn back but ignored the order.''
   Illegal fireworks ignited six fires in Manila, leaving thousands
homeless, authorities said. Hospital officials said seven died from
shootings and stabbings in New Year's celebrations and brawls in
Manila and Cebu.
   A check with doctors at 20 Manila hospitals showed 1,134 people
were injured, mostly by fireworks, during the night.
   ``It's like a war zone here,'' said a doctor. ``Fingers are being
amputated. People are wounded by stray bullets. They are still
coming in ...''
   Fire killed at least one person and destroyed 3,000 makeshift
houses in one slum neighborhood, said arson investigator Cpl. Edmar
Espresion. He said hundreds of homes also were burned in five other
fires.
   At least 733 revelers in Italy were reported injured by
fireworks, none seriously.
   In the West Berlin, about 200 youths began the New Year with a
rampage, hurling bottles, rocks and fireworks at police. Seven were
arrested and one policeman was reported injured. At least two deaths
on New Year's Eve in West Germany were attributed to fireworks
accidents, as were dozens of injuries.
   Four revelers in East Berlin plunged four stories when the
balcony they were on broke off and fell, killing one, the ADN news
agency reported.
   Children injured by the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia received
toys and clothes from around the world, Tass said. The Soviet news
agency said a boy from Spitak was asked what he wanted from Father
Frost, a bearded man who brings gifts on New Year's.
   ``Let him return my mother,'' 8-year-old Armen Kazaryan said from
his hospital bed.
   The new year elicited olive branches from leaders worldwide.
North Korean President Kim Il Sung, in a New Year's speech, invited
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo to a political conference in the
near future.
   President Reagan and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, each sent New Year's messages to their countries and each
other's.
   In a message made available to American television, Gorbachev
said: ``Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union _ and we
are rediscovering America.''
   Reagan said on Soviet television, ``Despite our disagreements, we
have been able to find some common ground.''
   In Moscow, a 42-foot New Year's greeting card signed by 20,000
Americans arrived Sunday. Tass said signers included ex-presidential
candidates Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II celebrated a New Year's Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica before 20,000 worshipers.
   The pontiff called on nations to give special attention to
minorities and for kidnappers to release their hostages.
   ``Let's hope that it is the year of peace, of justice, of growing
solidarity, of social solicitude for each one and for everybody,''
he said.
   In Afghanistan, the Soviets and the Soviet-backed government
promised a cease-fire on New Year's Day. But guerrillas attacked
government troops in two villages Sunday in the eastern Nangarahar
province, and eight guerrillas were killed, Afghanistan's official
Radio Kabul said.
   Residents in rebel-plagued Lima greeted 1989 with a blackout for
the second New Year's Eve in a row. The state power company said
nearly half the city of 6 million people was affected. Leftist
guerrillas were blamed for last year's blackout.
   A bomb blast at a temple in India killed at least five Hindus as
they prayed on Sunday, 1989's first victims of continuing Sikh
militant violence in India's northwestern Punjab state.

<UNK>Probe: Did West German Firms Help Libya Make Chemical Weapons?</UNK>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has begun investigating
U.S. allegations that a West German company helped Libya build a
chemical weapons plant, a Foreign Ministry official said Sunday.
   The Bonn government was informed of the U.S. position through
diplomatic channels, the official said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the review so far has yielded no evidence to support
claims ``that German firms were involved in any illegal
undertakings.''
   ``We have taken this information very seriously and immediately
launched an investigation,'' said the official.
   U.S. officials said last week that a chemical facility at Rabta,
about 50 miles southwest of Tripoli, is on the verge of producing
chemical weapons.
   Libya says the facility is a pharmaceutical plant.
   Companies from West Germany, Japan and Italy are believed to have
helped Libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex.
Japan told the United States its nationals believed they were
involved in the construction of a fertilizer plant.
   At least two West German firms provided Libya with chemicals,
technical assistance and special pumps and piping for the plant,
U.S. News &amp; World Report said in a report released Sunday.
   One of the West German companies was identified as
Imhausen-Chemie, the New York Times said Sunday, quoting U.S.
government officials.
   The company's president denied any connection with the Libyan
plant, the report said.
   ``We produce medical substances and fine chemicals ... but not so
far to Libya,'' the Times quoted Jurgen Hippenstiel-Imhausen as
saying. ``I never went to Libya. I don't even know where it is.''
   The Times quoted American officials as saying Imhausen was at the
center of a covert operation in which materials for the chemical
plant were shipped to Libya through Hong Kong and other Asian ports.
   American officials said they were deliberately misled by a
company called Japanese Steel Works, U.S. News &amp; World Report
reported. Company officials told U.S. senators the firm was only
building a desalinization plant, the report said.
   The magazine, quoting unidentified government sources, said the
State Department has prepared a secret report on the role of West
Germany and Japan in helping Libya, Iran, Iraq and Syria to acquire
chemical-weapons capability.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley on Friday
rejected Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's offer to let the United
States inspect the plant.
   She said a chemical weapons plant ``could easly be modified to
appear as a legitimate industrial chemical plant such as a
pharmaceutical or fertilizer facility.''

<TEXT>
   A preliminary review concluded that a police
sniper acted properly in killing a gunman who held up to eight
people hostage in a beauty salon, but controversy remained over a
mental health board's refusal to commit the man to a hospital in
November.
   Michael Fane, 21, was shot to death by a SWAT team sniper Friday
as police, afraid Fane would set off a fire bomb in the beauty
salon, rescued the last hostage.
   Police Chief Robert Wadman said Saturday that a preliminary
review indicated that officers followed proper procedure when the
police sniper fired the single shot that killed Fane, 21, of Iowa
City, Iowa.
   Fane, who told the hostages he was on a mission for God, was
killed 24 hours after he walked into the salon and took eight people
hostage. None of the hostages, released at intervals throughout the
ordeal, was hurt.
   Douglas County Attorney Ron Staskiewicz said that his office will
decide soon whether to call a grand jury to investigate.
   ``The last thing I want to do is have police officers who have
been involved in a traumatic situation wait a long time,''
Staskiewicz said. ``We want to make a decision. If a grand jury
needs to be called, let's get it over with.''
   Fane's parents said the standoff could have been avoided if the
Sarpy County (Neb.) Mental Health Board had followed the advice of a
psychiatrist and the pleas of his mother to commit him to treatment.
The request for commitment came after an incident at a restaurant at
which Fane began screaming.
   Cathie Fane of El Campo, Texas, said her son had been diagnosed
as having ``drug-induced schizophrenia.''
   But during the Nov. 4 committal hearing, a decision was made
against institutionalization because he posed no public threat, Mrs.
Fane said.
   ``We knew that he was gone a year ago,'' she told the Houston
Chronicle. ``We tried to get help for him. We tried to have him
institutionalized, but lawyers fought to keep him out of the
institution, so our hands were really tied.''
   But board members defended their decision.
   Richard Wycoff, a clinical psychiatrist, said it was a ``close
call'' as to whether Fane should have been committed, but there was
not ``clear and convincing evidence'' that Fane was a danger either
to himself or to others.
   Joseph Batorski, the lay member of the three-member board, also
said it was not proven Fane was dangerous.

<HEAD>Britain Used SAS Commandos in Oman in 1958, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-year-old documents made public New Year's
Day reveal the government sent commandos to Oman to fight rebels
threatening British interests in the Persian Gulf state, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The documents were released by the Public Records Office under
rules permitting publication of selected confidential papers after a
30-year lapse, The Observer said.
   In 1958, rebels were fighting the sultan of Oman and endangering
Britain's plans to use an air base at Masirah and its interest in
oil deposits believed to exist in the kingdom, the weekly newspaper
said.
   But the use of regular British troops to crush a rebellion was
considered certain to attract international criticism and the newly
released Cabinet documents show how concerned then-Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd were to avoid
such an outcome, the Observer said.
   In July of 1958 the sultan accepted 23 British officers for his
army, including a commander and the nucleus of an air force to put
down the rebels, in return for handing over the base for 99 years,
The Observer said.
   The military assault plan was canceled over concerns about
international criticism, but a government panel suggested Britain
instead conduct a special operation by commandos of the clandestine
Special Air Services regiment.
   The plan was approved and the cover story, the newspaper said,
was that the 100-man SAS squadron was training the sultan's army. A
second squadron was sent in December and by January 1959 the SAS had
put the rebels to flight, The Observer said.
   Britain has had close ties with the sultanate _ an absolute
monarchy _ for nearly 200 years.

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company offering quick, cheap tests of
blood cholesterol levels to people while they shop says technology
has outpaced state laws governing medical testing, but the state
says the company's services don't have the proper licenses and has
gone to court.
   The lawsuit filed by the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services against Heart Chek of Sarasota will be a
test case for the fledgling industry, attorneys say.
   Heart Chek has contracts to offer cholesterol readings with
several store chains throughout southwestern Florida, including
Publix, Albertsons and Walgreen.
   The procedure involves taking a few drops of blood from a
fingertip and running the sample through a machine. A reading is
given within minutes for $7.
   The state contends the process of drawing blood and analyzing it
for cholesterol content falls under a 1967 statute regulating
clinical laboratories, said department spokesman Stephen Kindland.
   But Heart Chek, which has been in business since March, believes
the regulations are outdated, said company attorney Steve Herb.
   Herb said the suit was initially filed by HRS against Heart Chek
early this September in Sarasota County Circuit Court.
   But he argued that the 1967 statute cited in the suit was never
intended to apply to screening procedures, just clinical
laboratories. The technology used nationwide for screening
cholesterol was not in existence at the time that statute was
written, Herb said Sunday.
   ``HRS is trying to take an old law and apply it to a situation
that could not possibly have been foreseen in 1967,'' he said.
   The company, which has 20 affiliates across the South and in
California, would like the new industry to be regulated by the
state, but not under the existing clinical laboratory law, national
President John Bell said.
   ``We're fighting the particular law in Florida, not the idea of
being under regulatory control. We recognize the need to keep
unqualified people out of the business,'' Bell said.
   The state told the company it should be licensed by the
Department of Licensure and Certification. But Heart Chek ignored a
cease-and-desist order, leaving a lawsuit as the only option to
settle the question, said state health department attorney Ed Haman.
   ``We've filed for a court injunction to decide whether Heart Chek
does qualify as a clinical lab under the statute. Until that
decision comes through, we have no authority to stop the operation
or regulate it at all,'' Haman said.
   The state defines a clinical laboratory as any business
performing examinations on material from the human body to obtain
information on a medical condition.
   Heart Chek has filed several countersuits against the state for
interference with business, slander and harassment.
   A hearing on the merits of the countersuits is scheduled for Jan.
13, but a final decision on the state's suit is not expected until
at least February, said Haman.
   ``As far as we know, this is the very first legal challenge to
the clinical lab statute,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
is investigating an explosion that killed four Maryland teen-agers
who were apparently experimenting with explosives.
   Ann Evans, spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Police
Department, Sunday said evidence had been recovered from the scene
of the explosion and was taken to the Rockville laboratory of the
BATF. She did not expect results until the end of this week.
   ``There is a strong suggestion that four boys were experimenting
with some type of explosives,'' Evans said Saturday.
   The teen-agers were killed before dawn Saturday as the four
youths apparently were attempting to make a bomb in a garage at the
home of a Brazilian embassy employee, police said.
   Two of the victims were killed instantly by the blast, while the
third person died a short time after being rushed to a local
hospital, Montgomery County Police Sgt. Harry Geehreng said. The
fourth teen-ager died Saturday evening.
   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that three of
the young men were described as close friends and said that the four
were science-oriented students who attended Walt Whitman High School
in Bethesda.
   The newspaper identified the victims as Samir Gafsi, Dov Fischman
and Bruno Perrone, all college freshmen whose ages weren't
available, and Gustavo Machado, 15, the son of a Brazilian attache.
   Geehreng said investigators have ruled out any terrorist
connection.
   ``Over the years we've seen young people experimenting and trying
to learn about explosives,'' Geehreng said. ``Unfortunately, we've
had accidents. But I don't think we've ever had anything this bad.
It's just young people, I can't explain it.''
   Sharmi Banik, described by the Post as Gafsi's girlfriend, said
Gafsi had shown a recent interest in explosives.
   Gafsi and Fischman were killed instantly by the explosion,
authorities said. Machado and Perrone died later after being taken
to Suburban Hospital. Machado died about 8:30 a.m. Saturday, while
Perrone died following eight hours of surgery.
   Geerheng said the explosion damaged a car in the garage but there
was no evidence that a bomb had been placed in or under the vehicle.
   The explosion occurred at about 3:10 a.m. at the Bethesda home of
Vera Machado, said Geehreng. Ms. Machado and her husband, Richard,
were sleeping inside the home and were not injured, he said.
   A security guard who answered the telephone at the Brazilian
embassy in Washington said Ms. Machado was a consular attache. The
guard, who refused to give his name, said he did not know her duties.

<HEAD>Suburbs Spar Over Lakefront Federal Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suburbs that want to stake claim on the lakefront
property of a century-old Army base are jockeying for position in a
potential land grab should the government go through with plans to
close the base.
   Fort Sheridan, which employs about 4,000 people, half of them
civilians, is one of 86 military installations targeted for closure
by a Pentagon-appointed panel. If the panel's recommendations are
accepted, the bases could close between 1991 and 1995.
   Lake Forest, Highwood and Highland Park officials are all looking
at the base's 700 acres of beachfront real estate. Developing the
land could help offset the economic woes that may follow closing the
base.
   ``I do think there is going to be a fight,'' said state Rep.
Grace Mary Stern of Highland Park.
   ``That's prime land along Lake Michigan,'' added U.S. Rep. John
Porter, whose north-suburban district includes the base and
surrounding communities. ``It's not on the tax rolls.''
   Federal law calls for the Army to give other federal agencies
first dibs on the base, a cluster of stone buildings that looks like
a wooded college campus along a stretch of beach. But Porter said he
knows of no federal interest in the land.
   The state is second in line to get the land, but David Fields, a
spokesman for Gov. James Thompson said he was not aware of any state
plans for the land.
   That leaves the three suburbs.
   It has not yet been determined which, if any, of the communities
would have jurisdiction over the land. Highwood tried to annex the
whole base in the 1960s, but the move was struck down in court, a
spokesman for the fort said.
   Lake County planning department documents show that the northern
100 acres have been annexed by Lake Forest, and the southernmost 150
acres have been annexed by Highland Park, leaving the middle 450
acres unclaimed.
   ``All the annexations don't mean a thing,'' said Highwood Mayor
Fidel Ghini. ``You can't legally annex federal land.''
   Ghini said Highwood has plans for the land, but he refused to say
what they are.
   ``Did your football coach ever tell the opposition what he was
going to do?'' he said.
   Daniel Pierce, mayor of Highland Park, said he opposed economic
development of the land.
   ``The first priority should be open space along the lake,''
Pierce said.
   Lake Forest Mayor Marshall Strenger could not be reached for
comment. The telephone at his home went unanswered Sunday.
   Porter plans to meet with officials whose constituents would be
affected by the closing, including the three mayors, state
legislators, and Thompson.
   ``It will be tough to get this thing reversed,'' Porter said.
``So I want to get all the players together at the end of January to
try to get cooperation between state and local officials.

<TEXT>
   The deaths of more than 1,300
people in El Salvador's civil war last year is part of a
``heart-breaking cry that summons us to keep striving for peace,''
Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said Sunday.
   The Roman Catholic archbishop said in his Sunday homily that
1,369 civilians, soldiers or leftist rebels were killed last year in
military clashes, rightist death squad operations and car bombings
or other terrorist acts.
   Rivera Damas customarily uses his homily to speak out against the
war, which has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives since leftist
rebels began battling the U.S.-backed government in 1979.
   The recent bombing of a Luthern church facility shows ``the path
of irrational violence'' El Salavador has taken, he said. Rivera
Damas also expressed concern at the resurgence of death squads.
   ``This situation is a heart-breaking cry that summons us to keep
striving for peace with the weapons the gospel has put in our hands:
the weapons of light, of hope, of reconciliation, all the fruits of
love,'' he said.
   The archbishop also repeated his earlier condemnations of a new
terror campaign by the rebels, whose death threats prompted more
than 20 mayors to resign in December.

<HEAD>Fog and Unexpected Snow for New Year's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New Year's Day brought an unexpected snowstorm to Maryland and
Delaware, surprising even the National Weather Service, which had
anticipated just a combination of sleet and freezing rain.
   Dense fog overnight in portions of California and the central
United States lingered Sunday afternoon in parts of Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.
   Rain and snow fell across the middle Atlantic Coast region Sunday
with heavy snow in some of the higher elevations. And light snow
extended from Upper Michigan to Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   Heavier snow was expected in parts of Maryland, Delaware and West
Virginia. Baltimore had nearly 3 inches by afternoon and Sault Ste
Marie, Mich., and Washington, D.C., each received an inch of snow
during the six hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Dry weather prevailed across most of the rest of the nation with
strong and gusty winds over parts of Southern California.
   Temperatures were still below freezing early Sunday afternoon
from the northern high Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley
to Upper Michigan and northern Lower Michigan. Temperatures hovered
around the freezing mark through the day in much of Maryland, with
the new snow turning to slush in many areas.
   Readings were in the single digits or below zero Sunday afternoon
from eastern Montana through the Dakotas, into Minnesota and across
much of the northern Atlantic Coast region. Temperatures were in the
teens or single digits in northern New England.
   Temperatures were generally above 60 degrees from south central
Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast, with readings in the 70s
across Florida, southern Georgia, South Carolina and into the lower
Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 83 degrees at
Cocoa Beach, Fla.
   The nation's low Sunday morning was 22 degrees below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Monday called for snow from the Great Lakes
region to northern New England. Rainshowers were expected across the
Pacific Northwest, with freezing rain in some of the higher
elevations. Rainshowers were also expected across much of Arizona
and Southern California and from Texas to the Tennessee Valley.
Dense fog was predicted for the Great Basin. It was expected to be
fair across the rest of the nation, with windy conditions along the
eastern slopes of the Rockies in Montana and Wyoming.
   Temperatures were expected to stay below freezing all day from
the northern and central Rockies to northern New England and in the
central Plateau. Highs were expected in the teens or single digits
from eastern North and South Dakota to Upper Michigan and in
northern Maine, in the 50s and 60s from the southern and central
coast of California through much of Texas to the southern and middle
Atlantic Coast. Readings were expected to reach the 70s from south
central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia.

   A cruise ship jammed with New
Year's revelers bound for a fireworks display at Copacabana Beach
capsized and sank after ignoring an order to return to port,
officials said Sunday. At least 51 people died and others were
missing.
   The sightseeing ship was carrying at least 131 people _ 31 over
capacity _ and sank in 65 feet of water in Rio's Guanabara Bay about
11:45 p.m. Saturday, authorities said.
   ``We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it
was because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the
Rio de Janeiro state Fire Department's Maritime Group.
   Authorities said a search for survivors was continuing. Some were
believed trapped in the hull of the vessel, said Col. Jefferson
Cardoso de Bem, chief of the Maritime Group.
   He said he had no accurate number of survivors or the number
missing because several boats in the area took part in rescue
attempts, and survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the city.
   Among the dead was the boat's captain.
   The double-decked ship Bateau Mouche sank between Sugar Loaf
Mountain and a small island as it rounded the bend on the western
side of Guanabara Bay and prepared to enter the Atlantic Ocean.
   The boat, a popular tourist attraction that offers daily cruises
of the bay, was to anchor in the ocean so passengers could view the
midnight fireworks display at Copacabana Beach.
   ``The top deck was so crowded you could hardly move,'' a
Brazilian woman told Brazil's TV Globo. ``The boat was completely
full, including lots of children. Then everything began shaking back
and forth. People were shouting: `It's going to flip over!'''
   Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said:
``The boat was turning and shifting. Then tables started flying,
glass started crashing, and the whole boat just turned over on its
side.''
   Survivors said foreigners were on board. The morgue in Rio called
foreign consulates for possible aid in identifying bodies, but
officials said they had no breakdown.
   The Rio newspaper O Globo said Sunday that an American may have
been on board. A Marine guard who answered the phone at the U.S.
Consulate said he was not authorized to give out any information
about possible U.S. victims.
   The vessel was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to
return to port, but it ignored the order, said Irineu Barroso, chief
of Rio's 10th police precinct.
   Survivors confirmed this account.
   ``This was not an accident,'' Calo, 38, a businessman from Sao
Paulo, said in an interview at the Bateau Mouche's mooring station.
``No effort was made to control the number of passengers who got
on.''
   Calo said that soon after the excursion started, a patrol boat
from Brazil's navy-run Port Authority circled the Bateau Mouche and
appeared to be counting people.
   He said two uniformed men from the boat then boarded the cruise
boat and forced it to return to its dock. ``But then, only about
five minutes later, the Bateau Mouche went out again,'' Calo said.
   Paulo Soares, 28, a brother-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's
captain, Camilo da Costa, 50, said at the mooring station: ``Camilo
didn't want to go out. He said the boat was overloaded, and the sea
was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he
didn't sail.''
   A spokesman for the Sol e Mar restaurant, which organized the
excursion, said at least 131 people were on board, according to an
incomplete reservation list. The spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, refused further comment.
   De Bem said the Bateau Mouche's capacity was about 100.
   The $220-per-ticket dinner cruise was heavily promoted in local
newspapers and at tourist hotels.

   The French released hot air balloons in 98 locations
Sunday to launch the bicentennial of their revered revolution after
preparations hampered by disorganization and modern-day political
strife.
   They also ushered in the New Year by turning on special lights on
the Eiffel Tower to mark its 100th birthday. The lights reading
``100 Ans,'' or 100 years, stand 13 yards high and will be kept on
all year both night and day at the Paris monument.
   The balloon launchings are among the first of many special events
to be held throughout the year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the French Revolution. Festivities are to peak July 14 on the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789, an event
that has come to symbolize the revolution.
   Organizers acknowledged criticism in recent months that they were
far behind schedule in planning the bicentennial events after the
deaths of two Bicentennial Mission chiefs forced quick changes of
leadership.
   Moreover, French pride in the watershed historical event did not
prevent political bickering over how to remember it. At one point,
Paris' conservative mayor Jacques Chirac, who lost to Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand in May elections, complained that the
government wanted to emphasize those historical details that would
serve their cause today.
   Also in Sunday's kickoff ceremonies, a red and yellow helium
balloon took flight at Paris' Tuileries Gardens carrying a man
dressed in a wig and period costume. And 300,000 souvenir envelopes
bearing a commemorative stamp showing three stylized birds went on
sale around the country.

<HEAD>National Study Says Pennsylvania Rain Most Acidic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rain at a monitoring station in central Pennsylvania registered
the highest acid content of 131 sites in 46 states, contributing to
the state's No. 1 ranking in acidic rainfall for 1987, an
environmental group said.
   The information was provided by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a Washington, D.C.-based, non-profit group that has lobbied
for sharp reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain, such as
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
   The council said federal monitoring data revealed the most acid
rain was recorded at the Leading Ridge in Huntingdon County, in
central Pennsylvania.
   Rain there had an average pH of 4.08, which is 33 times more
acidic than unpolluted rain, the council said recently.
   The pH scale measures acidity, with 7 being neutral. The lower
the number, the more acidic the rain. Unpolluted rain is slightly
acidic, with a pH of 5.6.
   Many pollutants are emitted by coal-fired power plants, factories
and cars. The materials are thought to undergo changes in the
atmosphere and fall to Earth as acid rain, snow, sleet, fog and dry
particles.

   A Washington, D.C.-bound United Airlines DC-10
jetliner returned here shortly after takeoff Sunday when a faulty
indicator light said an inboard flap malfunctioned, an airline
spokesman said.
   The pilot of United Flight 52 dumped fuel over the Pacific Ocean
to reduce fire hazard before returning to Los Angeles International
Airport, where the jumbo jet landed safely shortly before 9 a.m.,
said Tommy Aina, Federal Aviation Administration regional duty
officer.
   ``The indicator light was malfunctioning and replaced,'' said
United Airlines spokesman Rob Doughty from Chicago. ``The flap was
fine.''
   Failure of the inboard flap to retract would have increased the
drag on the aircraft and caused it to burn more fuel, so the pilot
decided to return, he said.
   Fire trucks and other emergency equipment were standing by, but
were not needed, Aina said. There were 259 passengers and 10 crew
members on the plane, Doughty said.
   Flight 52 was scheduled to depart Los Angeles at 7:40 a.m., bound
for Washington's Dulles International Airport. The same plane took
off for Washington after a 2{ hour delay, Doughty said.

   The Soviet-backed Afghan government
began a cease-fire New Year's Day, but U.S.-backed Moslem rebels
rejected the truce and attacked government troops in two villages,
Afghan radio said.
   The cease-fire offer was made Friday by Afghan President Najib,
and the Soviet Union announced Saturday that its troops would join
the truce.
   In a televised address to his nation Sunday, Najib complained
that rebels have expanded operations against his government and
repeated his offer of direct talks with them, Tass reported. He also
rejected any future Afghan government that excludes the present
leadership, the official Soviet news agency said.
   The rebels recently opened talks with Soviet representatives.
   Guerrillas attacked government troops Sunday in two villages in
the eastern Nangarahar province, official Radio Kabul reported in a
broadcast monitored in Islamabad.
   The radio said eight guerrillas were killed and seven wounded in
the attack on the military posts in Gushta and Deh Bala. It gave no
casualty figures for government troops, but it said soldiers
launched mopping up operations against the rebels after the attack.
   Rebel leader Ahmad Shah said the cease-fire was ``a condemnable
suggestion.''
   The seven-party Guerrilla Alliance named Shah head of the
Provisional Islamic Governmnent, which has yet to be installed.
   ``It only shows how desperate Najib is,'' Shah said in a
statement issued in Peshawar. ``Najib has repeatedly proposed such
meaningless cease-fires, but every time we rejected them.''
   Rebel spokesman Masood Khalili said of Najib's offer: ``We did
not start our fight because he asked us to. And we won't stop
because he asked us to.''
   Khalili belongs to the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group.
   An estimated 100,000 Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan in
1979 to help the Marxist government fight Moslem rebels.
   Half of the Soviet troops left last year under the terms of a
U.N.-brokered accord signed in Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the
United States and the Soviet Union. The rest of the Red Army troops
are to withdraw by Feb. 15.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, which also are supported by Pakistan,
have demanded that a broad-based government be established in Kabul
to take over the administration when the Soviets leave.

<HEAD>Florida Baby Doing Well After Experimental Transplants, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 14-month-old Florida boy who received a
liver and small intestine in an experimental transplant was doing
well Sunday and may be moved out of intensive care soon, doctors
said.
   Calvin Oliveira remained in critical but stable condition Sunday
afternoon at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. He
underwent the double transplant Saturday.
   ``I'm very happy to announce that baby Calvin is doing very well
this morning,'' said Dr. Munci Kalayoglu, chief surgeon and director
of liver transplants.
   ``As a surgeon, I'm very happy with the operation,'' Kalayoglu
said, adding that the infant could be transferred out of the
intensive care unit Monday.
   Calvin suffered from Short Bowel Syndrome, a rare disorder which
left only 5 percent of his small intestine functional. The child's
liver deteriorated as a result of the intravenous feeding the
condition required.
   Doctors said the child was near death when the two organs from a
Rochester, N.Y., baby became available Friday. Calvin was flown from
Deerfield Beach, Fla., to Madison for the eight-hour operation.
   Despite the initial success of the operation, Calvin was not out
danger, Kalayoglu said.
   The next three months will be critical in determining whether his
body will reject the new liver and small intestine, the doctor said.

destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.
   ``I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever
valid,'' she said in a wide-ranging New Year's television interview.
   ``The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation
of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought
to justice,'' she said on the ``David Frost on Sunday'' program on
the commercial TV-am channel.
   The danger of revenge, she said, is that ``it can affect innocent
people.''
   President Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that
the United States would punish those responsible for the bomb, which
brought the Boeing 747 down in southern Scotland, killing all 259
people on board and leaving 11 on the ground missing and presumed
dead.
   He said a report overseen by President-elect George Bush
advocating possible military action against terrorists ``ought to be
giving some people sleepless nights'' in the wake of the Dec. 21
bombing. He did not elaborate.
   Bush vowed last week to ``seek hard and punish firmly,
decisively, those who did this, if you could ever find them.''
   FBI Director William Sessions said Sunday the investigation of
the crash could be lengthy and welcomed any help that PLO chief
Yasser Arafat might be able to provide.
   Arafat ``has a great deal of information, a wealth of information
he can give us,'' Sessions said on U.S. network television.
   The idea of such cooperation arises in the wake of newly opened
talks between the U.S. and Palestine Liberation Organization
officials that began after Arafat disavowed terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   Last week the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyasseh quoted an
unidentified PLO official as saying the organization was considering
a request by U.S. officials that the PLO help in tracking down those
responsible for the bombing.
   Sessions, whose agency is helping in the crash investigation,
said he is optimistic of eventually finding out who planted the
bomb. He added that he has no evidence to confirm the bomb was the
work of terrorists rather than someone acting against someone on
board.
   Mrs. Thatcher allowed Reagan to use U.S. bombers based in Britain
to bomb Libya in 1986 in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement
in international terrorism.
   She said Sunday that no country should grant the Pan Am bombers
safe haven or permit them to escape justice.
   ``I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not
try to track down terrorists, absolutely disgusted.''
   U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of
responsibility for the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused
mostly on Palestinian extremists and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   Searchers in Lockerbie, Scotland, gave up their traditional New
Year's celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and
wreckage.
   Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing
local residents, was recovered, bringing the total to 242.
   Only 35 have been identified and released to relatives for
burial. Capt. Bruce Smith, a Pan Am pilot whose English wife,
Ingrid, was killed, was quoted in The Sunday Telegraph as saying the
Scottish police were ``paralyzed by inexperience and incompetence.''
   John Boyd, chief constable of the Dumfries and Galloway police,
replied at a news conference, ``I am sure no one would thank me for
shortcutting any legal or evidential gathering processes which may
... help to bring the person or persons (responsible) to justice.''
   More than 700 people are expected at a memorial service Wednesday
in Lockerbie, and 1,000 more will watch on monitor screens in nearby
halls.
   British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe
the bomb was smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by a
Lebanese-born passenger duped into carrying it. The West German
government said no evidence supports those reports.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 jet and
switched to a Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip
to New York.
   The Sunday Times of London said the bomb was loaded into the
airplane's forward cargo hold next to the electronic nerve center
which keeps the jet airborne.
   News reports in Britain and the United States said the bomb may
have been unwittingly brought on board the flight by Khalid Jaafar,
a 21-year-old Lebanese student. Khalid, who was living in Frankfurt,
was en route to Dearborn, Mich., to visit his father when he died in
the crash.
   His father, Nazir Jaafar, said the FBI questioned him about the
reports Friday and told him ``they have no evidence against my son.''

   Rocket and artillery clashes between rival
Shiite Moslem militias in Beirut's southern slums shattered a
short-lived cease-fire Sunday, killing seven people and wounding
eight, police said.
   The wounded included two Syrian soldiers who belonged to a
peacekeeping contingent that managed to arrange the cease-fire
before midday, a police spokesman said.
   It was not clear whether the other casualties were combatants or
civilians, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   The fighting erupted between gunmen of the Syrian-backed Amal
(``Hope'') militia against the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God. The two factions are locked in a prolonged struggle for
dominance of Lebanon's 1-million-strong Shiite sect.
   Sunday's clashes came after several days of skirmishing between
the two militias. The last serious oubreak of fighting took place in
November when 40 people were killed and 87 wounded in
Moslem-controlled west Beirut and the slums.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon as
well as west and south Beirut under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Year's Eve fire at a juvenile
detention center, apparently started during a jailbreak, left 11
teen-age immates dead and five injured, police reported.
   Police Maj. Patricio Araya said on the scene that 18 of the
detention center's 100 inmates escaped. Authorities said inmates
battled with officers who tried to put out the fire.
   ``The exact causes for the fire are being investigated,'' Araya
said. ``But it clearly seems it started when the inmates attempted a
escape.''
   Authorities at the detention center in the capital also said the
fire, which broke out five minutes before midnight Saturday, was
``apparently'' started by the inmates themselves as part of an
escape plan.
   Nine of the victims died in a bathroom where they sought refuge,
and 2 others died at the center's dormitory, Maj. Araya said.
   The fire ``started at the dormitory, at two or three beds.
Apparently, it was intentionally caused to trigger a mutiny and
escape,'' said a communique issued by the government agency running
the detention center.
   ``When officers tried to put the fire down, they were attacked by
the immates, some of them carrying pieces of glass from windows they
broke,'' the communique added. It said the fire spread quickly
through the old single-story building.
   Monday morning relatives of the inmates gathered in front of the
destroyed center awaiting to hear from their relatives. Many women
cried as officials explained them that the victims were still being
identified.
   Justice Minister Hugo Rosende, visiting the detention center
Sunday morning, said the inmates in the center were aged 16 to 18.
He said because of the lack of money, authorities were forced to
lodge ``highly dangerous criminals and petty criminals in the same
place.''

<HEAD>Hundreds of Seabirds Await Cleaning After One of Washington's Worst
Spills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SHORES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More oil-covered sea birds were found
over the weekend in what revised Coast Guard estimates show was one
of the worst oil spills in Washington history.
   Some 2,000 sea birds have died since Dec. 23, when a damaged
barge lost as much as 231,000 gallons of oil off Grays Harbor, state
Department of Wildlife spokesman Ron Holcomb said Sunday.
   The dead birds include about 1,650 found on ocean beaches from
Oregon and Washington, about 350 birds that were euthanized because
of their poor condition, and some others that died at a bird
cleaning center, Holcomb said.
   Volunteers working daily since the spill have cleaned about 420
birds and released a dozen, Holcomb said.
   Oil globs washed ashore as far as the northern tip of the Olympic
Peninsula, including national wildlife refuges stretching for about
75 miles in Washington.
   Cleanup crews Sunday focused mainly at La Push, about 70 miles
north of where the spill occurred.
   More than 2,000 live birds have been received at a cleanup center
at the Ocean Shores Convention Center, and hundreds of them still
needed cleaning, Holcomb said.
   The Coast Guard on Saturday revised its estimate of the spill and
put the amount at 168,000 to 231,000 gallons, said Mark Stewart of
the state Division of Emergency Management.
   Washington state's previous largest oil spill occurred on Dec.
21, 1985, when the ARCO Anchorage ran aground in Port Angeles harbor
and spilled about 239,000 gallons of crude. The oil polluted the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, which separates the northern Olympia
Peninsula from Canada's Vancouver Island and leads from the Pacific
Ocean to Puget Sound.

   President Joaquim Chissano has

   The year-old amnesty was to expire at the end of 1988, but
Chissano said the program will continue for another year ``to save
lives and promote the harmony of the nation,'' the news agency AIM
said.
   Under the amnesty, a full pardon is granted to rebels of the
Mozambique National Resistance if they give up to authorities. The
leftist government says about 3,000 rebels have been given amnesty.
   The rebels have waged a destructive hit-and-run insurgency since
1977.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union soon will ban the export of
consumer goods ranging from caviar to children's shoes and will
limit travelers to $160 worth of souvenirs, the official news agency
Tass said Sunday.
   The radical changes in export and customs regulations evidently
are aimed at remedying an extreme shortage of consumer goods in the
Soviet Union and assuaging citizens angry over the scarcity of such
basic items as soap and windshield wipers.
   Tass said the restrictions approved by the Council of Ministers
will take effect Feb. 1 and last until the end of 1990. It did not
give a date for the decision.
   The brief announcement limiting exports of consumer goods to 100
rubles, or $160 under the government-decreed exchange rate, per
person specifically included tourists. But it did not explain the
effect of the ruling on the Soviet Union's attempts to earn scarce
hard currency by selling the best caviar, fur hats and coats, vodka
and souvenirs in stores that require dollars, pounds or other freely
convertible money.
   Tass said it will be forbidden to export televisions,
refrigerators, freezers, washing and sewing machines, children's
clothing and shoes, coffee and caviar.
   Coffee is not grown in the Soviet Union, and the import duty is
up to $15 a pound.
   The announcement also said customs duties will climb to 20 to 100
percent of the retail price on vacuum cleaners, mixers,
coffee-grinders, irons, radios, cameras, automobile parts and other
items. It was not clear if this meant import or export duties.
   Export limits were imposed recently in Czechoslovakia and several
other East European countries after complaints that tourists from
neighboring socialist nations were stripping their stores bare of
consumer goods.
   The growing practice prompted a Soviet economist, Marina
Pavlova-Silvanskaya, to warn in Soviet Culture on Sunday of an
impending ``trade war'' among socialist countries.
   Many Russians travel to Eastern Europe on shopping trips, and Ms.
Pavlova-Silvanskaya herself reminisced about trips to East Germany
and Poland. She said her boss insisted that ``the program had to
include a visit to some institution named for Lenin, lest the
Germans or Poles think the citizens of the nation of the Great
October Revolution are coming to shop.''
   None of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe has fully
convertible currencies, and they trade with each other based on
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting country's cost
of production, much less a profit.
   Ms. Pavlova-Silvanskaya noted that capitalist countries don't
find an invasion of shoppers a problem _ in fact, just the reverse.
On Nov. 7, a holiday in Hungary, 100,000 Hungarians went to Austria
and spent $42 million in hard currency, she wrote.
   Rather than limit exports, the Austrians responded to the horde
of shoppers with advertisements in Hungarian newspapers, inviting
them back on their next day off, Ms. Pavlova-Silvanskaya noted.

   Finance Minister Shimon Peres on Sunday unveiled
an economic recovery plan aimed at reducing inflation by cutting
wages and spending for defense, health and welfare.
   Peres said at a news conference he plans to stimulate growth in
the economy by pumping money into flagging industries and
liberalizing investment regulations.
   The proposed budget cut is 1 billion shekels, or about $600
million, Peres said. The government adopted a $31 billion budget for
1988.
   About a quarter of the cuts will come out of defense spending,
putting at risk the jobs of up to 4,000 defense industry employees,
Israeli news reports said.
   Peres said his long-range aim is to reduce unemployment, which he
said hit 7 percent because of a lack of economic growth in the past
year.
   The plan was the most sweeping economic program introduced since
a July 1985 program curbed annual inflation of 440 percent down to a
current level of about 20 percent a year.
   Peres said he wants to reduce inflation to a single-digit figure
by year's end.
   ``We must reach a European level of inflation to survive,'' he
said, but did not give a specific target figure.
   ``Stability is endangered and we are liable to sink into a deep
recession with continuing inflation. ... Our economy needs these
measures like a breath of fresh air.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he supports the new program.
   ``I hope it will be accepted and implemented,'' Shamir said on
Israel radio, adding that he hoped ``the budget cuts would not hurt
too much.''
   The government's figures for last year reflect zero growth in
production and gross national product and a drop in exports and
tourism, major sources of foreign currency. Many of the nation's
farms are debt-ridden and many factories are failing.
   Israeli officials have blamed the nearly 13-month Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands for some of the economic
difficulties, including the decline in tourism.
   Israel radio quoted Peres as saying that the uprising led to a 2
percent drop in Israel's gross national product, a decrease of about
$600 million in exports to the occupied lands, and a 30-percent drop
in tourism.
   Peres, the former foreign minister, proposed curbing inflation by
cutting government spending on the army, schools, and hospitals and
by halting the longstanding practice of giving automatic
cost-of-living increases to salaried workers.
   Yisrael Kessar, leader of the nationwide Histadrut Labor Union
Federation, criticized the proposals.
   ``It is inconceivable to force workers ... to bear the entire
burden of this plan,'' Kessar said on army radio.
   The Cabinet heard a report about the plan at its weekly session
but made no decisions about budget cuts. While the Cabinet was
meeting, however, Peres implemented other decisions related to the
plan.
   Subsidies for food staples such as milk, bread and frozen chicken
were slashed, raising their prices by up to 26 percent.
   The Bank of Israel devalued the shekel by 8 percent against the
U.S. dollar after a 5 percent devaluation last week.
   The devaluation was aimed at helping export industries, which
have been operating at a loss because the exchange rate was frozen.
   Peres outlined other proposals to help electronics, textiles and
other industries. They include liberalizing regulations to encourage
investment from abroad, setting aside more funds for troubled
factories that come up with viable recovery plans, and lowering
interest rates on loans.

   Workers plucked pieces of boats
from the water Sunday at a harbor where at least 50 yachts were
destroyed in an explosion that set off a chain-reaction fire.
   The Saturday night explosion was aboard a pleasure boat moored at
the Watergate Yachting Center. The blaze spread to dozens of boats
and was brought under control about two hours later.
   Watergate Harbor Master Tony Buchanon said bystanders first tried
to push the boat away from the pier but the wind brought it back.
   Between 50 and 60 crafts were destroyed, said Buchanon and Chief
Frank Janoch of the Kemah Fire Department. Buchanon estimated damage
at between $2 million and $4 million.
   One firefighter was slightly hurt.
   On Sunday, workers skimmed oil and gas off the water and picked
up pieces of boats. Arson investigators also were looking into the
cause of the blaze.
   ``As far as the cause of the fire, we'll probably never know,''
Janoch said. ``It was such as intense fire, and the one that started
it all is on the bottom.''

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat raised the
Palestinian flag on the Embassy of Palestine on Sunday, the 24th
anniversary of Arafat's Fatah guerrilla group and the group's first
attack on Israel.
   ``Long live the Palestinian revolution. Long live Palestine. Long
Live Arafat!'' chanted a crowd of some 500 Palestinians as Arafat
kissed the green, white, red and black flag, then hoisted it atop
the $5-million sandstone building donated by the kingdom.
   ``We are your soldiers, Abu Ammar!'' they shouted, using Arafat's
nom-de-guerre.
   Several ambassadors, mainly Asian and Arab, attended the
inauguration of the Palestinian embassy. No American diplomat was
present.
   The official Saudi Press Agency later quoted Arafat as saying the
embassy was a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to the ``children
of stones, the nation of stones, the revolution of stones, the
intefadeh of stones.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader was referring to the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip known in Arabic as the intefadeh, where Palestinian protestors
use stones for weapons in clashes with Israeli soldiers. At least
345 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have been killed since the violence
began Dec. 8, 1987.
   Prince Salman Bin Abdel-Aziz, governor of Riyadh, said he was
praying for the chance ``to raise the flag of Saudi Arabia in a
liberated, independent Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine,'' the
agency said.
   Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday that it was granting the PLO
office in Riyadh full diplomatic status and its director, Rafik
Natsheh, will rank as an ambassador.
   The kingdom was one of the first countries to recognize the state
of Palestine, proclaimed Nov. 15 by the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile. Algeria and Iraq have also granted
PLO offices embassy status.
   Ninety countries have so far recognized the new Palestinian
state, which has no territory and, as yet, no government.
   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal attended the
ceremony Sunday. Arafat arrived at the embassy in a Mercedes
limousine flying the Palestinian flag, accompanied by Prince Salman.
   Sunday also marked 24 years since Arafat formed Fatah, the main
guerrilla group belonging to the PLO, which serves as an umbrella
organization for several groups. The day also marks Fatah's first
attack on Israel.
   Arafat himself participated in a Dec. 28, 1965, guerrilla attack
on an Israeli water installation in northern Israel. There were no
casualties in that attack.
   On the eve of what is known as ``Fatah Day,'' Arafat, 59,
addressed Palestinians Saturday through the Baghdad-based ``Voice of
the Palestinian Revolution.''
   ``We were able to impose our will on the United States to
recognize the Palestinian reality,'' Arafat said of the newly
initiated PLO-U.S. dialogue.
   Washington lifted the 13-year ban on dealings with the PLO after
Arafat explicitly recognized the state of Israel and renounced
terrorism Dec. 15 in Geneva.
   ``We are looking for the results of this dialogue in the region
shortly,'' Arafat said in his address.
   Arafat said: ``The Israeli enemy has tried but failed over the
years of occupation to create alternatives which he can manipulate
as he wants to implement his criminal policies. But all his efforts
... have been broken on the rock of the steadfastness of our people.
   He hailed the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and said
it shall continue until the end of Israeli occupation.
   ``Now the hour of victory is tolling.''

   New Year's revelers' gunfire struck police
cars, knocked out electricity and left one man dead, while another
man was killed by police for allegedly firing at an unmarked patrol
car, officials said Sunday.
   Celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July has
plagued the city in recent years, prompting lawmakers to enact a new
law making such random shooting a felony.
   But police said most of the shootings at patrol cars on Saturday
and early Sunday were intentional.
   ``Three were definitely directed at the cars, one was possibly
just a bullet fallen from the sky,'' said police Lt. Dave Hepburn.
   The body of a man killed by a gunshot wound to his head was found
near a housing project about 2 a.m., the likely victim of random
gunfire, said Hepburn. The man's identity was not immediately known.
   Officer Scott Krowber was grazed in the head by a bullet fired
through the rear window of his unmarked patrol car outside the same
housing project, where hundreds of bullet casings were found Sunday,
said police Lt. William Hall.
   Two officers in a patrol car following Krowber's fired at the
gunman, Hall said. The victim was identified as Salomon Moreno, 29.
   Krowber was treated and released at St. Francis Medial Center for
his head wound, said a nursing supervisor.
   Earlier, a police sergeant cruising through a southside
neighborhood in a patrol car was fired upon about 9 p.m. Two slugs
pierced the vehicle and passed through the other side, Hepburn said.
   About two hours later, another sergeant traveling alone in a
patrol car through a neighborhood was fired upon, Hepburn said.
   Five slugs hit the car but the sergeant was able to speed away
and avoid injury.
   A 2-square-mile area in the Firestone district, about five miles
south of downtown, lost electrical power about 11:30 p.m. because of
New Year's gunfire, county Sheriff's Deputy Bob Nimtz said.
   ``Deputies believe holiday revelers firing bullets into the air
caused the outage by striking the glass insulators holding the wires
onto the poles,'' Nimtz said.
   Power was cut to about 8,700 Southern California Edison customers
and about 500 remained without electricity Sunday, said utility
spokesman Steve Hansen.

   At least two people were killed Sunday
when a single-engine airplane crashed into snowbound, mountainous
terrain, authorities said.
   The Piper crashed about 10 a.m. near Mount San Antonio in the San
Gabriel Mountains about 40 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles,
said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Peterson.
   A man was found dead and two women were taken by helicopter from
the wreckage, but one of the women later died, officials said. The
surviving woman was listed in critical condition at Huntington
Memorial Hospital, said nursing supervisor Marlene Wade.
   Heavy snow and bad weather was slowing the search for other
people who might have been on board, said sheriff's Deputy Bob Nimtz.
   ``The snow is so deep and the wreckage is scattered over such a
wide area,'' Nimtz said, adding that high winds combined with the
cold to hamper the investigation.
   No further details were available.

<TEXT>
   The tower of Pisa leaned more in 1988 than the
previous year but is expected to stand for more than another
century, an expert who measured the incline said Sunday.
   Giuseppe Toniolo, head of a group charged with the preservation
of the monument, said that during the past year the medieval tower
shifted 0.0508 inches.
   The 180-foot tower leaned 0.028 inches in 1987.
   Toniolo said the tower has leaned an average of 0.0508 inches
over the past 60 years.
   ``Some years it's a little less, some years a little more,'' he
said. ``There is no important variation this year. The only time we
would be worried would be if the tilt was more than 2 millimeters
(0.08 inches).''
   Toniolo said if the tower continues to lean at the current rate
it would topple over in 100 to 150 years.
   Begun in 1173, the tower was only 34 feet high when the soil
underneath it began to give way, causing it to tilt. It was
completed between 1360 and 1370.

   A bomb blast at a Hindu temple killed at
least five Hindus on Sunday, the year's first victims of continuing
Sikh militant violence in India's troubled northwestern Punjab state.
   At least 20 others were injured in the explosion that occurred
when Hindus were praying at the shrine in Chawinda Devi town, 20
miles east of Amritsar, police and news reports said.
   Police blamed the militant Sikh group Babbar Khalsa, one of about
a dozen militant underground groups operating in the state, for the
blast.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, at least four others were killed Sunday in
Sikh militant violence, Press Trust of India news agency said.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population but are in a
majority in Punjab state. Sikh militants, claiming they are
discriminated against by the country's Hindus who make up more than
80 percent of the population, have waged a bloody campaign of
secession since 1982 for an independent Sikh state.
   At least 2,440 people were killed in militant violence in 1988.
Many of those killed were moderate Sikhs opposed to violence.

<HEAD>Cardinal Attacks Human Rights Conditions During New Year Celebration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Managua condemned the
human rights situation in Nicaragua Sunday during his New Year's Day
mass, saying it has caused an exodus of professionals, workers and
peasants.
   ``Will our Nicaraguan brothers continue to abandon the country in
search of better horizons because here life is impossible?''
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo asked in his homily to thousands
gathered in front of the ruins of the metropolitan cathedral.
   The cathedral, like much of Managua, was destroyed in an
earthquake shortly before the leftist Sandinistas took power in 1979
and has not been rebuilt.
   ``Will people continue to die in strange circumstances? Will
kidnappings and manipulation of the pain of Nicaragua's mothers
continue?'' he asked.
   The comment appeared to be a reference to charges published
periodically in the opposition newspaper La Prensa that the leftist
Sandinista government has committed human rights violations.
   ``No,'' Obando y Bravo exclaimed to loud applause. ``This year
cannot be a copy of the one before because we are determined to make
it something new.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Obando y Bravo also attacked the government for limiting press
freedom, saying there is no freedom of thought without freedom of
the press.
   The government has shut down La Prensa several times and
suspended broadcasts of several radio stations.
   The New Year's mass, part of a ``day of peace'' declared by Pope
John Paul II and also a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the
Managua archdiocese, was broadcast on the Roman Catholic radio
station Radio Catolica.
   Church spokesman Monsignor Bosco Vivas said other stations
refused to carry the service. He did not say why, but other sources
said they were acting under government orders.
   Obando y Bravo is a frequent and outspoken critic of the leftist
government. He also heads a national commission that will oversee
any peace accord reached by the government and the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels.
   A cease-fire has been in place since March, but talks on a
permanent end to the 8-year-old civil war broke down in September.

   An earthen dike gave way early Sunday,
sending a 12-foot wall of water down the Virgin River that forced
the overnight evacuation of 1,500 people, flooded homes and forced
authorities to close Interstate 15.
   No injuries were reported.
   ``If you had had a surfboard, you could have just rode the wave.
It was that forceful,'' said Mike Brunn, a member of the Washington
County Search and Rescue Team.
   St. George City Manager Gary Esplin said that by noon,
electrical, water and other utilities had been restored to areas
that were flooded. Evacuees were being allowed to return to their
homes as the floodwaters receded.
   Washington County officials said 50 to 60 homes and 100
apartments were flooded. Numerous abandoned cars, trucks and
trailers in low-lying areas also were covered.
   Interstate 15 _ the main route between Salt Lake City and Los
Angeles _ was closed south of St. George where the freeway enters
the narrow Virgin River Gorge. Officials reopened the freeway about
14 hours later.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter, who flew to the area 300 miles south of Salt
Lake City, declared the region a disaster area, which will help
facilitate federal aid for the southwestern Utah communities.
   ``Will we rebuild? The answer is `yes' to that, an unequivocal
yes,'' the governor said.
   The failed dike, which helped contain the Quail Creek Reservoir,
was built in 1983 at a cost of $3 million.
   Bangerter said state engineers would try to determine the cause
of the 300-foot-wide breach in the dike, located 14 miles east of
this town of about 12,000.
   The 2,500-foot-long earthen dike that broke is a section of the
Quail Creek Dam. When the 50-foot-high dike gave way, it left
low-lying areas awash.
   In all, 25,000 acre feet of water rushed through the dike breach,
but the flow had been reduced to a trickle by midday, said Ronald
Thompson, chairman of the Washington County Water Conservancy
District.
   Thompson estimated it would take at least six months to design
and rebuild the dike.
   State engineers were inspecting bridges and other highway
structures in the flood path.
   Thompson said the dike had a history of seepage dating to when
the reservoir was filled in 1985, but previous leakage had been
repaired with little difficulty.
   He said new seepage was discovered about 10 a.m. Saturday, and
that by 8 p.m. what had been a small water loss had expanded to a
major leak. Heavy equipment was dispatched to reinforce the dike,
but by 10:30 p.m. it became apparent nothing could be done to stop
the dike from failing and the machinery was pulled out.
   Authorities said 100 units of an apartment complex sustained
water and mud damage. At the flooding's height, water was reported
window high.
   Overnight, local Mormon Church authorities opened their chapels
to evacuated families and Red Cross officials appealed to community
residents to open their homes to the displaced.
   There were no reports of injuries, even though there was
confusion when civil defense sirens blew shortly after midnight.
   Some residents thought it was a new year's celebration, not an
evacuation warning, officials said. Others, attending New Year's
parties, were away from their homes when the evacuation was ordered,
said St. George Mayor Carl Brooks.

<HEAD>Beleaguered Prime Minister Blasts Demonstrators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's prime minister promised political
change Sunday but charged that demonstrators who rioted against
price increases were ``struck by madness'' and seeking illegal
political gains.
   At least four people died, apparently all in one Khartoum
shooting incident, during four days of street violence last week
that led to a general strike.
   After the strike began Thursday, the government backed down,
rescinding steep price increases and making salary hikes for
millions of Sudanese retroactive to July 1.
   The demonstrators then changed their focus mainly into a protest
of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's failure to endorse a draft peace
accord signed Nov. 16. The protests finally ended Saturday.
   Trade unions and political parties also remain unsatisfied with
the government's stand. They scheduled a meeting with Mahdi on
Monday to discuss further economic reforms and peace.
   In a nationally broadcast speech marking Sudan's 33rd anniversary
of independence from Britain and Egypt, Mahdi named no names in his
bitter attack on demonstration organizers.
   ``Some people want to make use of legal differences, some who
have been struck by madness,'' Mahdi said at a rally in el-Obeid,
200 miles southwest of Khartoum. ``For them to try and develop these
differences into an uprising is harmful and wrong.
   Mahdi promised political changes but didn't specify whether he
meant economic reforms or stepping up efforts to end the war.
   ``Our next steps in the government are holding wide consultations
and serious, responsible studies to review our performance,'' he
said in the speech broadcast over the official Omdurman Radio.
   The Democratic Unionist Party, which negotiated the peace treaty
with southern rebels, has quit the governing coalition. Party
leaders said they wanted to express sympathy with the strikers and
to dramatize their outrage at Mahdis' handling of the proposed
agreement to end Sudan's 5{-year-old civil war.
   The Democratic Unionists dominate the 2-million-member Sudanese
Workers' Trade Union Federation, which brought the people into the
streets and called the general strike.
   It acted after the government increased prices of essential
commodities by up to 600 percent and imposed a 15-percent
across-the-board sales tax.
   Government sources said the premier is expected to announce a new
coalition Tuesday with the fundamentalist National Islamic Front
replacing the centrist Democratic Unionists as junior partner to
Mahdi's Umma Party.
   In a radio message from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on
Saturday, renegade army Col. John Garang, the rebel leader,
described the outlook for peace in the New Year as bleak but said it
could have been promising. Garang blamed Mahdi's ignoring the
tentative peace plan for the impasse in the peace process.
   Rebel leader Garang took up arms in 1983 to fight the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum for economic, social and
political changes in the mainly Christian and animist south.

   Author Daniel Curley, an award-winning
novelist whose works include ``Mummy'' and ``How Many Angels,'' was
killed in a traffic accident while on vacation in Florida,
authorities said.
   Curley, 70, and his wife, Audrey, 56, were hit by a car Friday
night as they crossed a street, said Tallahassee Police Lt. Duane
West. Mrs. Curley suffered two broken legs and remained hospitalized.
   Curley, a University of Illinois professor, won both the
Guggenheim and Flannery O'Connor prizes.
   ``He was very important both for what he wrote himself and what
he helped others to write,'' said his friend, Roger Ebert, film
critic for the Chicago Sun-Times.
   ``How Many Angels?'' was Curley's first novel, and was published
in 1958. His most recent, ``Mummy,'' won critical acclaim last year
for its use of ``magic realism'' techniques, a departure from his
usual realistic style.
   Another novel was ``A Stone Man, Yes,'' which won two national
awards. And he published several story collections, including ``That
Marriage Bed of Procrustes,'' ``In the Hands of Our Enemies,''
``Love in the Winter'' and ``Living with Snakes.''
   ``Hilarion'' was a children's book he wrote.
   Curley also encouraged young writers as editor of the literary
magazine ``Ascent.'' Originally named ``Accent,'' the magazine was
the first to publish several major writers, Flannery O'Connor among
them, and continued to be a major literary voice of the 1980s.
   Curley was planning to retire at the end of this school year. A
retirement celebration had been planned in April in Urbana, in which
former students would come together to perform readings from his
works. The function could still go on as a memorial, said Marcia
Kirkpatrick, one of his friends.
   Curley is survived by his wife, four daughters and a stepdaughter.
   He was to be cremated and his ashes interred, but no date was set.

   Authorities were searching Sunday for two
men who opened fire on a sheriff's deputy during a routine traffic
stop on Interstate 40.
   Navajo County Sheriff's Deputy Bob Varner, 51, was listed in
critical condition at Barrow Neurological Center in Phoenix
following Saturday night's attack.
   Varner was shot three times, once in the head and once in each
forearm, with one of the latter bullets also hitting his chest, said
sheriff's Lt. Terry Deboer.
   Varner apparently stopped the men about 7:30 p.m. Saturday, but
``we don't know the circumstances of why he stopped that car,'' said
Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt.
   Investigators believed the two men got out of their car and
started shooting before Varner was able to get out of his vehicle,
Schmidt said.
   The men fled after the shooting and were believed to have shot at
a second police car later Saturday night. No one was injured in the
second shooting.
   The men were wearing camouflage jackets and possibly military
boots, and were armed with rapid-fire automatic weapons, Schmidt
said.
   Their car, containing several automatic weapons, was found
abandoned on the interstate.
   More than 100 law officers and three helicopters were involved in
the search.

   Israel on Sunday deported to Lebanon 13
Palestinians suspected of leading the year-old uprising, culminating
a bloody weekend in which six Palestinians died in clashes with
Israeli troops.
   In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians set off firecrackers and
held parades, dancing and waving pictures of PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat to mark the 24th anniversary of Arafat's Fatah guerrilla
group and its first attack on Israel.
   At least nine Arabs were shot and wounded in the occupied lands,
including a 17-year-old critically wounded by a bullet in the head,
Arab and military reports said. The army confirmed five casualties
and said it was checking further.
   A military helicopter flew the deportees over Israel's northern
border and dropped them in Lebanon, military sources said. They were
each given about $50 in cash, the sources said.
   However, a police spokesman in Rashaya, Lebanon, said the
deportees reported they refused the money.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the 13 were
dropped off at the border village of Metulla and traveled by car to
the Bekaa Valley in the east, where they joined a base run by the
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Two other Palestinians agreed to leave voluntarily in a deal with
authorities. The army said the two would be allowed to return to
their homes in occupied territory if they refrain from anti-Israeli
activity during a five-year period of exile.
   Seven of the Palestinians deported Sunday were from the occupied
West Bank, and six were from the occupied Gaza Strip, a military
spokesman said.
   The expulsions brought the number of Palestinians deported since
the uprising began a year ago to 49. Twelve more suspected
resistance leaders have received deportation orders, a military
spokesman said.
   At least 345 Arabs and 14 Israelis have been killed since the
anti-Israel revolt began Dec. 8, 1987.
   December had the highest casualty toll of any month of the
revolt, said the Jerusalem Post daily. Thirty-one Arabs were killed
and hundreds were wounded.
   Three Palestinians died of gunshots in the West Bank on Saturday.
On Friday, troops raiding a Gaza Strip hideout killed two
Palestinians as they tried to flee; a third Gaza resident was killed
when soldiers fired at stone-throwing worshipers after noon prayers.
   The army on Sunday confined all 650,000 Palestinian residents of
the Gaza Strip to their homes and strengthened patrols in an attempt
to quell the violence, an army spokesman said.
   The most senior Palestinian leader among the deportees was
Abdallah Abu Samhadaneh, 38, a lecturer at the Islamic University in
Gaza whom the army accused of organizing a network of underground
popular committees.
   Also deported was Abdel Hamid Al-Baba, a 25-year-old university
student from the Amari refugee camp in the West Bank accused of
being a member of the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising,
the underground group directing the Palestinian resistance.
   The army said all the 13 deportees received deportation orders on
Aug. 17, 1988. The orders were upheld by the military appeals
committees, and the 13 have dropped their appeals to Israel's
Supreme Court, it said.
   The United States and other Western nations have criticized
Israel for deporting suspected Palestinian activists.
   In the occupied territories Sunday, underground Palestinian
resistance leaders had called for a ``Day Of Escalation'' to mark
Fatah Day, which celebrates formation of Fatah and the group's first
anti-Israeli attack on Jan. 1, 1965. The PLO is an umbrella
organization for several guerrilla groups, the largest being
Arafat's Fatah.
   Arafat himself participated in a Dec. 28, 1965, guerrilla attack
on an Israeli water installation in northern Israel. There were no
casualties in that attack.
   Hundreds of Palestinian youths gathered in at least six West Bank
villages to hold parades, an Arab reporter said. The teen-agers were
dressed in green and khaki-colored vests and wore masks, the Arab
reporter said.
   In Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem, Palestinians spray-painted
pictures of Arafat on the wall and flew illegal Palestinian flags on
utility poles, an Arab reporter said.
   Eight Palestinians were wounded in violent incidents in the West
Bank, and a curfew violator was wounded in Gaza, Israel radio said.
   A 17-year-old from Tulkarem in the West Bank was critically
injured by a bullet to the head, an Arab doctor said on condition of
anonymity. The army spokeswoman said she was unaware of the injury.
   Israel captured the territories from Egypt and Jordan in 1967.
About 1.5 million Palestinians live there.

   Wishing that 1989 will ``be the year of
peace, of justice,'' Pope John Paul II on Sunday said respect for
minorities and their participation in public life are essential in
making a harmonious world.
   The Roman Catholic church dedicates the first day of the year as
``World Peace Day'' and John Paul, in his sermon during New Year's
Day Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, linked achievement of
international peace to respect for people of different cultural,
religious and ethnic backgrounds.
   The pope, quoting from the church's official message for World
Peace Day, said guaranteeing ``minorities' participation in public
life is a sign of elevated civil progress'' and honors ``those
nations in which all citizens are guaranteed such a participation in
a climate of true liberty.''
   He did not cite any specific nations or peoples.
   In his noontime Angelus prayer immediately following the
1}-hour-long Mass, the pope also made an appeal to the
``consciences'' of all kidnappers to release their victims because
``God is the only master of man's life.''
   Diplomats and their wives, some of whom covered their faces with
black veils, took communion from the pope.
   Fifty priests, each taking a chalice filled with consecrated
hosts fanned out from the high altar under the Bernini's baroque
brass canopy and distributed communion the thousands of others.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of dead birds found along a
three-quarter mile stretch of country road may have been poisoned by
a pesticide or other chemical, a biologists said.
   Residents along the road, about four miles south of Austin, first
noticed the dead birds Saturday.
   Hundreds of birds were visible from the road, flapping on the
ground or dangling from tree limbs. Hundreds more could be spotted
in fields.
   The varieties included brown-headed cowbirds, Brewer's
blackbirds, redwing blackbirds, Eastern meadowlarks, mourning doves,
kildeer and a marsh hawk which died shortly after feeding on a dying
cowbird.
   ``I didn't notice them until about 9:30 (a.m. Saturday),'' said
Steve Miller, a teacher and bird watcher who lives near the heaviest
concentration of corpses. ``I estimate there are at least 2,000 dead
or dying.''
   Miller said he counted 276 dead birds Saturday in an area roughly
the size of an acre in a pasture next to his home.
   Jack Ralph, a contaminants biologist with the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, said he suspected poisoning, possibly from some
type of herbicide, pesticide or related toxin.
   ``As yet, we can't determine whether this is a natural or
man-made event,'' Ralph said.
   Ralph gathered several of the birds for analysis at a state
toxicology laboratory. Test results would be available in about a
week, he said.
   State conservationists scrambled in recent weeks to stem an
outbreak of avian cholera that killed more than 2,000 geese along
the Texas coast.

   A fast-spreading fire swept through a home
north of here Sunday, killing eight children and the two adults who
were baby-sitting them, authorities said.
   The fire spread so quickly that it was unlikely anyone awakened
before being overcome by smoke, said Remer Fire Chief Leo Renn. The
bodies were found still on the couches or beds, he said.
   Elsewhere, fires killed at least six people Sunday, including
four who died in an early morning blaze in an Anchorage, Alaska,
trailer house. At least three people died in fires on New Year's Eve.
   The two-story wooden home where 10 died in Minnesota was engulfed
in flames when firefighters arrived about 2:10 a.m., authorities
said.
   ``It's probably the worst situation I've seen where 10 people are
killed at one time,'' said Cass County Sheriff Jim Dowson. ``It's
just devastating,'' he said.
   John and Nancy Watson, the owners of the house, returned home to
find their four children, two nieces, two neighbor children and the
two adults had been killed.
   The dead were identified as the Watson's four children, Jenny,
14, Samantha, 11, Edward, 9, and William, 8; Mrs. Watson's sister
and brother-in-law, Jean and Becky Smischney; their two children,
Jay, 10, and Kimberly, 8; and the two neighbor children, Michelle
and Robin Bastle, ages unknown.
   The home is in a rural area about one mile north of Remer, which
is 20 miles southwest of Grand Rapids in north-central Minnesota.
   The Watsons were ``hysterical, out of control,'' when they
arrived after the fire, Renn said. They had to be sedated and taken
to a hospital.
   The fire spread in minutes, said John Watson's step-sister, Tammy
Grover, 18.
   ``They (the Watsons) just went into town for 20 minutes to get a
pack of cigarettes and it just started in that short of time,'' Miss
Grover said.
   Renn said a wood-burning stove and a fuel-oil space heater were
each being investigated as possible causes of the blaze. He said
lives probably would have been saved if the house had been equipped
with smoke detectors.
   In Maine, an 11-year-old boy was arrested and charged with murder
in an apartment fire that killed a 53-year-old man in the southern
city of Biddeford on Saturday night, officials said.
   And in Portland, Maine, a mother and her infant daughter were
killed in a house with a defective smoke detector on New Year's Eve,
officials said.
   Victims of the Anchorage trailer fire Sunday were not immediately
identified, but police said they were two adults and two children.
The early-morning blaze, which was quickly extinguished, ``appears
to have been an accidental fire that started in the living room
area,'' said Don Barlow, a spokesman for the Anchorage Fire
Department.
   Seven people died in fires in Anchorage during all of 1988,
Barlow said.
   In Wisconsin, New Year's Day fires killed one person in a
Waukesha hotel room and another in a Racine residence.
   One man died in a fire in his room at the Waukesha Hotel about
3:30 a.m. Sunday, said Assistant Fire Chief Wayne Grauer.
   In Racine, firefighters responding to a report of a blaze early
Sunday at a two-story home found a badly charred body, believed to
be that of a woman who lived there, a fire department spokesman said.

<HEAD>Head Of IRA's Political Wing Criticizes IRA Guerrillas For Killing
Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerry Adams, the president of
the Irish Republican Army's legal political wing Sinn Fein, has
criticized the guerrilla group for killing civilians in bungled
bombings.
   ``My view is quite clear. I think the onus is on the IRA to
safeguard the civilians from injury and death,'' Adams was quoted as
saying in an interview with Sunday Life, a Belfast newspaper.
   Nineteen civilians have died in a series of botched IRA
operations in the last 14 months.
   The outlawed IRA prides itself on targeting the security forces
while sparing civilians in its fight to oust the British from
Northern Ireland, and the blunders have drawn criticism even from
some IRA supporters.
   Last July, Adams called on the IRA to ``get its house in order''
after a bomb exploded prematurely outside a West Belfast swimming
pool, killing two of his Roman Catholic constituents.
   In the interview published Sunday, Adams, a member of the British
Parliament, reiterated his view that the IRA ``must avoid
circumstances and conditions in which civilians and non-combatants
will be killed or injured.''
   ``I think the onus is always on the IRA to do that,'' he said.
``The other forces can kill civilians as a matter of policy but the
IRA cannot.''
   In November 1987, an IRA bomb killed 11 Protestants attending a
memorial service to Britain's war dead in Enniskillen, 65 miles
southwest of Belfast, sparking international condemnation of the IRA.
   The IRA claimed British electronic scanners may have triggered
the bomb prematurely.
   In another admitted blunder, a bomb intended to kill a judge
instead killed a Protestant couple and their 6-year-old son as they
drove home from a U.S. vacation last July.

   President Fidel Castro vehemently reaffirmed
his hardline socialist principles Sunday in a nationally televised
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his communist revolution.
   ``Today, we say with more force than ever: socialism or death,
Marxism-Leninism or death!'' Castro said.
   The speech, which carried one of Castro's strongest declarations
of ideological purity, comes at a time of new challenges in ties
with the Soviet Union, Africa, and Latin America.
   Cuba's ties with the Soviet Union appear to have entered a period
of uncertainty as a result of ideological differences. On other
fronts, Cuban diplomats say a visit here by Pope John Paul II may be
possible in 1989, and Cuba has hinted that it wants a more
constructive relationship with the United States.
   As part of the anniversary celebrations this weekend, Castro gave
his speech Sunday night in the main square of the eastern coastal
city of Santiago. He spoke for almost two hours from the balcony of
the building where he proclaimed victory for his guerrilla forces on
New Year's Day, 1959. A large crowd gathered to hear him in Cespedes
plaza next to the building, which is now used as the city hall.
   Castro told them he was maintaining strict adherence to socialist
principles because of the ``enormous responsibility'' Cuba has to
the peoples of the Third World.
   He devoted much of his speech broadcast on state-run television,
however, to praising the role played by the people of Santiago and
other eastern cities in his revolution and Cuba's independence from
Spain in 1902.
   The Cuban leader considers this city, from which he led his
communist guerrillas into revolution, the moral capital of this
communist country. On New Year's Eve 1958, Castro ousted a rightist
dictatorship, touching off a revolution that has made him the
undisputed leader of this Soviet-allied Caribbean nation.
   But the Cuban-Soviet friendship, although far from breaking up,
seems more tenuous now than it has been in decades.
   A key question is whether Soviet unhappiness with the way Cuba
has used economic aid from the Kremlin _ estimated at $5 billion
annually _ will lead to cutbacks. Castro has used the economic aid
to help build his country's schools and hospitals, the Soviets say,
and has neglected industrial development.
   Castro is an advocate of socialist purity and opposes any policy
that borrows from capitalism. He has spoken scornfully of the
political and social reforms proposed by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, saying the ``consequences would be hard'' for Cuba if the
Soviet experiment encounters ``serious difficulties.''
   ``So we may be in for difficulties coming from the enemy camp and
difficulties coming from the camp of our own friends,'' he said last
month.
   The recent Cuban commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from
Angola by 1991 presents another step toward scaling back Cuba's
involvement in international conflicts. Cuba has given military
support to many countries, but the commitment to Angola was by far
the biggest.
   In Latin America, Castro has been aggressively pursuing interests
common to other countries in the area. The evolution of democracy in
Latin America, which has been welcomed by the Reagan administration,
has also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic
opportunities for Castro.
   The Cuban leader, once known for his efforts to promote violent
revolution, now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with
elected governments.
   Castro attended presidential inagurations in Ecuador and Mexico
in recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the
Venezuelan president next month.
   During Castro's visit to Mexico in late November, his first since
he was exiled there in the 1960s, he said he envisions the eventual
unity of Cuba and the rest of Latin America.
   ``One day, we will make one big giant,'' he said.
   Western diplomats say Castro may be hoping to gain from the
growing restiveness over the devastating social consequences of
Latin America's $420 billion foreign debt, which has left the region
much poorer than it was a decade ago. Castro has long advocated that
Latin America renounce its debt on grounds it is unpayable.
   Meanwhile, Castro has indicated interest in a more relaxed
relationship with the United States. In remarks to the National
Assembly last week, he said he would not neglect any opportunity to
improve U.S.-Cuban relations.
   A potential obstacle to an accommodation with Washington is the
U.S. plan to beam to Cuban audiences a televised version of Radio
Marti, a station operated by the Voice of America whose
anti-communist programs are already heard in Cuba. The proposal has
drawn an angry reaction from Castro, but he has not said
specifically how he would retaliate.

   FBI Director William Sessions, anticipating a
long investigation into the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland,
said Sunday he welcomes any information PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
can provide.
   Arafat ``has a great deal of information, a wealth of information
he can give us,'' Sessions said. The FBI director added that
contacts between the FBI and the leader of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization presumably could be set up by the State
Department.
   U.S. and PLO officials recently opened talks after Arafat
disavowed terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Sessions, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley''
and on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said it may take a long time to
discover who is responsible for the jetliner crash.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced herself
Sunday from American vows to punish those who killed 270 people by
planting a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103.
   ``I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever
valid,'' she said in a wide-ranging New Year's television interview.
   ``The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation
of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought
to justice,'' she said on the ``David Frost on Sunday'' program on
the commercial TV-am channel.
   The danger of revenge, she said, is that ``it can affect innocent
people.''

   New Year's fireworks left thousands homeless in the Philippines,
and 49 revelers in Rio drowned en route to a pyrotechnics display.
The superpowers swapped warm salutations, but a one-sided truce
failed to silence the guns in Afghanistan.
   The new year came in as the old one went out, with promises of
peace and bursts of tragedy.
   Children orphaned by an earthquake got new toys, one Korea
offered a tentative olive branch to the other, five Hindus were
massacred as they prayed, and the lights went out in Lima for the
second New Year's Eve in a row.
   Thousands poured into streets and squares to celebrate the
arrival of 1989, from Times Square in New York to Orchard Road in
Singapore on the other side of the globe.

   Federal regulators, by rescuing or closing a
post-Depression record of 217 insolvent savings institutions in
1988, have written a check for $38 billion with money they do not
yet actually have.
   Now it's up to Congress and the administration of President-elect
Bush to make sure the check doesn't come back marked ``insufficient
funds.''
   Not since the Depression year of 1938, when 277 S&amp;Ls went under,
has a greater number failed.
   Twenty-two of the 1988 rescues, requiring nearly $6 billion in
government aid, came in a frenzied, 48-hour spending spree that
ended late Saturday, just hours before the new year began.

   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist threw his
weight Sunday behind an effort to boost federal judges' salaries by
51 percent to $135,000 a year.
   Rehnquist, in his 1988 year-end report on the federal judiciary,
strongly endorsed a presidential commission's recommendation of
hefty pay raises for judges and about 2,000 other top federal
officials.
   In addition to calling for the big pay raise for the trial
judges, who now make $89,500, the commission recommended boosting
salaries of federal appeals court judges from $95,000 to $140,000, a
47 percent jump; of Supreme Court associate justices from $110,000
to $165,000, a 50 percent increase; and of the chief justice from
$115,000 to $175,000, a 52 percent increase.
   The recommendations are pending before President Reagan, who can
accept or modify the figures before sending his fiscal 1990 budget
to Congress on Jan. 9.
