   The jury is still out on Ronald Reagan, but
history is likely to regard him as an average to good president,
according to some scholars of the presidency.
   With little time left in Reagan's final term, The Associated
Press interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists
in history, political science and social psychology.
   Their tentative verdict: Reagan will get high marks for his use
of the White House pulpit to unite the country and will get credit
for improving East-West relations even though Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev may have been more responsible for it than he.
   ``My view is that he will be viewed by the American people as an
above-average president,'' said Thomas Cronin, a historian of the
presidency at Colorado College who calls himself a moderate
Democrat. ``I think the historians and biographers will treat him a
little bit more harshly, still ranking him at least an average
president but not as high as the American people now do or will.''
   But Daniel Franklin, a professor of political science at Colgate
University who is critical of many Reagan policies, said, ``I think,
in the historical sense, somewhere down the road, that Reagan will
be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of
the problems that he has left us.''
   If the economy turns sour in the wake of his administration's
record budget and trade deficits, Reagan may go down in history like
Calvin Coolidge as a president who failed to take action to stave
off coming disaster.
   Some scholars said Reagan's reputation will also suffer from
scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal
effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless.
   ``I think probably in the short range reaction in the next five
or 10 years, even liberal and radical historians will find something
good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a
kind of quality of Americanism and a sense of national unity and he
projected that from the White House,'' said Herman Belz, a
neo-conservative historian at the University of Maryland.
   ``Whether or not in the long run our relations with the Soviets
will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall
of 1988 under Ronald Reagan I don't know, but it would certainly
look that way,'' said Vaughn Davis Bornet, professor emeritus of
history at Southern Oregon State College and a self-described
moderate Republican.
   Edward W. Chester, a conservative historian at the University of
Texas, said it is too early to evaluate Reagan. But, echoing many of
his academic colleagues, he said, ``The deficit does bother me. The
deficit does bother me.''
   ``I think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon
him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he
brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for
a renewed sense of national pride,'' said Charles W. Dunn, a former
Republican congressional aide who teaches political science at
Clemson University and has written widely on the presidency.
   Austin Ranney, chairman of the Department of Political Science at
the University of California at Berkeley, said, ``On just the
externalities of it, I think Reagan's presidency, with one huge
`if,' will probably go down as one of the most successful ones
certainly in this century and maybe ever.''
   However, comparing Reagan with one of the predecessors the
president most admires, Ranney also said that ``Reagan may go down
in history pretty much the way Coolidge did'' if some economists'
predictions of economic collapse come true.
   ``Coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by
Hoover, a bum, but as a president whose do-nothing policies led to
the huge crash of the early '30s that Hoover was the victim of,'' he
said.
   Dean Keith Simonton, a professor of psychology at the University
of California at Davis who has devised a formula for predicting how
history will rate presidents, said, ``When you put all the pros and
all the cons in the equation, Ronald Reagan comes out as a slightly
above average president.''
   One of the ``pro'' factors for Reagan, said Simonton, is the
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that he and Gorbachev have
forged.
   ``He gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he
didn't take the initiative for that,'' Simonton said.
   ``In all fairness, Gorbachev deserves more credit than he does,''
said Colorado College's Cronin.
   ``Still,'' said Southern Oregon's Bornet, ``Ronald Reagan stepped
forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and that's going
to be hard to erase, I'll tell you.''
   Clemson's Dunn, similarly, argued, ``A good leader also must
seize the opportunity, and Gorbachev offered an opportunity to play
for high stakes in the international arena. He seized that; he was
not frozen in place by rigid ideology, and thus I think one has to
give him credit.''
   From Berkeley, Ranny said the relaxation of East-West tensions
was the most important of Reagan's accomplishments in foreign policy.
   ``Now you might say that's because he got lucky and had Gorbachev
there, and I wouldn't quarrel with that,'' he said. ``Nevertheless,
it did happen. And I think when historians look back at that, they
will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most
successful postwar presidents that we have had.''
   Psychologist Simonton said one big factor working in Reagan's
favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since
Dwight Eisenhower to serve eight years.
   ``The longer you serve the more events happen that can be
credited to you, whether or not you are responsible for them,'' he
said. ``You make a thick chapter in the history of America under
your name.''
   Although Reagan recently pictured himself as the adversary of a
``Washington colony'' protecting special interests at the expense of
ordinary citizens, some scholars argued that one of his own chief
shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the
outside.

   ``There will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to
those without voice in Washington, that he responded much more to
upper middle class and middle class America,'' said Cronin. ``The
presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of
those who don't have the powerful lobbies.''
   Cronin is self-described as a Democrat with a liberal viewpoint
compared with Reagan's, but the more conservative Chester agreed,
``I also think Reagan could perhaps have done more for the
homeless.''
   The Iran-Contra affair and the investigations and indictments
that have marked Reagan's administration also will cast their
shadow, the scholars said.
   ``The people will forget that quickly; the historians won't,''
said Cronin. ``The historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff
and they'll call it as bad or equal to the Watergate mess.''
   Some who praised Reagan highly on other grounds conceded he was
not as attentive as he should have been to his duties.
   ``He didn't keep his ear to the ground enough and he didn't have
enough interest in political life, the warp and woof of it, to do as
good a job as he could have,'' said the neo-conservative Belz.
   In strikingly similar language, Ranny said, ``I imagine he loses
a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments
and things like that,'' and Simonton said that ``he is probably
going to get some negative points'' because of such troubles.
   In comparing Reagan with past presidents, scholars cited the
names ranging from Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson.
   ``Personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed
evaluation of Lyndon Johnson as president and if that's any
precedent, then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to
get down to serious business with Ronald Reagan,'' said Bornet, who
has written extensively on Johnson.
   Johnson, he said, ``is still the crude, cornpone president, and
Reagan is going to continue to be for a long time this image people
watched on TV and this person the press correctly portrayed as
essentially a lazy president.''
   As for Eisenhower, he has undergone a re-evaluation in recent
years, with scholars believing him a much more activist president
than first believed. Ranney said, ``If future scholarship finds out
that behind the scenes and when the truth is known Reagan himself
was also a much more hands-on active president than we now believe _
and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that _ he might
undergo the same kind of upgrading.''
   Dunn, however, said, ``Definitely a comparison of Eisenhower and
Reagan is in order. Eisenhower had a very subtle style of leadership
that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people
thought he was leading. Reagan's leadership I don't think will come
off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has
been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the
public mind.''
   On the other hand, the Clemson political scientist said, Reagan
may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that
John F. Kennedy has suffered as the force of his personality recedes.
   ``There is no longer the Camelot mystique to Kennedy; a lot of
that has worn off,'' he said. ``I suspect that with Ronald Reagan
there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that
surrounds him.''

<HEAD>Operation Rescue Head: Create `Social Tension' To Change Laws</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Where most people list their job
experiences, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry's resume brags,
``Arrested 26 times in seven cities.''
   Terry complains it's out-of-date.
   ``It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in
upstate New York where the latest protests against abortion are
being planned.
   Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a
high-profile issue again.
   Terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion
clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras.
   Terry says he is trying to produce the ``social tension''
necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s
civil rights protest as a model.
   ``He's the Martin Luther King of a movement,'' said Dominick
Brignola, an Albany lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion
drive.
   Terry's critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because
followers try to ``rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's
rights.
   ``The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people.
They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human
beings,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women.
   More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged Atlanta jails
during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then,
demonstrations have spread to New York City, Indianapolis,
Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Boston and still more cities.
   The activists want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated
1.6 million women have abortions each year in the United States.
   Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star.
   Terry and his wife, Cindy, began their crusade in 1984 by
standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of
entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office
that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby
clothes.
   ``God clicked a light on in my head and said it wasn't enough to
just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about
it,'' said Terry, who's selling his auto dealership because he is
too busy with Operation Rescue.
   Critics concede Terry has a mesmerizing personality. He even
tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said Dawn Marvin of
Rochester, his aunt.
   Terry was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit
high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said Marvin, who
is communications director for the Rochester chapter of Planned
Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently
target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization
about her nephew.
   ``He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about Terry's
transformation into a born-again Christian. ``He came back a totally
changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a
spiritual quest.''
   Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman
have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and
three foster children.
   Terry dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment
that ``he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention.
   To Margaret Johnston, administrator at Southern Tier Women's
Services in Binghamton, Operation Rescue is nothing new. She said
anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and
glued the clinic's door shut four or five times.
   Terry's first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself
to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for
22 days for refusing to pay a $60 fine.
   ``It doesn't matter what you say to him. There is no reason
involved,'' Johnston said. ``He doesn't care about women. I think he
really hates women.''
   Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the
Binghamton clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present
demonstrators at shouting distance.
   ``They really want to make it personal,'' Johnston said.
   Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office,
Johnston said Terry has shouted at her, ``How many babies did you
murder today?''
   Terry criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being ``too nice''
during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend
like President Reagan into not working hard for its goal.
   ``We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he
said. ``That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the
victim.''
   The lean, bushy-haired Terry expects and even hopes his
demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue was
responsible for 11,000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500,000 will be
arrested in 1989.
   There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified.
   ``In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own
beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children
murdered,'' he said.
   ``That's like saying, `Why can't a white man follow his own
conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why can't a German
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?'''
   Terry has attracted some prominent supporters, including former
presidential candidate Pat Robertson, who said he backs ``any means
short of violence'' to stop abortion.
   If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, Terry said,
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political
system is not built to deal with mass protests.
   Yard dismisses Terry as a ``puppet'' groomed for the role of
point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive.
   ``Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. ``The
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings (of
abortion clinics) and Operation Rescue is that people don't believe
Roe vs. Wade can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.''
   At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted.
   Pinned to the wall is a large map of the United States, with
``abortion mills'' dotted in red. Terry distractedly complains to a
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will
take him to a television appearance.
   As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his
desk, saying ``that's too casual for someone trying to change world
history.''
   He adds, chuckling: ``It's comical, really. I think God has a
sense of humor. Don't you think it's rather funny that a former used
car salesman is heading such a movement?''

   Faced with the choice of trying to kick heroin or
going back to jail, Jon Parker fought his way 14 years ago from the
murky world of Boston's shooting galleries to the academic heights
of Yale University.
   Now he's back on the streets. He again faces a possible jail
term, but this time he's charged with illegally handing out clean
needles to people he used to run with _ many of whom already have
contracted AIDS by sharing dirty needles.
   Parker, 33, said he doesn't want to go to jail, but he's willing
to risk it to try to change the Massachusetts requirement for a
prescription to buy a hypodermic syringe.
   ``People look down on addicts, but it's through them that AIDS is
going to spread to the heterosexual community,'' he says. ``People
are going to have to realize that.''
   Parker is founder of a 50-member organization called the AIDS
Brigade, which includes Yale graduate students as well as former
addicts and convicts. It was formed about four years ago and
distributes AIDS education materials, bleach and needles in New
Haven, Conn., New York City, New Jersey and Boston.
   Critics say he's a renegade, too far from mainstream efforts to
curb the spread of AIDS, most often transmitted through homosexual
contact and shared needles.
   ``I think clean needles clearly is one way of addressing the
problem for addicts. It would be nice if they were available, but
they're not, so we do what we can through other aspects,'' said
Brianne Comella, director of Project Trust, supported by city and
state funds.
   Project Trust volunteers distribute bottles of bleach and show
addicts how to sterilize needles.
   ``I think that there is an absolute need for fringe groups such
as the AIDS Brigade to push the system. Unfortunately, I think that
they could be more effective if they worked with existing programs
rather than as Lone Rangers,'' Ms. Commella said.
   State health officials estimate there are about 40,000 addicts in
Massachusetts, and about one-third are believed to be carrying the
AIDS virus.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn backed a needle exchange program, but it was
rejected by the City Council.
   Dr. George A. Lamb, first deputy commissioner for the Boston
Department of Health and Hospitals, supported the attempt at a
needle exchange program and said he will testify at Parker's trial,
which he hopes will revive interest in the program.
   Addicts meet AIDS Brigade workers in dingy restaurants and on
street corners to get their sets of needles, known as ``the works.''
   Parker makes rounds of the neighborhoods where the people he
tries to help live, such as Jenny, who used to shoot dope with
Parker 18 years ago, but now is trying to stay clean.
   A thin, pale woman in her 30s with dark circles under her eyes,
Jenny spoke at her apartment on condition her last name wasn't used.
She tested positive for the AIDS virus last summer, and she's sure
she contracted the disease through sharing dirty needles. ``The
works are hard to get,'' Jenny says.
   Parker was arrested this summer and charged with illegal
possession of hypodermic syringes, which he buys legally in Vermont.
The charge is a misdemeanor, but Parker requested a jury trial,
which will probably take place this spring.
   ``I want to show that this is the logical answer to stop the
spread of AIDS,'' Parker said.
   His attorney, Arnold Abelow, plans a ``necessity defense,''
saying that illegally handing out the needles is justified by the
need to curb AIDS.
   But prosecutors say having a reason for doing something doesn't
excuse an offense.
   ``We're only kidding ourselves to think (addicts) are going to go
out and only use the needle once,'' said First Assistant Attorney
Paul Leary of the Suffolk County District Attorney's office.
   Parker says his personal history makes him a better judge of how
addicts are likely to respond.
   He shot heroin as a teen-ager and robbed drug stores for money
and supplies. At 17, he served more than two years time, earning his
high school equivalency diploma in jail. A month after his release,
in 1974, he was caught violating parole and given the choice of
checking into a drug rehabilitation center or going back to jail.
   He chose reform.
   Since then, Parker has worked a variety of jobs, including
driving a cab and a few bouts as a local boxer, to get money to help
pay his way through Hampshire College in Amherst, where he studied
biology, and then to Yale's School of Epidemiology and Public
Health, where he is completing work on a masters degree in public
health.
   He says he wants other addicts to have the same chance he did.

   Uniformed men beat up Cecilio
Aguilar beneath an avocado tree, marched him and two friends down a
wooded path and pounded them to death with rifle butts, witnesses
say.
   Leftist guerrillas captured Francisco Diaz as he was searching
for three wayward cows, took him away and shot him.
   The killings are examples of the growing toll of politically
motivated slayings in El Salvador in 1988 as both sides in a
9-year-old civil war grow frustrated with a stalemate.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office has counted 181
summary killings in the first 11 months of 1988, compared with 129
in all of 1987.
   Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said during his homily
Sunday that altogether 1,369 civilians, soldiers or leftist rebels
were killed last year in military clashes, rightist death squad
operations and car bombings or other terrorist acts. The war has
claimed an estimated 65,000 lives since it began.
   ``It is so hard to see any sort of light,'' said a church worker
who has spent nearly two decades in Morazan, an eastern province
divided between guerrillas and government forces.
   ``It's so disheartening because you had the feeling things were
getting better. And now you feel them going backward, getting
worse,'' the worker said on condition he not be identified.
   When the uniformed men had finished killing Cecilio, they went
back to his house to demand food and his weapon. His mother could
give them only tortillas.
   ``They said he was a guerrilla. But my son had no weapon, only a
machete,'' said Dominga Aguilar. In her one-room mud brick home, she
recounted through sobs the events of Nov. 12, when men she described
as government soldiers swept into this hamlet.
   Francisco Diaz was the former mayor of another small town,
Lolotique, 12 miles from Piedra Luna. He was searching for cows with
his brother Dec. 6 when leftist guerrillas captured him, his wife
said. They killed him for what they said was his complicity in a
U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.
   The cases in Lolotique and Piedra Luna, a village of a dozen
households 90 miles east of San Salvador, are not unique.
   Respect for human rights improved steadily from 1984 until 1988.
The early 1980s were a time of slaughter when soldiers and rightist
death squads were blamed for the slayings of about 30,000 people.
   The United States, which has provided more than $3 billion in aid
this decade, told Salvadoran authorities in 1983 that support would
dry up if the rights situation did not improve. Salvadoran
authorities say the government no longer has any ties with
right-wing death squads.
   The leftist guerrillas have killed eight mayors and 32 other
civilians in 1988 for allegedly collaborating with the army.
   The Catholic Legal Aid office blames the army for 90 summary
executions of suspected guerrilla collaborators. Death squads are
blamed for 51 murders.
   The slayings of Aguilar, 17, Hernan Benitez, 18 and Dolores
Pineda, 24, devastated their families, the community council they
all sat on and the village soccer team.
   Benitez was the goalie, Aguilar a fullback and Pineda a
midfielder. Benitez died with his soccer shoes on.
   ``I won't play ever again,'' his mother, Amalia, quoted him as
saying as he laced up the cleats before being taken away.
   ``He knew. He lifted the dog's front paws and danced with him. He
kissed the baby and said, `This is it, Ma. I'm saying goodbye,'''
she said.
   Those who took them away were government soldiers, six witnesses
said. Hernan's mother said the officer in charge repeatedly accused
the family of setting corn aside for the guerrillas.
   Arturo Rivera Damas, archbishop of San Salvador, also has blamed
army troops for the Piedra Luna killings and called for an
investigation.
   Lt. Col. Oscar Leon Linares denied army responsibility. He blamed
the guerrillas, claiming they wanted to discredit the armed forces.
   He said army records show no troops near Piedra Luna on Nov. 12.
He denied a request to see the records, saying they were classified.
   He said the case is closed.
   Aguilar's 15-year-old brother has been a guerrilla for a year,
Mrs. Aguilar said. Benitez's father was detained for four days in
October, and _ according to his family _ he was severely beaten and
accused of guerrilla sympathies.
   The three young men, though perhaps not outright collaborators,
maintained friendly relations with rebels who pass through
regularly, villagers said. The community council they sat on
functions with tacit guerrilla approval.
   When the guerrillas kill civilians, they usually announce it on
their clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   The radio announced Dec. 9 that Diaz, the former mayor, was found
guilty of ``crimes against the people.'' He was the
secretary-general of the governing Christian Democratic Party in
Lolotique.
   He had been kidnapped by the guerrillas for five months in 1985.
   ``We explained to him how mayors are tools for the implementation
of the counterinsurgency plan ... but he did not obey, and continued
implementing the plan in Lolotique,'' said the broadcast.
   ``He helped whomever he could,'' said his widow, Blanca, in their
home. The room where she sat contained a sort of shrine _ a crucifix
and her husband's photograph surrounded by flowers in coffee cans.
   ``Maybe they killed him for helping the community,'' she said, a
tear tracking down her cheek.

<TEXT>
   When a U.S. ambassador sat down with a
PLO delegation for the first official meeting in 13 years, Sweden
scored a triumph for a foreign policy variously described as
magnanimous or meddlesome.
   For a small country, Sweden is engaged in other people's troubles
to a surprising degree.
   ``Some people call it international meddling or giving
unsolicited advice,'' said Pierre Schori, the Cabinet secretary who
is the Foreign Ministry's No. 2 official. But Sweden sees its
foreign diplomacy as central to its own well-being.
   ``Our security has not only to do with our borders. It also is
affected by the international climate,'' Schori said.
   Increasingly, neutral Sweden is being used as a communications
channel for parties who can't talk to each other.
   On Dec. 16, the same day the U.S. ended its formal boycott of the
PLO, Sweden's ambassador to Syria, Rolf Gauffin, was instrumental in
mediating the release of Peter Winkler, a Red Cross delegate who was
kidnapped Nov. 17 by a Palestinian faction in Lebanon.
   Sweden's approach to world affairs, sometimes criticized as
moralistic and preaching, has created some ill feeling, particularly
in Israel but also in the United States.
   The late Prime Minister Olof Palme was blacklisted from the White
House for his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War after he
marched through Stockholm with North Vietnamese leaders.
   ``We believe strongly in human rights, international law and the
resolution of conflicts,'' Schori said in an interview in his
vaulted 18th century office. ``Our actions are motivated by a
combination of self-interest and solidarity.''
   The U.S.-PLO dialogue was a personal victory for Foreign Minister
Sten Andersson, who worked in secret for nine months to nudge
Palestinian Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat to meet U.S.
conditions for ending its ban on contacts with his organization.
   ``The PLO success was the climax of a long process,'' Schori
said. ``But the positions were blocked, and what was needed was a
midwife. Somebody had to take the initiative. Sten Andersson saw
that.''
   Andersson, a wily politician with little foreign experience, came
to the Foreign Ministry in 1985 after nearly 20 years as secretary
of the dominant Social Democratic Party and three years as health
minister.
   He brought with him the typically Swedish approach that any
problem is solvable by discussion among reasonable men.
   Sweden, which allocates 1 percent of its gross national product
to foreign aid, also has provided a pool of experienced diplomats
for international service.
   Bernt Carlsson was U.N. Commissioner for Namibia. He died in Dec.
21 Pan Am plane crash in Scotland while on his way to New York to
observe the signing of an agreement for Namibian independence from
South African rule.
   Jan Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, was tapped by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Sept. 1 to lead
Iran-Iraq peace negotiations.
   In less public roles, Swedish diplomats have been conduits for
contacts between rival factions in Nicaragua and El Salvador, among
others, Schori said.
   Last year the Swedes persuaded Cuba to allow the Red Cross to
visit prisoners in Cuban jails.
   Sweden's international activity goes back a long way. Prime
Minister Karl Branting won the 1921 Nobel Peace Prize for his work
with the League of Nations.
   It has contributed 55,000 men to U.N. peacekeeping forces, which
were created by the U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, a Swede.
   Count Folke Bernadotte, a member of Sweden's royal family, was
the U.N.'s first martyr. He was assassinated by Jewish extremists in
pre-independence Palestine in 1948.
   Four years earlier, diplomat Raoul Wallenberg distributed Swedish
passports to Hungarian Jews threatened with deportation to Nazi
death camps. He was credited with saving 100,000 lives before Soviet
forces arrested him at the close of the war and he disappeared. The
Soviets say he died in prison in 1947, but his family is convinced
he is still alive.
   Gunnar Jarring, appointed special U.N. emissary to the Middle
East after the 1967 Six-Day War, earned a footnote in history as the
inventor of shuttle diplomacy, though the credit went later to
former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Jarring's mission
ended in failure.
   Schori said the relaxation of U.S.-Soviet tension may usher in a
less active period for Sweden.
   ``There's been a need for bridge-building. Now it's changing,''
he said. ``We have no ambition to be mediators. Where we have a
contribution to make, we do all we can. But I see this role
declining in an era of detente.''

   Federal regulators rescued a post-Depression
record 217 savings institutions in 1988, leaving Congress and
President-elect Bush to figure out the best way to pay the $38
billion bill.
   Theoretically, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
the S&amp;L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $45
billion to $50 billion _ to cover the cost.
   But analysts and many members of Congress say regulators have run
up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable.
   ``We still don't know the magnitude of the S&amp;L crisis,'' Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Sunday. ``We're not even
certain what the regulators have been doing the past week, running
up a tab of some $40 billion.''
   Even with a last-minute spending spree of nearly $6 billion to
rescue 22 institutions in the final 48 hours of 1988, regulators
still have about 350 more insolvency cases to handle. And, as of
last Sept. 30, another 150 savings institutions were sliding toward
insolvency with capital levels below 1.5 percent.
   Estimates of the total cost of paying for the mess run as high as
$112 billion, a figure reported last month by the General Accounting
Office, Congress' auditing agency.
   Treasury Department officials are considering a variety of plans
for the incoming administration. Most attempt to spread out the
burden over time and keep as much as possible from adding to the
federal budget deficit.
   But Dole, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said, ``Somebody's going to have to pay. ... We can't
hide it by putting it off budget or smoke and mirrors.''
   This year's failure and rescue total _ 217 of the 3,100 S&amp;Ls
operating at the start of the year _ is more than quadruple last
year's total of 48. It is the highest total since a record 277
failures and rescues in the Depression year of 1938.
   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
the nation's 13,500 commercial banks, 221 banks failed or required
government assistance. That is also a post-Depression record,
topping the previous record of 203 in 1987.
   Both the FDIC and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
draw their funds from an assessment on member institutions. But the
FDIC depends on the much-larger banking industry, which as a whole
is in much better shape, and enters 1989 in relatively good shape
with more than $15 billion in reserves.
   FSLIC, however, is technically insolvent. So, regulators have
been patching together rescue deals with as little cash as possible.
Most of the aid takes the form of various commitments secured by
revenue that regulators don't have now and in some case won't have
for as long as 30 years.
   Moreover, the revenue projections depend on charging S&amp;Ls a
special assessment, originally intended to be phased out in a few
years, over the next three decades. Industry officials say that
would drive even more S&amp;Ls into the red.
   The biggest rescue on the last day of 1988 was for the Beverly
Hills Savings and Loan Association, a giant California institution
whose financial problems had plagued regulators for years.
   The package called for the government to provide $983 million in
assistance in the sale of Beverly Hills to Michigan National Corp.,
a bank holding company in Farmington Hills, Mich., that is putting
$52 million into the deal.
   Also on Saturday, the bank board pledged:
   _$243.3 million in aid to Home Federal Savings and Loan, a San
Diego S&amp;L putting up $25 million to acquire three institutions in
the San Francisco area. They are: Columbus Savings and Loan, San
Rafael; Cal America Savings and Loan, Walnut Creek, and First
Security, Pleasant Hill.
   _$151.1 million in aid to California Savings and Loan of Los
Angeles, which agreed to put up $20.4 million into the insolvent
Broward Federal Savings and Loan of Sunrise, Fla.
   _$29.9 million in aid to First Network Savings Bank of Los
Angeles, which agreed to pay $1.25 million for the insolvent Tahoe
Savings and Loan of South Lake Tahoe.
   _$8 million to Home Federal Savings and Loan of Sioux Falls,
S.D., which is purchasing United Federal Savings and Loan of
Aberdeen, S.D.

<HEAD>Last Year Was Bloodiest In DC History: 371 Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The nation's capital also may be the nation's
murder capital.
   In 1988, 371 people were killed in the District of Columbia, far
surpassing the previous high of 287, set in 1969. Police say drugs
are mostly to blame.
   Final population and homicide figures have yet to be compared,
but Washington and Detroit had the two highest per-capita murder
rates in America in 1988.
   Thus, the nation's capital, where the federal government's war on
drugs is mapped out, could earn the dubious distinction of being the
murder capital as well.
   The District of Columbia's drug problems dramatize the two
different Washingtons _ the Capitol, the White House and other sites
visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power.
There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn
to the status and money that come from selling drugs.
   Police say drugs _ particularly the arrival of crack cocaine _
are to blame for about 60 percent of the slayings. As recently as
1986, drug-related killings accounted for just one-third of the
city's homicide total.
   The absence of organized crime in Washington may be a factor in
the city's murder rate, officials say. Law enforcement officials say
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug
market, there are fewer drug-related slayings.
   ``What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting
among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner. ``They are just working for themselves.''
   Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough
battle for Turner and his 3,800 officers.
   Earlier this year, police decided they will switch to .9mm
semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on
the street were outclassing the standard .38-caliber six-shot
revolver officers have been carrying.
   The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots
before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted
in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated
weaponry. Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, Turner
called the district's streets ``something out of the wild, wild
West.'' Officers will have their new guns by 1990.
   And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects
hasn't dulled the city's appetite for narcotics. A highly-touted
anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than
46,000 arrests since it began in August, 1986.
   However, Turner has complained that the program, which sends
swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make
arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's already
overcrowded jail and court systems.
   For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according
to Turner.
   ``A lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few skills,''
Turner said. ``They can make up to a $1 million a year selling
drugs. What would you do?''
   Jay B. Stephens, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who
can prosecute both local and federal crimes, announced in December
that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on
drug-related killings in the district.
   Turner also has called on city officials to spend more money on
drug education, prevention and treatment programs. Currently, a
three-week wait is common for people wanting to enroll in the city's
treatment centers.
   As for the future, police believe that as markets are more firmly
established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative, the
murder rate will decrease.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an
infusion of crack,'' Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other
cities, like New York, murder rates went up there, too.''

<HEAD>Medicare, Pensions Among Changes To Take Effect With New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes
in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching
Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a
little more expensive.
   Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast
expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women,
and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases
on credit.
   Others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduled
early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private
employers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large
layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating
against the handicapped and families with children.
   A few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impact
eventually may be felt by the entire population.
   For example, Environmental Protection Agency regulations
implementing the 46-nation ozone treaty took effect Jan. 1. The
regulations don't require chemical companies to actually do anything
until next July, but then they must cut their production of
chloroflourocarbon or CFC compounds by an estiamted 20 percent back
to 1986 levels.
   The treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer
15 to 25 miles up protecting the earth's surface from ultraviolet
rays. CFC compounds also contribute to the ``greenhouse'' effect
that is warming the planet.
   As a result of the regulations, consumers may notice fewer
plastic food containers from fast-food outlets, thicker insulating
panels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions.
   The biggest of the immediate changes is the Jan 1. expansion of
Medicare coverage for 32 million Medicare beneficiaries to include
catastrophic health care costs.
   Prior to passage of the measure last summer by Congress _ the
first major expansion of Medicare in its 22-year history _ the
program paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year.
   With the changes that took effect Sunday, the beneficiary still
will have to pay the first-day deductible of $560. But that charge
will be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many times
the patient has to be hospitalized. The other 364 days are fully
paid.
   That fundamental change in the hospital benefit was the
cornerstone of the Medicare expansion set in motion by President
Reagan in his 1986 State of the Union message.
   ``Let us remove a financial specter facing our older Ameicans _
the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to
make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death,'' he said
then.
   Medicare enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flat
increase in the premium deducted from their monthly Social Security
checks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40
percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax.
   The flat increase will be $4 a month effective immediately,
climbing to $10.20 monthly in 1993. The sliding scale premium is
projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax
liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993.
   Many of the Jan. 1 changes grow out of the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
The biggest new benefit from that law is faster vesting in pension
plans.
   The maximum waiting period for employees to become fully invested
in a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years.
   However, employers can adopt an option that denies full vesting
until seven years. To do so, they have to offer 20 percent vesting
after three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annually
until the seventh year, when it reaches 100 percent.
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that the
pension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million more
workers a year.
   ``We'll especially see more women being vested than in the past
because they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employer
for shorter periods,'' said Stephanie Poe, a spokeswoman for the
institute.
   Another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interest
payments on everything from car and student loans to credit card
charges will be deductible in 1989, compared with 40 percent last
year.
   And while the government is now raising tax brackets, exemptions
and standard deductions to keep cost-of-living raises from bumping
people into higher brackets, it also is taking more Social Security
taxes.
   The 7.51 percent Social Security tax took a maximum $3,380 out of
employee paychecks in 1988. This year the maximum amount of income
subject to the tax rises from $45,000 to $48,000, raising the
maximum Social Security tax that can be collected from an individual
employee to $3,605.
   The latest change came about just last Thursday, when the Federal
Aviation Administration ordered airlines, effective Jan. 1, to
either inspect by hand or X-ray all luggage checked aboard U.S.
airline flights from western Europe and the Middle East.
   The new inspections, prompted by the bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Scotland on Dec. 21, are expected to delay passenger check-ins by
about an hour.
   Other changes taking effect slightly before or after New Year's
Day include:
   _ The use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employers
to screen job applicants was outlawed, with some exceptions,
effective last Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates
the law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 million
polygraph exams now administered annually.
   _ A 47-year-old ban on homework in five apparel trades is being
removed on Jan. 8, unless unions which support the prohibitions win
a court stay first. Affected are an estimated 50,000 to 75,000
workers in fields such as mittens and gloves, embroideries, buttons
and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades. They will be
able to work legally at home for the first time if their employers
obtain a certficate from the Labor Department after pledging to
abide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards.
   _ A law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice of
plant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officially
takes effect Feb. 4. However, there are different interpretations on
whether companies are required to have provided 60 days notice
beforehand if they close a plant on that date. The Labor Department
advised in early December that, to avoid potential liability, they
should.
   _ Regulations implementing a law passed by Congress last summer
forbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped or
families with children take effect March 12. Violators can be fined
up to $10,000 for a first offense, $25,000 for a second violation in
a five-year period and $50,000 for two or more violations within a
seven-year period.

<HEAD>Volcano Eruption In Southern Chile May Last Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christmas Day eruption of the
snow-capped Lonquimay volcano in southern Chile is gaining in force
and seismologists say they expect it to continue for at least
another two months.
   Authorities have issued masks to residents who are remaining in
the area to protect them from a thick cloud of ash spewed by the
volcano over a sparsely populated area of about 12 square miles.
   And scientists estimate that 525 million cubic feet of lava have
oozed out of the 8,400-foot volcano, toward an uninhabited valley,
since the eruption began.
   Lonquimay, a peak in the Andes foothills about 400 miles south of
Santiago, had been dormant for a century when it erupted on
Christmas Day.
   Authorities say the eruption poses no danger for two nearby
villages, Lolco and Malacahuello. Residents of both towns quickly
evacuated after the eruption, and some later returned home. But many
remain lodged at schools and municipal buildings in Curacautin, a
city 50 miles away.
   Authorities on Saturday issued masks to the few residents who had
returned to their homes. Researchers, soldiers and police officers
also in the area were also wearing the white masks.
   On Sunday, the volcano continued to spew smoke and lava through a
300-foot-wide crater. The volcano initially showed three separate
smaller fissures, but a series of explosions joined them into a
single crater, authorities said.
   Seismologists from the University of La Frontera, in Temuco, the
largest city in the region, said a 1,200-foot-wide, 30-foot-high
mass of lava is slowly slipping down the volcano.
   They said the route followed by the lava is the same as the one
in the Lonquimay's previous eruption, in 1889, and poses no danger
for the population. Livestock in the area were removed to safer
zones, police said.

<HEAD>McLaughlin Says Successor Belongs on Bush Economic Team</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin says
her successor needs to carve out a place on President-elect Bush's
team of top economic advisers to help solve the nation's
competitiveness problem.
   Mrs. McLaughlin, the only woman in the Reagan Cabinet, said in an
interview with The Associated Press, ``On occasion I've felt that we
were spending too much time looking backward instead of preparing a
human resource policy for the future.''
   Bush recently named former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole as the next labor secretary and _ so far _ the only woman in
his Cabinet.
   But he did not give her what Mrs. McLaughlin thinks the labor
secretary needs: a designated spot on his top economic team right
alongside the heads of the Treasury and Commerce departments and the
White House budget office and Council of Economic Advisers.
   Mrs. McLaughlin, during her 14-month Cabinet stint, sought to
heighten business awareness of employee needs such as job
retraining, flexible hours and child-care assistance, and emphasized
the links between education and competitiveness.
   ``I see the Labor Department as an economic arm,'' she said. ``I
think Bush is headed there. The question is how do we get to the
next step.''
   ``The name of the game is going to be competitiveness and unless
the incoming labor secretary moves in there and ties the human
resource issues with the equation ... we're going to have a skills
shortage,'' she said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin, in what she calls her holistic approach to
workplace issues, has often complained that too many people in
government, labor and business are looking backward and constantly
fighting over turf.
   During her brief tenure, Mrs. McLaughlin spent a good part of her
time in those skirmishes, fighting her way into them on occasion and
sometimes finding herself on the sidelines.
   It was on her watch that the AFL-CIO won its first major
legislative victories in a decade: a ban on the use of polygraphs or
lie detectors by private employers to screen job applicants and
mandatory advance notices of plant closings and large layoffs once
vetoed by Reagan.
   With Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
forming an uncharacteristic but also unstoppable alliance on the
first, Mrs. McLaughlin helped persuade the White House to acquiesce
to the polygraph ban rather than continue opposing it on behalf of
some business groups.
   She was relegated to the sidelines on the second, with
then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III using the plant closing
notices as the primary reason for Reagan to veto legislation
overhauling the nation's trade laws.
   When Republican moderates from northern and midwestern states
with large blue-collar constituencies wanted to cut a deal last
spring in which labor would get advance notices of plant closings
but not other layoffs, Baker said no.
   Four months later, with polls showing that more than 80 percent
of voters favored advance layoff warnings, Baker, then Bush's
campaign chief, persuaded Reagan to let the notices for both layoffs
and plant closings become law without his signature.
   ``Plant closing was bigger than all of us,'' Mrs. McLaughlin
said. ``There was never a time when the plant closing situation was
really thought through. If I'm remiss, I suppose I should have
hollered louder.''
   As the former No. 2 official in the Interior Department, Mrs.
McLaughlin relished playing the broker, mediating disputes between
environmentalists and oil companies and cutting deals on Alaskan and
offshore drilling.
   She tried the same approach at Labor, finding that while union
leaders and business executives spoke glowingly of cooperation, they
were often unyielding in practice.
   ``Organized labor is not there yet in its role of what it can do
for itself and this country with regard to training, a quality work
force and all the issues of the workplace as we move into the 21st
Century,'' she said. ``And they won't be there, in my view, if they
continue just to back mandated legislation piecemeal to address
workers' needs.
   ``On the other hand, business isn't there yet either. It will
hold the line on legislation, just like labor will push it, instead
of finding out what's driving these things,'' she said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she will keep speaking out on child care,
flextime, education, drugs _ the human resource issues that she says
will determine the nation's economic health in the 1990s.
   She claimed she is not surprised not to have a role in the new
administration, although she had declared her availability early.
   ``I expected George Bush to find his team, his people,'' she
said. ``It's time to leave because I leave on a high. I join a
prestigious group of people who were here only a year or two years.''

   Two residents of a retirement home were
beaten to death and four were injured in an attack early New Year's
Day, and police detained an 88-year-old man for questioning,
authorities said.
   The man being questioned was regarded as a key witness and was
taken into custody Sunday night, said Police Chief Phil Thompson.
The man has not been ruled out as a suspect, but no charges have
been filed, Thompson said.
   The two killed in the attack in this central Florida city were
Max Nickbarge, 90, and Myrtle Smith, 73.
   The man in custody shared a room at the house with Nickbarge and
with Frank Tear Sr., 89, who suffered a fractured skull and was
listed in critical but stable condition Sunday night at Tampa
General Hospital, authorities said.
   Frank Tear Sr. is the father-in-law of Helen Tear, who owns the
Reflections I retirement home, where the attacks occurred.
   The man who was taken into custody was missing when the bodies
were found Sunday morning by two nurses, Thompson said.
   One of the nurses slept through the attacks, which took place
between midnight Saturday and 8 a.m. Sunday, Thompson said.
   Esther Kelly, 67, was in guarded condition Sunday night following
surgery at a hospital here, Thompson said. Lucy Mitchell, 85, and
Ruth Godfrey, 71, were in fair condition at a hospital in
Zephyrhills.

   Steven Bochco is developing a TV series about a
teen-age doctor, Jackie Mason is tailoring his comedy show for
Britons and Ron Howard is preparing to make Jason Robards and Steve
Martin into a father-and-son team.
   Bochco, one of 36 artists who told The New York Times about their
plans for the 1989, said he got some inspiration from his father,
who was an accomplished violinist by age 7 or 8. He plans a
half-hour series to begin on ABC in September about a 16-year-old
doctor.
   ``It's interesting to think that a 16-year-old kid can't buy a
six-pack of beer, but he could write you a prescription for
morphine,'' said the writer-producer of ``L.A. Law.''
   Mason, whose one-man show ``The World According to Me'' was a hit
on Broadway, said he is writing new material about the differences
in lifestyles between England and New York for the debut of his show
in Britain in February.
   ``In England, politeness is the accent of the whole culture,'' he
said. ``I swear if a guy was drowning, he'd be ashamed to holler
`help.'''
   Howard, whose movie credits include ``Cocoon,'' plans to start

   Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., who was recently
re-elected to his 11th term in Congress, married Mary Ann
Tinklepaugh Knauss, a deputy assistant secretary of commerce for
intergovernmental affairs.
   The couple were married Saturday at St. Philip's Episcopal
Church-in-the-Highlands in Garrison.
   It was the third marriage for Fish, a 62-year-old Republican who
represents New York's 21st District. His previous two wives died.
   The new Mrs. Fish, a longtime Republican activist, directed the
1980 Reagan-Bush campaign in Connecticut. Her previous marriage
ended in divorce.
   The wedding was the second for a Hamilton Fish this year. Fish's
father, Hamilton Sr., the oldest living former member of Congress
who turned 100 last month, married his live-in housekeeper in
September.

   The Chicago Bears' Mike Ditka, who refused to be
sidelined earlier this season by a heart attack, is the most
charismatic coach in the National Football League, according to an
informal survey.
   ``He hurls gum, he's back a couple of weeks after a heart attack,
he says outrageous things, he mocks opposing fans and stadiums,''
said the New York Post's Steve Serby, one of 11 writers and
broadcasters surveyed by The Houston Post. ``What more do you want?''
   The Bears came out as the most charismatic team overall,
finishing first in three of the eight other categories in the
survey: stadium, unique characters and fans.
   Orange County Register columnist Mark Whicker said he would
``love to have a few drinks with the Bears _ and watch them fight.''
   The runners-up for the charisma title were San Francisco and
Washington. The Atlanta Falcons were the most woesome in the
charisma leagues, finishing last in seven categories, including the
worst uniforms. That vote wasn't unanimous, though. Washington Post
columnist Tony Kornheiser said Tampa Bay's uniforms are so bad,
their players ``look like clerks at Disney World.''

   Ants, ants and more ants are marching into
San Francisco Bay area homes, crawling up Christmas trees and making
themselves a nuisance in unprecedented numbers because of winter's
sudden onset.
   ``They give me the heebie-jeebies. Last night I came back to find
the bathtub black with ants,'' said Elizabeth Darling of Menlo Park.
   The ants, lured by early December's sun and mild temperatures,
weren't ready for the recent wet and cold weather. When the weather
changed, they went scurrying inside houses, said Joe Neitzel,
manager of Rose Exterminator Co.
   ``I can't remember when it's been this bad. We're being flooded
by calls, absolutely flooded,'' said Neitzel.
   The insects also were lured inside by Christmas trees, which drip
sap and are adorned with candy canes, both of which they find
irresistible, exterminators said.
   ``We spray ... everywhere, but it's only a Band-Aid solution.
They always come back,'' said Ms. Darling.
   Exterminators say the Argentine ants _ the Bay area's most common
variety _ are hard to get rid of. You may control them for a few
weeks, or even months, but the ants will come marching back.
   ``They were on this planet before us, and they'll definitely
outlive all of us,'' said James Pereira of Jackson Pest Control in
Novato. ``For people like me, that's what you call job security.''

   While others were at home nursing hangovers, the
Boston Harbor's icy waters were apparently just what the doctor
ordered for those who braved an annual New Year's Day swim.
   ``It was great!'' said Frances Tobin after her first winter swim.
``I said I was going to do it and I did it.''
   Forty-nine men and women took to the 29-degree water Sunday
morning to celebrate the L Street Brownies swimming club's 85th
anniversary.
   Before they ran down the beach into the water, Paul Levenson, the
club's president, apologized to onlookers for ``the mild weather
over which we have no control.'' It was 25 degrees.
   ``Not bad,'' said Al Binari, 55, as he left the water.
   Many of the swimmers are longtime members of the swimming club
headquartered at the L Street Bathhouse in south Boston. Some, like
George Graney, 75, Jerry Collins, 82, and Joe Alecks, 77, have been
swimming in the harbor year-round for decades.
   ``We do it for health reasons,'' said Graney. ``It's a
discipline. We do it every day, like joggers. Some days we have to
chop the ice away before we go in.''
   Peter Jurzynski, 37, scoffed at questions about the cleanliness
of Boston Harbor, which was an issue in last year's presidential
campaign.
   ``The yuppies go to the Caribbean; we have the crystal clear
waters of Boston Harbor,'' Jurzynski said.

   A 17-year-old Czechoslovakian hockey star who
wants to play in the National Hockey League was in the custody of
Canadian immigration officials when his teammates flew back home
Monday, tournament officials said.
   Peter Nedved had disappeared from his billet's residence early
Monday morning.
   ``He is currently in the hand of the immigration people,'' said
Ted Taylor, chairman of the Mac's Midget Hockey Tournament.
   Taylor said he doesn't know whether the 6-foot-2, 165-pound
forward has asked to stay in Canada.
   Nedved said in a weekend interview he wanted to return to Canada
as a visitor but would ``prefer to play here.'' He led the
tournament in scoring and his club, Litvinov, won the event.
   Spokesmen for the Immigration Department could not be reached,
and a spokesman for the External Affairs Department in Ottawa said
he had no information about Nedved.
   His father played on Czechoslovakia's national team alongside his
current coach Josef Beranek. An older brother also played before
being drafted into the army. That fate would await Peter in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``I should have a better chance to play for the national team,
every boy hopes to play for it,'' he said through an interpreter.
   His dream also includes the NHL.
   ``I don't plan that far ahead,'' he said with a smile. ``But I'll
be able to give you a better answer in five years.''

<TEXT>
   The number of police officers who died in the
line of duty in 1988 fell slightly to 153, the National Association
of Chiefs of Police said Sunday.
   The national total was 155 the year before.
   Eight women officers were included in the 1988 total; three women
officers died the year before.
   In 1988, California led the nation with a loss of 23 officers,
followed by 21 in Texas, where five died in Dallas alone, and 13 in
Florida.
   Robert Ferguson, president of the association, said many police
killers were on alcohol or drugs.
   Of the officers killed, 75 died of gun shot wounds, 58 in traffic
chases and accidents and the rest in plane crashes, stabbings,
drownings and other causes in the line of duty. Their average age
was 27.
   Gerald Arenberg, a spokesman for the association, said the 153
deaths included a broad range of law enforcement officials from
county sheriff deputies and local police to FBI and corrections
officers.
   The association has maintained an American Police Hall of Fame
listing all officers killed since 1960 when 55 died. In 1988, one
office died every 57 hours. On average, 157 are wounded or injured
every day.

<HEAD>Chief Justice Backs 51 Percent Pay Raise For Jurists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has strongly
endorsed a proposal to raise federal judges' salaries by 51 percent
to $135,000 a year.
   In his 1988 year-end report on the federal judiciary, Rehnquist
threw his weight behind a presidential commission's recommendation
of big pay raises for judges and about 2,000 other top federal
officials.
   Besides calling for the pay raise for trial judges, who now make
$89,500, the commission recommended boosting salaries of federal
appeals court judges from $95,000 to $140,000, a 47 percent jump; of
Supreme Court associate justices from $110,000 to $165,000, a 50
percent increase; and of the chief justice from $115,000 to
$175,000, a 52 percent increase.
   The recommendations are pending before President Reagan, who can
accept or modify the figures before sending his fiscal 1990 budget
to Congress on Jan. 9.
   Under the law, whatever pay increases the president endorses will
take effect 30 days later unless both the House and the Senate vote
to set them aside.
   ``Over the past two decades, the purchasing power of federal
judicial salaries has been seriously eroded by inflation,''
Rehnquist said.
   The buying power of an appeals court judge's salary has dropped
30 percent in the past 20 years, said the chief justice, adding,
``While the salary of the median household has increased
approximately 200 percent to keep pace with inflation since 1969,
the salaries of federal (trial) judges rose by little more than half
that amount.''
   Rehnquist cited a recent American Bar Foundation survey in which
30 percent of the federal judges who responded said they planned to
resign before retirement unless ``a significant increase in
compensation'' is provided.
   ``Dozens of federal judges have resigned from the bench during
the past 15 years, far more than ever before, due in large part to
financial reasons,'' Rehnquist said. ``And the problem appears to be
growing worse.''
   He said judicial salaries are directly linked to ``the quality of
American justice.''
   Comparing justice and medical care, Rehnquist said, ``We are
interested in receiving the best medical care available. If the
quality of medical treatment is poor, it is little consolation that
the cost may be low.''
   He added: ``The right to one's day in court is meaningless if the
judge who hears the case lacks the talent, experience and
temperament that will enable him to protect imperiled rights and to
render a fair decision.''

<HEAD>Unwanted Ferrets Find Shelter at Halfway House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deep in the basement of a suburban family home,
220 ferrets from all around the country frolic with toy balls, crawl
tubes and other ferret-phernalia in a makeshift halfway house for
the weasel-like creatures.
   The ferrets, unwanted by their owners or between homes, are the
pride and joy of Mary Van Dahm, who keeps 14 of her own upstairs.
   It started 18 months ago when a group of concerned Chicago-area
ferret-lovers formed the Greater Chicago Ferret Association. Mrs.
Van Dahm, the only founding officer with a basement, was asked to
run the association's shelter.
   She agreed.
   So when a Chicago woman recently asked her veterinarian what to
do with two ferrets her older son had outgrown, she was told to head
for the Van Dahm home.
   There, the ferrets live in cages until a new owner is found.
   ``We've gotten ferrets from all over the country,'' said Mrs. Van
Dahm, who prefers to keep the location of her home a secret so as
not to disturb the neighbors.
   Some were transported from New Jersey. A batch from Kentucky
arrived after animal-welfare officials seized 19 ferrets from a
Louisville-area woman who kept them in a cramped back-yard shed.
   Others come from disenchanted owners.
   ``It was not what I expected,'' one woman said, complaining that
her ferret did not like to sit in her lap to be stroked like a cat.
   ``They are more exotic than dogs or cats,'' Mrs. Van Dahm said.
``They are good for apartment dwellers because they are small and
can be kept in cages most of the time.
   ``They also have a bit of a wild look, and they don't provoke
allergies,'' she said.
   Of the nation's estimated 5 million pet ferrets, about 10,000
live in the Chicago area, said Janice Miller, president of the
Greater Chicago Ferret Association based in suburban Westchester.
   She said the association was formed because ``so much was
unknown'' about ferrets.
   ``We wanted to say, `Hey, these little guys aren't so bad.''
   Ferret lovers say the animal's reputation as a sometimes vicious
biter is unfounded.
   They are often mistakenly considered rodents but related to
weasels and mink. Like cats, they can be trained to use litter boxes
and will eat cat food.
   ``They have a strong will to survive,'' said Susan Brown, a
Westchester veterinarian and another association member. ``They are
easy to work with. I'm seldom bitten. In fact, I'm bitten far more
often by iguanas and birds.''

<HEAD>Hungary's Parliament No Longer Just A Rubber Stamp</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long ago, Parliament was a mere
rubber-stamp body that met for just four three-day sessions a year.
Now, outspoken deputies are openly demanding accountability from
Communist authorities.
   Live television coverage came to Parliament in September, and its
383 deputies have since begun edging the once-tame forum toward
democracy.
   Increasingly, deputies are bringing into the open formerly taboo
subjects such as defense spending. They challenge government and
Communist Party leaders to adhere to their avowed policy of openness
and disclose facts and figures.
   The changes, more rapid than political reforms occuring in
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union, have prompted rare admissions
from Hungary's Communist leadership about how parliamentary work was
controlled in the past.
   Matyas Szueroes, head of the party's parliamentary group, was
quoted by the government daily Magyar Hirlap as admitting that
Communist leaders once met with deputies to tell them how to vote.
   On live radio and television, constituents watch closely what one
Budapest man termed the ``great theater'' emanating from
Parliament's 19th century quarters on the Danube _ and are
exercising their own rights as a result.
   Deputy Karoly Eke says he has received a ``tremendous response''
from constituents since the broadcasts began. Just two days into
December's session, he had already received eight letters commenting
on his behavior in debates.
   Deputies now meet often, and debate into the night. In December,
Parliament held the year's unprecedented fifth session, the third in
as many months. The agenda was so long that speaker Istvan Stadinger
announced an unprecedented Christmas recess, with business to resume
Jan. 10.
   Mindful of November's exhausting session, when deputies worked 12
hours a day to get through the agenda, he also limited the length of
daily sessions in the high, gilded chamber.
   The non-Communists who make up 25 percent of the deputies then
took another unprecedented step, banding together in a formal group
intended as a counterweight to the long-established group of
Communist parliamentarians.
   Judit Benjamin, coordinator for the new group, told Magyar Hirlap
it aims to obtain the same information as Communist deputies.
   The non-Communists include one of the most outspoken deputies,
Zoltan Kiraly, a television journalist from southern Hungary who was
expelled from the Communist party earlier this year for his views.
   In October, Kiraly stunned the chamber when he and other deputies
requested a change in voting procedures on a controversial dam and
power plant project opposed by many Hungarians as damaging to the
environment.
   His request for a roll call vote sparked an acrimonious,
spontaneous debate that was eventually settled by compromise.
   Taking government and party leaders at their word that this
Soviet bloc country's Parliament should be more independent, Kiraly
and other deputies have also called for new elections prior to those
planned for 1990.
   The reformers say the current legislature _ with 75 percent
Communist deputies _ is incapable of making independent decisions.
   In some ways, the changes in Parliament mirror events in the
society at large.
   Within weeks this fall, Hungary went from debating whether a
multi-party system was feasible to discussing how soon it would come
about.
   The Communist leadership _ the country's ruling force _ has
appealed for patience, saying the package of political reforms it
outlined in November will take 18 to 24 months to introduce.
   Deputy Justice Minister Geza Kilenyi has said a new constitution
and a law on establishing political parties will be adopted before
the 1990 elections.
   Non-Communist candidates were allowed to contest and win seats in
the last elections in 1985.
   But debates that seemed fiery and controversial then now seem
dull.
   In December, for example, Budapest transport official Andras
Derzsi won only a simple majority when elected to head a new
``superministry'' for construction, transport and communications.
   Just 25 deputies voted against Derzsi _ the only candidate put
forward by Communist premier Miklos Nemeth. But 128 abstained in a
vote that was forced into a recount after one deputy complained the
115 tally for absentions was inaccurate.
   On the dam project vote in October, Szueroes admitted the
Communist leadership ``gave a firm orientation'' to party deputies
not to support a referendum or the organization of international
supervision.
   But he added swiftly in a December interview, ``This belongs to
the past.''

   Cleveland Yelder said he believes his
latest marriage will last forever. But then, he felt the same way
about the previous 16.
   ``I'm a very optimistic individual,'' said Yelder, who is nearly
two weeks into his latest marriage. His shortest marriage lasted two
weeks, his longest about five years.
   ``Some people say once you're married, that's it _ you go through
thick and thin,'' said Yelder, 46, sitting on his sofa and stroking
a long-haired cat. ``I like this cat, but if this cat scratches me,
I'll put it down.''
   Yelder's 48-year-old wife, Ethel, was unconcerned about his
previous marriages.
   ``I never heard of a man being married that many times,'' said
Mrs. Yelder, who married Yelder nearly two weeks ago. ``But it
didn't bother me a bit.''
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the highest
number of verified marriages in the monogamous world is 27.
   The Yelders live in a small, green house. Mrs. Yelder works as a
part-time nurse's assistant. Yelder, who has been unemployed since
heart surgery nearly 19 years ago, does the cooking.
   ``My wife is the breadwinner,'' he said Sunday night. ``I cook
and clean up. I'm the house man.''
   Yelder said he has no regrets about his previous marriages. He
said his divorces can show people that ``there's a way out of
marriage without violence. In all those marriages I've never killed
any one; I've never shot anyone.''
   ``A divorce can be mended, a broken heart can be mended, but once
you're 6 feet under, it's all over,'' he said. ``That's my
philosophy.''
   Probate courts list 16 of Yelder's marriages, starting at age 18
when he married a 15-year-old girl.
   He said he had only three children during his marriages, but has
fathered 11 illegitimate children.
   As for his new wife, ``If she said tonight, `Baby it's over, pack
your grip, make your trip,''' he would end the marriage, Yelder said.

<TEXT>
   Like prizefighters entering the ring,
Republican President Bush and the Democratic Congress will return to
the political arena this month, after two months of preparation,
with lots of smiles and a handshake.
   And as in any championship, high-stakes fight, it will be only a
matter of time before someone ends up with a bloodied nose _ the
tough, veteran Democrats who have controlled Congress for years, or
the Republican administration, which showed in last fall's campaign
that when the going got tough, it did, too.
   The Senate's new Democratic majority leader, George Mitchell of
Maine, already has asked the president-elect to approach Congress
with ``candor, consultation and trust.'' George Bush, who promised a
``kinder and gentler nation'' in his successful campaign, has
indicated he wants a closer relationship with Congress than that
enjoyed by his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Round One won't begin until after Bush is inaugurated on the West
Front of the Capitol on Jan. 20 and Congress returns the following
Monday, Jan. 23.
   Then, however brief, will come that Washington institution, the
political honeymoon.
   But unlike other Washington institutions, the honeymoon probably
won't last long.
   Democrats, firmly in control of both the House and Senate, are
anxiously awaiting the new president's budget recommendations,
starting with his ideas on how to save $32 billion to meet
deficit-reduction targets. Then, in May, Bush will have to ask
Congress to raise the national debt ceiling above its current $2.8
trillion figure.
   Democrats also will have their own agenda to push, perhaps a
renewed drive for a hike in the minimum wage, and other costly plans
to compete for tight budget dollars.
   And all these problems and programs come wrapped in Bush's
promise not to raise taxes.
   ``The deficit is a time bomb with a lighted fuse,'' Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., said in a recent interview. ``Bush's
tendered solution, his flexible freeze, is deja voodoo all over
again. The idea that we can grow our way out of this mess is
absolute nonsense.''
   The question is: How can a Republican president, elected by a
solid majority, deal with a Democratic Senate and House, also
elected by a solid majority?
   History, it seems, is against the president.
   ``Presidential success is mainly a function of the number of
seats in Congress held by the president's party,'' say writers
Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Thomas E.
Mann of the Brookings Institution and Michael J. Malbin of the House
Republican Conference, in their book, ``Vital Statistics on
Congress.''
   Using figures compiled by Congressional Quarterly, the
congressional observers uncovered some stark statistics.
   ``When one party controls both branches, success never drops
below 75 percent,'' they said. ``With divided government, presidents
average well below that level of success.''
   For example, when Lyndon Johnson swept into office in 1964, his
agenda, measured by public positions, was near 88 percent successful
in the Congress. Republican Gerald Ford, however, managed only a
58.2 percent ``victory'' rate in first full year in office.
   When Jimmy Carter marched into the White House in 1976 with his
party in control of both houses of Congress, he enjoyed, initially,
a 75 percent success rate in pushing his legislation.
   But that shouldn't be the case in 1989, with Bush vowing no new
taxes and Democrats almost daring him to run the country without
them.
   ``It isn't a question of economics, it's a question of
mathematics,'' says House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   ``I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Surely he must
have a plan,'' Wright says.
   Across the Capitol, Senate leader Mitchell also is offering to
reason with Bush.
   ``The larger objective is to provide to our people the greatest
possible individual liberty and economic opportunity,'' Mitchell
said. ``Our system, divided or not, can do that. But it can do it
only if there is a shared understanding of the need for candor,
consultation and trust.''
   ``Divided government cannot work in a polarized society, one in
which mistrust and deceit are widespread,'' Mitchell added.

<HEAD>27 Arrested Outside Pilgrim Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven people were arrested during a
demonstration to protest the Pilgrim nuclear plant's restart nearly
three years after it was closed for management and maintenance
problems.
   Those arrested, who were among more than 125 demonstrators, were
charged with trespassing and released, authorities said.
   ``It was a symbolic show of our frustration, of our determination
not to go away,'' said Donald Muirhead, a member of Citizens for
Responsible Energy.
   The protesters gathered at Duxbury High School on Saturday
morning and positioned themselves at the entrance to one of the
plant's two main gates.
   One protester, Priscilla Dean Hatton of West Yarmouth, said she
is a 12th-generation descendant of a Pilgrim born on the Mayflower.
   ``Why are they still making these wasteful products with no place
to dump them?'' she asked during the hour-long protest.
   On Friday, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission cleared the
way for low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor for up to 5
percent of its capacity.
   If the plant's restart schedule is followed, Pilgrim will provide
customers power when it hits 10 percent of capacity sometime next
month. It will reach full power in four months.
   Pilgrim had been shut since April 1986, when the NRC called the
reactor ``one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country.
   Boston Edison has spent about $200 million since the shutdown to
replace nearly all of the plant's top management, fix mechanical
problems and fight skepticism by the NRC and a growing anti-nuclear
movement among residents.
   But the state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the
plant from operating. State officials including Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis have said evacuation plans for those living near the plant
are inadequate despite utility company revisions. They also have
said the plant should not reopen until a new study of leukemia rates
of nearby residents is complete.

   Mayor Edward Koch says he doesn't intend to
change his outspoken manner to win re-election.
   ``Lots of people have said to me, `Listen, Ed, shut up for the
next six months and you'll get re-elected. Automatically.' ...
   ``I don't want to shut up,'' he said on WABC-TV's ``Eyewitness

   ``I do speak out occasionally too much,'' the mayor admitted.
``But I don't think so much too much. I believe that the people of

   Nicholas Calas, a poet and art critic whose work
focused on young artists and new art movements, has died at age 81.
   Calas died of heart failure Saturday in his Manhattan home.
   Calas contributed to Art Forum, Arts Magazine, Art International
and other journals.
   Many of his essays on the deeper cultural meanings of modern art
were collected in ``Art in the Age of Risk.''
   Calas collaborated with the anthropologist Margaret Mead on
``Primitive Heritage,'' a 1953 anthology of texts chosen for their
literary and humanist significance.
   Born to Greek parents in Switzerland, Calas was educated in
Greece, and lived in Paris during the 1930s, where he joined the
Surrealist movement. His poems were written in Greek and translated
into English for publication here.
   Calas came to the United States in 1940 and worked for the Office
of War Information during World War II. He became a U.S. citizen in
1945.
   Calas is survived by his wife, the former Elena von Hoershelman.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said all nations
must cooperate to track down whoever sabotaged Pan Am Flight 103 but
made clear she opposes an ``eye for an eye'' revenge attack that
could harm innocent people.
   In Washington, FBI Director William Sessions welcomed PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat's reported offer to help in identifying any
suspects. However, he said he still had no evidence linking a
terrorist group to the plastic explosives bomb that downed the New
York-bound Boeing 747.
   Mrs. Thatcher distanced herself Sunday from U.S. vows to punish
the culprits, saying ``I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for
a tooth is ever valid.''
   The Dec. 21 explosion and crash at Lockerbie, Scotland killed all
259 people on board. Another 11 people on the ground are missing and
presumed dead.
   ``The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation
of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought
to justice,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a television interview with
journalist David Frost.
   ``Revenge is never a good word to use because it can affect
innocent people,'' she added.
   The Sunday Express, a London newspaper, reported without
attribution that Arafat has vowed to dispatch an assassination squad
to hunt down and kill whoever is responsible.
   The paper said the Palestine Liberation Organization also sent a
message to President Reagan pledging ``a traitor's death'' for the
bomber if its operatives find him first.
   U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of
responsibility for the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused
mostly on Palestinian extremists opposed to Arafat's Middle East
peace initiative.
   Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that a report
overseen by President-elect Bush advocating possible military action
against terrorists ``ought to be giving some people sleepless
nights'' in the wake of the bombing. He did not elaborate.
   Bush vowed last week to ``seek hard and punish firmly,
decisively, those who did this, if you could ever find them.''
   Sessions, interviewed Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and NBC's ``Meet the Press'' said Arafat has ``a wealth
of information he can give us'' but said he opposes any attempt by
the PLO leader to retaliate by killing any suspects.
   ``We believe in the system of justice,'' the FBI director said.
``We hope those people are handled in the courts.''
   He added that contacts between the FBI and Arafat presumably
could be set up by the State Department. U.S. and PLO officials
opened a dialogue Dec. 17 after Arafat renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Sessions said he anticipated a lengthy investigation into the
crash.
   Mrs. Thatcher allowed Reagan to use U.S. bombers based in Britain
to bomb Libya on April 15, 1986, in retaliation for alleged Libyan
sponsorship of international terrorism. At least 100 people were
killed in the raid.
   She said Sunday that no country should grant the Pan Am bombers
safe haven or permit them to escape justice.
   ``I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not
try to track down terrorists, absolutely disgusted,'' she said.
   Searchers in Lockerbie gave up their traditional New Year's
celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage.
   Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing
local residents, was recovered, bringing the total found to 242.
   British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe
the bomb was smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by a
Lebanese-born passenger duped into carrying it. The West German
government said no evidence supports those reports.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 and switched
to a Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip to New
York.

<HEAD>Palestinian Held By Greece May Hold Clues To Pan Am Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian held by Greece and wanted by
the United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner may hold
clues to the group that blew up Flight 103 over Scotland last month.
   Whether he will ever tell his story in a U.S. court is an open
question.
   Greece's Supreme Court has twice delayed the extradition of
Mohammed Rashid, 39, who is thought by Western intelligence experts
to specialize in the planting of bombs aboard jetliners and to be a
senior operative in the May 15 Palestinian terrorist group.
   The Rashid case has taken on extra significance since the Dec. 21
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed all 259 people aboard the
Boeing 747 and about a dozen on the ground.
   U.S. and European officials are focusing on the May 15 group and
another extremist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, as possible suspects in the bombing.
   On Nov. 15, the Greek Supreme Court indefinitely postponed its
decision on extraditing Rashid, saying the United States had failed
to supply key documents in the case. The U.S. Embassy in Athens says
the requested documents have been turned over to the Greek
government.
   ``The requested papers have been sent. I guess they are being
moved from ministry to ministry,'' said an embassy representative,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Rashid is wanted in the United States on charges of planting a
bomb that exploded on a Pan Am jet as it flew from Tokyo to Hawaii
six years ago. A Japanese teenager was killed and 15 people were
hurt.
   Rashid was arrested at Athens airport on May 29 on a tip from
U.S. officials and was sentenced to seven months in jail for
entering Greece with a false passport.
   American officials have claimed Rashid and the May 15
organization _ which is named for the date the 1948 Arab-Israeli War
began _ also involved in the 1986 bombing of a TWA jetliner over
southern Greece that killed four Americans. That blast is not
mentioned in the extradition request.
   The Supreme Court has not said when it will issue its decision.
An extradition ruling has to be approved by Justice Minister
Vassilis Rotis before it can be carried out.
   The long delays in Rashid's case, combined with the rejection of
an Italian plea for extradition of another Palestinian, have given
rise to charges that Greece's governing Panhellenic Socialist
Movement is not committed to combating international terrorism.
   In early December, the government reneged on an extradition
agreement with Italy and put 27-year-old Abdel Osama Zomar on a
plane to Benghazi, Libya. Zomar was suspected of helping to organize
a September 1982 attack on Rome's main synagogue that killed a
2-year-old boy and left 37 people injured.
   The Palestinian had been imprisoned in Greece since November
1982, when he was arrested at the Greek-Turkish border driving a car
loaded with explosives.
   Justice Minister Rotis said he overturned a 1984 Supreme Court
extradition decision because Zomar was ``acting in the struggle for
the re-acquisition of his homeland.''
   Zomar had been identified as one of two Arabs jailed in Greece
with links to the extremist Palestinian faction Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, which is headed by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   The other is Omar Mabrouki, serving a 10-year jail term for
trying to shoot the Jordanian charge d'affairs in Athens in 1984.
   According to Greek and Western intelligence officials, Zomar's
detention may have triggered an attack on the City of Poros cruise
ship last July near Athens. Nine people were killed and 11 others
were injured in the assault.
   There have been no arrests in connection with the ship attack,
but one of the four men apparently involved in the machine-gun and
grenade assault has been identified by Greek police as Mohammed
Khadar, 40, the alleged operations officer for the Abu Nidal group.
   In the past, Greece has been criticized by its Western allies for
failing to crack down on suspected Palestinian terrorists operating
out of the country.
   Last year, the government was accused of allowing the Abu Nidal
group to operate a logistics office in Athens in return for a
promise by the group that it would not launch attacks in Greece. The
office was shut down in July 1987 after strong protests from
Greece's allies.
   Greece has repeatedly denied it is soft on terrorism.
   ``The government condemns all forms of terrorism and takes all
measures it deems necessary to fight it,'' government spokesman
Sotiris Kostopoulos said recently .

   The New Year rumbled into Peru with an earthquake, left thousands
homeless in Philippine fireworks accidents and claimed at least 51
lives in Brazil when a tour ship capsized.
   But 1989 brought a warm exchange of greetings from President
Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It ushered in a prayer for peace by the Roman Catholic leader in
war-torn El Salvador and a tentative olive branch from one Korea to
the other.
   In Afghanistan, the guns again roared, despite a New Year's
cease-fire resolution by the Soviet-backed regime. Rocket and
artillery barrages ended a brief truce between rival Shiite Moslem
militias in Lebanon.
   Traditions persisted.
   Thousands blew noisemakers in Times Square in New York to watch
1989 begin, and millions of Japanese went more sedately to temples
and shrines to pray for health and prosperity as the year of the
snake slithered in.
   In Italy, a preservation group found Sunday that the tower of
Pisa leaned a little more during 1988, tilting another .0508 inches
toward the ground. At that rate, it will take at least a century to
topple.
   In Havana, President Fidel Castro pledged ``socialism or death''
in a televised speech marking the 30th anniversary of his communist
revolution.
   Revelers on a jammed cruise ship in Rio de Janeiro listened to
samba music as they sailed for a fireworks display off Copacabana
Beach. The boat capsized, and authorities said at least 51 people
drowned.
   Survivors said few life jackets were accessible when the 100-foot
Bateau Mouche went down.
   Illegal fireworks ignited six fires in Manila on Sunday, leaving
thousands of people homeless, authorities said. Hospital officials
said seven people died from shootings and stabbings in New Year's
celebrations and brawls in Manila and Cebu.
   A check with doctors at 20 Manila hospitals showed 1,134 people
were injured, mostly by fireworks. President Corazon Aquino today
called for an end to the widely ignored ban on fireworks and ``some
kind of regulation and control to minimize'' accidents.
   Fire killed at least one person and destroyed 3,000 makeshift
houses in one slum neighborhood.
   At least 733 revelers in Italy were reported injured by
fireworks, none seriously. At least two deaths and dozens of
injuries were attributed to fireworks accidents in West Germany.
   An earthquake registering 5.5 on the Richter scale shook Peru,
but officials had no report of injuries. It came after the lights
went out in Lima for the second New Year's in a row in a power
blackout believed caused by leftist guerrillas.
   Children injured by the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia received
toys and clothes from around the world, Tass said. The Soviet news
agency said a boy from Spitak was asked what he wanted from Father
Frost, a bearded man who brings gifts on New Year's.
   ``Let him return my mother,'' 8-year-old Armen Kazaryan said from
his hospital bed.
   The new year elicited olive branches from leaders worldwide.
North Korean President Kim Il Sung, in a New Year's speech, invited
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo to a political conference in the
near future.
   Reagan and Gorbachev each sent New Year's messages to each
other's country.
   On Soviet television, Reagan said: ``Despite our disagreements,
we have been able to find some common ground.''
   In El Salvador, Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said urged an end
to a 10-year-old civil war in which he said 1,369 people died in
1988.
   ``This situation is a heart-breaking cry that summons us to keep
striving for peace with the weapons the gospel has put in our hands:
the weapons of light, of hope, of reconciliation, all the fruits of
love,'' he said.
   Pope John Paul II told 20,000 worshipers at New Year's Mass in
the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica that nations should give special
attention to minorities and urged kidnappers to release their
hostages.
   ``Let's hope that it is the year of peace, of justice, of growing
solidarity, of social solicitude for each one and for everybody,''
he said.
   In Afghanistan, the government had promised a New Year's Day
cease-fire. But guerrillas attacked government troops in two
villages Sunday in an eastern province and eight guerrillas were
killed, official Radio Kabul said.
   A bomb blast at a temple in India killed at least five Hindus as
they prayed on Sunday, 1989's first victims of continuing Sikh
militant violence in India's northwestern Punjab state.
   In Chile, officials said 11 teen-age inmates at a juvenile
detention center died in a fire that apparently started during a
jailbreak _ five minutes before the new year.

<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro, celebrating the 30th
anniversary of his revolution, rejected market-oriented economic
reforms and said that for Cuba, it is ``socialism or death.''
   Castro's remarks, in a televised speech Sunday night, seemed
aimed at the Soviet Union and other Communist countries that have
been abandoning strict adherence to Marxist doctrine.
   ``Today we say with more force than ever, socialism or death,
Marxism -Leninism or death,'' he said.
   Castro spoke to a large gathering from the balcony of the
municipal building in the eastern city of Santiago, where he had
proclaimed victory for his revolutionary struggle on Jan. 1, 1959.
   He did not refer directly to the Soviet Union in his remarks,
saying only that the contemporary situation has been marked by
``confusion.''
   In other speeches, Castro has been more explicit about his
rejection of the reform policies of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   He has said that Cuba will never embrace any reforms that ``reek
of capitalism.'' He also has acknowledged that the changes under
Gorbachev could cause ``difficulties'' for Cuba.
   The Cuban-Soviet friendship, although far from breaking up, seems
more tenuous now than it has been in decades.
   A key question is whether Soviet unhappiness with the way Cuba
has used economic aid from the Kremlin _ estimated at $5 billion
annually _ will lead to cutbacks. Castro has used the economic aid
to help build his country's schools and hospitals, the Soviets say,
and has neglected industrial development.
   Calling the revolution a ``beacon of light before the eyes of the
world'' Castro said Cuba has an enormous responsibility to Third
World countries to stick to its present hard-line Marxist-Leninist
course.
   Much of Castro's speech was devoted to reviewing the
revolutionary heritage of the people of Santiago and other cities in
eastern Cuba.
   Cuba officials said Castro is expected to deliver a policy
address on Wednesday.
   Despite Sunday's call for ideological steadfastness, Cuban policy
has undergone some drastic changes in the past year, including its
recent commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola by 1991.
   In Latin America, Castro has been aggressively pursuing interests
common to other countries in the area. The evolution of democracy in
Latin America, which has been welcomed by the Reagan administration,
has also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic
opportunities for Castro.
   The Cuban leader, once known for his efforts to promote violent
revolution, now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with
elected governments.
   Castro attended presidential inagurations in Ecuador and Mexico
in recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the
President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela next month.
   During Castro's visit to Mexico in late November, his first since
he was exiled there in the 1950s, he said he envisions the eventual
unity of Cuba and the rest of Latin America.
   ``One day, we will make one big giant,'' he said.

<HEAD>PTL Bankruptcy Judge Calls Bakker `Sawed-Off Runt'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge who presided over PTL's
bankruptcy proceedings said he received threats during the case, and
couldn't understand why Jim Bakker's followers ``were interested in
that little, sawed-off runt.''
   Rufus Reynolds, who retired Saturday at age 81 as a U.S.
bankruptcy judge, was guarded by U.S. marshals during the bankruptcy
proceedings as the FBI investigated the threats.
   ``They didn't say, `I'm going to kill you.' They said, `The
Lord's going to take you,''' Reynolds said.
   ``I didn't know Christians could be so critical. They would just
chew me out.''
   When a woman called the bankruptcy court in Columbia, S.C., to
find out if he was a Christian, ``I said, `You tell her I was when I
started this case, but now I plead the Fifth Amendment.'''
   Reynolds said television ministries are ``wide open'' for
mismanagement or corruption.
   ``I think Congress should pass a very strong act forcing the IRS
... to make them comply with an accounting,'' Reynolds said. ``We
have all kinds of laws protecting consumers. Religion is just
another consumer item, just the same as selling soap or washing
powders or aspirin.''
   Reynolds also said he was amazed at the response to the travails
that brought down Bakker's evangelistic empire.
   ``What puzzled me was why people were interested in that little,
sawed-off runt,'' Reynolds said.
   Bakker, who resigned from PTL in 1987, responded Sunday, saying:
``I am shocked to find Judge Reynolds so prejudiced toward us, and
to hear of him making fun of us and the PTL partners. ...
   ``He should not have tried the PTL case with these feelings
against us.''
   The ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws
in June 1987, three months after Bakker resigned from PTL.
   Two months ago, Reynolds ordered Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and
former aide David Taggart to repay PTL nearly $7.7 million in
benefits he found to be excessive. Last month, he approved the sale
of PTL assets to a Canadian businessman.
   Also last month, a federal grand jury indicted Bakker and former
top aide Richard Dortch on charges including fraud and conspiracy,
accusing them of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money for
their own benefit. Two other former PTL officials were indicted.
   Upon his retirement, Reynolds sand he left the PTL case
discouraged and somewhat cynical.
   From the beginning, Reynolds said he believed the only way to
save PTL was to keep it intact as a religious operation.
   ``It's a one-purpose center, a religious center _ a wonderful
idea,'' Reynolds said. ``If Bakker had employed reasonable business
principles, just on an average, they wouldn't owe a dime.''
   Reynolds said he was disappointed at the outcome of the case.
   ``When you've had 40,000 cases _ at least; when you've had
success in lots of them, the majority of them; when you take the one
most publicized, best known, and you make a failure, you can't feel
very good. It's that simple,'' Reynolds said.
   ``I'm going to take a bath and forget about it,'' Reynolds said.
``Someone asked me what was the best part of the whole case. I said,
`Getting out.'''

nearly a decade, police said.
   Shanta Chervu, 51, and her husband, Lakshmamrao, 58, both

   No motive for the slayings was determined, police said.
   Chervu was a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine;
his wife was a doctor at New Rochelle Hospital, police said.
   It was the first homicide in this New York City suburb of 6,000

<HEAD>Residents Clean Up from Burst Dike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of two states today cleaned up
homes damaged by a 12-foot wall of water that surged down the Virgin
River after an dike broke, forcing 1,500 people to evacuate and
closing Interstate 15.
   The 2,000-foot earthen dike 15 miles east of here gave way early
Sunday, flooding 50 to 60 homes and 100 apartment units in southwest
Utah and three homes in Littlefield, Ariz., authorities said. No
injuries were reported.
   The dam, which was less than 4 years old, had a history of
seepage, authorities said.
   When civil defense sirens signaled the evacuation shortly after
midnight Saturday, some of the 1,500 people in the flood's path
mistakenly thought they heralded the new year, officials said.
   Sherri Hansen of Bloomington and her husband had 20 minutes to
evacuate before the water hit. They sat on a hill watching through
binoculars.
   ``We sat there hoping and praying the river wouldn't get us,''
she said. ``The river didn't hit everyone. I don't know how it chose
us, but we really got nailed.''
   The water surged into the Hansens' home, filling the basement to
the ceiling and doing structural damage estimated at $40,000.
   In Littlefield, Lester C. Taylor, 27, his wife and five children
rescued many of their belongings before their adobe home was
submerged in 5 feet of water.
   ``The bad part was making sure my wife and the kids were OK,''
Taylor said. ``I was scared.''
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter flew to the region 300 miles south of
Salt Lake City, declared Washington County a disaster area in an
attempt to gain state and federal aid.
   At a news conference, Bangerter said the dike, built for $23.5
million in 1983, would be rebuilt. He said engineers would try to
determine the cause of the 300-foot-wide breach that opened.
   The dike had helped contain Quail Creek Reservoir. In all, 25,000
acre feet of water rushed through the breach and down the Virgin
River, but the surge was short-lived. By midday, it had slowed to a
trickle and power had been restored. Interstate 15, closed for 14
hours, was reopened after several bridges spanning the river were
declared safe. Two bridges in the St. George area were washed out,
closing part of Utah 9.
   Seepage at the dike dated to 1985, the year the reservoir was
filled, said Ronald Thompson, chairman of the Washington County
Water Conservancy District.
   Even before construction, state geologists had warned that the
presence of gypsum salt in the bedrock beneath the dike could cause
problems. Gypsum dissolves if exposed to water for prolonged periods.
   Previous leaks were repaired with little difficulty, Thompson
said.
   New seepage was discovered Saturday morning, and by evening what
had been small water loss had expanded to a major leak, said
Thompson. Heavy equipment was dispatched to reinforce the dike, but
by 10:30 p.m. it became apparent nothing could be done to prevent a
breach and the machinery was pulled out.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Eats Spiders, Snow to Survive Six Days Lost in Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old who got lost in the Cleveland
National Forest survived six days and bitter-cold nights by sleeping
in hollow logs and eating snow and spiders, his mother said.
   ``I don't know how he did it, being out there in 20 degrees and
below,'' Debbie Campbell said of her son, Andrew. ``He kept telling
himself he had more to do in life. He's a strong boy, and he's got a
will to live.''
   The boy was in fair condition early today at Sharp Memorial
Hospital, where he was being treated for minor frostbite and hunger,
hospital spokeswoman Pauline Renner said.
   ``His feet are swollen ... and very bruised,'' said Mrs. Campbell
of rural Guatay. ``He's lost about 20 pounds.''
   A father and son who had gone for a drive in the eastern San
Diego County backcountry found the missing teen-ager Friday, three
days after authorities abandoned their search despite protests by
his parents.
   Though the boy was wearing several pairs of socks, thermal
underwear, a flannel shirt and Army field jacket, nighttime
temperatures dipped into the 20s for several days while he was
missing.
   ``It's just a miracle that he was found alive out there as low as
the temperatures dropped,'' Mrs. Campbell said.
   The youth had become separated from a friend while returning home
Dec. 23 from an overnight fishing trip with a group of boys. He had
frostbitten feet and toes when he arrived at the hospital by
ambulance, Renner said.
   Mrs. Campbell said her son couldn't remember some things that
happened or the order in which events occurred. But he could recall
crawling, walking and jogging through the forest, eating snow and
spiders, sleeping in a hollow log and burying himself under a mound
of dirt to stay warm, she said.
   ``I asked him, `How can you eat spiders?' and he said, `I plucked
off the legs and ate them,''' Mrs. Campbell said.
   The boy was rescued by Bill Orsborn, 60, a retired firefighter
from La Mesa, and his son, Mark, 29.
   ``He was just off under some oak trees wandering around,'' Bill
Orsborn said. ``He was disoriented. He didn't know where he was, how
long he was out there or what day it was.''
   While driving him back to Guatay, about 60 miles east of downtown
San Diego, Campbell recalled how he ate handfuls of snow because
water in the ravines was foul, the elder Orsborn said.
   ``He mentioned that he had tried to eat some crawdads from a
stream, but that they made him sick,'' Orsborn said.
   Authorities had abandoned their search Tuesday after dogs
trailing his scent lost it near a roadside. Sheriff's officials said
they believed Campbell, who ran away from home once before, hitched
a ride out of the forest and was safe.
   ``I do feel angry that they just quit,'' Mrs. Campbell said. ``We
didn't give up, though. We had a search party ready to go.''
   A taped statement issued by the sheriff's department said
officials will review how the search for Campbell was conducted.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Readying Anti-Satellite Laser</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Miracl cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon will present the Bush administration
with a proposal to test a giant laser weapon modified so that it can
destroy enemy satellites, according to a published report.
   The proposal could spark controversy, because some members of
Congress and others oppose the development of anti-satellite
technology on the grounds that it could escalate the arms race.
   The laser, named Miracl, was designed to shoot down enemy
missiles and has been tested successfully at the White Sands Missile
Range in New Mexico. But now the Air Force is preparing to engage in
anti-satellite tests, which could occur as early as this year, The
New York Times reported Sunday.
   A duty officer at the Pentagon said Sunday there would be no
immediate comment on the report.
   To conduct the tests, the device must be modified so its beams
are steady enough to be focused on objects hundreds of miles away.
Experts say the modification will be relatively easy, but the laser
will have to be tested before anyone knows whether it can actually
destroy satellites. It will be tested on old U.S. satellites, the
paper said.
   The decision to upgrade the laser was made early last month by
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, and was reported in the Dec. 19
issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology.
   However, the military must receive White House approval before
the device is tested on satellites. President-elect Bush has given
no indication of his position on the issue.
   Gen. John Piotrowski, commander in chief of the United States
Space Command, has said that the Soviet Union has lasers capable of
destroying American satellites and that the United States' lack of
such equipment is a ``grave detriment to our national security.''
   Paul Stares, a research associate at the Brookings Institution,
countered that the planned laser could ``undermine the general
improvement in U.S. and Soviet relations, as well as progress in
arms control.''

<HEAD>Police: Man Threatened Children Over Outcome of Football Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who held police at bay for two hours and
threatened to shoot his children apparently did so because he was
upset the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Seattle Seahawks in a playoff
game, authorities said.
   The standoff began about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, when the children's
mother called to report her husband had barricaded himself with a
gun inside the family's suburban Cincinnati condominium, Union
Township police dispatcher John Kiskaden said.
   Officers arrived to find Doran Whitney, 30, formerly of Seattle,
threatening to shoot the children, ages 2 years and 3 months,
Kiskaden said. The dispatcher said he didn't know the children's
sexes.
   The children later were found unharmed and asleep in their beds.
   Police said Whitney surrendered peacefully about 2:30 a.m. and
was charged with aggravated burglary, aggravated menacing, domestic
violence, inducing panic and child endangering.
   He was being held Sunday in the Union Township jail, Kiskaden
said.
   Whitney became despondent after watching Saturday's National
Football League game in which Cincinnati defeated Seattle, 21-13,
police said.
   ``We get them every year,'' Kiskaden said. ``Last year, we had a
guy drive his car into a tree because the Bengals lost.''

<DATELINE>SALINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family of nine squeezes into an
apartment the size of a small studio. Dozens of farmworkers share a
single house. Others live in their cars or, worse, in bushes.
   Housing conditions in 1988 for farmworkers in the Salinas and
Pajaro valleys about 120 miles south of San Francisco were the worst
in decades, according to Monterey County officials.
   ``I would say this is probably the worst I've seen in farmworker
housing in Monterey County from the standpoint of ignoring the
health and welfare of the farmworker,'' said Walter Wong, Monterey
County director of environmental health.
   ``They're putting them in such extreme conditions _ such as
sleeping on top of pesticide sacks, sleeping in caves, sleeping in
the bushes, cooking in dirt in the ground, with no water, no
toilets,'' he said.
   Wong's agency is charged with licensing farm labor camps and
enforcing health codes. In 1988, he set a record by shutting down
five illegal camps, yet he concedes that for every camp he raided,
many others went unreported.
   ``The fact is, there's just going to be more of these extreme
substandard housing conditions unless there is more housing
developed for the farmworker,'' he said, adding that landlords and
labor contractors are scooping up 100 percent profits under current
conditions.
   Conditions are as primitive as any the ``harvest gypsies'' of the
Depression era endured, Wong said.
   Inspectors found workers and their families living in garages
that were divided only with fabric partitions. Workers at one camp
used a discarded bathtub for bathing, building a fire beneath it to
warm the water.
   Monterey County Supervisor Sam Karas toured some of the camps
last summer and discovered workers living in outhouses.
   ``It's really a disgrace,'' said Crescencio Padilla, a former
farmworker and longtime community activist. ``I saw the same
situation 20 years ago, and it's worse than it was then. We're going
backward.''
   Just over a decade ago, the Salinas Valley enjoyed a reputation
for good working and living conditions following a successful
organizing drive by the United Farm Workers union. Many growers
provided camps for workers.
   But conditions have changed since then, and observers cite
several pressures that have combined to create the farmworker
housing crisis:
   _ The federal amnesty program for illegal aliens attracted a
larger stream of workers and family members to an area where housing
costs are twice the national average. At least two workers competed
for every job last summer.
   Rents can quickly eat up a worker's monthly earnings. A
two-bedroom house in Salinas rents for about $800 a month, while the
minimum wage for farmworkers is $5 an hour and most workers take
home only about $200 to $250 a week.
   _ More families are choosing to live here year-round, filing for
unemployment benefits and hoping to find piecework during the
off-season.
   _ The number of licensed labor camps in the county has fallen
from more than 200 during the 1970s to 48 as growers and the
government have gotten out of the housing business.
   _ Growers are relying more on independent contractors for their
labor supply. The number of contractors in the county has more than
tripled in the last three years, according to some estimates, and
workers are told a labor contractor's responsibility is to find
jobs, not housing.

   Police searched today for the men who shot a
62-year-old mother of 14 to death ``like an animal'' through the
front door of her home.
   Doris Smith was shot early Sunday in the borough of Brooklyn
after she refused to let three or four men involved in a dispute
with a member of her family into her home, police and family members
said.
   ``Before she could turn around they cut loose,'' said her eldest
son, Steven, 38. ``She was gunned down like an animal. Everyone
panicked and started hollering, and the guys ran away.''
   Mrs. Smith was shot six times, and police recovered about 14
spent 9mm bullet casings, said Detective Sgt. Harold V. Paulson. No
one else was hit.
   Smith said four men had come looking for one of his brothers, who
had warned his mother not to tell anyone he was home. Smith said a
girlfriend was involved.
   The shooting was the result of a dispute between the gunmen and a
member of Mrs. Smith's family, but was not drug-related, said
Detective Sgt. Vincent Gerecitano.
   Paulson said that, as far as police knew, Mrs. Smith was ``an
innocent victim.''
   Mrs. Smith was a retired housekeeper who was widowed six years
ago. Smith said the family had expected to gather on New Year's Day
for an annual dinner of his mother's specialities _ roast chicken
and apple pie.
   ``She was a good mother,'' he said. ``She didn't drink or smoke
or even go out. She was glad that she lived another year. Now, we
have to make funeral arrangements ... It's not easy to start the new
year like this.''

<HEAD>Armenian Paper Prints Alleged Threat; Activist Calls It a Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official Armenian newspaper has printed a letter
purported to be from Armenian nationalists who threaten to wage
terrorist attacks with U.S.-made Stinger missiles if their leaders
are not freed from jail.
   Rafael Popoyan, an Armenian activist, called the letter a ``total
fabrication from beginning to end.'' He said it was another attempt
by Soviet officials to discredit people agitating for annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   Published by the local Communist Party daily Kommunist, the
letter demands the immediate release of members of the Karabakh
Committee, a banned group that has led an 11-month campaign for the
annexation of the enclave.
   If the committee's leaders are not freed, the unsigned document
says, ``we will have recourse to mass terror ... in our arsenals, we
have `Stingers,' provided by our friends.''
   A facsimile copy of the purported document was published in
Kommunist's Wednesday editions, which reached Moscow over the
weekend. Kommunist said the letter was received by law enforcement
officials, and labeled ``to be transmitted to the KGB.''
   The letter made no additional reference to the Stingers. Many of
the U.S.-made ground-to-air missiles have been shipped by the United
States to insurgents fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
   Popoyan said the letter may herald a further crackdown by Soviet
authorities on the Karabakh Committee, seven of whose members are
now in jail. The other four reportedly are in hiding to avoid arrest.
   ``Now that so many members of the committee have been arrested,
there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges,'' Popoyan said,
speaking by telephone from Yerevan, the Armenian capital. ``The
press is now closed to anyone from the committee.''
   Soviet authorities jailed Karabakh committee leaders after the
Dec. 7 earthquake in northwest Armenia, which killed 25,000 people.
   Authorities have accused committee members of sabotaging the
earthquake relief effort and whipping up ethnic tensions by
continuing to seek Karabakh's annexation by Armenia, a demand the
Kremlin has refused.
   Since February, at least 60 people have been killed in ethnic
rioting in mainly Christian Armenian and mainly Moslem Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Soviets Ban Exports Of Caviar And Other Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT to 1990. Picks up 5th, `It also ...'

<TEXT>
   In an apparent effort to help remedy severe
consumer shortages, the Soviet Union announced it would ban the
export of goods ranging from caviar to children's shoes.
   The official news agency Tass also said foreign visitors will be
limited to 100 rubles worth of souvenirs. That is $166 at the
official rate or $20-$25 at the black market rate.
   In the report Sunday, Tass said the restrictions specifically
applied to tourists.
   The radical changes in export and customs regulations take effect
Feb. 1 and last until the end of 1990. Tass said the Council of
Ministers approved the changes, but did not give a date for the
decision.
   It also did not explain the effect of the ruling on the Soviet
Union's attempts to earn scarce hard currency by selling the best
caviar, fur hats and coats, vodka and souvenirs in stores that
require dollars, pounds or other freely convertible money.
   Tass said it will be forbidden to export televisions,
refrigerators, freezers, washing and sewing machines, children's
clothing and shoes, coffee and caviar. Coffee is not grown in the
Soviet Union, and the import duty is up to $15 a pound.
   The announcement also said customs duties will climb to 20 to 100
percent of the retail price on vacuum cleaners, mixers,
coffee-grinders, irons, radios, cameras, automobile parts and other
items. It was not clear if this meant import or export duties.
   Export limits were imposed recently in Czechoslovakia after
complaints that tourists from neighboring Soviet bloc nations were
stripping its stores bare of consumer goods. The practice prompted a
Soviet economist, Marina Pavlova-Silvanskaya, to warn in Soviet
Culture on Sunday of an impending ``trade war'' among socialist
countries.
   Many Russians travel to Eastern Europe on shopping trips, and Ms.
Pavlova-Silvanskaya herself reminisced about trips to East Germany
and Poland. She said her boss insisted that ``the program had to
include a visit to some institution named for Lenin, lest the
Germans or Poles think the citizens of the nation of the Great
October Revolution are coming to shop.''
   None of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe has fully
convertible currencies, and they trade with each other based on
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting country's cost
of production, much less a profit.
   Ms. Pavlova-Silvanskaya noted that capitalist countries don't
find an invasion of shoppers a problem. On Nov. 7, a holiday in
Hungary, 100,000 Hungarians went to Austria and spent $42 million in
hard currency, she wrote.
   Rather than limit exports, the Austrians responded to the horde
of shoppers with advertisements in Hungarian newspapers, inviting
them back on their next day off, Ms. Pavlova-Silvanskaya noted.

<HEAD>Fog Covers Nation's Midsection; Travelers Stranded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fog blanketed the nation's midsection today, and freezing rain
and low visibility made travel treacherous in some areas.
   Dense fog on New Year's Day caused delays for thousands of
holiday travelers whose flights were canceled or stalled at airports
in Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis.
   ``It has been rather hectic,'' said George Small, manager of
passenger services for Braniff at Kansas City International Airport.
``We couldn't land because of the fog and had to divert nine Kansas
City-bound planes to Omaha (Neb.), several to Wichita (Kan.) and
Tulsa (Okla.) and one to Amarillo, Texas.''
   Fog was widespread today over the Ohio, middle Mississippi and
lower Missouri river valleys. Dense fog advisories were in effect in
Indiana and Kentucky.
   Fog also formed in Texas and Florida. Freezing drizzle was
reported in Michigan, New York state and Pennsylvania.
   In the West, dense fog formed in the Idaho and Utah.
   A cold front from Michigan to Oklahoma was expected to move
eastward and spread drier air across the Midwest, dissipating some
of the fog.
   Behind the cold front, cold arctic air spread across the northern
Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley. Temperatures dropped to
around 20 below zero in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota.
   Precipitation was sparse, with some light rain and drizzle in the
Pacific Northwest and snow in northern Idaho. Light snow also fell
over the upper Mississippi Valley and northern Great Lakes.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph at Big Timber, Mont., and Cody, Wyo., and
to 55 mph at Cut Bank, Mont.
   Today's forecast called for snow in much of New York state and
northern New England, a mixture of rain and snow over southern New
England, snow showers in Michigan, rain showers over much of
Arkansas, rain in western Washington state and Oregon, and snow from
the eastern sections of Washington and Oregon to northwest Montana.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits and teens in
the northern and eastern sections of the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, northern portions of the upper Great Lakes and
northern Maine; 20s and 30s in the northern and central Rockies, the
remainder of the northern Plains, the central Plains, the middle
Mississippi Valley, the remainder of the Great Lakes and northern
parts of the Ohio Valley to the remainder of New England; 60s in
Southern California and southern Arizona; 60s and 70s in Texas, the
lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast states, much of Florida and
the southern Atlantic Coast states; 80s in the southern Florida
Peninsula; and the 40s and 50s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 73 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   A man was shot to death, two others were wounded
and at least 52 people were arrested as an estimated 600,000
revelers left Times Square to begin another new year, police said.
   Crowds began assembling for the Times Square celebration at 6
p.m. Saturday. Police began blocking off streets around about 8:40
p.m.; by 10:30 p.m. people were packed in shoulder-to-shoulder.
   The revelers counted down the last few seconds before midnight
and watched a lighted ball slide down a pole, just as it has most
New Year's Eves since 1907. When 1989 arrived, the crowd let loose,
uncorking champagne, throwing confetti and even pitching a few
bottles.
   ``Last year was a bad year but next year, I mean this year, is
going to be cool,'' Paul Stahura, 26, of Lafayette, Ind., said just
minutes into the new year.
   Three men, who were with three friends, were shot early Sunday
after arguing with two men who apparently followed them from Times
Square, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Andrew Tringle, 19, was struck in the heart and died at Bellevue
Hospital, O'Donnel said.
   Christoper Betta, 18, was hit three times in the leg and once in
the neck, and Richard McCroy, 20, was wounded twice in the shoulder
and once in the neck, said Officer Hugh Barry. Both were in
satisfactory condition at Bellevue, said hospital administrator Don
Middendorf.
   No one was arrested in the shootings.
   Of the 52 arrests in and around Times Square, 18 were for
robbery, nine for grand larceny, one for criminal possession of a
weapon, 12 for disorderly conduct, six for assault, four for
reckless endangerment and two for menacing, O'Donnell said.
   Thirty-two Sanitation Department workers using eight mechanical
brooms, 18 sweepers and three garbage trucks spent the first eight
hours of the new year cleaning up the mess left by revelers, said
Sanitation Department spokesman Jim Hart.
   Garbage from past New Year's Eve celebrations has averaged about
25 tons a year; this year's debris won't be tallied up until
Tuesday, when the trucks are weighed, Hart said.

<HEAD>African Student Sentenced Without Trial To 15 Days</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An African student from Benin has been summarily
sentenced to 15 days in prison following a bloody Christmas Eve
brawl between Chinese and Africans in Nanking, an African diplomat
said today.
   It was the first report that a second African had been formally
arrested in connection with the brawl that left 11 Chinese and two
Africans injured.
   The diplomat, Benin's first secretary, Gobo Bio Mamah, also
quoted African students as saying that Chinese police stripped and
tortured two students from Benin when they attacked 140 mostly
African students at a guest house outside Nanking on Saturday.
   ``We have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the
cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods,'' Mamah said.
``They were doing this to make them talk. It appears to be torture.''
   The brawl at Nanking's Hehai University sparked five days of
anti-black protests and resulted in most of the city's African
students being forced by police to the guest house on Dec. 26.
   The students had wanted to flee the east-central city for
Beijing, but were stopped by police at Nanking's railway station.
   African students said about 400 Chinese police attacked them
Saturday in the guest house and removed about half of them,
returning some to their universities and sending others to another
hotel.
   The student witnesses said Chinese police beat and detained seven
or eight of their classmates. One witness said police charged the
students as loudspeakers broadcast platitudes about China's great
friendship with African nations.
   Another said he saw about seven police beating one student from
the Congo.
   Chinese news reports said only that a student from Ghana, Alex
Dzabaku Dosoo, had been arrested and three other students held for
questioning. No mention was made of a student from Benin.
   But Mamah said officials from the Public Security Department in
Beijing told him Sunday that student Ludovic Dossoumon had been
sentenced without trial to 15 days in prison as ``punishment.''
   Chinese authorities in Beijing refused to specify Dossoumon's
alleged crimes, he said.
   ``They told me the authorities in Nanking were the only ones who
could say anything,'' Mamah said. ``This action is unacceptable.''
   Chinese authorities at the Ministry of Public Security said they
were ``not clear'' about the arrests.
   At least 50 students from Hehai remained at the guest house
today, apparently because they still wanted to go to Beijing. The
rest apparently were at another hotel or at their universities.
Jiangsu province said today that they also were ``not clear'' about
the arrests and the exact whereabouts of the students, some of whom
were from Western Europe, Japan and South Asia.
   A Ghanian diplomat said China had broken an agreement to keep the
students at the guest house until a delegation representing nine
African countries returned to Nanking.
   The delegation came to Nanking last Tuesday for negotiations,
returned to Beijing and was planning to go again to Nanking later
this week.
   ``We don't know why they broke the agreement,'' said the
diplomat, Y.N. Ohene-Akrasi. ``But in light of the apparent police
attack this is the least of our concerns.''
   Chinese officials in Nanking have made it clear that no Chinese
will be punished for the clash and subsequent demonstrations during
which Chinese students destroyed property in African student
dormitories and shouted, ``Down with black devils!''
   In Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, a standoff continued
between 56 black Africans and Chinese at the Zhejiang Agricultural
College. The students have locked themselves in their dormitory
since Dec. 26 because they allege Chinese officials say they have
the deadly disease AIDS.
   College officials have denied the claim.
   The weeklong incidents in Nanking and in Hangzhou are the latest
in a series of incidents between Chinese and China's 1,500 African
students, brought here to demonstrate China's solidarity with the
Third World.
   Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese are
often openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is
very different from their own.

   Police blamed overcrowding for the
capsizing of a boat packed with revelers planning to watch a New
Year's Eve fireworks display off Copacabana Beach. At least 51
people died, and divers searched for other victims today.
   Authorities today said they would seek homicide charges against
those responsible for letting the jammed flat-bottomed craft _ built
to hold 100 people _ go out. They said it ignored Port Authority
orders not to sail in Saturday's choppy seas.
   Survivors said few life jackets were accessible when the 100-foot
Bateau Mouche went down Saturday night in 65 feet of water about a
mile from shore. One survivor, Plinco Donadio, said, ``I watched my
wife die because I couldn't untie one of the life preservers to save
her.''
   As army divers searched the Atlantic Ocean and Guanabara Bay off
Rio, confusion continued regarding how many people were on the
double-decked sightseeing boat Bateau Mouche. Estimates have ranged
from 130-150.
   The passenger list was on the sunken ship, said the company that
booked the cruise. Officials gave no estimate of survivors.
   ``We think the majority of the bodies already have been taken
out, but there always is the possibility of finding more,'' said Lt.
Pedro Paulo Albuquerque of the Fire Department's Maritime Group.
   Irineu Barroso, a police precinct chief, said he hoped to seek an
indictment for homicide. ``We are taking statements from survivors,
and they are telling us that something aboard that boat was not
right.''
   Cid Castor, a director of Itatitaia Turismo, which booked the
$220-per-person cruise, said his travel company had no
responsibility for the operation of the outing.
   ``We are simply ticket sellers,'' said Castor, who said the
passenger list was on the ship.
   The Sol e Mar restaurant, the boat's operator, referred calls to
a local lawyer, but no one answered the number given.
   ``We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it
was because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the
Fire Department's Maritime Group.
   The boat had a seven-piece samba band playing on board and tables
set for dinner when it capsized.
   Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said:
``The boat was turning and shifting. Then tables started flying,
glass started crashing, and the whole boat just turned over on its
side.''
   Luxury yachts and smaller boats heading to watch the midnight
pyrotechnics display fished survivors from the stormy seas near the
base of Sugar Loaf mountain.
   ``We rescued about 30 people from the sea,'' said Valentino
Ribeiro, captain of one vessel, the Casablanca. ``There were people
everywhere screaming for help. We took those we could and left the
bodies. We couldn't take on any more.''
   Officials said at least 51 people died. They had no reports of
Americans on board.
   Brazil's largest private network, Globo TV, quoted maritime
specialists saying the boat was not made to withstand Saturday
night's choppy sea waters.
   But the Sol e Mar's spokesman, Gustavo Blanco, said Sunday that
the boat was ``in perfect mechanical shape.''
   According to Denmark's Hans Nihaj, who was on the boat with his
wife, daughter and five fellow countrymen _ all of whom swam to
safety _ there were no adequate life jackets or preservers on board.
   ``We made it because we were strong and could swim,'' Nihaj told
The Associated Press. ``If you weren't in good shape, you simply
died.''
   Donadio, a photographer who lost his wife and two other
relatives, said the life preservers were ``tied onto the railings in
the lower part of the boat.''
   The vessel was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to
return to port, but it ignored the order, Barroso said.
   Survivors confirmed this account.
   The cruise boat's captain, Camilo da Costa, ``didn't want to go
out,'' said his brother-in-law, Paulo Soares.
   ``He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the sea was too
rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he didn't
sail.''
   Da Costa died.

   A carload of gang members shouted at a
16-year-old youth, then sprayed him with bullets, in a holiday
weekend of shootings that left two dead and capped a record year of
gang violence.
   The death of Adam Lopez, 16, was among more than 330 attributed
to gang violence in the county in 1988. In 1987, 284 died.
   At 9 p.m. Friday, about 15 minutes before Lopez was gunned down,
21-year-old Raymon Smith was killed in a drive-by attack in the same
gang-dominated area of south-central Los Angeles.
   The attackers in the two shootings escaped without being
identified, police said.
   In addition to gang-related shootings over the holiday weekend,
New Year's revelers marked Saturday night with a barrage of gunfire
into the air that left one dead and 8,700 homes without power,
police said.

   The imperial family today canceled a traditional
post-New Year's appearance for the first time in 21 years, citing
Emperor Hirohito's grave condition.
   But the family kept the gates to the palace open, allowing at
least 19,000 people to walk through and sign registries by early
afternoon. The visitors included 90-year-old Kenji Muramatsu, who
wore a traditional kimono and carried a tattered Japanese flag from
World War II.
   ``I came to pray for the emperor,'' he said. ``I want him to get
well and live as long as possible.''
   A 23-year-old college student, who visited the palace with her
boyfriend, said ``I'm a big fan of the emperor ... to me he's just
an old man who is always smiling.''
   Hirohito and his immediate family customarily appear on Jan. 2
behind bulletproof glass on a palace balcony in the East Garden
before thousands of well-wishers waving paper red-and-white Japanese
flags.
   The emperor's condition was stable today, with his blood pressure
at 98 over 42, said a palace official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. A normal reading is about 120 over 80.
   The 87-year-old monarch, who has been bedridden since a serious
hemorrhage Sept. 19, suffered internal bleeding early today and
received another transfusion, palace sources said. Hirohito has
received 64.4 pints of blood since he fell ill.
   On Sunday, Hirohito received 2.1 pints of blood after a
``substantial'' hemorrhage, palace officials said.
   The imperial family's New Year appearance was last canceled
between 1964 and 1968 for a major renovation of the palace.
   The custom, which began in 1948, was also called off in 1952
because of the death of Empress Taimyo, Hirohito's mother.
   Takeshi Nonogaki traveled 300 miles from Aichi prefecture in
east-central Japan with his 16-year-old son Shinichi to see the
registry.
   ``My son said he would like to see inside the palace and I
thought it was important to bring him here, especially now that the
emperor is gravely ill,'' said Nonogaki, 48, adding that he wanted
his son to learn respect and adoration.
   ``I believe respecting the head of your country leads to
respecting your family and your company on individual level,'' he
said.

   Soldiers today demolished the homes of two
Palestinians suspected of firebomb attacks and of distributing
leaflets urging resistance to Israeli rule in the occupied lands,
the army said.
   Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in
towns and refugee camps in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab news
reports and hospital officials said. The army said it was checking
the reports.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas
to disperse Arab stone-throwers after a woman and a policeman were
injured by rocks, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
   The destruction of the homes in the Balata refugee camp in the
occupied West Bank came a day after Israel renewed a crackdown on
activists by deporting 13 Palestinians to Lebanon. It was the
largest number deported on a single day in the nearly 13-month-old
Palestinian uprising.
   Palestinians in Gaza City today shut their businesses and public
transportation to protest the expulsions. Six deportees were from
the Gaza Strip.
   The strike followed the lifting of a 24-hour curfew in the Gaza
Strip. Many violated the curfew Sunday, which Arabs celebrated as
the 24th anniversary of the first attack in Israel by the PLO's
mainstream Fatah movement.
   In the West Bank, Palestinians set off firecrackers and staged
parades in villages Sunday, dancing and waving pictures of PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, head of the Fatah wing.
   The suspects from Balata whose homes were demolished are among
nine in the camp detained recently who are active with the Moslem
fundamentalist movement ``Hamas,'' or ``Zeal,'' an army communique
said.
   The statement did not identify the suspects, but said the group
was suspected of involvement in at least two firebombings, one on an
army patrol Sept. 26 and the other on a passenger bus Oct. 18.
   The activists also were accused of participating in riots and
distributing Hamas leaflets, the statement said. The organization is
one of the underground groups active in the rebellion against Israel.
   Arab news reports said the houses were home to families of 10 and
nine people each, and that they were bulldozed without letting
families take out belongings such as furniture.
   At least 345 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died since the
rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Israel has ruled the West Bank and
Gaza Strip since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The army accused the 13 Palestinians deported on Sunday of being
senior leaders of the uprising. Most of them also were members of
Palestinian guerrilla groups, the army contended.
   The most prominent deportee was Abdallah Samhadaneh, 38, a
lecturer at the Islamic University in Gaza. The military accused him
of organizing a network of underground popular committees.
   Since the Palestinian revolt began, Israel has deported 49
Palestinians and another 12 suspected uprising leaders have received
deportation orders, a military spokesman said.
   The United States and other countries have criticized Israel for
deporting suspected Palestinian activists.
   In another development, Finance Minister Shimon Peres unveiled a
sweeping economic recovery plan aimed at halving inflation, now at
about 20 percent, by cutting $600 million from the nation's budget.
A quarter of the cuts would come from defense spending.
   Peres, who announced the plan Sunday, said his long-range aim was
to reduce unemployment, which he said hit 7 percent this year.

   Two peace activists attacked two
Dutch air force jets with a sledgehammer, damaging the planes, a
Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed today.
   The activists, one a former army chaplain, remained in military
police custody on this southern Dutch air force base where the two
NF-5 fighter-bombers were waiting to be flown to Turkey, the planes'
next owner.
   The suspects were not identified in line with Dutch judicial
practice.
   However, the Defense Ministry spokesman said one of them had been
a Roman Catholic chaplain in the Dutch army before he quit in the
early 1980s to protest deployment by NATO of nuclear cruise missiles
in the Netherlands.
   Woensdrecht air force base, the missiles' planned deployment
site, was the scene of numerous anti-nuclear demonstrations before
last year's U.S.-Soviet pact eliminating all medium-range nuclear
missiles from both Eastern and Western Europe prevented cruise
deployment here.
   Early Sunday, the two men gained entry to the base by cutting a
hole in its perimeter fence, according to the spokesman, who spoke
in exchange for anonymity in line with ministry practice.
   Armed with a sledgehammer and an ax, they did an estimated 50,000
guilders ($25,000) damage before they were caught by a military
police patrol, according to the spokesman.
   Dutch air force NF-5s, which have been replaced by supersonic
F-16s, are scheduled for delivery to Turkey later this year. In
November, activists daubed eight of them with paint here in a
protest against alleged human rights abuses in Turkey.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias today fought
street battles for a third day in Beirut's southern slums and
exchanged artillery and mortar fire near Israel's self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon, police said.
   Five people were killed and 21 wounded in south Beirut, where
gunmen of the mainstream Amal militia and the fundamentalist
Hezbollah attacked each other with grenades and mortar barrages,
police said.
   Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 12 killed and 29
wounded since a new round of fighting for dominance of Lebanon's
million Shiites began Saturday.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, is backed by Syria. Hezbollah, or Party of
God, is supported by Iran. Both militias accused each other of
starting the clashes.
   Several Beirut radio stations said Syria was considering a
redeployment of its 4,500 peacekeeping troops in the slums to
``improve their performance and prevent further fighting.''
   The fighting was the first serious clash between Amal and
Hezbollah since November, when the two sides fought for six days in
west and south Beirut. Forty people were killed and 87 wounded.
   In May, nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in a
three-week battle between Amal and Hezbollah. It was then that Syria
sent its troops into the 16-square-mile region comprised mainly of
cement shanties.
   Police said thousands of panicked residents have been huddled in
basements and bomb shelters in the embattled districts of Shiyah,
Ghobeiri, Haret Hreik and Mesharafiyeh since New Year's eve.
   ``I hope 1989 will wipe out all these criminals and let civilized
human beings live and breathe safely,'' said Umm Mohammed, a
housewife reached by telephone in Haret Hreik.
   In south Lebanon, police said Amal and Hezbollah gunners poured
mortar fire and Katyusha rockets on each other's strongholds in
Iklim el-Tuffah, or Apple Province.
   The region stretches from the port of Sidon to the security zone,
which Israel established in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its
troops following a three-year invasion.
   A Hezbollah communique charged that Amal's forces launched a
two-pronged, pre-dawn assault from strongholds southeast of Sidon on
Hezbollah's positions in and around Mount Safi, just north of the
security zone.
   ``With God's help, our fighters stood fast and repulsed the
assailants after two hours of heavy fighting,'' the communique said.
   The attackers then ``clamped a siege on the area, preventing food
and water supplies from going in,'' it said.
   The communique said Hezbollah's fighters in the area were all
from the Islamic Resistance Front, a loose coalition of Moslem
factions locked in guerrilla warfare against Israeli forces in the
security zone.
   A terse Amal communique accused Hezbollah of firing first.
   Police had no immediate casualty report from the south Lebanon
clash, the first in the area since a four-day battle in April that
left 62 people killed and 150 wounded.

   Scandinavian Airlines stepped up
security in Sweden and abroad after receiving a terrorist threat,
officials said today.
   SAS, the flag carrier of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, received the
warning Sunday from Hungarian police through Interpol in Paris, said
SAS spokesman John Herbert.
   He did not specify the nature of the threat, but said it was
against SAS planes and its other interests, including affiliated
hotels.
   A security alert was transmitted to about 90 international
airports used by SAS aircraft, Herbert said. ``We are acting on the
advice of police,'' he said without elaborating.
   The Stockholm daily Svenska Dagbladet said the warning came from
an Iranian Shiite Moslem group, but Herbert said police gave no
indication of the origin.
   ``We only know it was picked up in Hungary,'' he said.
   The Aftonbladet newspaper reported Friday that it received by
mail an anonymous bomb threat against SAS domestic flights in Sweden
in connection with the visit last month to Stockholm of Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   SAS passengers at Arlanda International Airport north of
Stockholm were asked to identify their luggage on the tarmac Sunday,
delaying flights for up to 30 minutes.
   Security at Arlanda already has been increased for U.S. airlines
following the Dec. 21 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in
which at least 270 people died.

   Lebanese militia leader Antoine Lahd was
released from a hospital in northern Israel today, nearly two months
after being shot twice in an assassination attempt, a hospital
spokesman said.
   The 61-year-old Lahd will spend the next few days resting in a
hotel in Haifa before returning to Lebanon, said Dr. Albert
Setinger, deputy director of Rambam hospital in Haifa, where Lahd
was treated.
   Lahd heads the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed 2,000-man
militia that operates in Israel's self-declared security zone in
southern Lebanon. Israel established the zone in 1985 when it
withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon after a three-year invasion.
   Lahd was shot in the upper arm and chest by his wife's
21-year-old dance instructor on Nov. 7 while he was drinking coffee
with her at his home in Marjayoun. The Lebanese National Resistance
Front, a coalition of Syrian-backed leftist groups, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   The dance instructor is being held at the militia's Khiam prison
in the security zone pending trial.
   One of Lahd's major blood vessels was severed by the bullets, and
he received blood transfusions and was on a respirator during much
of his hospitalization.
   Doctors originally predicted a two-week recovery but said Lahd's
situation became more complicated because of the large amounts of
blood loss.

<HEAD>Libya Claims U.S. Allegations Are A Pretext To Kill Gadhafi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Libyan news agency claimed today the
United States is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant in
Libya as a pretext to launch an attack and kill Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   The JANA news agency, monitored in Rome, referred to a report
Sunday in the United Arab Emirates daily Al-Khaleej that quoted
unidentified Arab sources as saying the Americans planned to send a
``hit squad'' to kill the Libyan leader during an attack.
   Al-Khaleej claimed an American task force had trained in Italy,
Spain and aboard U.S. warships in the Mediterranean for the attack,
which it said could come this month. The newspaper said the strike
would include bombing attacks on the nuclear research center at
Tajura and the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabtah.
   The newspaper report had no dateline but appeared to originate in
the Libyan capital, Tripoli. JANA gave the report unusual attention,
not only carrying a story but also sending it to foreign news
agencies by telex and telefax.
   ``The uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and exposes
clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical campaign''
against Libya, JANA said.
   It said the report proves the U.S. allegations about a chemical
weapons plant ``were excuses and pretexts for an operation of
premeditated individual murder.''
   The U.S. government has contended Libya is on the verge of
producing chemical weapons at the plant near Rabtah, a city about 50
miles southwest of Tripoli. Libya insists the facility is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   West German officials are investigating U.S. charges that a West
German company played a key role in helping Libya build the plant.
   President Reagan has said the United States had discussed with
other NATO countries the possibility of military action against the
plant.
   ``We are confident that the public opinion after knowing these
facts will stand on our side...,'' said JANA, referring to the
Al-Khaleej report.
   JANA repeatedly has carried denials by Gadhafi's government that
the plant produces chemical weapons as well as statements of Libya's
commitment to treaties to ban such weapons.
   On Christmas Eve, Gadhafi offered to return the body of an
American pilot killed in the 1986 U.S. bombing raids on Libya. He
also called for the release of two French children held hostage in
Lebanon. They were later freed.
   JANA has carried frequent stories on ``massive demonstrations''
in Libyan cities to denounce the U.S. threats and show support for
the government.
   On Monday, it said a group it called the International League in
Defense of the Mediterranean condemned the sailing of a new U.S.
13-ship carrier battle group for the Mediterranean.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman in Washington called the sailing a routine
deployment of the 6th Fleet. A Navy spokesman in Italy said the new
group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the
Mediterranean.

<HEAD>Israel Criticized Over Deportations, Foreign Ministers to Meet in
Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Cabinet minister said today that
Israel's latest deportation of Palestinians violates human rights,
obstructs Middle East peace efforts and runs counter to the Jewish
state's own interests.
   The criticism coincided with the disclosure that the Egyptian and
Israeli foreign ministers will meet in Paris on Sunday. Egypt is the
only Arab state that has diplomatic relations with Israel.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, took Israel
to task in a statement to reporters on the expulsion of 13
Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza to
Lebanon. The action Sunday brought to 49 the number of Palestinians
deported since an uprising against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8,
1987.
   Egyptian leaders condemned earlier deportations in terms similar
to those used today by Ghali.
   As Ghali spoke, Foreign Ministry sources said Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel-Meguid will meet in Paris next Sunday with his Israeli
counterpart, Moshe Arens.
   It will be their first meeting since Arens, a member of the
right-wing Likud bloc, took the foreign affairs portfolio in the
Cabinet formed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir last month.
   The last meeting at this level took place about three months ago
in New York between Abdel-Meguid and Shimon Peres, then Israel's
foreign minister. Peres, of the center-left Labor Party, is now
finance minister.
   Arens and Abdel-Meguid will meet during a Jan. 7-11 international
conference on the prevention of chemical weapons that both ministers
are attending in Paris.
   Ghali said Egypt viewed the deportations as ``violations of the
human rights of Palestinians and a negative stance that obstructs
the (Arab-Israeli) peace process.''
   He said the expulsions also ``encourage extremist tendencies
among the various parties and conflict with the interests of the
Israeli people in taking advantage of available opportunities and a
new climate for peace efforts.''
   This apparently referred to last month's peace strategy announced
by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Arafat publicly recognized Israel, renounced what he said was all
forms of terrorism and offered to hold peace talks with Israel
within the framework of an international conference.
   Arafat's statements led the United States to open a dialogue with
the PLO.

<HEAD>State Department Official, House Panel Member Disagree on Cuba</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Torricelli in graf 7, Torricelli said.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official and a member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee disagreed today on whether the
United States needs a new policy on Cuba.
   ``I don't think we need a new policy. I think the policy's
working,'' said Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs.
   ``It's a policy of putting pressure on (Cuban President Fidel)
Castro to isolate him, to make his economic situation more
difficult, to try to force him out of Angola, to try to force him to
make human rights concessions. That's what's working,'' Abrams said
on the ABC-TV program ``Good Morning America.''
   But Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., interviewed on the same
program, said ``to have an American policy that is basically based
on the idea that we wish the revolution didn't happen, we wish that
he'd go away, is really foolish going into a fourth decade.''
   Torricelli said he thinks a policy is needed that would require
some reforms from Castro in exchange for an improved relationship
with the United States, a policy that ``puts a real price on a new
relationship, a real price on his policies in Nicaragua and Angola
and human rights at home. We may find that that gets some results.''
   Castro, celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, said
in a televised speech Sunday night that it is ``socialism or death''
for Cuba, as he rejected market-oriented economic reforms. His
remarks seemed aimed at the Soviet Union and other Communist
countries that have been abandoning strict adherence to Marxist
doctrine.
   Torricelli said that ``despite the rhetoric, I think there's some
reason to believe there can be change.''
   He said ``the difficulty here is that he doesn't understand what
necessarily is required for better relations. And what
(President-elect) Bush should be doing is spelling that out exactly.
We want some change of policy in Nicaragua, we want him to continue
to adhere to not aiding violent revolution in Latin America, we want
the Angolan accords fulfilled, we want his promises kept on
immigration, we want human rights changes in Cuba.''
   Abrams said that if Castro wants a changed relationship with the
United States, ``probably his first real step has got to be
implementing'' the Angola agreement ``and taking the troops out.''
   But, Abrams said, he thinks Castro is ``a first generation
communist leader...who is unable to countenance a reduction in his
personal power, real democracy, real change. It will take the next
generation coming, I think, for there to be real change in Cuba.''

<TEXT>
   Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker returned to
television today after a two-year absence with a show broadcast from
the living room of their borrowed home to a handful of stations
around the country.
   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''
Mrs. Bakker said as the show began. Sporting her trademark heavy eye
makeup, she began crying two minutes into the hourlong show.
   Bakker, the founder of PTL, left his television ministry in March
1987 in the midst of a sex and money scandal. He and his wife had
not appeared on a television pulpit since January 1987.
   Today, Bakker told viewers and his supporters crowded into the
house that his last television appearance was to break ground for
the Crystal Palace Church at Heritage USA, the home of PTL.
   ``I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' Bakker said. ``I
think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built.
... I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and Tammy
Bakker.'''
   Bakker said he believes that church, which was designed to hold
30,000 people, still will be built.
   But since the Bakkers left the PTL organization, it has filed for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws, and last month a
bankruptcy judge ordered its assets sold to a Canadian businessman.
Also last month, Bakker and a former top aide were indicted on
charges including fraud and conspiracy.
   Bakker thanked a supporter who had donated the money to put him
back on the air, and said the program would be carried by more
stations next month. It is scheduled to be shown Monday through
Friday.
   ``We bought time,'' Mrs. Bakker said. ``We had a certain amount
of money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot of
money, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.''
   Bakker did not make any direct appeal for donations, in marked
contrast to his old ```PTL Club'' show. He did give an address in
Fort Mill, S.C., ``if you want to write us.''
   Callers to a telephone number _ not toll-free _ shown throughout
the show were asked to give their name, phone number and address but
got no appeal for funds. The callers were invited to ask the Bakkers
to pray for them.
   Bakker, who turned 49 today, said the program was being carried
by television stations in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Albany, N.Y.;
Akron and Canton, Ohio; Asheville, N.C.; and Louisiana.
   In Amsterdam, N.Y., near Albany, WOCD general manager Fred
Wuenschel said the Bakkers paid ``the usual rate per hour'' to be on
the station. He wouldn't say what that was.
   The station has a 30-day contract for the show. He said he will
keep the show on ``as long as they keep paying.''
   The only mention of Bakker's legal troubles came when the guest
on the show, former PTL songwriter Mike Murdock, said he wrote one
song in a lawyer's office. Murdock said he knew Bakker ``didn't know
anything about lawyers.''
   ``Oh no-o-o-o,'' Bakker said with a chuckle.
   Bakker said he had a message for ``hurting people'' and that
viewers should keep their faith no matter what crisis they were
facing.
   ``If Jim and Tammy can survive their holocaust of the last two
years, then you can make it,'' Bakker said.

   Chef Albert Grabham cooked the most
expensive dish of his career New Year's Day: his restaurant's
profits from the night before.
   Grabham hid the money collected on Saturday night in an oven, but
forgot about it the next day when he turned on the oven to cook
lunch.
   The smell of burning pound notes wafted through the New House
Hotel in west Wales before Grabham realized what he had done. By the
time he reached the oven, more than $360 had gone up in smoke.
   ``The notes had burned to a cinder, the box had melted and the
coins were stuck fast,'' he said Monday.
   ``I could not face walking up four flights of stairs to put the
money away properly. We had had a busy night and I was whacked.''
   ``Now I am having to put up with jokes from customers, like hot
money and crisp bread,'' he said. ``It serves me right I suppose.''
   Grabham said he hopes his bank will understand, and accept any
identifiable remains.
   Hotel owner Hilary Ward said: ``There was such a mess we cannot
be sure how much money was in there in the first place.''

<HEAD>Home of Cricket Considering Female Pavilion Admission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The home of cricket is taking the first step toward
opening its most sacred doors to women.
   In a newsletter to its 18,000 members, the Marylebone Cricket
Club asked the question unheard in its 202-year history: ``Should
MCC consider the election of lady members?''
   Marylebone is one of just two men-only clubs left in top-flight
English cricket.
   Women can watch cricket at Lord's, the club's headquarters, but
not from the Pavilion, which is limited to members only. Not even
women accompanying male members are allowed.
   The newsletter noted that England's national women's cricket team
even had played matches at Lord's and that the Pavilion and
club-like Long Room had been opened to women on those occasions.
   ``As we approach the 21st centruy, should this `progress' be
taken further?'' the newsletter asked.
   It also sought to reassure diehard supporters of the men-only
rules that no women members were likely anytime soon, not with a
waiting list of about 8,000.
   ``With the current waiting list, none would be elected for some
time but should we allow ladies to watch some cricket from the
Pavilion, either as members or as guests of members?'' the
newsletter asked.
   Last month, the Lancashire Cricket Club in Manchester voted to
remain all-male, defeating a proposal to allow women members.

<HEAD>Medvedev's Works, Except Criticism of Solzhenitsyn, to Be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unofficial historian says he would like to
dispute some of the writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn but the work
of the Nobel Prize-winning author of ``The Gulag Archipelago''
remains off-limits in the Soviet Union.
   In the interview published Sunday in the newspaper Moscow Young
Communist, Roy Medvedev did not detail his criticism of
Solzhenitsyn. Both writers have examined the Russian Revolution and
the mass repression of Josef Stalin. Solzhenitzyn's three-volume
``Gulag'' is a detailed chronicle of Stalin's labor camps.
   Medvedev, who is widely known abroad but has seen his own
articles published in the Soviet Union only in the past year, said
negotiations are under way to publish all or parts of many of his
own books, including works on Stalin and on his successors, Nikita
S. Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The journal Znamya plans to publish the first part of his new
book on Stalin, ``Let History Judge,'' in its first issue this year,
Medvedev said. The entire book is slated for ``express'' production
by Progress Publishers.
   But Medvedev said there is still no chance for the one book he
would really like to publish here, titled ``Polemics with
Solzhenitsyn.'' It consists of six or seven critical essays on the
basic works of Solzhenitsyn.
   ``It's too bad that everything connected with this writer remains
a closed area,'' Medvedev said.
   ``We mine gold from dirt and rock, picking out the best, washing
to find the gold,'' Medvedev said. ``It's the same here.
Solzhenitsyn must be published. And criticized.''
   Soviet intellectuals have called for publication of
Solzhenitsyn's works.
   But the Kremlin ideology chief, Vadim Medvedev, said in November
that publishing ``Gulag Archipelago'' and Solzhenitsyn's history of
Vladimir Lenin's life just before the Russian Revolution ``would
undermine the foundations on which today's life rests.''
   The ideology chief, who is not related to the historian, said
Solzhenitsyn's writing ``radically contradicts our social and
political system, our understanding of the world, of history, our
attitude toward Lenin.''
   Solzhenitsyn traces Stalin's widescale repression back to Lenin,
who is revered in the Soviet Union.
   Medvedev said his books ``The Troubled Spring of 1918,'' on the
beginning of the Soviet Civil War and the socialist system, and
another on ``Those Who Stood Around Stalin'' also are scheduled for
publication.

   Chinese paramilitary forces beat and used electric
truncheons on African students during a five-hour attack on 140
foreign students at a Nanking guest house, witnesses said Monday.
   An African diplomat, Gobo Bio Mamah of Benin, also reported
allegations that Chinese militiamen stripped and administered
electric shocks to students during Saturday's attack.
   ``We have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the
cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods,'' Mamah said.
``They were doing this to make them talk. It appears to be torture.''
   Mamah also said a Benin student had been sentenced, without
trial, to 15 days in prison following a bloody Dec. 24 clash between
Chinese and Africans in Nanking.
   It was the first report a second African had been arrested in
with the brawl that left 11 Chinese and two Africans injured. The
fight between Chinese and African students at Hehai University
touched off five days of anti-black protests in Nanking, capital of
Jiangsu province.
   A student from Mali said he saw Chinese forces at the guest house
Saturday using the electric prods all over the the foreigners'
bodies, including their genitals.
   ``They put their electric sticks everywhere but mostly on our
sexes,'' said Daouda Diakite, a 24-year-old student at Nanking
University. ``Luckily, I succeded in defending myself. I had friends
around me.''
   ``They treated us like animals,'' said another African, student
at the Nanking Pharmaceutical College. ``They used an electric baton
on my face.''
   A Japanese student at Nanking University said the police were
``brutal'' but she said she did not see them use their electric
batons.
   None of the allegations could be independently confirmed. An
American TV crew outside the guest house during the attack was
prevented from entering. Chinese authorities say they are ``not
clear'' about what happened at the guest house.
   The problems in Nanking and in another Chinese city, Hangzhou,
are the latest in a series of incidents between Chinese and 1,500
African students brought here to demonstrate China's solidarity with
the Third World.
   Relations between the two have been tense. Chinese are often
openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is very
different than their own.
   Chinese and African students fought at Hehai on Christmas Eve
after gatekeepers refused to allow two Chinese women to attend a
dance given by black African students.
   Anti-black protests followed and most of Nanking's 139 African
students fled to the Nanking train station. They wanted to go to
Beijing but were stopped by about 150 police.
   On Dec. 26, People's Armed Police, a paramilitary group, forced
the students to the guest house. The following day, diplomats from
nine African countries came to Nanking to speak with the students.
An agreement was made to keep the students in the guest house until
the diplomats returned this week, according to Y.N. Ohene-Akrasi,
minister counsellor at the Ghanian Embassy.
   But on Saturday, the Chinese broke the agreement, he said.
   African students said about 400 Chinese militiamen attacked the
students in the guest house.
   Students fought off the Chinese, throwing plates at them from the
dining hall, but soon realized that they were outnumbered, Diakite
said.
   The students then agreed to leave the dining hall and gather in a
courtyard.
   One African witness at Nanking Polytechnical College said police
charged the students, and another said he saw about seven police
beating one student from the Congo.
   ``I saw people, only men, naked, being shocked by the Chinese and
their weapons,'' Diakite said. ``They shocked women, too, though.
Also on their sexes.''
   Witnesses said Chinese ``arrested'' six to eight African students
from Hehai. Chinese reports said one Ghanian student, Alex Dzabaku
Dosoo, had been arrested and three other students held for
questioning. No mention was made of a student from Benin.
   But the Benin diplomat said that on Sunday officials from the
Ministry of Public Security in Beijing told him student Ludovic
Dossoumon had been sentenced to 15 days in prison as ``punishment''
without trial.
   Chinese authorities in Beijing refused to specify Dossoumon's
alleged crimes, Mamah said.
   ``They told me the authorities in Nanking were the only ones who
could say anything,'' he said.
   Chinese authorities at the Ministry of Public Security said they
were ``not clear'' about the arrests.
   On Monday, at least 50 students from Hehai remained at the guest
house, apparently because they still wanted to go to Beijing. Those
who hadn't been returned to their schools apparently had been moved
to another hotel.
   Meanwhile in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, a standoff
continued between 56 black Africans and Chinese at the Zhejiang
Agricultural College. The students have locked themselves in their
dormitory since last week because they allege Chinese officials say
they all have AIDS. College officials have denied the claim.

   The 100th Rose Parade got under way today with floats that showed
off Polynesian dancers, a grateful Vietnam refugee and a couple who
exchanged wedding vows in front of 1 million spectators and a TV
audience estimated at 300 million.
   Halfway across the nation, 650 pompon dancers opened today's
Cotton Bowl parade in Dallas, a flashier event than in previous
years as the city sought to make the pageant competitive with the
Rose and Orange parades.
   Half a million people jammed downtown Miami to watch floats,
stars, bands and 20 circus elephants in the 55th Annual King Orange
Jamboree Parade on New Year's Eve. And 22,000 marchers _ some
dressed as rabbits, Mexican senoritas or California raisins _
strutted their stuff in snow for 52,700 hardy spectators of
Philadelphia's 89th annual Mummers parade.
   People began lining the 5{-mile parade route Saturday morning.
Police Lt. Gregg Henderson called the crowd better behaved than last
year's. As of 8 a.m. 177 people had been arrested, most for
drunkenness.
   The parade began promptly at 8 a.m. under picture-perfect, sunny
skies and temperatures warming into the 60s.
   The grand marshal was Shirley Temple Black, 60, who enjoyed the
same honor 50 years ago when she was Hollywood's child acting
sensation.
   Black recently admitted she's allergic to roses, and she had
plenty to sneeze at: more than 20 million roses, chrysanthemums,
orchids, carnations, marigolds, irises, daffodils, tulips and other
blooms.
   The first Rose Parade was held in 1890, when the Valley Hunt Club
treated the town to a rose-petal-covered procession of
horse-and-buggy teams.
   The 1989 edition featured 275 horses, 20 marching bands and 60
floats _ including its tallest ever, a 70-foot creation depicting a
roller-skating giraffe pulling a giant calliope. It won a trophy for
the most original float.
   On a float dubbed ``Romance in California,'' Carie Humphries, 21,
and Ron Simms, 23, recited wedding vows before what was said to be
the largest audience ever to witness a marriage ceremony. Some of
the TV audience of 300 million watched the festivies wearing special
3-D Fox Television glasses.
   Vietnamese refugee Vinh Nguyen, riding the Home Savings of
America float, said: ``I feel very great. I'm really happy. It's the
best New Year's I have ever had.''
   Eighteen floats won trophies. Unocal's ``Mardi Gras,'' depicting
a giant masked reveler with a 26-foot headdress, was the Sweepstakes
winner as the most beautiful float.
   Rose Queen Charmaine Beth Shryock traveled with her court in a
float followed by another reuniting many former Rose Queens,
including 80-year-old Holly Halsted Balthis, who was the parade's
monarch in 1930.
   After the parade, the University of Southern California and the
University of Michigan were to meet in the Rose Bowl.
   In Dallas, a float containing a 24-foot rabbit popping out a
magician's hat won the theme prize for the bigger-than-ever Cotton
Parade. It was an appropriate symbol for the event, which organizers
hoped to jazz up by tripling the pageant's 1989 budget to $225,000.
   Some 100,000 spectators gathered for the parade under overcast
skies and 55-degree weather, and millions more watched an hour of
the event on TV.
   ``We have a one-hour shot to show that Dallas is not in the
dumps,'' said parade chairman Ward Lay.
   Thirteen floats, three giant balloon figures, 15 bands and five
equestrian units followed a new route mapped to avoid shadows from
downtown buildings. The grand marshal was country singer Charley
Pride.
   Following the parade, the University of Arkansas and the
University of California, Los Angeles, will square off in the Cotton
Bowl.
   The University of Miami plays the University of Nebraska in the
Orange Bowl tonight, but Miami had its parade New Year's Eve.
   Sherman Hemsley, star of TV's ``Amen,'' wore flashing sunglasses
and was backed up by three female singers on a float celebrating Ben
Franklin and electricity. Other celebrity participants included
actor Raymond Burr, ``L.A. Law'' star Susan Ruttan and ``Cheers''
star George Wendt. Marilyn McCoo and Joe Garagiola were the masters
of ceremonies.
   Philadelphians lining the 2{-mile Mummers parade route on New
Year's Day were treated to 14 hours of string bands competing for
more than $286,000 in prize money and clowns who cakewalked to the
event's perennial theme, ``Oh, Dem Golden Slippers.''
   Mummery, the prancing and wearing of masks and costumes for the
sheer fun of it, traces its origins back 2,400 years to the Greek
god Momus. In Philadelphia, the first formal parade was in 1901, but
neighborhood parades go back to at least 1877.
   Some clowns wore traditional garb, but others dressed more
topically, suiting up as President Reagan and talk show hosts Morton
Downey Jr., Geraldo Rivera and Oprah Winfrey.
   ``Anything goes in this parade,'' said Philadelphian Lucille
Hart, attending her 20th Mummers parade.
   About 50 miles to the southwest, tiny Middletown, Del., spoofed
the Mummers with its Hummers Parade despite rain and snow. About 200
spectators were entertained by 100 marchers, including participants
dressed as Betty Crocker, Father Time and Baby 1989.

   The 101st Congress ceremonially convenes for
its bicentennial session on Tuesday, firmly in the hands of
Democrats waiting to see whether the incoming Republican president
will be more conciliatory than the departing one.
   ``We both know there will be things on which we can't agree,''
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said after a post-election
meeting with president-elect Bush. But he added that Bush was ``a
realist'' interested in forging a better link with Congress.
   The Capitol Hill-White House relationship will be tested
throughout the year as lawmakers grapple with the obstinate problem
of the federal budget deficit and seek to map a new path for
domestic and foreign policy. But the first difficult item to
confront lawmakers will be whether to give themselves as much as a
$45,000 pay raise.
   While there is some new leadership on Capitol Hill _ most
prominently George Mitchell of Maine as the new Senate Majority
Leader _ the new Congress will look a lot like the last one.
   Better than 98 percent of House incumbents and 92 percent of
sitting senators who sought re-election will return for another
term. This year's freshman class is the smallest in history.
   Eleven new senators _ five Democrats and six Republicans _ will
take the oath of office as the first order of business when the
chamber convenes. The number includes Republican Rep. Dan Coats of
Indiana, appointed to replace vice-president elect Dan Quayle, who
was resigning before his Jan. 20 inauguration to let Coats be sworn
in early.
   In the House, 33 freshmen will be sworn in, 17 Democrats and 16
Republicans. They include Georgia Democrat Ben Jones, who played
``Cooter'' on TV's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' mountain climber Jolene
Unsoeld, D-Wash., and attorney and political novice Ronald Machtley,
the Rhode Island Republican who knocked off scandal-tainted
Democratic veteran Fernand St Germain.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, will be re-elected to a second
term as speaker, despite two ethics investigations into his finances
and his alleged disclosure of classified information. Wright's
first-day speech to the House will set the tone for the new session.
   It is a day not of substance, but of ceremony. The visitors
galleries on both sides of the Capitol will be filled with
lawmakers' families. There will be socializing, picture taking and
handshaking.
   A few routine housekeeping details will be taken care of in both
chambers, including the organizing of committees and the adoption of
rules.
   Tuesday's ceremonies and festivities will be followed by the
formal counting of presidential electoral votes on Wednesday. The
Senate will convene, then march as a body across the long corridor
to the House chamber.
   There, Bush _ acting in his constitutional role as president of
the Senate _ will open the certificates sent in from each state,
announce them in alphabetical order, and declare himself the winner.
   After two days in Washington, the new Congress will leave again,
and not come back until Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. Real business
gears up the following week, and while Bush may enjoy a limited
``honeymoon'' period, partisan struggle lurks not far below the
surface.
   Bush's first challenge will be to outline for Congress his budget
priorities and to show how he would save the $32 billion or so
necessary to meet deficit-reduction targets. He has pledged to do it
without raising taxes, and Democrats have been skeptical about
whether that can be accomplished.
   For their part, Democrats will be anxious to set their own policy
course in many areas. With a 55-45 majority in the Senate, a
one-seat gain from last year, and the House at 260-175, three better
than the 100th Congress, the majority party believes it has as much
a mandate as the new president.
   Leading the way will be two new Budget Committee chairmen: Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., in the House and Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., in the
Senate. Other new chairmanships will go to Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, at the Judiciary Committee; Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas,
and Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., at the Banking committees; former
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., as head of Senate
Appropriations; and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., House Government
Operations.
   In addition to the budget, another early and difficult issue for
the new Congress will be where to set its own pay. A presidential
commission has recommended 50 percent salary hikes for lawmakers and
some 2,500 other top government officials in the executive and
judicial branches. President Reagan's budget, due on Capitol Hill
Jan. 9, will likely include an increase.
   If both the House and Senate do not vote to stop it, whatever
Reagan recommends will automatically take effect on Feb. 8. House
leaders have said they plan to let the raise happen, but have
promised to expedite a ban on honoraria, the special-interest
speaking fees earned by many legislators.
   Senate committees also will face the immediate task of holding
confirmation hearings on members of Bush's cabinet and other top
administration appointees. Hearings on former Sen. John Tower's
nomination to be Secretary of Defense have been tentatively
scheduled for Inauguration week, and the Foreign Relations Committee
is expected to hold early hearings on James Baker's nomination as
Secretary of State.
   The 101st Congress is called the bicentennial Congress because it
will be meeting during the 200th anniversary of the date when the
first Congress was finally able to muster a quorum and officially
convene on April 6, 1789.

<HEAD>Cable Prices Going Up Along With Wider Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television systems are offering more
channels to more viewers, but the price for watching is also going
up.
   In the two years since most cable systems were freed from
municipal rate regulation, their basic service rates have risen
substantially. However, stability in premium channel rates, which
were never regulated, has moderated the increase in the average
overall cable bill.
   The Consumer Price Index for the 12 months through November shows
that cable TV bills for urban viewers rose 13.3 percent, while the
overall index rose 4.2 percent during the period. The cable increase
during the previous year was 6.85 percent.
   Other trackers of cable prices, however, show different figures.
   Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research firm that
compiles nationwide cable prices, says the monthly rate for basic
cable rose about 10 percent, from a monthly average of $13.20 last
year to $14.52 in 1988. With premium channels added in, average
monthly cable bills rose 5.6 percent over 1987 to $24.73, a rate
only slightly higher than inflation, the firm says.
   Those in the industry say that for the two decades before
deregulation took effect in January 1987, municipalities kept basic
service rates artificially low. With the freedom to charge what the
market will bear, cable systems have added more channels to the
basic tier and raised prices.
   Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst at Kagan, said the trend in
steep increases for basic service is a ``two-year phenomenon'' that
already shows signs of stabilizing.
   ``Regular rates will track fairly closely with inflation and
perhaps outpace it simply because of the new services'' being added,
she said. ``There could be a consumer backlash if charges go up
without new services, but cable operators are sensitive to this.
It's a subscription service _ you vote every month whether to buy
it.''
   For some systems, rates are still taking healthy leaps upward.
Cable TV Arlington in Virginia is raising its monthly rate for basic
service _ 54 channels _ by 11.1 percent to $19.95. That increase
comes on top of an 18 percent increase last August. Media General
Cable of Fairfax, Va., is raising its rate for basic service of 83
channels by nearly 19 percent to $18.95. It last raised its rates a
year ago.
   On the more moderate side, TeleCommunications Inc., the nation's
largest cable company operating systems with more than 4 million
subscribers, says it will raise its basic monthly rates an average
of 7 percent in 1989, to an average $15.50.
   So far, consumers appear to be doing little more than shrugging
their shoulders at the increases.
   The number of homes subscribing to cable service grew this year
by about 8 percent to 48.6 million _ representing 53.8 percent of
all U.S. television households. About 80 percent of all homes are
wired for cable.
   ``People value television choice in their home, they want to have
a lot of channels and they're willing to pay for it,'' said Charles
E. Walters, vice president of a Washington, D.C.-based consulting
firm.
   Decker Anstrom, executive vice president of the National Cable
Television Association, says cable packs a lot of entertainment
value for the price.
   ``Rates are increasing, but if you look at the overall universe,
cable is priced quite reasonably,'' he said. ``For about 50 cents a
day, the average cable subscriber receives 35 channels. It's a good
entertainment buy.''
   These arguments have been made to Congress but have failed to
assure some, including Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that
consumers' interests rather than a bottom line are being served by
cable companies.
   Metzenbaum plans to introduce legislation in the upcoming session
to strengthen the ability of cities to regulate cable rates, said
Eddie Correia, an aide to the senator.
   The deregulation that took hold in 1987 precluded rate regulation
in virtually every metropolitan area under the theory that systems
in heavily populated areas face competition from other media
sources, including many over-the-air broadcast signals. But, Correia
said, even in metropolitan areas, cable can lock out competition by
refusing to sell its programming to other sources, like wireless
cable and backyard satellite dishes.
   ``It's the worst of both worlds. You have monopolies but you have
no ability to regulate them,'' he said.
   Nicholas Miller, a Washington,D.C.-based communications lawyer
who represents municipalities on cable issues, also characterizes
cables operators as monopolies based on their pricing practices.
   ``They price based on what people are willing to pay, not what it
costs them to deliver the service,'' he said.

   The man wearing the visitor card around his
neck carried a large framed poster showing George Bush above a 1989
calendar. ``I dream of a kinder and gentler nation,'' read the
caption.
   Alas, politicos and souvenir hunters trying to capture a little
of the bicentennial inaugural spirit will not get a chance to buy
that poster.
   Like the George Bush salad plate, the red-white-and-blue pompons,
the horned hat and the one that ballooned into something resembling
the Pillsbury doughboy, it did not pass muster with the Presidential
Inaugural Committee.
   ``Everything in here is eminently tasteful,'' promotion director
Jill Collins said of the 16-page commemorative catalog due for
mailing this week to 1.5 million Republicans, historians and
collectors.
   In other inauguration news, with less than three weeks to I-Day:
   _The Fresh-Up Lounge, a 20-year tradition, announced it will once
again serve ``the grooming and personal needs of media men and
women'' covering the inaugural. Those needs apparently range from
haircuts, Band-Aids and food to a Color Vision Computer. ``See
yourself in a variety of hair colors,'' urges the press release
issued by sponsors Clairol and Bristol Myers.
   _Nearly 2,200 bottles of Korbel champagne, the official champagne
of the Bush inauguration, were delivered to inaugural headquarters.
(Official inaugural candy bars are in the works).
   _The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has agreed to perform at a musical
prelude to the Jan. 20 inaugural ceremony.
   _The Postal Service will make special I-Day stamp cancellations
in six cities _ Milton, Mass.; Greenwich, Conn.; Houston;
Kennebunkport, Maine; Huntington, Ind., and Indianapolis. Why? Hint:
Bush was born in the first and raised in the second, started a
business in the third and vacations in the fourth; the last two have
something to do with Vice President-elect Quayle.
   _Some 60,000 invitations to inaugural events are out, gone,
finis. That leaves a mere 400,000 to mail, but there's no rush.
They're commemoratives that won't admit anyone to anything. ``I've
seen them framed on walls all over the country,'' insists committee
spokesman Ed Cassidy. ``They are extremely popular.''
   For those who aren't even on the commemorative list, the
inaugural catalog offers consolations ranging in price from 95 cents
to $1,195. The cheapest item is a schoolbook cover depicting Bush
and George Washington in keeping with the inaugural's bicentennial
``George To George'' theme. At the top end of the scale, devotees
can purchase eagles _ $1,195 for Steuben glass or Boehm china.
   For couch potatoes and the politically unconnected, the committee
is offering for $29.95 a VCR tape that promises buyers the inaugural
bicentennial ``captured for years of enjoyment and historical
significance.'' Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, a Bush
supporter, is making the tape.
   Half of the one-hour tape will be historical and the other half
will hit the high points of the Bush-Quayle inauguration, according
to Stephen Studdert, executive director of the committee. He said
all schools in the country will be given a copy.
   For the tradition-bound, the catalog offers the usual medals _
ranging from $29.50 for a bronze art medal to $920 for a collectors'
set _ and inaugural license plates, available for $50 and usable in
any state until March 31.
   But not everything in the catalog is generic. Some items have
been chosen to reflect the incoming president's tastes and
background _ horseshoe belt buckles and key rings, Texas chili mix
and coasters made of Maine slate; golf shirts and Navy-style caps
like the ones he wears.
   You won't find official inaugural dried pork rinds. You will find
commemorative blazer buttons, but officials strenuously deny that
they are there to recall Bush's preppie image _ a distinct liability
early in his White House campaign.
   No, blazer buttons have an important place in inaugural history.
Seems George Washington wore special buttons engraved with the arms
of the new government at his inaugural ceremony. This year's set, 10
brass buttons for $65, is engraved with the bicentennial inaugural
seal.
   Most of the cost of the inauguration _ expected to top $20
million _ will come from ball and gala ticket sales. But the
committee hopes to net more than $2 million from its catalog items.

   One hundred professors and other prominent
personalities have signed a petition asking the government for open
elections to parliament in 1989, spokesmen for the group said Monday.
   The petition, presented to the government ombudsman's office Dec.
30 and given to Western news agencies, said that any citizen should
have the right to run for the Sejm, or parliament, after being
nominated by a certain portion of eligible voters.
   For example, the group said, signatures by 1 percent of a
district's electorate could be sufficient to nominate a candidate.
   Under Poland's current arrangement, nominations to parliament
elections are controlled by the Communist Party, which in effect
determines how many seats go to communists, to allied political
parties and to non-party members.
   Communists have always received an automatic majority of the
seats since the party consolidated power in Poland after World War
II and held the first postwar parliament elections in 1947.
   Elections are planned this year after the drafting of a new
election law. Deputies serve four-year terms and the last elections
were held in October 1985.
   In his New Year's Eve message to the nation, Polish leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski said he would like the new parliament to ``more
clearly reflect the natural differentiation of attitudes and views
within society.''
   Among those signing the petition to the ombudsman were film
director Andrzej Wajda; the rector of Warsaw University, Grzegorz
Bialkowski; the leader of the Polish Economic Society, Aleksander
Paszczynski; and leader of the Polish PEN Writer's Club, Julius
Zulawski.
   Those who signed included 54 professors. Many were members of a
recently formed Citizen's Committee designed to bring the mainstream
of the Polish opposition movement into one structure.

   Where most people list their job
experiences, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry's resume brags,
``Arrested 26 times in seven cities.''
   Terry complains it's out-of-date.
   ``It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in
upstate New York where the latest protests against abortion are
being planned.
   Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a
high-profile issue again.
   Terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion
clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras.
   Terry says he is trying to produce the ``social tension''
necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s
civil rights protest as a model.
   ``He's the Martin Luther King of a movement,'' said Dominick
Brignola, an Albany lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion
drive.
   Terry's critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because
followers try to ``rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's
rights.
   ``The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people.
They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human
beings,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women.
   More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged Atlanta jails
during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then,
demonstrations have spread to New York City, Indianapolis,
Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Boston and still more cities.
   The activists want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated
1.6 million women have abortions each year in the United States.
   Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star.
   Terry and his wife, Cindy, began their crusade in 1984 by
standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of
entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office
that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby
clothes.
   ``God clicked a light on in my head and said it wasn't enough to
just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about
it,'' said Terry, who's selling his auto dealership because he is
too busy with Operation Rescue.
   Critics concede Terry has a mesmerizing personality. He even
tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said Dawn Marvin of
Rochester, his aunt.
   Terry was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit
high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said Marvin, who
is communications director for the Rochester chapter of Planned
Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently
target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization
about her nephew.
   ``He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about Terry's
transformation into a born-again Christian. ``He came back a totally
changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a
spiritual quest.''
   Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman
have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and
three foster children.
   Terry dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment
that ``he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention.
   To Margaret Johnston, administrator at Southern Tier Women's
Services in Binghamton, Operation Rescue is nothing new. She said
anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and
glued the clinic's door shut four or five times.
   Terry's first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself
to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for
22 days for refusing to pay a $60 fine.
   ``It doesn't matter what you say to him. There is no reason
involved,'' Johnston said. ``He doesn't care about women. I think he
really hates women.''
   Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the
Binghamton clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present
demonstrators at shouting distance.
   ``They really want to make it personal,'' Johnston said.
   Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office,
Johnston said Terry has shouted at her, ``How many babies did you
murder today?''
   Terry criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being ``too nice''
during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend
like President Reagan into not working hard for its goal.
   ``We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he
said. ``That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the
victim.''
   The lean, bushy-haired Terry expects and even hopes his
demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue was
responsible for 11,000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500,000 will be
arrested in 1989.
   There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified.
   ``In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own
beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children
murdered,'' he said.
   ``That's like saying, `Why can't a white man follow his own
conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why can't a German
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?'''
   Terry has attracted some prominent supporters, including former
presidential candidate Pat Robertson, who said he backs ``any means
short of violence'' to stop abortion.
   If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, Terry said,
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political
system is not built to deal with mass protests.
   Yard dismisses Terry as a ``puppet'' groomed for the role of
point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive.
   ``Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. ``The
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings (of
abortion clinics) and Operation Rescue is that people don't believe
Roe vs. Wade can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.''
   At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted.
   Pinned to the wall is a large map of the United States, with
``abortion mills'' dotted in red. Terry distractedly complains to a
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will
take him to a television appearance.
   As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his
desk, saying ``that's too casual for someone trying to change world
history.''
   He adds, chuckling: ``It's comical, really. I think God has a
sense of humor. Don't you think it's rather funny that a former used
car salesman is heading such a movement?''

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Africa Falling Behind Developed Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost all African nations were
falling further behind the world's developed countries, the
executive secretary of the United Nations' Economic Commission for
Africa said Monday.
   The U.N. official, Adebayo Adedeji, also called for fundamental
changes in structural adjustment programs mandated by major lending
institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
   Structural adjustment programs usually require significant
economic belt-tightening by nations receiving World Bank or IMF aid,
and debtor nations frequently complain the measures often lead to
hardship and civil unrest.
   Adebayo, delivering a year-end assessment to an audience of
diplomats and economists at the commission's headquarters in
Ethiopia's capital, said Africa's economy did not keep pace with its
population growth in 1988.
   He predicted an even more dismal decline in 1989.
   Adebayo said Africa's combined economy grew at a rate of 2.5
percent in 1988, compared with 1.3 percent in 1987. However, he
said, that was offset by population growth of about 3 percent.
   A decade-long pattern of slow economic growth coupled with rapid
population increases has left the average African with an income
only about 80 percent of what it was in 1980, Adebayo said.
   He noted that demand for African exports remains weak and said
the continent's economy ``has been sapped and weakened by the burden
of debt in spite of the perceptible recovery of the industrial
economies.''
   He put the combined debt of African nations at $230 billion at
the close of 1988, compared with $218 billion in 1987.
   Adebayo said improved weather conditions that put an end to
droughts in many parts of Africa in 1988 were expected to continue
in 1989, but that resulting improvements in agriculture were likely
to be offset by further declines in commodity prices. Africa's basic
agricultural exports are coffee, tea, cocoa and vegetable oils.

<HEAD>Suspect In Officer's Shooting Surrounded In Cabin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINSLOW, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspect in the New Year's Eve shooting of
a Navajo County deputy sheriff was ``pinned down'' this morning in a
cabin near here and fired shots at an officer's car, authorities
said.
   Sgt. Allan Schmidt, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of
Public Safety, said shots were exchanged with one of two suspects in
the fatal shooting of Deputy Bob Varner, but no one was hit.
   The owner of the cabin, who does not live there full time, called
police this morning after he went to the cabin ``and recognized that
something was amiss,'' Schmidt said.
   Varner died today at Barrow Neurological Center in Phoenix, where
he was taken after being shot Saturday night after two men opened
fire during a routine traffic stop, authorities said.
   The man inside the house is believed to be Douglas Savory, 45,
who also is known as Douglas Savorey and Douglas Toad Wolf, Schmidt
said. He said the man is armed with at least one automatic weapon.
   The other suspect, identified earlier as Raul Lopez, about 25, is
not at the cabin. The two were believed to have split up earlier,
Schmidt said.
   Savory told a couple who were victimized by the two suspects
after the shooting Saturday that he was a survivalist and ``don't
believe in hurting people, but there are times when it's necessary.''
   The two had approached the home of Bud and Betty Hunt, pretending
to have car trouble, and then tied up the two and took their car.
The Hunts were not injured.
   After DPS and Navajo County authorities arrived at the cabin
today, shots were fired from the house at a sheriff's patrol car,
but no one was injured, Schmidt said.
   He said Interstate 40 was closed in both directions about 3 miles
east of Winslow because the cabin where the man is holed up ``is
only a few hundred yards from the highway.''
   The cabin was surrounded and that at least two helicopters were
being used to help keep the building under surveillance. ``We're
waiting for a SWAT team from Flagstaff and developing a plan to
handle this guy,'' Schmidt said.
   Schmidt said a California warrant from San Bernardino County
accused Savory of robbery and kidnapping in a September gun-store
robbery in which five other people have been arrested. Schmidt said
he had no other details on the robbery.
   He also has been investigated in connection with manufacturing
and sale of illegal weapons and explosivies, and ``he is well known
to authorities at the (California) state and federal level,''
Schmidt said.
   He said Lopez ``may be a citizen of Mexico but we have very
little on his background,'' the spokesman said.
   Varner apparently stopped the two suspects about 7:30 p.m.
Saturday, but ``we don't know the circumstances of why he stopped
that car,'' Schmidt said. There were at least 17 bullet holes in the
windshield of Varner's car, Sheriff Gary Butler said. He was hit
three times.

<HEAD>Official Papers Show Information Withheld On Nuclear Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The private papers of former British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan show his government kept secret the details of a
1957 accident at an atomic power plant that contaminated milk at
about 800 farms, according to a published report.
   The release Sunday of Macmillan's papers marked the first time
full details have been revealed about the spring 1957 accident at
the Windscale nuclear plant in Cumbria, northwest England. The
papers were cited in a report by The Observer, a London newspaper.
   The papers show that Macmillan kept the information secret
because he feared shaking public confidence in the industry and
jeopardizing collaboration with the United States.
   The Observer cited the documents as saying the accident
contaminated milk with high levels of strontium 90, a deadly isotope
found in radioactive fallout. The newspaper said the milk was sold
to the public without any warning.
   In a secret memo to Macmillan on Sept. 12, 1957, Agriculture
Minister John Hare estimated ``800 or more farms may be affected''
by an escape of strontium 90 and that ``the readings on some of
these farms have been many times higher than the national average,''
the Observer said.
   It said Hare also wrote that no action was being taken ``to
prevent milk being consumed or produced on farms in the area.''
   The paper quoted John Dunstan, a former director of the state-run
National Radiological Protection Board, as saying full details of
the amount of radioactivity released in the accident were not
disclosed to the board until 1986. The release of the information
came in connection with an inquiry into increased childhood leukemia
near the plant, now known as Sellafield.
   The newspaper did not report the cause of the accident and made
no mention of any deaths attributed to it.
   Macmillan's documents were made public by the Public Records
Office under rules permitting publication of selected confidential
papers after 30 years.
   Government papers made public a year ago said Macmillan also
suppressed a report on Britain's worst ever nuclear accident at
Windscale on Oct. 10, 1957. The report said the accident was caused
by a fire.
   Sales of milk from an area measuring more than 200 square miles
around the plant were banned after a release of radioactivity. The
accident caused no immediate deaths.
   The problem-plagued plant on the Irish Sea is one of the West's
oldest commercial atomic power stations and largest nuclear
reprocessing plants. It reprocesses used nuclear fuels from Britain
and other countries to extract uranium and plutonium for making
nuclear bombs.

   An exhibition of modern art from
the New York and Venice Guggenheim collections drew 121,000 visitors
during its display at Prague's National Gallery, officials said.
   On Sunday, the last day of the exhibit, it took visitors 1{ hours
to make it through the line to the second floor of Sternberk Palace,
where 50 paintings by 33 artists have hung since early November.
   The Guggenheim exhibit brought to Prague expressionist, cubist,
futurist, constructivist and surrealist masterpieces.
   It was preceded last summer by a Czech National Gallery exhibit
of 60 canvases in New York's Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art.
   On display in Prague were paintings by artists such as Pablo
Picasso, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, Joan Miro, Jackson
Pollock and Jean Dubuffet.
   The two shows were based on a 1986 cultural agreement and a
10-year friendship between Guggenheim director Thomas M. Messer and
Jiri Kotalik, the director of the Prague gallery.
   ``It's a sign of improving relations. It could not have happened
five years ago,'' said Messer, adding he saw the exhibit ``not
merely as an art show but as a very significant cultural event.''
   ``It's the first time ever that a full survey of 20th century
paintings ... has been presented in any of the socialist
countries,'' he said in an interview.
   He noted, however, that the show focused on the period 1900-45,
and that a second exhibit would be needed to show contemporary art.
   This thought was echoed also in some of the entries in the
visitors' book and complaints that the works on show were already
well-known from literature.
   Most, however, were grateful. ``Thank you, we ourselves are not
likely to get to New York,'' wrote one visitor. Another said,
``thanks, but wish there had been more.''
   There were so many visitors, up to 4,200 a day, that after a few
days the gallery announced it was extending viewing time until 8
p.m. two days a week.
   ``Artwork necessarily creates an atmosphere of international
understanding,'' wrote the trade union daily newspaper Prace. ``Art
can speak with the same urgency to people throughout the world.''
   The women's weekly Vlasta said, ``We can only wish that the
useful international cooperation continues. After all, it brings
enrichment for both countries _ for us, especially, an expansion of
knowledge of the various trends of contemporary 20th century art.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union appears bent on a
political solution in Cambodia and has urged its Vietnamese allies
to withdraw their occupation forces, Western and Soviet diplomats
say.
   The Kremlin denies pressuring Vietnam to pull out, but Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor A. Rogachev has called a partial withdrawal in
1988 an ``avenue toward a speedy solution'' that could improve
Soviet relations with China.
   A summit of the two largest communist powers is expected this
year, and Cambodia might head the agenda. Vietnam invaded its
Southeast Asian neighbor in December 1978, ousted the bloody Khmer
Rouge regime and installed another government.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, a Western diplomat said of the
Chinese-Soviet dispute over Cambodia: ``I think they've both decided
to put this one behind them, to sweep this one under the rug.''
   Moscow backs Hanoi and its client regime in Phnom Penh. Beijing
arms Khmer Rouge guerrillas and other rebel groups fighting that
government.
   The Soviet Union's apparent retrenchment after a decade fits its
current policy of shedding or reducing costly foreign involvements.
It also does not appear to relish being Cambodia's major donor of
foreign aid.
   ``This kind of monopoly we certainly do not like,'' said a Soviet
diplomat in Phnom Penh. He said his country was especially unhappy
about having to provide all Cambodia's oil, on credit.
   Most Western analysts believe the Soviet Union wants to retain
its influence in Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos but at a level that
would not antagonize China or the non-communist nations of the
region, with which Moscow seeks better economic and political
relations.
   Although the Soviet investment in Cambodia is substantial, it
does not approach the amount the Kremlin has committed to
Afghanistan or to neighboring Vietnam, and Moscow has not carried
out pledges of reconstruction made 10 years ago.
   Official Cambodian media said the Soviet Union extended aid worth
$133 million in 1979-80 to help overcome famine and devastation
caused by nearly four years of Khmer Rouge governemtn.
   Aid levels are believed to have been substantially lower since,
but no reliable estimates are available. Washington estimates the
Soviets pour the equivalent of more than $3 billion a year into
Vietnam.
   Several hundred Soviet advisers are stationed in Cambodia,
involved in projects ranging from a ground satellite station to a
veterinary medicine center.
   Soviet pilots fly planes of the Cambodian airline and engineers
sent by the Kremlin are renovating the electric power supply system.
By 1990, more than 3,500 scholarships are expected to have been
provided for Cambodians studying in the Soviet Union.
   Most of the bill for Cambodia's army and the Vietnamese
occupation force also goes to the Kremlin. Western analysts say that
is an important reason the Soviets want to get the Vietnamese out
and reach a political solution with rebel groups.
   Little Soviet blood has been shed in Cambodia and Moscow has not
installed a naval base at the Kompong Som port, as some observers
expected. It also has not built the roads, communications and other
facilities needed in a country plagued for nearly 20 years by war,
Khmer Rouge rule, invasion and insurgency.
   According to Soviet diplomats, their government wants to cut
unnecessary items from the current aid program. They scoff at some
suggestions from their aid bureaucracy, like establishing a circus
or getting involved in tourism.
   One diplomat, noting deficiencies in the Soviet Union's own
development of tourism, said the Cambodians ``saw the light'' and
decided to invite Hong Kong businessmen to restore a first-class
hotel in Phnom Penh.

   Two separate bus accidents killed 41 people,
official Chinese news reports said Monday.
   The Xinhua News Agency said 31 people were killed when a bus
carrying a bride and her relatives collided with a freight train
Sunday in northeast China's Heilongjiang province on the Bingbei
Railway Line.
   The bride, the bus driver and 29 others on board the bus died,
the news agency said. It gave no figure for the number of people
injured. The cause of the accident was under investigation, it said.
   In another accident, a bus carrying 46 passengers plunged into an
icy river Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring 32 others, the
China Daily reported.
   It said ``hundreds of local people, policemen and doctors''
jumped into the river to help save the passengers.
   Passers-by smashed the bus windows with axes and bamboo poles in
the rescue effort, the newspaper said. Four were still missing, it
said.
   The crash occurred outside of Shanghai when the bus left the road
and plunged over a 24-foot-high bridge into a river. The bus landed
upside down and was submerged, the report said.

<TEXT>
   An 88-year-old man who had been feuding
with the other residents of his small, cramped retirement home was
accused today of killing two of them and injuring four others while
they slept, authorities said.
   Henry Thomas, who walks with the aid of a cane, was charged with
two counts of first-degree murder and was being held without bond in
the Pasco County Detention Center, said Police Chief Phil Thompson.
   Thomas' clothes and cane were bloodstained when he was picked up
Sunday evening while strolling through this city about 30 miles
northeast of Tampa, police said. He was taken into custody about 12
hours after the victims' bodies were found. The injuries could have
been caused by the cane but that hadn't been confirmed, he said.
   The bodies of Max Nickbarge, 90, and Myrtle Smith, 73, were
discovered Sunday morning by two nurses at the Reflections I
retirement home, one of whom had slept only a few feet away from
where the attack occurred, police said.
   The victims apparently were asleep at the time of the attack,
Thompson said.
   The police chief said there was bitterness between Thomas and
other residents ``that had been building for some time and came to a
head.'' While he didn't know the cause of the bitterness, Thompson
said cramped quarters in the home, where Thomas lived with two other
men in a 9-foot-by-10-foot room, may have contributed.
   Nickbarge was found in his bedroom, and Smith was found in the
living room. The two, last seen around midnight Saturday, had been
beaten about the head, neck and shoulders, police said.
   ``Some furniture had been overturned, and there was broken glass
on the floor,'' said police Sgt. Dale Neuner.
   Four other people were injured, two seriously.
   Frank Tear Sr., 89, was listed in critical but stable condition
today with a fractured skull, cuts and bruises at Tampa General
Hospital. Tear is the father-in-law of Helen Tear, who owns
Reflections I and a similar home nearby.
   Esther Kelly, 67, was in guarded condition at Humana Hospital in
Dade City with two broken arms, cuts on her face and head, and
bruises.
   Ruth Godfrey, 71, and Lucy Mitchell, 85, were both listed in fair
condition with facial cuts at East Pasco Medical Center in
Zephyrhills about 10 miles south of here. Godfrey also suffered a
broken collarbone.
   Nine people lived in the home. All six victims had been sleeping
in rooms near the front of the house, said Neuner.
   ``Some residents in the rear of the house said they heard strange
noises in the night,'' Neuner said, but no one rose to investigate.
   The home's three other residents were transferred Sunday to
Reflections II nearby.
   Thomas, a retired fruit picker, checked into the home after his
house burned down in November, police said. Neighbors said he often
collected and sold junk.

   A man and his daughter were injured Monday
when they jumped from their second-floor hotel room to escape a
fire, authorities said.
   Elio Pirrone and his daughter, Antonina Silvana, threw a mattress
onto a first-floor balcony 16 feet below their room after hearing a
fire alarm and seeing smoke.
   Pirrone, 53, suffered a dislocated shoulder, and Ms. Silvana, 20,
had bruises on her leg, according to doctors at San Carlo hospital.
Both also suffered smoke inhalation.
   The two were among only three guests at the 54-room Hotel
Tiziano. The third guest and hotel employees were unhurt in the
fire, which may have been caused by a short circuit.

   A 15-year-old soccer fan was hospitalized
in a coma Monday after a fight between supporters of rival teams.
   Davide Fornaroli suffered broken bones Saturday in the violence
between supporters of rival teams from Cremona and Brescia, said
doctors at the Civil Hospital in this northern city.
   The 20-minute fight erupted after a championship match when fans
of Brescia, which lost 2-0, attacked a train carrying the fans of
visiting Cremona team.
   The Brescia supporters hurled stones at the train, smashing the
windows of several cars, railway officials said.
   Two people were taken into custody.
   It was the second serious incident in the Italian soccer season.
In October, a supporter of the Ascoli team died from head injuries
suffered during clashes with fans of Milan's Internazionale team.
Three supporters of the Milan team face murder charges.

   A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean
coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are
missing, authorities and news reports said today.
   Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, a spokesman at the Puerto Barrios
naval base, said the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday
afternoon in Amatique Bay. He said by telephone that 59 people died.
   Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios,
said the Justo Rufineo Barrios II ran out of fuel midway on a
regular 16-mile run from the town Livingston, across the bay, to
Puerto Barrios.
   Gaytan said the boat sank while it was being towed by a tugboat.
   The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City confirmed the sinking and
said a 40-year-old Spanish citizen, Vicente Daudi, was among the
dead. The embassy reported his wife, Rosa Maria Arnal, and a son
survived the shipwreck, but two daughters were missing.
   Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic
development mission in Guatemala, the embassy said.
   An official at the Puerto Barrios morgue said 13 bodies have been
identified. Besides Daudi, the nationalities of the victims were not
immediately known.
   Gaytan said navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and private craft
have been searching the bay for survivors and recovering bodies.
   He said he had no other details on the shipwreck.
   Puerto Barrios, 187 miles northeast of the capital, is
Guatemala's principal east coast port.

<HEAD>Armenian Paper Prints Alleged Threat; Activists Calls It a Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Armenian newspaper has printed an alleged threat
by Armenian militants to wage terrorist attacks with U.S.-made
Stinger missiles if their leaders are not freed from jail. The
activists called it a fake.
   The purported letter, published by Kommunist, the Armenian
Communist Party daily newspaper, demands the immediate release of
members of the Karabakh Committee, a group that has led an 11-month
campaign for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly
Armenian region of Azerbaijan.
   If the committee's leaders are not freed, the unsigned document
says, ``we will have recourse to mass terror. ... In our arsenals,
we have `Stingers,' provided by our friends.''
   A facsimile copy of the purported document was published in
Kommunist's Dec. 28 editions, which reached Moscow over the weekend.
Kommunist said the letter was received by law-enforcement officials,
and labeled ``to be transmitted to the KGB.''
   It made no additional reference to the Stingers. Many of the
U.S.-manufactured ground-to-air missiles have been shipped by the
United States to Afghan insurgents fighting their country's
pro-Moscow government.
   Rafael Popoyan, an Armenian activist, said the letter printed by
Kommunist was a ``total fabrication from beginning to end,'' and
another attempt by officials to discredit the Karabakh committee
militants.
   Sergei Grigoryants, an Armenian-Russian activist who was released
last week after 30 days in jail in Yerevan, the Armenian capital,
for filming soldiers who are enforcing a curfew, said the
grammatical construction of the letter was too complicated for most
Armenians. The letter was written in Russian, which Armenians learn
in school in addition to their own language and alphabet.
   At a news conference in Moscow, Grigoryants also distributed a
copy of an interview with Ashot Manucharyan, a member of the
Armenian Supreme Soviet legislature who Grigoryants said is a
fugitive because of his nationalist activities.
   Manucharyan was quoted as saying he was told about such
threatening letters by the Armenian KGB secret police five months
ago, when no members of the Karabakh Committee were under detention.
   Popoyan said the appearance of the article may herald a further
crackdown by Soviet authorities on the committee, seven of whose
members are now in jail and the other four reportedly in hiding to
avoid arrest.
   ``Now that so many members of the committee have been arrested,
there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges,'' Popoyan said,
speaking by telephone from Yerevan. ``The press is now closed to
anyone from the committee.''
   Soviet authorities jailed committee leaders after the Dec. 7
earthquake in northwestern Armenia. Authorities have accused
committee members of sabotaging the earthquake relief effort and
whipping up ethnic tensions by continuing to seek Nagorno-Karabakh's
annexation by Armenia, a demand the Kremlin has refused.

<TEXT>
   A man serving a 25-year to life sentence for the
1978 slaying of a restaurateur who took his cover-girl lover away
from him has been granted permission to seek a new trial.
   Howard ``Buddy'' Jacobson, who says he's being treated for bone
cancer in Attica state prison, was granted permission to file new
motions on Feb. 1 by Appellate Division Judge Richard W. Wallach,
Newsday reported Monday. The ruling was made Dec. 8, the newspaper
said.
   Three previous appeals of Jacobson's conviction of murdering Jack
Tupper have been denied.
   Jacobson, 58, one of the nation's most successful thoroughbred
horse trainers in the 1960s and 1970s, maintains that Tupper was a
narcotics dealer slain in a drug dispute.
   ``I'm innocent, plain and simple,'' Jacobson told Newsday from
Attica.
   The government, with model Melanie Cain a major witness in an
11-week trial in 1980, said Jacobson shot and stabbed Tupper to
death because Miss Cain left him after four years and moved into an
apartment across the hall with Tupper.
   Jacobson's lawyer, Herald Price Fahringer, said a new trial will
be sought on grounds that the prosecution hid statements by a
witness who said Jacobson was not one of the three men she saw at
the site where Tupper's body was dumped.
   Miss Cain, 33, now an actress with a 3-year-old daughter, told
Newsday she still believed Jacobson guilty and would ``be shocked if
it turned out differently.''

   Pilots on Monday made their first test of a new
Soviet airliner, the Tupolev 204, that designers say is more roomy
and efficient than current Aeroflot jets, the Tass news agency said.
   The 214-seat airliner is to go into service at the end of 1990
and be one of Aeroflot's principal medium-range carrier in the
1990s, Tass said.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' showed a yellow
twin-engine jet on a tarmac in Moscow preparing for its 32-minute
flight. News reports did not say if any problems were found in the
flight.
   The Tu-204 ``belongs to a new generation of airliners,
economical, equipped with most up-to-date electronic systems and
instruments of Soviet make, and very comfortable for passengers,''
Tass said.
   Chief engineer of the new plane, L. Lanovsky, told Tass it will
have wider corridors and more leg room than the Soviet Union's
notoriously cramped airliners.
   The plane will be built in modules, so first-class and
business-class sections also can be built in, he said. Some Aeroflot
planes that fly international routes have business-class sections,
but there is no such differentiation on domestic flights.
   It will be much more energy efficient than the Tupolev 154,
currently the most efficient Soviet passenger jet, Tass said.
   Tass said test pilots and engineers will test up to 3,000
components of the plane in the next 12 to 18 months, and that it
probably will be displayed at international air shows before it goes
into general service.
   The Tu-204 is likely to replace the Tu-154 on some routes. It has
been carrying passengers on regular routes since 1972.

<HEAD>President Rejects Clemency For Convicted Gandhi Assassin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman on
Monday rejected an appeal for clemency for one of the two Sikhs
condemned to death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, defense lawyers said.
   Lawyers for Kehar Singh and Satwant Singh said they would file
another round of appeals Tuesday to halt their executions.
   Ram Jethmalani, the defense attorney for Kehar Singh, said the
earliest his client could be hanged was at dawn Wednesday, but said
he would launch appeals in the trial court, appellate court and
Supreme Court on Tuesday.
   Under Indian law, a man condemned to be executed has to be hanged
within seven days of the issue of the death warrants but not before
24 hours from the time it is issued.
   S. Mohapatra, superintendent of the maximum-security Tihar jail,
where the convicted men are lodged, said Monday he had received the
``black warrants'' for the executions, but refused to say when they
would take place.
   Rupinder S. Sodhi, defense attorney for Satwant Singh, said
Venkataraman sent a letter Monday to Kehar Singh's son, Rajinder,
informing him of the decision to turn down the plea for mercy.
   It was the second time he has turned down a mercy petition by
Kehar Singh, 54.
   ``After carefully considering the petition ... the president of
India has declined to grant pardon or any other relief ... and has
rejected the petition,'' the letter said.
   It gave no reason for the rejection, which vacated the stays of
execution for Kehar Singh and Satwant Singh.
   The two men are not related. All male Sikhs take the name of
Singh, which means lion in the Punjabi language, by doctrine of
their faith.
   Satwant Singh has not filed a mercy petition with the president,
but under Indian law his death sentence was automatically delayed
when Kehar Singh asked for clemency.
   Sodhi said Satwant Singh would not ask the president for clemency.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them, Beant
Singh, was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later.
The other, Satwant Singh, was arrested, tried and sentenced to the
gallows.
   Kehar Singh, an uncle of Beant Singh, was convicted of conspiracy
and sentenced to death.
   Mrs. Gandhi's assassination was in apparent revenge for an army
raid she had ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple,
Sikhism's holiest shrine, to clear the complex of Sikh militants
entrenched inside.
   On Oct. 30, Kehar Singh filed his first mercy petition. It was
dismissed by the president Nov. 24 and the two men were ordered to
hang on Dec. 2.
   But Kehar Singh's lawyers challenged the president's decision in
the Supreme Court, arguing Venkataraman had powers to review the
case. The court granted a stay 15 hours before the two were to be
hanged.
   On Dec. 16, the Supreme Court ordered the president to reconsider
the appeal.
   A trial court convicted them in 1986 and sentenced them to death.
The convictions and death sentences were upheld by an appeals court
later that year and by the Supreme Court last August.
   Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people, claim
they are discriminated by the Hindus, the country's religious
majority accounting for over 80 percent of the population.
   Militant Sikhs are fighting a 6-year-old guerrilla war for a
separate nation in Punjab. Over 2,400 deaths last year were blamed
on the militants.

<TEXT>
   A 24-hour strike by Iberia airlines'
mechanics forced the cancellation of 55 flights Monday, a spokesman
said.
   The cancellations mostly affected flights to and from Madrid and
Barcelona on the domestic carrier Aviaco, said Jose Maria Estrade,
an Iberia spokesman.
   The 1,400-member Spanish Association of Aircraft Maintenance
Technicians called the strike to pressure Iberia to accept a
separate pay scale and work rules for union members. The mechanics
are included in an agreement governing all 21,000 Iberia ground
employees.
   Estrade said 400 mechanics went to work Monday as part of an
agreement with the union to provide minimum services. But he said
Iberia officials considered the strike illegal and were considering
disciplinary action against its organizers.
   The union has announced more strikes for Thursday and Jan. 9.

<HEAD>Bus Crash Survivors Learn to Live With Burn Treatments, Stares _

   She was one of 12 teen-agers left with
severe burns after the church bus crash that killed 27 people last
year, but Trina Muller is learning to adjust.
   Friends, counselors and even strangers are helping.
   ``One day this kid looked at me and said, `What happened to your
hands and face?' and my friends ran up to him and said, `If you
don't like what you see, don't look,''' Trina said.
   Garry King, principal at J.T. Alton Middle School, said survivors
of the May 14 crash deserve the credit for a smooth transition in
returning to school.
   ``These kids are fantastically courageous,'' King said. ``It's
been an inspiration for me.''
   Trina must wear skin-tight pressure garments that doctors say
will help prevent her burns from leaving hideous scars. She thinks
the flesh-colored suit that covers her from her head to her knees is
ugly.
   ``If the doctor told me I didn't have to wear it anymore, I'd
throw a party,'' she said.
   Still, the 14-year-old doesn't let the chin strap prevent her
from endless phone conversations with friends or the pressure gloves
from wearing several rings over them.
   Life goes on for Trina and the 39 others who nearly burned to
death inside the church bus after it was hit head-on by a pickup
truck driver.
   Police say Larry Mahoney's truck crashed into the bus from the
First Assembly of God Church in Radcliff while he was driving the
wrong way on Interstate 71. The bus, returning to Radcliff after the
church group spent the day at an amusement park north of Cincinnati,
burst into flames.
   The 67 people aboard survived the impact, but three adults and 24
children died as they tried to escape the burning bus.
   Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, pleaded innocent to 27 counts of
murder and other charges, including drunken driving. He was released
from jail on $540,000 bond Oct. 10.
   Aside from periodic absences for surgery, the student survivors
are all back in school. Doctors and therapists monitor their healing
to see what they can do to limit disfigurement for the seven who had
skin grafts.
   The Hardin County school system has worked to smooth the way for
the students by inviting a burn specialist to lead a seminar for
school staff in August. Sharon Rengers, a nurse at Kosair Children's
Hospital in Louisville, gave a similar presentation to students at
Alton Middle School in September.
   She said many teen-agerss associate burn patients with Freddy
Krueger, the disfigured character in the ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
horror movies. ``I have to tell them, `Burn patients are not
monsters. They're the same people; they just look different.'''
   But she said it's natural for patients to worry about their
looks. ``Physical appearance is a big part of our culture. It's even
more important for teens.''
   The battle now, therapists say, is to get the patients to wear
the pressure garments. Trina said her friends yell at her when she
tries to take them off. But other students have resisted the
treatment because the garments are noticeable and often
uncomfortable.
   Dotty Pearman said her daughter, Christy, a freshman at North
Hardin High School, has come home in tears on several occasions
after people commented about her appearance or voice, which is
deeper because her vocal chords burned, grew together and had to be
surgically separated.
   Christy also has second- and third-degree burns on her arm and
shoulders.
   Said Christy: ``The memory will always be there. And then you
look down and see the scar to remind you.''

<HEAD>No Word From Arafat on Crash Probe Aid, Reagan Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with Reagan saying U.S. has not heard from Arafat;
picks up 5th graf pvs, The FBI chief.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

   President Reagan said today the United States
has heard nothing from Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, on help in tracking down those responsible
for last month's bombing of a Pan American jetliner over Scotland.
   ``We've not heard from him,'' Reagan told reporters upon landing
here after spending the New Year's weekend in Palms Springs. ``If he
has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell us.''
   FBI Director William Sessions had said on Sunday that Arafat has
``a wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of
the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people.
   Without the PLO's help, Sessions said on two television interview
shows, the govenment expects a lengthy manhunt but is optimistic
that those responsible will be found eventually.
   ``We're set up for the long haul,'' he said. ``We have a pattern
and reputation for being able to solve'' such crimes.
   The FBI chief said he would welcome any help Arafat and his
Palestine Liberation Organization might provide. He said contacts
between the FBI and Arafat presumably could be set up by the State
Department.
   U.S. and PLO officials recently opened talks on the Arab-Israeli
conflict after Arafat disavowed terrorism and recognized Israel's
right to exist.
   Sessions said Arafat ``has a great deal of information, a wealth
of information he can give us.''
   Last week the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyasseh quoted an
unidentified PLO official as saying the organization was considering
a request by U.S. officials that the PLO help in tracking down those
responsible for the bombing.
   While welcoming Arafat's help in identifying possible suspects in
the Pan Am crash, Sessions said he opposes any attempt by the PLO
leader to retaliate by killing any suspects.
   Arafat has blamed terrorists for bringing down the jetliner,
condemning it as an ``inhuman criminal action.''
   Asked about reports that Arafat is consider organizing an
assassination team to retailiate against those who planted the bomb,
Sessions said, ``We believe in the system of justice. We hope those
people are handled in the courts.''
   Sessions said he has no evidence as yet to confirm the bombing
was the work of terrorists rather than a non-political criminal act
aimed at an individual on board the jet.
   He also said that 62 bodies from the crash have been identified
through fingerprinting.
   Meawhile, Alan McArtor, head of the Federal Aviation
Adminstration, also appeared on ``Meet the Press,'' and defended the
policy of not publicizing threats to airliners.
   ``These threats are transmitted on a routine basis,'' he said.
   But McArtor conceded that it was mistake for the United States to
warn overseas embassy personnel about the threat to Pan Am jets
while not alerting the public.
   ``Personally, I don't think it was managed well,'' he said.
   McArtor said an alert has been issued to the Athens airport and
others in the Mediterranean area to be on the lookout for false
passports.
   ``There has been movement of some known terrorists who have in
their possession false passports,'' McArtor said.
   He also said the FAA will negotiate with European allies to seek
improved airline security.
   ``This is a threat against civil aviation. It's not just isolated
to American carriers,'' he said.
   On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, and
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the United States should keep open
the possibility of military retaliation against any nation linked to
terrorist attacks.
   ``The military option always has to be there,'' Hamilton said.
``But we don't want to indiscriminately bomb areas.''
   In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced
herself from U.S. talk of punishing whoever planted the bomb.
   ``I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever
valid,'' she said. ``The most important thing to do is to try to get
the cooperation of all nations to track these people down so that
they are brought to justice,'' she said in a British television
interview.

   A woman celebrating her birthday with her
husband broke into hysteria after returning home to find that a fire
had destroyed their wooden house, killing 10 people, including their
four children.
   Firefighters had to restrain Nancy Watson when she repeatedly
tried to enter the burned-out two-story house, said Valerie Pound, a
witness.
   ``There was no house to get back into. It was just gone,'' Pound
said. ``She kept screaming the names of her four kids in a pattern,
one right after another.''
   Three walls and the roof already had collapsed when firefighters
arrived early Sunday, said Fire Chief Leo Renn.
   The bodies of the badly burned victims were in or near their beds.
   ``It's probably the worst situation I've seen where 10 people are
killed at one time,'' said Cass County Sheriff Jim Dawson. ``It's
just devastating.''
   Killed were John and Nancy Watson's children, Jenny, 14,
Samantha, 11, Edward, 9, and William, 8; Mrs. Watson's sister and
brother-in-law, Jean and Becky Smischney; their two children, Jay,
10, and Kimberly, 8; and Michelle Bastle, 10, and Robin Bastle, 12,
daughters of Tony and Nancy Bastle, who live near the Watsons.
   Elsewhere, New Year's weekend fires killed at least 23 people,
including four in Charlotte, N.C., and four in Anchorage, Alaska,
since Saturday.
   Mrs. Watson was kept overnight for observation at Itasca Memorial
Hospital early today in the north-central Minnesota city of Grand
Rapids, 20 miles northeast of this town of 400 residents. She was
expected to be released today, hospital officials said.
   The fire spread so quickly it was unlikely anyone woke up before
being overcome by smoke, said Renn.
   It was sparked by a wood-burning stove or an oil space heater,
Renn said. He originally said the house was not equipped with smoke
detectors, which were not required by law. But later, after a
relative said there were indeed three smoke detectors in the house,
Renn said, ``We may have to retract that.''
   The fire was discovered by passing motorists, who stopped at the
house of Melody Berczyk across the road from the Watson home. ``It
was one big ball of flame right then,'' said Berczyk, who called the
fire department.
   A crisis intervention team was asked to come to the elementary
school Tuesday to help the children deal with the deaths of their
classmates. ``Hopefully, we'll just all pull together,'' said
Principal Mike Doro.
   The Watsons had left the children with her sister and
brother-in-law, who were visiting from Bemidji, to celebrate Mrs.
Watson's 32nd birthday on New Year's Eve.
   Tammy Grover, a stepsister of John Watson, said the Watson
children loved the outdoors.
   ``They had pet rabbits and geese and ducks,'' she said.
   ``Jenny liked drawing and painting a lot, especially unicorns and
horses. She just won $75 in a contest at school, which was a really
big thing to her,'' Grover said.
   The Watsons, who are unemployed, ``were a poor family as far as
material things go, but they were a very close family,'' said Pound.
   She said a fund has been set up for the victims' families at the
Security State Bank in Remer.
   ``In a small town, everyone is family,'' she said. ``This is by
far the most devastating thing that has ever happened to this town.
   ``Everybody will pull together and help in any way you can. Even
though it's not going to bring the kids back, the families will know
that everyone in this town is hurt by what happened and is behind
them. This has touched everybody,'' Pound said.
   In other fires, Anchorage police said two adults and two children
were killed in a trailer fire Sunday. Seven people died in fires in
Anchorage during all of 1988, authorities said.
   Four members of a Charlotte family died and three others were
injured in a New Year's Day fire blamed on smoldering smoking
materials in their cinder-block house, fire officials said. Killed
were a woman, 26, her 18-month-old son, her sister, 11, and the
sisters' 65-year-old great-uncle. Two of the injured were in in
critical condition, authorities said.
   Two boys, ages 4 months and 2 years, were killed and a 5-year-old
boy was critically injured in a fire at a Philadelphia public
housing project this morning, authorities said. The cause was under
investigation.
   A father and son died in a house fire Sunday in Marion, Ohio. The
father carried his wife through their burning home to safety before
re-entering the house, where he died in an unsuccessful effort to
save his 20-year-old son, authorities said.
   In Wisconsin, New Year's Day fires killed one person in a
Waukesha hotel room and one in a Racine residence.
   In New York state, a couple was found dead in a bedroom closet
following an early Sunday fire that destroyed their home in
Willsboro along Lake Champlain; and a 7-year-old girl died and her
3-year-old brother was critically injured Sunday evening when a fire
engulfed their two-story home in Ogdensburg.
   In Portland, Maine, a mother and her infant daughter were killed
in a house with a defective smoke detector on New Year's Eve,
officials said.
   An 11-year-old boy was arrested and charged with murder in an
apartment fire that killed a 53-year-old man in the southern Maine
city of Biddeford on Saturday night, officials said.
   In Wichita, Kan., a house fire early Saturday killed a
firefighter and a woman and left her husband in serious condition,
authorities said.
   A 20-year-old Kansas City, Mo., man died in a fire in his house
Sunday.

<HEAD>Part of Tail Section Recovered, Village to Be Rebuilt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searchers on Monday recovered part of
the tail section of Pan Am Flight 103, and civic officials said they
would meet to discuss plans for rebuilding parts of Lockerbie
destroyed by the crash.
   Police Superintendent Angus Kennedy said part of the Boeing 747's
tail section was found near Lengholm, about 15 miles east of
Lockerbie, along with ``sizable pieces'' of nearby wreckage that has
not been identified.
   ``The area is very rough terrain and there has been no
confirmation yet from the accident investigators about what parts of
the aircraft are there (other than the tail part),'' he said.
   Only 20 percent of the jumbo jet had been recovered from the
crash site, although other parts of the plane have been seen, he
said.
   All 259 passengers and crew members on the New York-bound jet
died in the Dec. 21 crash. Authorities have recovered three bodies
of 11 townspeople presumed killed on the ground.
   Ten houses were destroyed by falling wreckage, replaced by a
crater 100 feet long and 30 feet deep. Another 30 homes were badly
damaged.
   Les Jardine, spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway regional
council, said council officials would meet with residents to discuss
rebuilding plans.
   Thirteen bodies were identified Monday, including that of
passenger Ingrid Smith, Kennedy said. Ms. Smith's husband, Capt.
Bruce Smith, a Pan Am pilot, accused local police over the weekend
of being ``paralyzed by inexperience and incompetence'' and of
delaying the return of victims' bodies to their relatives.
   Chief Constable John Boyd of the Dumfries and Galloway police
force said he sympathized with bereaved relatives, but added
everything was being done to positively identify the victims. He
said 81 of the 242 recovered bodies have been released. No bodies
were recovered Monday.
   ``Every effort continues to be made to identify and release
victims' bodies to their families,'' he said. ``The trauma and grief
experienced by relatives continues to be uppermost in our minds.''
   In a related development, passengers on Scandinavian Airlines
System faced delays Monday as the airline issued a worldwide
security alert after receiving a bombing threat, officials said.
   The warning was received early Sunday from Hungarian police
through Interpol in Paris, said SAS spokesman John Herbert. A
security alert was transmitted to about 90 international airports
used by SAS aircraft, Herbert said.
   Budapest radio reported that an unknown caller telephoned police
headquarters in the Hungarian capital, warning that an SAS airliner
would be blown up. The report did not elaborate.
   Security at Athens airport also was tightened. A police spokesman
said security had been increased around Pan Am, TWA and several Arab
airline terminals and baggage check-in counters.
   The Flight 103 investigation is focused on the Lockerbie crash
site, Frankfurt Airport and London's Heathrow Airport. The flight
originated as a Boeing 727 in Frankfurt and, following a stop in
Heathrow, left for New York on the jumbo jet.
   In Frankfurt, a prosecutor's spokesman said Monday the Pan Am jet
had been carrying four U.S. military mail sacks and a bank document
pouch that were not checked by Frankfurt airport security officials.
The Munich-based weekly magazine Bunte quoted an unidentified
security expert as saying the bomb could have been smuggled in with
the mail.
   Spokesman Hubert Harth at the federal prosecutor's office in
Frankfurt said the post bags and bank pouch were not checked by
airport security ``because they had been continuously under the
control of U.S. military officials.''
   FBI Director William Sessions said Sunday he welcomed any
information Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
could provide in identifying suspects.
   The Sunday Express, a London daily, reported without attribution
that Arafat had vowed to dispatch an assassination squad to hunt
down and kill the bomber.
   Arafat ``has a great deal of information, a wealth of information
he can give us,'' Sessions said in an interview.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced herself Sunday from
U.S. vows to punish the culprits.
   ``I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever
valid,'' Ms. Thatcher said on the ``David Frost on Sunday'' program.
``The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of
all nations to track these people down so that they are brought to
justice.''

<TEXT>
   A revamped Christian Science Monitor makes its
debut Tuesday, with color photography, fewer pages and less
advertising all aimed at streamlining the newspaper Mary Baker Eddy
founded 80 years ago.
   The changes prompted an exodus in November of top management at
the church-run daily newspaper, including the departure of Pulitzer
Prize-winning editor Katherine Fanning.
   But company executives said Monday that five years of research
showed the newspaper's readers, faced with other demands on their
time, wanted more concise articles and ``greater selectivity'' of
coverage.
   ``In short, they continue to look to the Monitor for the context
and perspective of events, and want a serious paper that can be read
thoroughly in about 30 minutes,'' John H. Hoagland Jr., manager of
the Christian Science Publishing Society said Monday in a statement.
The society publishes the Monitor.
   The newspaper, published Monday through Friday with a circulation
of about 170,000, is still a tabloid. But it will now be 20 pages,
smaller by about eight pages in its new format which limits national
advertising to two pages and eliminates local and classified ads.
   In addition, the staff of 160 people are among the 800 members of
the publishing society and broadcasting operation due for cutbacks
of 20 percent to 25 percent, said Don Feldheim, spokesman for
publishing society. Supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the
church $20 million a year.
   Mrs. Fanning, who became the first woman editor of the Monitor in
1983, resigned along with her managing editor and assistant managing
editor in November.
   She said she left rather than see the newspaper reduced in size,
while also losing independence under a restructured management that
concentrated more on the church's broadcasting arm.

<HEAD>Small Chippewa Band Considers Settlement on Food-Gathering Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLE LAKE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Wisconsin's smallest Chippewa
band have recommended that tribal members approve the state's
proposed $10 million settlement to limit the band's hunting and
fishing treaty rights.
   The Chippewa's exercise of treaty rights has been a source of
controversy and protest by sportsfishermen and other outdoorsmen who
argue it is unfair for Indians to use methods or seasons prohibited
others and that the exercise of the court-upheld food-gathering
rights may harm or deplete natural resources.
   Earl A. Charlton, an attorney representing the Sokaogon Chippewa,
said the Tribal Council unanimously adopted the final draft of an
agreement with the State Justice Department and recommended it for
approval by the community.
   A meeting is scheduled Tuesday night to introduce the settlement,
and a Jan. 14 referendum has been set, said council member Charles
Ackley.
   If the agreement is ratified, it must be approved by the
Legislature and signed by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson by Feb. 15,
Charlton said.
   He said the agreement calls for payments of $1 million each year
for 10 years and that 75 percent of the money is to go toward
economic development and the rest is to pay for health and social
programs.
   The Sokaogon band would have to give up some rights, including
spearfishing outside of that for ceremonial purposes. The band would
be limited to 100 fish speared per year, he said.
   The band also would forfeit its right to harvest timber on public
land except for firewood, he said. The agreement could be extended
for an additional 15 years at the option of both parties.
   Assistant Attorney General Stephen Nicks, who drafted the
agreement, refused to say over the weekend whether offers similar to
that prepared for the Sokaogon band have been drawn up for five
other Chippewa bands in northern Wisconsin.
   State and tribal lawyers have negotiated for months in an attempt
to reach an agreement over the Chippewa's off-reservation claims to
natural resources guaranteed by 19th-century federal treaties.
   The tribe's insistence on using spears to catch game fish, a
technique ordinarily forbidden by the state Department of Natural
Resources, has been a volatile subject between tribal
traditionalists and treaty critics.
   Justice Department spokesman Frank Ryan said he could not comment
whether similar deals were under consideration by other bands.
   The Sokaogon is believed to be the smallest Chippewa band in
Wisconsin, with about 1,300 members at Mole Lake, Charlton said.

   Ranasinghe Premadasa was sworn in as
president Monday in a Buddhist ceremony at the Temple of the Tooth,
and he again appealed for an end to the ethnic violence that has
devastated the tropical island.
   ``Further delay in finding a solution will enable certain
elements to destroy many more innocent lives. This destruction must
end because democracy cannot tolerate it,'' Premadasa said in his
inaugural address.
   Premadasa, 64, took the oaths of office and secrecy before Chief
Justice Parinda Ranaginshe during a two-hour ceremony in this
picturesque hill town, 85 miles east of Colombo, the capital.
   Heavily armed soldiers surrounded the sacred Temple of the Tooth,
where more than 500,000 people gathered to watch the ceremony.
Police sharpshooters were perched on surrounding roofs, and troop on
the ground checked all those entering the city.
   Premadasa won a six-year term by defeating two opponents in the
Dec. 19 presidential election. He polled 50.4 percent of the vote,
although only 55 percent of the 9.3 million eligible voters cast
ballots.
   He succeeds his mentor, Junius R. Jayewaredene, as president
after serving as his prime minister for 11 years. The president
wields supreme power in Sri Lanka.
   Premadasa assumes the task of ruling a nation reeling from five
years of strife between the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese and the
Hindu Tamils.
   Nearly 10,000 people have died since 1983 when Tamil militants
began fighting for independence from the majority Sinhalese. The
fighting also has left the national economy in shambles, ruining the
island's crucial tourism industry and reducing agricultural
production.
   Premadasa also faces an uneasy relationship with regional
superpower India, which sent an estimated 47,000 peacekeeping troops
to Sri Lanka 18 months ago to disarm the rebels and enforce a
cease-fire.
   The insurgency has yet to be quelled, however, and Premadasa said
he wants the unpopular Indian soldiers to leave.
   On Sunday, the Indian government announced it would start
withdrawing its troops this week at Premadasa's request. Between
2,000 and 3,000 soldiers are expected to leave within days.
   The remaining troops will be gradually pulled out, the government
said, but gave no timetable.
   Speaking from the octagonal central courtyard of the ancient
Buddhist shrine, Premadasa in his inaugural speech vowed he would
not allow ``a single inch'' of Sri Lankan soil to be occupied by any
foreign country again.
   ``Let us settle our problems by ourselves through negotiations
and mutual respect. We should not create situations that provoke or
invite foreign intervention,'' he said.
   Unlike most of Sri Lanka's ruling elite, Premadasa was born in
the slums of Colombo.
   During his campaign, he frequently said he was the only candidate
who could champion the poor in this country where the per capital
annual income of $360.
   Premadasa joined the United National Party in 1956 and entered
Parliament four years later. When the party returned to power in
1977, he became Jayewardene's prime minister.
   He remained at that post throughout Jayewardene's term, although
the two men had some policy differences, most prominently over the
Indian-sponsored accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion.
   The pact, signed on July 29, 1987, offered limited autonomy to
Tamil community in the north and east provinces and invited India to
send peacekeeping soldiers to combat the rebels who still demand
independence.
   Jayewardene signed the accord. Premadasa opposes it.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
They claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government.
   The biggest and most militant Tamil rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected the accord, saying it did not meet
enought of their demands for self-rule.
   A radical Sinhalese group, the People's Liberation Front, also
denounced the pact, claiming it granted too many concessions to the
Tamil community. The Front has been blamed for more than 900 murders
since the accord was signed. Most victims have been government
supporters.
   During the campaign, Premadasa took pains not to blame Sinhalese
extremists for escalating violence. He has yet to say how he will
deal with the radicals, but pledged to provide security to any
member of extremists groups.
   ``I call upon those who have not joined the democratic process to
do so,'' he said. ``I am available at any time, anywhere to discuss
any problem.''

   Afghanistan reported scores of people
killed and dozens wounded Monday, the second day of a New Year's
cease-fire proclaimed by the Soviet-backed regime but rejected by
the Moslem guerrillas.
   Two insurgent leaders criticized the Soviet Union for considering
a role in a future Afghan government for former King Zahir Shah, who
was overthrown in 1973 and lives in Italy.
   Iran said Yuri Vorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister,
arrived in Tehran for talks with Afghan insurgent leaders based in
Iran. He met in Saudi Arabia last month with Burhanuddin Rabbani,
leader of a seven-faction alliance based in Pakistan.
   At least 5.5 million Afghans have fled their country during a
decade of civil war, nearly all of them to Pakistan or Iran, Moslem
nations that are Afghanistan's neighbors on the east and west.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December
1979. An estimated 115,000 were there when a U.N.-mediated
withdrawal agreement was signed April 14, 1988.
   Red Army soldiers started leaving May 15 and U.N. officials said
half were gone by Aug. 15. All are to be out by Feb. 15.
   The insurgents, supported by the United States and Pakistan, have
demanded an Islamic government after the Soviets leave and are
trying to overthrow the regime of President Najib.
   Najib announced the cease-fire Friday, effective New Year's Day,
and said government forces would not fire unless fired upon.
   Insurgent leaders believe Najib's government will fall when the
Soviets are gone and rejected the truce because, they said, it would
be a disadvantage to them at this stage.
   State radio in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, said Monday that
insurgents attacked Kandahar in the southeast, killing three
civilians and wounding six.
   It said 31 guerrillas were killed and 27 wounded in an ensuing
battle with security forces.
   Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, said the guerrillas fired on
residential areas of Paktia, near the Pakistani border, and security
forces returned the fire, killing 17 insurgents.
   Two more battles, in which 23 guerrillas were slain, occurred at
Jalalabad and Gushta in Nangarahar province, the radio claimed. It
did not mention government casualties and there was no independent
confirmation of its reports.
   In Islamabad, insurgent leaders Rabbani and Gulbadin Hekmatyar
criticized the Soviets for overtures to the former king. Vorontsov,
who also is Moscow's ambassador to Kabul, met with Zahir Shah in
Rome on Dec. 24.
   ``Zahir Shah will certainly not feel safe in the revolutionary
Afghanistan,'' Rabbani said at a news conference, and Hekmatyar
declared the king ``has no place in today's Afghanistan.''
   ``The Afghan people will strongly resist any move against
formation of an Islamic government in Kabul,'' Hekmatyar said.

   Students chanted pro-democracy slogans
Monday as they marched in a funeral cortege with 100,000 other
mourners to bury the widow of Burmese independence leader Aung San.
   The students defied a ban on public gatherings to accompany the
body of Daw Khin Kyi along the five-mile route from her home to the
burial site on the southern end of Rangoon's Shwedagon Pagoda.
   It was the first student march since a military crackdown in
September. No soldiers were seen near the crowds, although some
armed personnel stood a distance away. A few police officers kept
order.
   Daw Khin Kyi, 77, died Dec. 27 after a long illness. She was the
widow of Gen. Aung San, who was assassinated in 1947. She also was
the mother of Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the major
opposition party, the National League For Democracy.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, who returned to Rangoon from her home in
England to care for her ailing mother, played a key role in the
recent demonstrations against authoritarian rule in Burma.
   The student-led demonstrations ended when soldiers killed
hundreds of protesters and military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized
power in a coup Sept. 18, and authorities banned politically
motivated public gatherings.
   The students defied the ban during the 2{-hour funeral procession.
   ``We won't forget our colleagues who have fallen in the fight for
democracy!'' they sang. ``We will continue our struggle!''
   Students carried placards with other anti-government slogans.
Marchers also carried banners and flags of the National League for
Democracy, the All Burma Students Federation and the Rangoon
University Students Union.
   Many people paid their respects to Daw Khin Kyi during the week
at her home. On Sunday, Saw Maung signed a condolence book at the
house and spoke to Aung San Suu Kyi and her brother, Aung San Oo.
   Aung San Oo arrived from the United States, where he has been
living as an American citizen. Burmese law does not permit Burmese
with foreign citizenship to return to the country, even as tourists,
but Saw Maung made an exception for Aung San Oo to attend the
funeral. Aung San Suu Kyi has remained a Burmese citizen.
   The government donated about $1,670 for funeral expenses and
allowed the construction of a special tomb for Daw Khin Kyi near the
tombs of the last queen of Burma and of former U.N.
Secretary-General U Thant.
   Four government ministers attended the funeral and Ne Win, whose
26-year rule of Burma ended with his resignation last year, sent a
wreath.

<HEAD>Bakkers Return To Television Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PINEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founders Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker
returned to the television pulpit Monday for the first time in two
years with an appeal for ``hurting people'' to keep the faith, but
no direct pleas for donations.
   ``If Jim and Tammy can survive their holocaust of the last two
years, then you can make it,'' said Bakker, who left PTL in March
1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal.
   ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' originated in the living room of the
Bakkers' borrowed home in this Charlotte suburb. They said it was
sent by satellite to a half-dozen stations in California, Ohio, New
York, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, with the couple's new ministry
paying for air time.
   The hourlong telecast is scheduled Mondays through Fridays.
   ``We bought time,'' said Mrs. Bakker. ``We had a certain amount
of money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot of
money, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.''
   In their prime at PTL, the Bakkers and their ``PTL Club'' could
be seen on about 180 television stations.
   As in their old show, the Bakkers sat on a couch. Mrs. Bakker
wore her trademark heavy eye makeup and broke into tears several
times, the first just two minutes into their show.
   The couple made no direct appeal for funds, but gave an address
and telephone number so viewers could request prayers.
   And the show's guest, former PTL songwriter Mike Murdock, gave
Mrs. Bakker a card which he said he had been asked to deliver by a
supporter. Mrs. Bakker said the card contained a $1,000 check.
   John Bland, a volunteer at Jim and Tammy Ministries, said
Monday's show drew ``a beautiful response.''
   ``A lot of people called in who said they were partners
(supporters who gave $1,000 or more to PTL) and glad to see that
they were back on TV,'' Bland said.
   The Bakkers' last appearance as television evangelists was in
January 1987, two months before the scandal that drove them from
PTL. They had left the air because Mrs. Bakker was receiving
treatment for dependency on prescription drugs and for pneumonia,
the couple said at the time.
   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''
Mrs. Bakker said as the show began.
   Bakker told viewers that his last television appearance was to
break ground for the Crystal Palace Church at Heritage USA, the home
of PTL.
   ``I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' Bakker said. ``I
think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built.
... I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and Tammy
Bakker.'''
   Bakker resigned from PTL following disclosure of his 1980 sexual
encounter with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and that she had
been paid for her silence.
   In June 1987, the ministry sought protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court, and last month a judge approved the sale of PTL's
chief asset, the Heritage USA theme park at Fort Mill, S.C.
   Also last month, Bakker and a top aide were indicted on charges
they used PTL funds for private gain.
   But the only mention of his legal troubles during the show came
when Murdock noted a song he said he wrote in a lawyer's office.
Murdock said he knew Bakker ``didn't know anything about lawyers.''
   ``Oh no-o-o-o,'' Bakker said with a pained chuckle.
   Fred Wuenschel, general manager WOCD in Amsterdam, N.Y., one of
the stations broadcasting the program, said he would show it ``as
long as they keep paying.''
   He said the station has a 30-day contract for the show, but
declined to say how much the Bakkers are paying except to say it was
``the usual rate per hour.''

<HEAD>Cab Drivers On Patrol Against Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For just $300, police have added 40
recruits to patrol the streets of this northern Kentucky city. They
don't make arrests, but they will drive people to jail _ for a fee.
   The recruits are the drivers of De-Luxe Yellow Cabs Inc., who
have enlisted in a 2-week-old program to give police more eyes and
ears in the streets.
   ``This is an excellent opportunity for us to take advantage of
the fact that cab drivers operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week
on the same streets that we patrol,'' said Sgt. Bill Dorsey, a
police administrative supervisor.
   Under the new program, Taxis On Patrol, cab drivers report
suspicious activity to dispatchers over two-way radios. The
dispatchers then notify police.
   ``You name it and we see it,'' said cab driver Bob Sterling. ``We
stop fights, rapes and all of those things.''
   Still, authorities say they don't want cab drivers to stop
crimes, just to tell police about them.
   ``We're not asking them to do police work or to get involved,''
said city Commissioner Butch Callery. ``They're strictly to call an
event in and alert us to the situation.''
   Callery proposed the taxi program after reading about similar
efforts elsewhere. ``It'll never take the place of more policemen,
but it will assist us,'' the commissioner said.
   The $300 start-up cost of the program covered a 2{-hour training
program for drivers and the printing of decals affixed to the taxis.
   Authorities in Nashville, Tenn., tried a similar system in 1983,
but gave up after cab drivers lost interest, said Walter Lawhorn, an
inspector for the Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Taxicab
Board.
   Assistant City Manager Gregory Jarvis said the Covington program
hasn't been in effect long enough to determine its impact. But, he
said, ``It certainly can't hurt.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
slowly may be winning converts to his policy of glasnost, or
openness, but whether the word merits inclusion in a U.S. dictionary
remains under debate.
   The honor likely to be accorded such all-American terms as
``televangelist'' and ``computer virus'' in upcoming Merriam-Webster
dictionaries has so far been denied the word describing Gorbachev's
reforms.
   ``It is still most often found in either italics or quotes and to
us that means it has not been completely Americanized,'' said James
G. Lowe, senior editor at Springfield-based G.C. Merriam Inc. ``When
reporters and writers start using it without explaining what it
means it will be ready for consideration for the dictionary.''
   The term ``computer virus'' came into wide use too late for this
year's book, but it is an almost sure bet for inclusion in the next
addendum to the company's unabridged dictionary, Lowe said, thanks
to a graduate student who this autumn unleashed a ``virus'' that
clogged university and military computers and exposed the
vulnerability of computer banks to infection.
   ``Televangelist,'' ``colorization,'' as used to describe the
tinting of old black-and-white films, and ``zap,'' when used to
describe what happens to a television commercial when a viewer
switches to another channel by remote control, are also likely
candidates for the unabridged dictionary, he said.

   Monday was a holiday within a holiday for
many parents who had the day off but sent their children back to
school.
   The federal and state New Year's Day holiday was observed by many
school systems, but it was back to the books for students in public
schools here.
   ``I don't want to go,'' said Joe Alexander, 14, as he boarded a
school bus bound for Attucks Junior High. ``It's not fair for us to
go on a federal holiday.''
   A lot of students _ and parents _ apparently had the same
opinion, as the absentee rate shot up to near 40 percent at some
schools. Overall, attendance was termed ``fair'' by officials.
   Frank Tout, principal at Howe High School, estimated that between
60 percent and 65 percent of the school's 1,609 students were in
class.
   Although Christmas vacation started earlier at city schools than
at other school systems, another day off would have been nice, most
students agreed.
   ``I don't like it,'' said Jesse Harper, 12, another Attucks
student. ``My dad is staying home today and I wanted to stay with
him.''
   But some were more than ready to return.
   ``I wanted to go to school today,'' said Missy Frazier, 14, an
eighth-grader at Attucks. ``I get bored at home.''

<HEAD>Trade Unions Ready for More Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's prime minister told trade union
leaders Monday the economy still needs price increases, but his
listeners hinted that imposing them might lead to a recurrence of
violent strikes.
   Steep price increases announced Dec. 26 led to demonstrations and
a general strike. Four people died and scores were injured before
union leaders called off the protests Saturday, two days after the
government rescinded the price increases.
   On Monday, more than 500 leaders of trade and professional
organizations met with Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi to discuss the
impact of the violence and the government's failure to endorse an
initiative to end civil war in southern Sudan.
   In addition to the rollback on prices, the government gave in to
a demand by the Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation to make
salary increases of up to 500 percent retroactive to July 1, instead
of Dec. 1 as the government had ordered.
   While Mahdi conceded the price increases may have been too high _
as much as 600 percent for sugar _ he said prices on some items had
to be raised. He promised to stay away from important foods,
however, and said subsidies on sorghum, the Sudanese staple, and
medicines wouldn't be touched.
   ``There are other possibilities and other more reasonable (price)
increases that I don't want to go into now,'' Mahdi said.
   He said the price of sugar, extremely important in the Sudanese
culture, must be increased to cover its production costs and to
prevent smuggling into neighboring countries.
   ``Any steps must not affect the workers and struggling people and
add to their burdens,'' said Abdel-Wahab Sinada, representative of
the professional associations. ``We reject any increase in prices.
We are ready for civil disobedience and general strikes.''
   Professional groups carry considerable weight in Sudan and played
a decisive role in the 1985 military coup that ousted the
authoritarian pro-Western president, Gaafar Nimeiri. Tradesmen and
students were the major forces behind last week's disturbances.
   Western observers fear the trade and professional unions might
join forces with the Democratic Unionist Party, still angered over
Mahdi's handling of the peace agreement it reached a month and a
half ago with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   During the strike, the Unionists resigned from the coalition
Cabinet headed by the Umma Party in sympathy with the demonstrators
and outrage over the prime minister's stand on the peace agreement.
   Mahdi apparently refused to officially endorse the agreement
because of a clause advocating suspension of the 1,400-year-old
Islamic legal code, which was sure to anger the fundamentalist
National Islamic Front _ the third-largest Cabinet partner and
Mahdi's buffer against his traditional opponents, the Democratic
Unionists.
   Publicly, Mahdi says he objects to the pact's clauses eliminating
defense treaties with other countries and ending emergency rule,
which has been Nimeiri's overthrow in 1985.
   The unions have been demanding immediate implementation of the
peace plan and a cease-fire in the 5{-year-old civil war on ground
it would save the country $275 million a year. Sudan's foreign debt
is $14 billion, and Khartoum owes more than $900 million in interest
it can't pay.
   ``It is slowly but surely building up into another explosive
situation,'' a Western political observer said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The (Democratic Unionist Party) is gathering forces with the
southern and communist parties and the trade and professional
unions, calling for implementing the peace initiative. This will
sooner or later spill into the streets in demonstrations, and this
could be ugly.''
   John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, called
for Mahdi's resignation in a New Year's Day radio broadcast from
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He suggested direct peace talks with Sudanese
army generals, ``especially those fighting in the south.''
   Defending his views on the agreement, Mahdi told union leaders,
``We do not disagree on the peace issue, but there are specific
points in the initiative that have to be resolved.''
   He agreed to form a committee with the union leaders to discuss
possible solutions to the civil war and the economic situation.

   Rival Shiite Moslems fought with grenades
in Beirut and rockets in south Lebanon's shattered apple orchards
Monday, the third day of their latest battle in a sporadic war that
began nine months ago.
   Police said eight people were killed and 25 wounded in the Shiite
slums of south Beirut, and five were slain and 14 wounded in
fighting near Israel's ``security zone'' along the border.
   Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation radio said Iran was sending
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani to negotiate peace
between Amal, a Shiite militia backed by Syria, and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, which is strong in the slums and has tried to expand in
south Lebanon. The report gave no details.
   Twenty people have been killed and 47 wounded since the fighting
began Saturday, said a police spokesman, whose name cannot be used
under standing rules.
   Syrian peacekeeping troops called a ``total and comprehensive''
cease-fire at midday, but it collapsed four hours later.
   Bulldozers demolished sandbag barricades and earth mounds set up
by both sides along a stretch of the slums along the highway to
Beirut's airport.
   Hezbollah fighters in black headbands hurled grenades in a charge
backed by mortar fire and overran a police station in south Beirut's
Ghobeiri district, the spokesman said.
   Amal militiamen responded with heavy fire from tanks stationed in
nearby woods as a dozen policemen sprinted to safety under heavy
rain, the spokesman added.
   He said the two sides were locked in house-to-house fighting in
Ghobeiri and the neighboring district of Haret Hreik.
   Amal, a mainstream militia whose name means Hope, and the
fundamentalist Hezbollah (Party of God) are struggling for dominance
of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in the country.
   Each accuses the other of starting the latest battle, their most
intense since November, when 40 people were killed and 87 were
wounded during six days of fighting in west and south Beirut.
   Police said thousands of residents had been living in basements
and bomb shelters since New Year's Eve in the Shiyah, Ghobeiri,
Haret Hreik and Mesharafiyeh slum districts.
   Several Beirut radio stations said Syria planned to review its
deployment of 4,500 soldiers in the slums to ``improve their
performance and prevent further fighting.''
   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker and has about 40,000
soldiers in the country, including at least 7,500 in the Moslem
sectors of Beirut. It first sent troops into the 16 square miles of
slums in May, after a three-week battle between Amal and Hezbollah
in which 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   In south Lebanon, the current fighting is the most serious
between Amal and Hezbollah since four days in April in which 62 were
killed and 150 wounded.
   South Lebanon police said Amal and Hezbollah used mortars and
rockets against each other's strongholds in Iklim el-Tuffah, the
``apple province'' whose orchards have fallen victim to 13 years of
sectarian and factional war.
   The region runs from Sidon to the border ``security zone'' Israel
established in 1985 when it withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon
after three years of invasion and ocupation.
   An Amal statement said its fighters drove Hezbollah militiamen
from Jbaa, Jarjou, Arabsalim and Ein Biswar villages with a
two-pronged dawn offensive.
   One from Hezbollah communique said the assault was repulsed
``with God's help'' in two hours of heavy fighting, but Amal then
``clamped a siege on the area, preventing food and water supplies
from moving in.''
   It said Hezbollah fighters in the area belonged to the Islamic
Resistance Front, a coalition of fundamentalist factions that raids
the security zone, which is defended by Israeli soldiers and and
their predominantly Christian surrogate militia.

   More than 25,000 people demonstrated in
the southern town of Bou-Saada after rumors were spread the southern
town would not be made an administrative center, Algerian radio
reported Monday.
   The radio reported no violence in the Saharan community 155 miles
south of Algiers during the Sunday protests.
   The protests were prompted by rumors that Bou-Saada was to be
removed from a list of 14 communities to be promoted to the level of
prefectures, or seats of regional administration. The new status
would give the community benefits such as government credits and
greater administrative autonomy.
   Bou-Saada, surrounded by a desert region populated by nomads, has
about 60,000 residents.
   The Interior Ministry said no final decision had been made on
which towns would be selected as prefectures in the government's
administrative reorganization.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
listed in satisfactory and stable condition Monday but could walk a
little, a doctor said.
   St. Francis Medical Center Nursing Supervisor Mary Kravutske read
a statement by Dr. Livingston Wong that said Marcos was able to
stand and take a few steps alone, but was still very weak.
   Kravutske said Marcos, 71, would remain hospitalized at least
until Tuesday.
   Marcos was admitted to the hospital Thursday after suffering
another episode of congestive heart failure. He spent nine days in

   Geraldo Rivera's brawl, Bryant Gumbel's suits
and heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's marital antics were
among the ``monkey business'' in 1988 accorded their due in TV
Guide's eighth annual J. Fred Muggs awards.
   The awards, named after the chimpanzee who appeared on the
original ``Today'' show, appear in the Jan. 7 edition of the
magazine.
   The J. Fred Mugged Award went to Rivera, whose nose was broken in
a brawl that broke out between civil-rights leader Roy Innis and a
group of white supremacists during the taping of his syndicated show.
   The Peacock Award for Olympic Splendor went to Gumbel, who TV
Guide said set an Olympic record by taking 18 designer suits with
him to cover the Games in Seoul forNBC.
   The on-again, off-again marriage of Tyson and actress Robin
Givens won them The Ralph and Alice Kramden Award for the Year's
Most Compatible Couple.
   Among other honors, The Rip Torn Award for the Most Colorful
Character Name went to CBS's ``The Cavanaughs,'' which had the title
family taking a vacation at a monastery run by a cleric called Abbot
Costello.

   Director Lawrence Kasdan is concerned his
latest movie, ``The Accidental Tourist,'' may be too subtle for
audiences used to such fare as ``The Empire Strikes Back'' and
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' _ adventure movies Kasdan wrote.
   His latest film, based on Anne Tyler's novel, is about a travel
writer whose 12-year-old son has just died and whose wife has left
him.
   Kasdan said he tried to follow the calm, cool tone of Tyler's
writing, but was concerned viewers used to action movies may not be
able to give his new film the close attention it requires.
   ``I worry that American audiences are not used to doing that
anymore,'' Kasdan said. ``Everything is handed to them. No small

   Paul S. Trible Jr., who had announced
plans to work for a Washington law firm after leaving the Senate
this week, says he also will join a Virginia Beach firm.
   Trible, a Republican who did not seek re-election, will join
Shuttleworth Ruloff Giordano &amp; Kahle. He also will practice with
Laxalt Washington Perito &amp; Dubuc, a 115-lawyer firm with offices in
Washington, Baltimore and New York. The Laxalt firm is headed by
former U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada.
   ``We met with Laxalt on Dec. 21 and went over possible
conflicts,'' said Thomas B. Shuttleworth of the Virginia Beach firm.
``They gave us a list of clients, and we gave them a list of clients
and we didn't have any conflicts.''
   Shuttleworth said it was not unusual for an attorney to practice
with more than one firm. Spokesmen from both firms declined to
disclose Trible's salary.
   Trible, a candidate for the GOP nomination for governor in 1989,
has expressed confidence in his ability to run a campaign while
practicing law.

<TEXT>
   ``The truth-tellers of the nation,'' have
spoken out in a new book by and about teen-agers and their views and
hopes.
   ``I'd like to be able to walk down American streets at midnight
with the same ease I'd walk down the street at noon,'' one
teen-ager, Tobdeleya Dumas of Cleveland, said in ``Voices of Hope.''
   Jana Reiss, of Galesburg, Ill., reflected on the maturation
process.
   ``As people grow older, they begin to see things in shades of
gray and not in simple black and white as they did as children,''
she was quoted in the book as saying. ``When I was a child, my
dreams were simple and selfish. Now I hope for feelings, not things.
I dream more for my friends and family, and less for myself.''
   American teen-agers are ``incredibly idealistic'' and want to
help solve society's problems, but often are frustrated because they
think they lack the means to make a difference, said Greg Jao, an
editor of the book.
   ``They honestly want to be able to talk to their parents and be
involved in politics, but they're also very cynical because they
don't feel any real change can come'' from their efforts, said Jao,
20.
   ``Voices of Hope'' follows ``Teenagers Themselves'' and ``Voices
of Conflict,'' a series researched by the staff of the student
newspaper at Glenbard East High School in this western Chicago
suburb.
   Staff members of the Echo newspaper traveled to 35 cities,
interviewed 2,000 students and collected questionnaires from 5,000
more in all 50 states, under the direction of journalism teacher and
newspaper adviser Howard Spanogle.
   ``Teen-agers are unique because they are the truth tellers of the
nation,'' Spanogle said.
   Students interviewed, ages 14 through 19, ranged from the
``wildly hedonistic stereotype'' of the inner cities to the ``deeply
religious'' of more rural areas, Jao said.
   ``As opposed to statistical studies ... we've tried for much more
of a qualitative approach,'' said Jao, now an English student at the
University of Chicago.
   Students want an end to all forms of discrimination _ against
them as young people and against minorities, Spanogle said.
   They seek ``communication between generations, equal treatment
for teen-agers, openness to all viewpoints, and awareness of social
problems,'' said Spanogle, who has been advising the newspaper for
21 years.
   Researchers also interviewed adults such as U.S. Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., for perspectives on issues that most concern teen-agers.
Nobel Prize-winner Leon Lederman, director of Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory near Batavia, Ill., asserts that science
education in the United States is ``bloody awful.'' And Doug Wood,
director of youth ministries at Dallas' First Baptist Church,
suggests ways the church can elevate the moral fiber of young people.
   Sean Mix of Seattle said of teen-age drinking: ``Teen views and
adult views don't really differ ... when it comes to handling
pressure ... because we handle it about the same way. Our parents
drink, and so do we.''
   Megan McKinney of Abilene, Texas, talked about morals.
   ``In order to know what is right or wrong ... consult the Bible.
Unfortunately, in an increasingly immoral society, people succumb to
their natural urges rather than overcome them,'' she said.
   ``One reason I believed sex should only happen within the
marriage vows came from the examply my parents `supposedly' set,''
said a South Carolina girl who was not identified by name. ``When I
found out a year ago that my parents were married in '69 instread of
'68, making me a child conceived out of wedlock, I was shocked and
confused.''
   The ideal family was on the mind of Kimberly Aretta of Uniontown,
Pa.
   ``The perfect family would be one that is always there for you
even if you're wrong ... one that understands the feelings of a
teen-ager and realizes we will make plenty of mistakes,'' she said.
   Jao said the book is a challenge to America to find ways for
teen-agers to channel their hopes and enthusiasm.
   ``Teens are incredibly idealistic,'' he said. ``There's a real
frustration people perceive as apathy, that they don't know how to
channel that energy. We need to find ways to channel that incredible
idealism.''
   The book and the two others in the series were published by Adama
Books of New York and is available at major bookstores nationwide.

<HEAD>Police: Bomb That Killed Four May Have Been Prank</HEAD>

   Four teen-agers who died in an accidental
pipe-bomb explosion apparently were building the powerful device for
fun, not for political or criminal reasons, according to reports
published Monday.
   ``They were all bright kids. ... Everything points to kids
looking at this as a challenge, like something they saw on TV and
said, `Hey, I can do that,''' an unidentified police official told
The (Baltimore) Sun.
   Another police source, also unidentified, told The Washington
Post the youths may have been planning a prank, ``like blowing up a
flagpole or something.''
   Dov Fischman, 18, and Samir Gafsi, 17, honor students who
graduated last year from Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School, were
killed instantly Saturday when the bomb detonated, apparently as
they were assembling it, police said.
   Two other youths, Bruno Perrone, 18, a freshman studying
chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, and Gustavo
Machado, 15, a sophomore at Walt Whitman, died later at Suburban
Hospital in Bethesda.
   Diego Soromenho-Ramos, a Walt Whitman classmate of the older
youths, said his friends were fascinated with chemistry.
   ``They were probably going to go to some field and see how big a
hole they could make,'' he said. ``They were peaceful people. They
would never try to hurt anybody.''
   The explosion occurred about 3:10 a.m. in a garage attached to a
brick home rented by Machado's parents. Because Gafsi and Fischman
were killed instantly, investigators believe they were standing over
the pipe bomb when it exploded, Montgomery County Police spokesman
Harry E. Geehreng said.
   Laboratory tests on metal and debris collected at the site by
agents from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms weren't expected to yield any results until later this
week, investigators said.
   Gafsi, a National Merit Scholar, was a freshman at Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass., where his studies included Japanese
and classical Arabic.
   Fischman, a first-year honors program student at the University
of Maryland, planned to major in chemistry and math. He had won
prizes for his work in both subjects in high school, his family said.
   According to Gafsi's father, Salem Gafsi, Fischman's interests
also included explosives, ``but in the positive sense. He's a gifted
kid.''

   A woman recognized her live-in companion
on a television show they were watching about a fugitive wanted in
the beating death of his mother, authorities said Monday.
   Before Nicholas Dolce, 38, left in the woman's car ``he indicated
to her he was the person'' described on the show, FBI agent William
Nettles said.
   ``America's Most Waned'' featured a profile of Dolce, accused of
beating his mother to death and setting fire to her home in
Trinidad, Colo., on May 2, 1986. Dolce was last reported seen in
Pueblo, Colo., in August 1987, according to the program.
   Dolce, who Nettles said is listed among the FBI's 10 most wanted
fugitives, was at large Monday. Authorities described him as a drug
user with dark, shoulder-length hair who occasionally dressed as a
woman.
   The woman who recognized Dolce had known him for several weeks,
Nettles said, ``but (he) has been in town longer than that.''
Authorities refused to release her name.
   Dolce apparently had worked on shrimp boats while in the area,
Nettles said.

<TEXT>
   A resident of a cramped retirement home
beat to death two sleeping residents with his walking cane and
injured four others in a room-to-room rampage sparked by squabbles
with roommates, police said Monday.
   There apparently was friction between Henry Thomas, 88, a retired
fruit picker and sometime junk collector, and other residents of the
Reflections I house, said Dade City Police Chief Phil Thompson.
   ``There was some bitterness in the home between our suspect Mr.
Thomas and the other residents of the home,'' he said. ``Evidently
that bitterness, from what we can tell, had been building.
Evidently, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, this thing
came to a head and Mr. Thomas took his action.''
   Thomas was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the
deaths of his 90-year-old roommate, Max Nickbarge, and resident
Myrtle Smith, 73.
   Charges were being prepared in the injuries to the other four
residents and should be filed this week, Thompson said.
   Nickbarge, 89-year-old Frank Tear Sr. and Thomas shared a 9-foot
by 10-foot room, and the police chief said the cramped quarters may
have contributed to the outburst.
   Tear, father-in-law of the home's owner Helen Tear, had a
fractured skull and was in critical but stable condition Monday at
Tampa General Hospital, Thompson said. Esther Kelly, 67, was in
guarded condition at Humana Hospital in Dade City with two broken
arms, cuts on her face and head, and bruises.
   Ruth Godfrey, 71, and Lucy Mitchell, 85, were both listed in fair
condition Monday with facial cuts at East Pasco Medical Center in
Zephyrhills about 10 miles south of here. Ms. Godfrey also suffered
a broken collarbone.
   The bodies were discovered by staff nurses about 8 a.m. New
Year's Day.
   Thompson said he believes the beatings took place between 1:30
a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
   Thomas, who walks with a cane, was found walking through Dade
City, a quiet town of 6,000 people northeast of Tampa, 9:30 p.m.
Sunday. He was described as jovial when confronted by police.
   Thompson said Thomas had not admitted to the crime, but police
had strong physical evidence. Thomas's cane and clothes were
splattered with blood. Autopsies were planned Tuesday.
   ``We feel the murder weapon involved is the cane of Mr. Thomas,''
Thompson said. ``It is a heavy, oak-type cane.''
   The chief said Thomas ``is a rather large individual who gets
around better than most people think.''
   Thomas was being held without bond Monday.
   One of the nurses who found the bodies of Nickbarge and Ms. Smith
had slept only a few feet away from where the attack occurred,
police said.
   ``Some furniture had been overturned, and there was broken glass
on the floor,'' said Sgt. Dale Neuner.
   Nine people lived in the wood-frame home just outiside Dade City.
All six victims had been sleeping in rooms near the front of the
house, said Neuner.
   Helen Tear said Thomas had problems getting along with the other
residents and would grow angry at Nickbarge for moving things in the
house. She said he also grew angry when his roommates squabbled.
   ``I would tell him if it bothers you, go away and walk for a
little while,'' she said.

   A dealer accused of trading in thousands of stolen
Nazi-era documents from a U.S.-run archives handed over nearly 800
of the records Monday, a Justice Ministry spokeswoman said.
   Andre Huesken, a Hamburg dealer in military memorabilia, turned
the material over to West Berlin court officials, the justice
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
   She said she did not know details of the contents of the 780
documents that were returned.
   Huesken is charged with trading in goods stolen from the U.S.-run
Nazi Document Center in West Berlin. He has been on trial since Dec.
5 with three other defendants.
   Prosecutors accuse a second defendant, Alfred Darko, of stealing
at least 4,000 documents from 1984-87 and selling them to another
defendant, West Berlin antiques dealer Henry Berger. Darko, from the
Ivory Coast, is a former employee of the documents center and has
admitted receiving more than $8,000 for supplying the papers.
   Berger says he did not realize the documents were stolen. He says
he passed them on to military memorabilia trader Herbert Borrmann of
West Berlin and collected a fee as a go-between.
   Borrmann is accused of providing the stolen documents, in turn,
to Huesken for sale to buyers in foreign countries, including
Britain and the United States.
   The Nazi Document Center houses about 30 million files from the
Third Reich era, including Nazi Party membership lists, marriage
applications of prominent Nazis, and military information.
   The center, which is in the U.S. sector of the city, has been
operated and maintained by the U.S. government since 1953. Used
mainly by scholars and government agencies, it contains the world's
largest collection of Nazi records.
   No Americans have been charged in the case.

   About 250 arms-making plants will be restructured
and included in a plan to produce machinery for growing and
processing food, the official news agency Tass reported Monday.
   ``A special program has been drawn up for the coming eight years
that provides for the creation and mastering of the batch production
of highly efficient equipment,'' Tass said in a dispatch based on an
interview with Deputy Premier Igor Belousov.
   It said the new equipment was intended for smaller lease-contract
farming operations as well as collective and state farms.
   Huge quantities of food are lost in transportation and storage in
the highly centralized Soviet economy.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is promoting smaller farming
operations, involved with specific tasks or parcels of land, to
encourage farmers to work harder and produce more.
   Tass said research and design work on farming and processing
machinery would increase seven-fold.
   ``Some 250 arms-manufacturing plants have been drawn into this
work,'' it quoted Belousov as saying. ``Some industrial enterprises
of this (arms) industry that were planned are being switched to
peaceful production.''
   He said Soviet defense policies should lead to arms production at
a lower level still sufficient to defend the the Soviet Union and
its allies, according to the Tass report.
   Gorbachev has recommended diverting some resources from the
military to production of consumer goods. He says the Soviet Union
needs an easing of world tensions so more time and resources can be
devoted to solving internal problems.

<HEAD>Libya Claims U.S. Allegations Pretext To Kill Gadhafi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's official news agency said Monday that the
United States is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant as
a pretext to attack the radical North African Arab nation and kill
its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   In West Germany, Bonn government officials announced they were
examining the records of Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, a company said to
be involved in the purported plant.
   But no criminal investigation has begun into the activities of
the company, local prosecutor Werner Botz said.
   Imhausen-Chemie director Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen rejected
the accusations in an interview with South German Radio in Stuttgart
that was broadcast late Monday. He said he hoped the government
probe would clear his firm of any wrongdoing.
   Libya's JANA agency, monitored in Rome, noted that a report
Sunday in a United Arab Emirates newspaper quoted unidentified Arab
sources as saying America planned to send an assassination team to
kill Gadhafi during an attack on Libya.
   The daily Al-Khaleej said a U.S. task force trained for the
attack is in Italy, Spain and aboard U.S. warships in the
Mediterranean and said it could come this month. It said the strike
would include air raids on a Libyan nuclear research center at
Tajura and the purported chemical weapons plant at Rabtah.
   JANA said on Monday that a group it called the International
League in Defense of the Mediterranean condemned the sailing of a
new U.S. 13-ship carrier battle group for the Mediterranean.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman in Washington called the sailing a routine
deployment of the 6th Fleet. A Navy spokesman in Italy said the new
group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the
Mediterranean.
   The State Department in Washington said Monday it had no officer
on duty to answer questions.
   The report by Al-Khaleej report carried no dateline but appeared
to originate in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   JANA said, ``The uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and
exposes clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical
campaign'' the U.S. government has mounted against Libya.
   It said the report proves U.S. allegations about a chemical arms
plant ``were excuses and pretexts for an operation of premeditated
individual murder.''
   Washington says Libya is about to produce chemical weapons at the
plant near Rabtah, about 50 miles southwest of Tripoli. Libya says
the plant makes pharmaceuticals and stresses Libya's commitment to
treaties banning chemical weapons.
   President Reagan has said the United States discussed with other
North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations the possibility of
military action against the plant.
   In Bonn, federal government spokesman Norbert Schaefer told a
news conference authorities ``had no indication or evidence to
verify the American suspicions'' that West German industry was
involved.
   He said the allegations were brought to the government's
attention during Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Washington in
November, but Bonn had no ``concrete information'' to work with.
   ``We must guarantee that German companies do not make profits
from the construction of death factories in Third World countries,''
Helmut Ohnewald, a Christian Democratic state legislator from
Baden-Wuerttemberg, told reporters.
   The Christian Democratic Union in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where
Imhausen-Chemie is located, issued a statement demanding a full
probe into the allegations.
   The company's Hippenstiel-Imhausen said Imhausen-Chemie had
nothing to do with the Libyan factory, but had ``business contacts''
in Libya relating to provision of materials for a plant to produce
plastic bags.
   Finance Ministry spokesman Karlheinz von den Driesch confirmed
that a foreign trade investigation was launched Friday as a
``precautionary'' measure once Bonn learned that the name of the
German firm implicated by the United States was to be made public.
   He said no evidence was uncovered to suggest Imhausen-Chemie was
involved in wrongdoing.
   Von den Driesch said the investigation would try to find whether
materials could have been shipped to Libya indirectly through a
third country.
   Companies from West Germany, Japan and Italy are believed to have
helped Libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex,
according to news reports in the United States. Japan told the
United States its citizens believed they were involved in building a
fertilizer plant.
   At least two West German firms provided Libya with chemicals,
technical assistance and special pumps and piping for the plant,
U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine said in a report released Sunday.
   One company was identified as Imhausen-Chemie, the New York Times
said Sunday, quoting U.S. government officials.

   West Bank lawyers said Monday they would boycott
military courts for one month to protest what they called a complete
lack of due process for Palestinian detainees.
   The announcement coincided with the demolition of two homes in
the occupied West Bank and came a day after the deportation of 13
Palestinians, fueling new charges of human rights violations by
Israel.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, at least 10 Palestinians were
wounded Monday in scattered clashes between troops and
stone-throwing youths, Arab hospital officials said. The army said
it was checking the reports.
   The wounded included two girls, aged 12 and 14, reported in
critical condition after being shot in the head during a clash at
Gaza's Bureij refugee camp, Arab doctors said.
   An army patrol came under a shooting attack near Dahiriya in the
West Bank, but no injuries resulted. The army surrounded the village
and conducted searches, Israel radio said.
   In Gaza City, Palestinians staged a spontaneous strike to protest
Sunday's deporations. Six of the deportees were from Gaza.
   An army official denied the lawyers' allegations and defended
Israeli actions to quell the nearly 13-month Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   ``We believe we have a liberal judicial system in the
territories, but we should not be judged in the same context as
Western countries that are not in a state of war,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Deportations and house demolitions ``are among our tools for
maintaining control,'' he said. The United States and other Western
nations have condemned such practices, saying they violate
international human rights conventions.
   At a news conference, Palestinian lawyer Bahij Tamini said his
clients were being denied their rights at every step in the military
legal system as part of a strategy to crush the uprising, known by
the Arabic word ``intefadeh.''
   The boycott is a ``cry of protest, one last attempt to get
through to the authorities,'' Tamini said.
   He said attorneys face difficulties in locating clients;
attorneys frequently are barred from meeting with their clients;
bail requests are routinely denied; and trial dates are often not
coordinated with attorneys.
   ``We feel handcuffed and chained ourselves,'' said Tamini.
   Added colleague Jonathan Kuttab: ``Lawyers should be allowed to
be lawyers, instead of being collaborators in a system that pretends
to be legal, but isn't.''
   Palestinian lawyers in the Gaza Strip have been boycotting
military courts for a year to protest similar conditions.
   Felicia Langer, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinian
clients, said she feared deportations and other strict measures
would increase under the government formed last month by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The army official sharply denied the lawyers' allegations.
   He said that earlier, the sheer numbers caused delays in helping
lawyers to find clients, but now the army has set up a special
office to help lawyers find their clients.
   Attorneys are not barred from seeing clients, trial dates are
coordinated with lawyers, and bail has been granted in hundreds of
cases, he said.
   In mid-December, 5,542 Palestinians were in detention, including
2,370 awaiting charges, 1,380 awaiting trial, 442 convicted and
1,350 held without charges for up to six months in so-called
adminstrative detention, the army said.
   The West Bank lawyers estimated that since the beginning of the
uprising, nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been jailed at one time or
another.
   In addition to the detentions, 49 Palestinians have been deported
since the beginning of the uprising, compared with 43 in the
three-year period from January 1985 to November 1987.
   Since the uprising, the army has demolished or sealed 151 houses
in the West Bank, including two bulldozed Monday in the Balata
refugee camp, according to the Palestinian human rights group Law in
the Service Man. Thirty-eight houses also were reported torn down or
sealed in the Gaza Strip.
   The army official said deportations were carried out selectively
and only as a last resort.
   Houses usually are torn down before the owners are convicted of
any crime.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The former mayor of Port-au-Prince
blamed for the church massacre of 12 people has fled Haiti after
receiving a safe-conduct pass from the military government.
   Franck Romain left Port-au-Prince on Saturday after spending
three months in the Dominican Embassy, the Information Ministry
said. He was given political asylum in the embassy after the Sept.
17 military coup that brought Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to power.
   The ministry statement, issued Sunday, did not say where Romain
had gone, but he was believed to be in the Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. He was given an official
pass assuring his safe departure at the request of the Dominican
government, the ministry said.
   In the Dominican Republic, the daily newspaper El Nacional
reported Monday that Romain was in the country on Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted sources in the Dominican Embassy in Haiti as
saying Romain was taken to the border in an embassy automobile under
military escort. Once at the border, Romain traveled to Santo
Domingo, where he is staying with friends, the newspaper reported.
   El Nacional said Romain's wife and a son left the embassy two
weeks earlier. But it did not say whether they also traveled to the
Dominican Republic.
   Jose del Carmen Acosta, the Dominican ambassador in Haiti,
declined comment.
   Romain, who has not been charged, was accused of directing the
Sept. 11 massacre at a Roman Catholic church in a Port-au-Prince
slum. Attackers armed with guns, machete knives and spikes killed 12
people and wounded at least 70 others.
   The Information Ministry said Romain's departure did not
``prejudice the legal proceedings'' against him, but did not
elaborate.
   The former mayor was a reputed leader of the Tonton Macoutes, the
dreaded militia set up during the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship, and
perpetrators of the church massacre were identified as City Hall
employees.
   The soldiers who overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in September
said they were provoked by the atrocity and wanted to end
state-sponsored violence.
   Namphy fled to the Dominican Republic and remains there with his
wife and daughter.
   In November, the government announced it was investigating Romain
for unspecified crimes.
   Arnold Antonin, co-director of the National Network for the
Defense of Human Rights, said Monday that Romain's departure would
have ``an adverse effect on the human rights credibility of the
Haitian government.''
   ``Franck Romain was one of the big bosses of the paramilitary
gangs in Haiti,'' Antonin said. ``The granting of a safe-conduct
pass is especially disturbing now that we all are expecting
spectacular measures on the part of the government to eliminate
these gangs from national life.''
   Avril has pledged to purge the army of the Tonton Macoutes and
carry out sweeping democratic reforms.
   Namphy led the military junta that assumed power when dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in 1986. Duvalier assumed the
presidency in 1971 on the death of his father, Francois Duvalier,
who was elected president in 1957.

<HEAD>Stiff Winds in Rockies, Fog Over Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Shifting air masses brought wind gusts of more than 70 mph
blasting through parts of Montana, Colorado and Wyoming on Monday,
while parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri were encased in dense
fog.
   Winds gusted to 71 mph at Livingston, Mont., and gusts of up to
75 mph were expected throughout the day in the upper Yellowstone
Valley. The stiff winds were being caused by the difference in air
masses _ one over the central intermountain region, the other over
the upper Mississippi Valley _ that created a pocket of rapid
pressure change allowing the winds to howl through the eastern
slopes of the northern Rockies.
   Winds of up to 75 mph were reported in the northeast foothills of
Colorado, near Rollinsville and Squaw Mountain. High wind warnings
also were issued for northwest Wyoming, where gusts of 46 mph were
clocked at Rawlins and Laramie.
   A stationary front over the southern Plains brought light rain
and dense fog to northern and central Oklahoma, much of Kansas and
western Missouri. Light snow fell over northeast Kansas and
northwest Missouri.
   Scattered showers dotted the lower Mississippi Valley.
   West and northwest winds swirling around a low pressure center
over southwest Quebec brought widespread snow to eastern Upper
Michigan and lower Michigan. The same pressure system also produced
snow over western New York.
   A warm front curved across parts of New England and snow fell
over Maine. Two inches of new snow fell at Caribou, Maine.
   Temperatures continued to plummet below zero over eastern North
Dakota and central Minnesota. In Grand Forks, N.D., it was 15 below
zero with a wind chill of minus 45.
   On the other extreme, Miami had a record high for the date of 85,
breaking the mark of 84 degrees set in 1967.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13 below
at Grand Forks to 89 at Harlingen, Texas. The nation's low for the
morning was minus 32 at Warroad, Minn.
   Tuesday's forecast called for scattered snow from the Great Lakes
into northern parts of the lower Ohio Valley into southern New
England, and scattered rain from the Middle Atlantic States into the
Gulf Coast. Snow also was likely from eastern Washington into
western Montana, with widespread rain across the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures should be in the 30s and 40s across much of the
nation, dipping into the teens and 20s from the northern Plains
through the Great Lakes into New England. Highs should warm into the
50s and 60s from the California Coast through the southern Plateau
and southern Rockies, the central high and southern Plains, Arkansas
and the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast.
Highs should be in the 70s from southern Texas through the Gulf
Coast, rising into the 80s over the central and southern Florida
peninsula.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Its Air Force Is Nearing Self-Sufficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian Premier Hussein Mussavi said
Monday that Iran is nearing military self-sufficiency by building an
advanced fighter plane and maintaining its aging U.S.-made F-4 and
F-5 fighters, Tehran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Mussavi spoke after
inspecting Iranian air force facilities, but showed footage of only
one single-propeller trainer plane said to be locally built.
   Mussavi said Iran now was able to repair its U.S.-made Hawk
surface-to-air missiles without outside help.
   He also said an Iranian-made passenger plane was tested
successfully and could be used for flights between smaller
provincial cities, according to the TV report.
   It quoted Mussavi as saying that the Iranian navy now was
overhauling Iran's Boeing 747 passenger planes, which used to
undergo maintenance abroad at considerable expense.
   A Tehran-based foreign military attache said he was ``highly
skeptical'' about Iranian claims of self-sufficiency in producing
and maintaining aircraft. He spoke to The Associated Press from
London on the condition of anonymity.
   The source said both the Iranian military and Iranair, the
national airline, lacked the skills and equipment needed for such
operations.
   He said Iran's Boeings were regularly serviced in Western Europe
and that complex maintenance operations are done abroad, or by
foreign engineers specially flown in for the purpose.
   Asked about Iranian claims of building an advanced fighter, he
said: ``If the Iranians had been successful ... they would be the
first ones to roll it out and show it to the world. ... We in Tehran
have seen nothing.''
   Iran has been seeking to rebuild its air force after the
cease-fire last August in its war with Iraq.
   Before the war started in September 1980, Iran had 447 combat
aircraft _ 190 F-4s, 166 F-5s, 77 F-14s and 14 RF-4 reconaissance
jets.
   Because of a chronic lack of spare parts, due to a U.S. arms
embargo and combat losses, Western analysts estimate Iran now has
about 50 planes operational _ 20 F-4s, 20 F-5s, and 10 F-14s, some
without radar.

<HEAD>Moscow Chief Rabbi Says Anti-Zionist Committee Dismantled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's chief rabbi says the Soviet
Anti-Zionist Committee has been dismantled and he hopes for better
cooperation with Jewish groups in the West, a Jewish organization
said Monday.
   Abraham Shayevitch, the chief rabbi, made the announcement in a
letter sent Monday to the Edgar Bronfman, chairman of the World
Jewish Congress, said Avi Beker, executive director of the WJC in
Israel. Shayevitch is in Israel for a two-week visit.
   American Jewish leaders said in December they were told by letter
that the committee, which generated propaganda against Israel, would
be dismantled by the end of the year.
   The letter to prominent Jewish leaders in New York purportedly
was written by Samuel Zivs, a Soviet lawyer who helped found the
committee in 1983.
   Beker said Monday about the chief rabbi's letter: ``The
significance is that from now on Jewish organizations can have
normal relations with the Soviet rabbis and we can start working
together toward building a normal communal life for Jews in the
Soviet Union.''
   He said in an interview the World Jewish Congress had boycotted
Shayevitch and other Soviet rabbis before the letter was written.
   The Anti-Zionist Committee, a government-sponsored body, included
some well-known Jewish personalities in the Soviet Union and has
been a source of embarrassment for Jewish groups dealing with
officials of Soviet Jewry.
   It was intended to lend credibility to anti-Israeli policies the
Soviet Union followed until recently.
   Shayevitch said in the letter to Bronfman, according to Beker:
``In my meetings here ... I announced unequivocally that I am not a
member of the anti-Zionist committee and that the committee was
dismantled. Furthermore ... I regret that such a committee existed
in the past, but I emphasize that I have never participated in
actions against Jews or the state of Israel.''
   He said he ``understood ... this announcement could clear the way
for working relationship with the WJC,'' Beker reported.
   Israeli Jews have accused Shayevitch of lacking interest in
Jewish culture. He is appointed by the Soviet government and
presides over the Grand Synagogue in Moscow.
   He arrived in Israel last Tuesday with Chaim Levite, chief rabbi
of Leningrad, on the first trip to the Holy Land by Soviet religious
leaders since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. They are guests of
the Tel Aviv religious council.
   Moscow broke diplomatic ties after the 1967 Middle East war, in
which Israel captured territory from the Kremlin's Arab allies.
Relations have improved recently, and the governments have exchanged
low-level diplomatic missions.
   The Soviets allowed 19,300 Jews to emigrate in 1988, and the
December emigration figure reached a nine-year monthly high of
3,650, Israel's government-sponsored Public Council for Soviet Jewry
said Monday.

   A close-knit community grieved Monday over
the loss of 10 people in a New Year's Day fire whose cause
investigators said may never be known.
   A mother who lost four children in the blaze remained
hospitalized Monday after becoming hysterical, and an elementary
school called on a crisis intervention team to counsel children who
lost five classmates.
   ``I have a suspicion we may never be able to determine the source
of this fire,'' said Elmer Baltes, a deputy state fire marshal, as
he surveyed the smoldering ruins of the home that caught fire early
Sunday, killing eight children and two adults. ``The extent of the
fire makes it very difficult.''
   Arson has been ruled out, and a fuel oil space heater appeared to
have been turned off, Baltes said, but a wood-burning stove,
electrical problems, smoking material, a Christmas tree and children
playing with matches all were being investigated as possible sources
of the fire.
   Remer Fire Chief Leo Renn said the fire spread so quickly it was
unlikely anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke.
   Three walls and the roof of the two-story house already had
collapsed when firefighters in the north-central Minnesota town of
about 400 people arrived at 2:25 a.m., Renn said.
   Nancy Watson, who returned home from celebrating her 32nd
birthday with her husband, John, to find her house in ashes, became
hysterical and repeatedly tried to rush inside, authorities said.
She remained hospitalized Monday.
   Killed were the Watson's four children, Jenny, 14, Samantha, 11,
Edward, 9, and William, 8; Mrs. Watson's sister and brother-in-law,
Becky and Jean Smischney; their two children, Jay, 10, and Kimberly,
8; and two neighbor children, Michelle Bastle, 10, and Robin Bastle,
12.
   Tammy Grover, 18, a stepsister of John Watson, told investigators
Monday the house had three smoke detectors. Renn had said earlier
there were no smoke detectors in the home, but when told of Grover's
comment he said he may have been wrong.
   The fire was discovered by passing motorists, who stopped at the
home of Melody Berczyk across the road. ``It was one big ball of
flame right then,'' said Berczyk, who called the fire department.
   She said she had looked out the window a half-hour earlier before
going to bed and saw no flames.
   ``The whole town is in shock. I'm still in shock,'' said Mayor
Chuck Gilstead.
   Friends and neighbors set up a memorial fund at a bank and
donation cans in a cafe.
   Mike Doro, principal of the 147-student elementary school which
five of the children attended, said he has asked for a crisis
intervention team to come to the school Tuesday.
   ``Being a small elementary school, it's like one big family. I
really don't know what's going to happen,'' Doro said. ``Hopefully,
we'll just all pull together.''

<HEAD>Prominent Virologist Dies At 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Christopher Andrewes, a prominent virologist
who was on the team that discovered the influenza virus, has died at
the age of 92, the Times of London reported Monday.
   Andrewes, a leader of research into the causes of the common
cold, died Saturday, the newspaper said. The place and cause of
death were not specified.
   He had been deputy director of the National Institute for Medical
Research from 1952 until 1961.
   The son of a pathologist, Andrewes began his career in the same
field, starting with a post as an assistant resident physician at
the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institution in New York, where he
stayed for two years.
   He decided to concentrate on virology, a field in which he spent
nearly 40 years. In 1927, after returning from the United States, he
joined the scientific staff of the Medical Research Council at
Hampstead in North London.
   Andrewes worked with colleagues on the role of viruses in
transmissible tumors in animals. In 1933, in collaboration with
Wilson Smith and Sir Patrick Laidlaw, he carried out the successful
transmission of influenza to ferrets.
   From 1946 to 1960 the virologists strove to isolate the virus in
the laboratory. Shortly before Andrewes' 1961 retirement, a team he
was part of isolated several viruses from patients with colds.
   The search then continued in many countries for the possibility
of using a specific virus vaccine against cold viruses.
   A member of many government committees, Andrewes was a former
president of the Pathological section of the Royal Society of
Medicine and the Society of General Microbiology.
   Andrewes' wife, the former Kathleen Lamb, died in 1984. He is
survived by three sons.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Monday he is sure Yasser
Arafat will tell U.S. officials if he knows anything about the
bombing of a Pan American jetliner over Scotland, but that the
Palestine Liberation Organization leader has not been heard from yet.
   Reagan made the comment in response to a reporter's question as
he arrived here to complete a holiday stay in California that began
Dec. 23 and will end with his return to Washington Thursday.
   He spent the New Year's weekend in Palm Springs, where he said in
his weekly radio address Saturday that President-elect Bush shares
his determination to bring the bombers of the Pan Am plane to
justice.
   Last week, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyasseh quoted an
unidentified PLO official as saying the organization was considering
a request by U.S. officials that the PLO help in tracking down those
responsible for the bombing.
   Presidential spokesman Roman Popadiuk, however, said the White
House had received no communication from Arafat.
   FBI Director William Sessions said on Sunday, in an interview on
the NBC television program ``Meet the Press,'' that Arafat has ``a
wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of the
Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people.
   As Reagan arrived at Los Angeles International Airport after his
flight from Palm Springs aboard Air Force One, a reporter called
out, ``Arafat says he wants to help find the bomber.''
   ``We've not heard from him,'' the president replied. ``We'll be
happy to hear from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure
he'll tell us.''
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan are staying at the home
in the fashionable Bel Air district of Los Angeles where they will
live after his term ends Jan. 20.
   The only public event on their schedule before their return to
Washington is a fund-raising dinner Wednesday night on behalf of
Mrs. Reagan's campaign against drug abuse.

<TEXT>
   More than 500 people nationwide called a
toll-free number for information about anorexia nervosa after
watching a television movie about singer Karen Carpenter, who died
as a result of the eating disorder.
   When ``The Karen Carpenter Story'' was broadcast by CBS Sunday
night, many affiliate stations displayed the toll-free telephone
number of a Philadelphia center devoted to treating eating disorders.
   Since the number, 800-334-8415, appeared, the Renfrew Center has
received more than 500 calls asking for information, Judy Goldstein,
the center's director of admissions, said Monday.
   ``We expected the explosion of interest,'' Ms. Goldstein said.
``We put in extra telephone lines to handle the calls.''
   The center is sending callers a brochure with basic information
about the disorder and a list of self-help centers throughout the
country, said Sam Menaged, a co-founder.
   ``We were at the phones until 3 a.m.'' Monday, Menaged said.
``The calls started trickling in from the East Coast, then as the
night went on, I noticed we were talking to (people in) Kansas and
Texas and California and Oregon.''
   Ms. Carpenter and her brother, Richard, recorded 20 top 10 hit
songs during the 1970s, singing such tunes as ``Close to You,''
``Top of the World,'' ``We've Only Just Begun,'' and their No. 1
remake of ``Please Mr. Postman.''
   She died in 1983 of heart failure due to anorexia nervosa, an
eating disorder characterized by an obsession with weight loss and
an aversion to food.
   Although the disorder primarily affects women _ especially young
women _ no pattern to the calls existed, Ms. Goldstein said.
   A number of callers also asked about bulimia, an eating disorder
characterized by binging then purging the body of food.
   ``In the movie, Karen Carpenter had recovered but died several
months later,'' Ms. Goldstein said. ``She had done so much damage to
her body. ... She wasn't able to make it.''
   Recovered anorexics should continue to receive therapy or
support, Ms. Goldstein said, so they will be aware of their
continued needs.
   She said the center normally gets about 100 calls per week from
people seeking information about the disorder.

<HEAD>Four Communists Jailed On Charges Of Promoting Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four leading members of the outlawed
Communist Party were jailed Monday, and President Augusto Pinochet's
military government charged them with promoting political violence.
   Those ordered to jail by civilian Judge Domingo Kockish of
Santiago were Mireya Baltra, Americo Zorrilla, Jose Sanfuentes and
Guillermo Scherping. Ms. Baltra and Zorrilla served in the elected
government of the late President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist
ousted by Pinochet in a 1973 coup.
   The Communists and two other radical leftist groups were made
illegal by the 1980 constitution, which the military wrote. The
indictments and jailings coincided with the party's 67th anniversary.
   As the defendants arrived at the court building Monday, other
party members presented them with anniversary cakes. They smiled and
ate the cakes while court guards watched without intefering.
   Charges of promoting political violence stem from a document they
issued Dec. 6th announcing the party's first national congress in
two decades. It document urged a ``popular rebellion'' and supported
``all forms of struggle,'' including violence, against the
government.
   Party officials said the congress, expected to last months, began
later in December at clandestine locations.
   Attorney General Ambrosio Rodriguez said the Communist document
violated the internal security law, which makes promoting political
violence a crime.
   According to the indictments, the party proclamation amounted to
``an apologia for political violence, urging the overthrow of the
goverment and the formation of armed popular militias.''
   Carlos Caceres, the interior minister, said action was taken
against the Communists ``to demonstrate the government's
determination to have a peaceful transition to democracy.''
   Sanfuentes, one of the defendants, said the government wants to
``prevent the Communist Party's presence in the country's political
life.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Austerity Plan May Impair Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a government austerity plan said
Monday some provisions could hurt the army by forcing cuts in
weapons purchases or training programs.
   Ministers and legislators from both major political blocs accused
Finance Minister Shimon Peres of not working out the details of his
plan before announcing it Sunday.
   His proposals call for controlling inflation by curbing
cost-of-living pay increases and cutting about $600 million from
government spending on the army, schools, hospitals and welfare.
   Peres, who leads the center-left Labor Party, said his inflation
target was 9 percent by the end of 1989, about half of the current
annual figure of 18 percent. He did not say where spending cuts
should be made, leaving that to a ministerial committee expected to
convene Wednesday or Thursday.
   He began implementing the plan Sunday by reducing subsidies for
food and gasoline. Prices of milk, bread and frozen chicken
increased as much as 26 percent on Sunday morning.
   The government has devalued the shekel by 13 percent since last
week as a first step toward reviving export industries hampered by a
frozen exchange rate.
   Israeli news reports said the Peres plan calls for reductions of
up to $353 million in the military budget, including $147 million
allocated to army operations in the occupied territories, where
Palestinians began a rebellion 13 months ago.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also of the Labor Party, said the
army might have to reduce training, abandon a 10-year development
plan and slow equipment purchases.
   ``This would seriously harm the army's ability and may destroy
security-related industries in Israel,'' he said. ``It does not look
justified to me.''
   Other planned cuts are said to include up to $118 million in the
education budget, which might force parents to pay tuition for
kindergarten and high school, the radio said.
   Deputy Premier David Levy, of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
conservative Likud bloc, said price increases and reductions in
spending on schools and welfare could negate a generation of
progress and ``tear our society apart.''

<HEAD>Cuba's Castro Says Cuba Will Shun Non-Socialistic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

   President Fidel Castro said that Cuba has an
enormous responsibility to Third World countries to stick to its
present hard-line Marxist-Leninist course, and he spurned
market-oriented economic reforms.
   ``Today we say with more force than ever, socialism or death,
Marxism -Leninism or death,'' he said.
   His one-hour-and-54-minute televised speech Sunday night,
celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, was devoted
mainly to praising the people of Santiago and other eastern Cuban
cities for their revoutionary heritage and support. It is the area
Castro calls ``the cradle of the revolution.''
   It was only toward the end of his address that Castro made
remarks appearently directed toward the Soviet Union and other
communist lands that have been veering from rigid adherence to
Marxist doctrine.
   He did not refer directly to the Soviet Union or to the economic
and political reforms now being pushed by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, saying only that ``confusion'' marked the contemporary
situation.
   Castro was more explicit about rejecting Gorbachev's reform
policies in earlier speeches.
   He acknowledged then that changes being attempted under Gorbachev
could cause ``difficulties'' for Cuba, and also said that Cuba will
never embrace any reforms that ``reek of capitalism.''
   Castro addressed a large gathering on Sunday night from the
balcony of the municipal building in Santiago, where three decades
before, on Jan. 1, 1959, he proclaimed victory for his revolutionary
struggle .
   The president called the revolution a ``beacon of light before
the eyes of the world.''
   Cuban officials said Castro is expected to deliver a policy
address on Wednesday.
   The friendship between Havana and Moscow seems more tenuous now
than it has been for years, although it is far from rupture.
   The Soviets have chafed about the way Cuba has used the estimated
$5 billion a year it receives in Soviet economic aid, and the
question has arisen whether this will lead to cutbacks. Moscow
thinks Castro has neglected industrial development to spend the
money instead on schools and hospitals.
   Despite Castro's remarks on Sunday, the president now seems more
interested in pursuing normal ties with elected governments than in
efforts to promote violent revolution, as he once did.
   Cuba's recent commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from
Angola by 1991 is one sign of dramatic policy change.
   He said while attending the presidential inaguration in Mexico in
November that he envisions the eventual unity of Cuba and the rest
of Latin America.

   U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau discussed
Middle East peace prospects and the Pan American jumbo jet bombing
with a PLO representative at a meeting in Tunis over the weekend,
the White House said Monday.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
meeting Saturday at the U.S. Embassy was requested by Hakam Balaoui,
the Palestine Liberation Organization's representative in Tunis, for
the purpose of introducing himself to Pelletreau.
   ``Discussion centered on Middle East issues,'' Popadiuk said.
``Since the meeting was called by Mr. Balaoui, the ambassador was
principally in a listening mode.''
   ``The ambassador took the opportunity to mention that the United
States would welcome any information the PLO is able to develop
concerning the Pan Am tragedy,'' the spokesman said.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said Balaoui took note of Pelletreau's views and told
him he would pass them on to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   The official said the discussion did not amount to a request by
the United States for PLO assistance, but was in line with the
administration's position that it it will welcome information from
any source that would help to solve the bombing.
   The administration official said the meeting was not a
continuation of the dialogue between U.S. and PLO representatives
which began Dec. 16 in Tunis when Pelletreau met with three members
of the PLO executive committee.
   Popadiuk said there are currently no plans for a further meeting
as part of this dialogue. He declined other comment on a report,
attributed to PLO spokesman Hani Faidy in Madrid in an interview
with Spanish state radio, that such a meeting was scheduled for
Saturday.
   Popadiuk said President Reagan was aware of the meeting between
Pelletreau and Balaoui in Tunis.

   The Philippines deported on Monday a
Syrian who was held at Manila airport after Australia refused to
accept him because it suspected he was linked to a terrorist group,
officials said.
   Immigration authorities said two security men shepherded Vartan
Bakerjian onto a Philippine Air Lines flight bound for Bangkok, the
capital of Thailand.
   Immigration official Ruben Domingo said Bakerjian left Bangkok
last Tuesday for Sydney, Australia, by way of Manila. Australian
authorities sent him back to the Philippines, and he was detained in
Manila on Saturday.
   Domingo said Australian authorities told Manila that Bakerjian
tore up a Greek passport which he used when entering the Philippines
and switched to a U.S. passport when he arrived in Sydney.
   ``When the guy was interrogated, the Australians came to the
conclusion he might be a suspected terrorist,'' Domingo said.
   Bakerjian denied being a member of an extremist group, Domingo
said, but he added that the Philippines decided to play it safe _
``especially with recent reports that some action would be taken
against Asian airlines by Middle East terrorists.''
   Security at Asian airports was increased after a warning was
issued that terrorists may try to blow up or hijack an Asian
airliner this month.
   The warning followed the Dec. 21 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Scotland which killed a total of 270 people.

   Shirley Temple Black made an encore
appearance as grand marshal of the Rose Parade, which had its 100th
outing on a picture-perfect Monday amid dozens of floats laden with
blossoms, nostalgia and high hopes for 1989.
   In a Rose Parade first, Carie Humphries and Ron Simms recited
wedding vows before one of the largest audiences ever to witness a
marriage ceremony. An estimated 350 million people in 32 countries
watched on televison, while half a million thronged the curbside
along the 5{-mile route.
   ``This is like a fairy tale come true. I'm so excited to show off
my beautiful bride to everyone. It's a chance to show everybody what
true love is about,'' said Simms, 23, who wed Ms. Humphries 45
minutes into the parade.
   A grateful Vietnamese refugee rode one float. Cancer-stricken
youngsters waved from another entry.
   The Rose Parade may be the grande dame of the New Year's
processions, but Dallas' Cotton Bowl sought a little more limelight
by adding more marchers, mimes, clowns and mascots to its 32nd
annual parade Monday. Country singer Charley Pride was grand marshal.
   The Orange Parade, held on New Year's Eve, attracted a
half-million people to Miami to watch the floats, celebrities and
circus elephants that filed by, while 22,000 marchers modeled
outrageous costumes in Philadelphia's 89th annual Mummers parade on
New Year's Day.
   ``You are not going to find one person from Michigan
complaining,'' said Leslie Footlick, 21, a University of Michigan
student among the masses of Rose parade spectators basking in the
Pasadena sunshine and 60-degree weather.
   After the parade, the University of Southern California and
University of Michigan were to square off in the Rose Bowl.
   Former ambassador Shirley Temple Black, who wowed the crowds 50
years earlier as grand marshal when she was America's favorite child
actress, led off the flower-bedecked flotilla promptly at 8 a.m.
   Police described the crowds as well-behaved. There were only 188
arrests, mostly for drunkenness, compared with 444 last year, said
parade spokesman Ken Veronda.
   Some of the more spectacular of the 60 floats included the
tallest in parade history, a 75-foot flowered-covered giraffe by
Carnation Co., and the Casablanca Fan Co. float featuring a ski run
and breath-taking flips by members of the Stuntmen's Association.
   Vietnamese refugee Vinh Nguyen, riding the Home Savings of
America float, reveled in the celebration: ``I feel very great. I'm
really happy. It's the best New Year's I have ever had.''
   ``Life's important, it's the most important thing in the world,''
said Kathleen Rydberg, 15, of Oxnard, whose liver cancer has been in
remission since 1986. She rode a float with other children with
cancer.
   Eighteen floats won trophies, including Unocal's ``Mardi Gras,''
the Sweepstakes winner, depicting a giant masked reveler with a
26-foot headdress. Slice soft drink's ``Luau,'' which won the Grand
Marshal's Trophy for its tropical island complete with waterfalls
and dancers, broke down and never made an appearance. It was the
first float ever to miss the parade, officials said.
   The City of Alhambra-City of Mobile, Ala., float, Sea World's
entry and the Pac-10 float also had mechanical troubles and had to
be dragged down Colorado Boulevard via tow trucks _ the only parade
vehicles not adorned with flowers. Carnation's giraffe float broke
down but was repaired and didn't need towing.
   Rose Queen Charmaine Beth Shryock reigned with her court on a
float followed by another reuniting many former Rose Queens,
including 80-year-old Holly Halsted Balthis, the 1930 parade monarch.
   More than 20 million roses, chrysanthemums, orchids, carnations,
marigolds, sweet peas, iris, daisies, daffodils, tulips and other
flowers festooned the floats. Twenty marching bands and 275 horses
rounded out the two-hour procession. Some of the television audience
watched the festivities with special 3-D glasses provided by Fox
Television.
   In previous years, police agencies have estimated a crowd of
about 1 million spectators, but this year declined to do so, saying
the number was difficult to arrive at. The Pasadena Star-News
conducted its own head count using a formula worked out by a retired
Jet Propulsion Laboratory physicist, arriving at an estimate of
500,000.
   About 650 pompon dancers led off the Cotton Parade in Dallas,
followed by 13 floats, three giant balloon figures, 15 bands and
five equestrian units. Some 100,000 spectators watched for the
parade under overcast skies and 55-degree weather, and millions more
saw an hour of the event on TV.
   Organizers had tripled this year's parade budget to $225,000 from
last year to try to bring the parade out of the shadow of the Rose
and Orange parades.
   Afterward, the University of Arkansas and the University of
California, Los Angeles vied for the Cotton Bowl title.
   The University of Miami was to play the University of Nebraska in
the Orange Bowl Monday night but Miami had its parade Saturday.
Among the celebrities waving from the floats were Raymond Burr,
``L.A. Law'' star Susan Ruttan, George Wendt of ``Cheers'' and
Sherman Helmsley of ``Amen.'' Marilyn McCoo and Joe Garagiola were
the masters of ceremonies.
   And in Philadelphia, spectators clustered along the 2{-mile
Mummers parade route were treated to 14 hours of string bands
competing for more than $286,000 in prize money and clowns who
cakewalked to the event's perennial theme, ``Oh, Dem Golden
Slippers.''

   U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau discussed
Middle East peace prospects and the Pan American jumbo jet bombing
with a PLO representative at a meeting in Tunis over the weekend,
the White House said Monday.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
meeting Saturday at the U.S. Embassy was requested by Hakam Balaoui,
the Palestine Liberation Organization's representative in Tunis, for
the purpose of introducing himself to Pelletreau.
   ``Discussion centered on Middle East issues,'' Popadiuk said.
``Since the meeting was called by Mr. Balaoui, the ambassador was
principally in a listening mode.''
   ``The ambassador took the opportunity to mention that the United
States would welcome any information the PLO is able to develop
concerning the Pan Am tragedy,'' the spokesman said.
   The White House announcement came hours after President Reagan
said that he is sure PLO chairman Yasser Arafat will tell U.S.
officials if Arafat has information about the Pan Am bombing.
   Reagan's comment came in response to a reporter's question as he
arrived here to complete a holiday stay which began Dec. 23 and will
end Thursday when he returns to Washington.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said that Balaoui took note of Pelletreau's views during
the weekend meeting and told him he would pass them on to Arafat.
   The official said the discussion did not amount to a request by
the United States for PLO assistance, but was in line with the
administration's position that it will welcome information from any
source that would help to solve the bombing.
   The administration official said the meeting was not a
continuation of the dialogue between U.S. and PLO representatives
which began Dec. 16 in Tunis when Pelletreau met with three members
of the PLO executive committee.
   Popadiuk said there are no current plans for a further meeting as
part of this dialogue. He declined other comment on a report,
attributed to PLO spokesman Hani Faidy in Madrid in an interview
with Spanish state radio, that such a meeting was scheduled for
Saturday.
   Popadiuk said President Reagan was aware of the meeting between
Pelletreau and Balaoui in Tunis.
   Reagan spent the New Year's weekend in Palm Springs, where he
said in his weekly radio address Saturday that President-elect Bush
shares his determination to bring the bombers of the Pan Am plane to
justice.
   Last week, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyasseh quoted an
unidentified PLO official as saying the organization was considering
a request by U.S. officials that the PLO help in tracking down those
responsible for the bombing.
   Popadiuk said the White House had received no communication from
Arafat.
   FBI Director William Sessions said on Sunday, in an interview on
the NBC television program ``Meet the Press,'' that Arafat has ``a
wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of the
Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people.
   As Reagan arrived at Los Angeles International Airport after his
flight from Palm Springs aboard Air Force One, a reporter called
out, ``Arafat says he wants to help find the bomber.''
   ``We've not heard from him,'' the president replied. ``We'll be
happy to hear from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure
he'll tell us.''
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan are staying at the home
in the fashionable Bel Air district of Los Angeles where they will
live after his term ends Jan. 20.
   The only public event on their schedule before their return to
Washington is a fund-raising dinner Wednesday night on behalf of
Mrs. Reagan's campaign against drug abuse.

   William Como, longtime editor of Dance Magazine,
the influential journal of the ballet world, has died of lung cancer
at the age of 63.
   Through the magazine, Como championed new dance companies and
regional companies, such as Ballet West and the San Francisco,
Boston and Tulsa, Okla., ballets, and was an advocate for the
critical acceptance of the Stuttgart Ballet in West Germany, the
Danish Royal Ballet and Maurice Bejart's companies in France among
others.
   ``And he did the same thing with young dancers and young
choreographers, such as John Neumeier, an American choreographer and
artistic director of the Hamburg Ballet in West Germany,'' said
Norma McLain Stoop, a senior editor of the magazine and a good
friend of Como's.
   Como died Sunday night at Lenox Hill Hospital, Stoop said.
   He was born in Williamstown, Mass., on Nov. 10, 1925, and he was
educated at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.
   Como had a brief career as a dancer and actor both in California
and New York from 1948 to 1953, before joining the magazine.
   From 1954 to 1960, Como was sales manager of Dance Magazine, then
was promoted to advertising manager and assistant to the publisher
from 1961 to 1969. The next year he was named editor in chief, a
position he held until his death.
   Como also edited Ballroom Dance Magazine, which was renamed After
Dark, from 1968 to 1979 when it folded. He also had a weekly
half-hour show about dance on National Public Radio, Stoop said.
   Como is survived by a brother, Joseph of Alexandria, Va., and his
mother, Janet Como, of Williamstown, Mass.

   Country music entertainer Johnny Cash was
scheduled to be released from Baptist Hospital Tuesday, two weeks
after undergoing heart bypass surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said
Monday.
   Cash, 56, had suffered some lung problems, but doctors said such
complications were not unusual with heart bypass surgery, hospital
spokeswoman Aileen Katcher said.
   The singer's doctors ``last week said the problems were resolving
themselves, and I'm certain they wouldn't be releasing him if
everything wasn't OK,'' Ms. Katcher said Monday night.
   Cash had a double heart bypass Dec. 19, one week after his friend
and fellow singer Waylon Jennings had triple bypass surgery in the
same hospital.
   Cash is known for his songs ``A Boy Named Sue,'' ``I Walk the
Line'' and ``Ring of Fire.''

<HEAD>Rebel Leaders Say Willing to Meet With Sandinistas in Washington</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebel leaders on Monday
told Costa Rican President Oscar Arias they are willing to attend
peace talks in Washington with the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   ``We have the honor of confirming to you, Mr. President, our
willingness to reach a political solution to the conflict and that
we have decided to accept Washington as the city where negotiations
with the Sandinista government should continue,'' the leadership of
the Nicaraguan Resistance, the rebels' political organization, told
Arias in a letter.
   Arias is the author of a 1987 peace plan for Central America that
calls, in part, for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   A tenuous cease-fire agreement between the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist Sandinistas has been in
effect since March. Negotiations on a permanent end to the
seven-year-old civil war broke down in September.
   The Sandinistas suggested in September that future talks take
place either in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, or in Washington.
The Reagan administration has trained, funded and supplied the
rebels since 1981 in their war to overthrow the Sandinistas.
   The Contras proposed in their letter on Monday that negotiations
with the Sandinista government begin Jan. 25 at the Washington
headquarters of the Organization of American States.
   The proposed that OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Suares, Roman
Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua and the foreign
ministers of the five Central American governments act as witnesses
to the talks.
   The Resistance leaders said they were willing to call an end to
rebel military operations in exchange for democratic reforms by the
Sandinistas. They also called for effective measures by a
verification commission to monitor Sandinista compliance with the
peace plan, which provides for democratic guarantees.
   ``We consider it urgent that viable mechanisms be established to
guarantee the independence of the (peace plan) verification
commission,'' said the letter, signed by Resistance directors Adolfo
Calero, Enrique Bermudez, Roberto Ferrey and Wilfredo Montalvan.
   The rebel message came after Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo
confirmed he plans to attend a summit of Central American presidents
scheduled for Jan. 15-16 in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, to
advance the stalled peace plan.
   The summit had been threatened by Nicaraguan claims that
Honduras, a key U.S. ally, has been harboring and supporting the
Contras. Most Contra fighters fled to Honduras after U.S. military
aid expired in February.
   The International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands,
agreed last month to hear a formal Nicaraguan complaint against
Honduras over the rebels' presence in that country.
   The World Court decision prompted Azcona Hoyo to threaten to
boycott the summit unless Nicaragua dropped its case. Honduras would
also boycott a preparatory meeting of Central American foreign
ministers in Managua if Nicaragua didn't withdraw its complaint, he
said.
   In addition, Azcona Hoyo threatened to file a countersuit against
Nicaragua before the World Court charging Sandinista army troops
with repeated incursions into Honduran territory.
   But Azcona Hoyo confirmed he would attend the summit during a
nationally broadcast New Year's message on Saturday.

   After weeks of delay, a cargo plane loaded with 42
tons of food, blankets and medical supplies for Armenian earthquake
victims departed Monday bound for the Soviet republic.
   On board were two physicians who will evaluate medical conditions
there and propose to Armenian authorities the establishment of ``a
steady stream of doctors, equipment and drugs going back and forth
on a regular basis,'' said Dr. Carolann Najarian of Mount Auburn
Hospital in Cambridge.
   It was the first such airlift from Boston since the Dec. 7 quake
that killed an estimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 people
homeless.
   The supplies, donated from all over the United States, have been
piling up at Logan International Airport since the day after the
quake and nearly filled a large hangar provided by Trans World
Airlines as a staging area.
   Monday's airlift delivered only about a quarter of the supplies.
   ``In this hangar, we've got $8 (million) to $10 million worth of
equipment,'' said Mike Nazarian, east coast chairman of Medical
Outreach for Armenia, a relief group. ``We need about two or three
more flights.''
   Nazarian said he hoped to arrange another airlift for the
remainder of the supplies next week.
   Twelve private relief planes have departed from other cities,
said Dikran Kaligian, executive director of the Armenian National
Committee. But two weeks ago, before transport could be arranged
from Logan, the Soviets called a temporary halt to shipments to
Armenia in order to take stock of which supplies were needed, and
where, he said.
   Armenian church and relief officials in the United States,
meanwhile, have been reluctant to airlift cargo without sending
their own people along to ensure the supplies reach the quake
victims for whom they are intended, Kaligian said.
   Kaligian said he knows of no relief supplies that have gone
astray, but the Armenians are taking no chances.
   ``They could divert it to Moscow, they could take everything,''
he said. ``We've had our personnel on board.''
   The cargo plane and crew were provided by Pan Aviation, based in
Miami and owned by Armenian-Americans. Medical Outreach paid for
fuel and operating costs, Nazarian said.
   The plane, loaded with bales of blankets, food, tents and medical
supplies ranging from antacids to antibiotics, left Logan at about
4:10 p.m. The schedule for the 14-hour trip to the Armenian capital
of Yerevan included a stop at Shannon, Ireland, officials said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife, Kitty, Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn and state House Speaker
George Keverian were at the airport at noon for a news conference on
the plane's departure.
   Dukakis said the supplies being stored in the hangar reflect
``the affection Massachusetts residents have for the people of
Armenia.''
   The two physicians, Najarian and Dr. Richard Aghababian of the
University of Massachusetts at Worcester, said they wanted to set up
a microbiology laboratory in Armenia to help test for infectious
diseases, which can spread after disasters.
   Mrs. Dukakis promised to help raise the money for the laboratory
if it turns out to be needed.

   A police chief said Monday he will
seek homicide charges against two cruise operators and two port
guards in the capsize-sinking of a tourist boat that drowned at
least 51 people on New Year's Eve.
   Also Monday, the navy released a report saying that the vessel
was inspected twice on the week it sank, including on the day of the
sinking. The report conflicted with statements by witnesses who said
no attempt was made to control the number of people who boarded the
double-deck excursion vessel, Bateau Mouche, and that few life
jackets were available.
   Widely conflicting reports emerged about how many people were on
the 100-foot-long boat when it sank and how many may still be
missing.
   The navy said its inspectors examined the boat on Wednesday,
finding ``satisfactory safety and navigational conditions'' and ``a
number of life jackets above what was necessary.''
   A patrol boat intercepted the vessel at 9:30 p.m. Saturday, just
over two hours before it capsized, and navy inspectors found ``149
people aboard ... within a permitted capacity of 153,'' the
statement said.
   ``The vessel therefore was given clearance,'' the navy declared,
and its Port Authority for Rio had a ``perfectly clear conscience of
duty carried out.''
   ``Rumors of bribes or negligence'' involving men from the patrol
boat who made the last inspection will be investigated, it said.
   Police Chief Irineu Barroso of Rio's 10th precinct, who is in
charge of the case, said Monday he will seek criminal charges
against the owner of Itatiaia Turismo, the Rio travel agency that
booked the cruise; the owner of the Sol e Mar restaurant that
operates the vessel; and two port authority guards who stopped the
boat but allowed it to go on its way. Barroso said he will also seek
charges of corruption and accepting bribes against the guards.
   No one has been arrested in the case.
   ``Survivors ... are telling us that something on board was not
right,'' he had said Sunday.
   Barroso said the Bateau Mouche was overcrowded and questioned why
it resumed its trip after the patrol boat turned it back to the dock
for inspection Saturday.
   A representative of the booking agent said the Bateau Mouche
usually carried only 100 passengers. Tickets for the New Year's Eve
cruise, to watch midnight fireworks off Copacabana Beach, cost $220
each.
   On Monday, the boat remained under 65 feet of water off Sugar
Loaf Mountain, a Rio landmark near downtown.
   Rescuers said they may find more bodies but that most of the
people who drowned probably were accounted for.
   ``We think that most of the bodies already have been taken out,''
said Lt. Pedro Paulo Albuquerque of the fire department maritime
division, whose divers were inspecting the wreck. He added, however,
that ``we ... may see some bodies washing up on Rio's beaches in the
next couple of days.''
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest commercial network, carried reports of
30 bodies trapped in the boat's banquet room. It did not give the
source of the reports.
   Col. Jefferson Cardoso de Bem, head of the fire department
maritime division, said in response: ``Our divers still do not have
sufficient visibility to see what's inside (the room.) There are
piles of tables and chairs in the way. The work is going very
slowly.''
   Survivors told journalists Sunday no effort was made to control
the number of people boarding. They said few life jackets were
available and life preservers were tied to the railing. They
confirmed the forced return for the passenger count and said the
craft went back out a few minutes later.
   Cid Castor of Itatiaia Turismo told The Associated Press 100
tickets normally were sold for twice-daily sightseeing excursions on
the Bateau Mouche.
   Confusion persisted about how many on the New Year's Eve cruise
were passengers, crewmen, waiters, members of the samba band or
others.
   Castor said Itatiaia's excursion director drowned in the sinking
and ``the passenger list went down with him.''
   Sergio Rodrigues, a lawyer for the Sol e Mar restaurant, said an
incomplete reservation list showed 106 passengers, eight band
members, five waiters, one head waiter, the pilot and three crewmen.
   Gustavo Blanco, a spokesman for the Sol e Mar, produced an
incomplete list Sunday with 131 names, but said it did not include
people accompanying those with reservations and ``we don't know how
many were on board.''

<HEAD>Man Who Confessed in Ecologist's Death To Get Lie Detector Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who said he killed Amazon
ecologist Francisco Mendes will undergo a lie detector test to clear
up contradictions in his statements about the shooting, the Justice
Ministry said Monday.
   Deputy Justice Minister Luis Fernando Eichenberg told The
Associated Press that investigators have questions about the events
that preceded the Dec. 22 shooting. Mendes was shot as he stepped
from his home in the Amazon jungle city of Xapuri, 2,660 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Darcy Alves Pereira da Silva, 21, the son of a local cattle
rancher, said last Tuesday he killed Mendes, the president of the
local Rubber Tappers Union. Mendes challenged local ranchers, who
wanted to clear Amazon land for cattle grazing.
   But Eichenberg said, ``If he (Pereira da Silva) did shoot Mendes,
he didn't act alone. The lie detector test can help us eliminate
doubts.''
   Police said earlier that Pereira da Silva might be acting as a
cover for his father, Darly Alves da Silva, who Mendes had said
threatened to kill him.
   Pereira da Silva and his brother Oloci, 22, are being held in
police custody, but their father and their uncle, Alvarino Alves da
Silva, are in hiding, possibly in Bolivia, according to press
reports.
   ``That the Alves brothers may be hiding in Bolivia is a
hypothesis we are examining. If confirmed, we will begin extradition
procedings,'' Eichenberg said.
   Mendes received the United Nations Global 500 award for his
ecological work to preserve the Amazon forest. Ecologists say an
area the size of Belgium is burned and chopped down each year in the
jungle region that covers more than two-thirds of Brazilian
territory.
   Ecologists say the reduction in tropical forest lands has
contributed to the elevation of the Earth's temperature, which may
have been a factor in the devastating drought in the U.S. Midwest
this past summer.
   Mendes' death has drawn world attention to the old problem of
land conflicts between landless peasant farmers and right-wing
cattle ranchers.
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 peasants, ecologists and church
leaders, who defend the peasants, have been killed in battles over
land ownership in Brazil.

<HEAD>New Hosts Try to Crack Late Night Talk Circuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak and hip
comic Arsenio Hall say they won't try to dethrone the giants when
they debut their own late-night talk shows.
   Instead, they will try to reach new audiences.
   ``I think people place too much emphasis on the competition. I'm
running my own race,'' said Hall, whose syndicated ``The Arsenio
Hall Show'' airs Tuesday. ``It's a personal best, it's me against
me.''
   Hall and Sajak, whose CBS show debuts Monday, may have an uphill
battle establishing themselves in a field already glutted with
flashy _ even bizarre _ personalities. But their shows will have
subtle differences from the current fare and each other.
   Sajak, for instance, will have a desk. Hall won't.
   Sajak, who usually wears a pocket handkerchief on the ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' will abandon it at night, said coordinating producer
David Williger. Hall will tend to stylish suits.
   CBS spent more than $4 million to build a new sound stage and
other facilities for Sajak's 90-minute show, which will rely on the
traditional format pioneered by Jack Paar. However, it will be
spiced by live interviews with Los Angeles locals _ everything from
punk rockers to melon merchants.
   Sajak said he also considered having a female sidekick, but opted
instead for Dan Miller.
   Viewers familiar with his game-show role with letter-turner Vanna
White might be upset, ``as though Vanna and I had gotten a divorce
or something,'' Sajak said.
   Hall, who was guest host on Fox's ``Late Show,'' said he will try
to create an air of spontaneity on his hour-long show and plans to
avoid relying on guests with youth appeal.
   ``I'd love to talk to Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``There isn't
anyone who I would consider too old and square.''

   One man sought in the fatal shooting of a
sheriff's deputy was arrested Monday, and a second was found dead
after apparently committing suicide in a cabin where he had holed
up, authorities said.
   The man arrested in connection with the New Year's Eve shooting
of Navajo County Deputy Bob Varner was tentatively identified as
Raul Lopez.
   The second man, tentatively identified as Douglas Savory, 45, was
found dead of a gunshot wound to the face after police fired tear
gas into the cabin near Winslow, a state Department of Public Safety
spokesman said.
   Earlier Monday, the man had fired at officers and a law
enforcement helicopter and apparently killed himself afterward, DPS
spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt said.
   A 33-mile stretch of Interstate 40 was closed for about six
hours, forcing drivers to make a 167-mile detour onto lesser routes
to the north, because the cabin was less than a quarter-mile from
the interstate.
   After the tear gas was fired, officers ``entered (the cabin) with
orders to shoot to kill,'' said Navajo County Sheriff Gary Butler.
   ``Mr. Savory was an extremely dangerous man,'' Butler said.
``Every time we had contact with him, he turned on us. He shot
Officer Varner before he even had a chance to react. He turned on
two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him. Every time that
we made contact with him, I ended up with several bullet holes in my
patrol cars.''
   The owner of the cabin called police Monday morning after he went
there ``and recognized that something was amiss,'' Schmidt said.
   A California warrant accused Savory of robbery and kidnapping in
a September gun-store robbery in which five other people have been
arrested, Schmidt said.
   Savory also has been investigated in connection with
manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons and explosives, and ``is
well known to authorities at the (California) state and federal
level,'' Schmidt said Sunday.
   Lopez, he said, ``may be a citizen of Mexico but we have very
little on his background.''
   Lopez, who was unarmed, was arrested without resistance in
Holbrook after an officer recognized him, police Lt. Ken Moore said.
Lopez was turned over to sheriff's deputies for questioning, Moore
said.
   Chief Deputy Arleigh Richmond said Lopez would be treated at a
Flagstaff hospital for frostbite to his feet and then returned to
Holbrook, possibly on Tuesday, to be booked. Richmond said it had
not been determined what charges would be filed against Lopez.
   Varner, 51, was shot three times Saturday night after he stopped
a car with two suspects. He died at a Phoenix hospital early Monday.
   The suspects, one of whom said he was a survivalist, later tied
up a couple with telephone cord at their home. The men took the
couple's car and fired on a second patrol vehicle; after a short
chase, the two wrecked the car and fled on foot, Schmidt said.

<DATELINE>KEYSVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The racially divided town of Keysville held
its first locally supervised election since the 1930s on Monday,
re-electing the mayor and voting in her all-black council slate.
   Joseph Cochran, the 67-year-old white challenger to Mayor Emma
Gresham, said he wasn't surprised by the results after a ruling
earlier Monday by the Burke County Board of Registrars against
challenges he had filed against 84 black voters.
   Mrs. Gresham got 127 votes, while Cochran got 61. In the council
races, Mrs. Gresham's slate won all five seats by similar margins.
   The ballots were counted Monday night after the county registrars
denied two challenges filed by Cochran, said Gayle Korotkin, an
attorney for Christic Institute South, a nonprofit foundation that
helped fight the challenges.
   Cochran had contended that the 84 voters he challenged did not
live within the east Georgia town's boundaries. Thirty-five of the
84 live in a section that was annexed by the town last year.
   ``Since the town's boundaries have not been established, I can't
see hardly how you can annex more property into it,'' Cochran said.
   Alan Gregory, another attorney for Christic Institute South, said
the annexation was precleared by the U.S. Justice Department and
approved by the Georgia secretary of state's office.
   In addition to the 35 voters living in the annexed area,
``they're challenging the same 49 people that were challenged in the
last election,'' Gregory said. ``Those were nullified by the
registrar at the end of the vote tallies. There is no reason for
those people to be challenged again.''
   Cochran, whose council slate included four whites and one black,
said Monday night he would consult with his attorney before deciding
whether to appeal the registrars' decision.
   The town is about 70 percent black and has about 230 registered
voters.
   Keysville's government was revived in January when Mrs. Gresham
and a slate of council members were elected to one-year terms.
   Monday's election, conducted under the town's original 1890
charter, was for 20-month terms. If the Legislature approves a new
charter, subsequent elections will be for four-year terms.
   For reasons lost to time, Keysville deactivated its government in
1933. In the 1980s, black residents tried to reactivate it to get
water, sewers, fire and police protection, all of which the town
lacked.
   There were problems defining boundaries, however, since the
original charter described the city limits as everything within a
half-mile radius of a schoolhouse demolished about 1895.
   White residents went to court to block the move to revive
Keysville's government. They denied they were worried about a
possible black government and said their concern was that installing
municipal services would tax poor blacks out of their homes.
   Mrs. Gresham and a council were elected the first time in 1985,
but white residents' contention that the town limits were not
defined was upheld in court and the vote was thrown out. The state
court issued an order forbidding the Keysville officials from taking
office.
   Those opposed to reactivating the government used the same
argument to try to prevent elections last year, but ultimately lost
in federal court.

   The bodies of six servicemen,
victims of the explosion of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland,
arrived at Dover Air Force Base at sunset Monday.
   At Boston's Logan International Airport, the sisters of another
victim, Thomas Walker, 47, of Quincy, Mass., were waiting when his
body arrived Monday.
   ``It's like a nightmare and it just goes on and on,'' said Sally
MacKinlay of Rockland, watching families greet passengers arriving
on the flight from London that brought the remains of her brother
home.
   All 259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21 were killed
when a bomb exploded while the jet was over Scotland, en route from
London to New York.
   At Dover Air Force Base, the largest mortuary operated by the
military, the bodies of an Air Force sergeant and five Army
personnel arrived aboard a military aircraft that was also
transporting explosives. Air Force officials said it is not unusual
for bodies and explosives to be transported on the same plane.
   The body of Air Force Sgt. Edgar H. Eggleston, 24, of Glens
Falls, N.Y. was removed by the Air Force honor guard. Eggleston,
stationed at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, was coming home to
visit his ill stepmother.
   The remaining bodies were removed from the plane by members of
the Old Guard, an Army honor guard, stationed in Washington, D.C.
   The bodies included that of Maj. Charles D. Mckee, of Trafford,
Pa. He had been an assistant attache for military affairs at the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, but never told his family or
friends.
   Officials identified the other victims as: Sgt. Philip V.
Bergstrom, of Forrest Lake, Minn.; Capt. Joseph P. Curry, 31, of
Fort Devons, Mass.; Spec. Kenneth J. Gibson, of Romulus, Mich.; and
Army Sgt. First Class Lloyd D. Ludlow, 41, of Pittsburg, Kansas.
   Ludlow and Gibson were stationed in Germany. Curry, assigned to
the 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Devens in Ayer, Mass., was
attending a conference in Europe and was on his way home.

   A ferry overloaded with New Year's
travelers sank off the Caribbean coast after it ran out of fuel,
leaving 67 people drowned and 14 missing, authorities said Monday.
They said 46 people survived.
   The ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday in Amatique Bay,
said Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, second-in-command at the Puerto
Barrios naval base.
   He said the 22-year-old captain, Juan Pablo Ezquibel, was
arrested after authorities determined that 120 people were aboard
the 30-ton ferry, although the manifest listed 40.
   The vessel was authorized to carry 90 people, he reported.
   Navy divers found no bodies inside the wreck, he said.
   Giron Arreola said the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile
run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios, and sank after
a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
   Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios,
said authorities who interviewed survivors believe the crew failed
to take adequate precautions while preparing to be towed.
   Giron Arreola said passengers ran to one side of the ferry while
it was under tow and the ferry sank.
   The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City said a 40-year-old
Spaniard, Vicente Daudi, was among the dead. It said his wife, Rosa
Maria Arnal, and a son survived, but two daughters were missing.
   Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic
development mission in Guatemala, the embassy said.
   A morgue official said 13 bodies were identified. Aside from
Daudi, the nationalities of victims were not known.
   Navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and other private craft
searched for the missing Monday.
   Puerto Barrios, 187 miles northeast of Guatemala City, the
capital, is Guatemala's main east coast port. There are no roads to
Livingston and most travel along the coast is by boat.

   Philippine Airlines on Tuesday
identified four people authorities say are members of a radical
Palestinian faction planning to hijack or blow up an Asian airliner
this month.
   Rollie Estabillio, spokesman for the airline, said the four are
believed to be members of a breakaway Palestine Liberation
Organization faction led by Abu Musa, who is supported by Syria and
Libya.
   Estabillio said the names were provided in a telex sent by
authorities at Tokyo's Narita International Airport last month. The
message prompted increased security at Asian airports in the wake of
the Dec. 21 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland, in which 270
people were killed.
   He identified them as Mudh Zaman Bakar, Muhen al-Barani, Mustafa
al-Burani and Ahmed Yasar and said they were believed to be carrying
passports from India, Pakistan and Oman.
   He said officials at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport
were carefully screening all passengers from South Asia and the
Middle East in view of the alert.
   Abu Musa, whose real name is Said Musa, broke with PLO chief
Yasser Arafat in 1983 because of opposition to peace moves with
Israel and his anger over Arafat's failure to stop the Israeli 1982
invasion of Lebanon.
   Last week, Asian aviation officials said they were warned by
Air-India of a possible attack on an Asian aircraft by Jan. 10.
Air-India refused comment, but sources in New Delhi said security
was increased at airports in New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras.
   Similar measures were ordered at airports in Hong Kong, Tokyo,
Taipei, Manila, Dhaka, Bangladesh and Colombo, Sri Lanka.
   On Monday, the Philippines deported a Syrian who was held at
Manila airport after Australia refused to accept him because it
suspected he was linked to a terrorist group, officials said.
   Immigration authorities said two security men shepherded Vartan
Bakerjian onto a Philippine Air Lines flight bound for Bangkok, the
capital of Thailand.
   Immigration official Ruben Domingo said Bakerjian left Bangkok on
Dec. 27 for Sydney, Australia, by way of Manila. Australian
authorities sent him back to the Philippines, and he was detained in
Manila on Saturday.
   Domingo said Australian authorities told Manila that Bakerjian
tore up a Greek passport which he used when entering the Philippines
and switched to a U.S. passport when he arrived in Sydney.
   ``When the guy was interrogated, the Australians came to the
conclusion he might be a suspected terrorist,'' Domingo said.
   Bakerjian denied being a member of an extremist group, Domingo
said, but he added that the Philippines decided to play it safe _
``especially with recent reports that some action would be taken
against Asian airlines by Middle East terrorists.''

<TEXT>
   The 12-foot wall of water that gushed
from a 300-foot-gap in a southern Utah dike was down to a trickle by
Monday and residents cleaned up mud and debris from the flooded 50
homes and 100 apartments.
   No injuries were reported from the Quail Creek Reservoir break
early Sunday that resulted in the evacuation of an estimated 1,500
along the Virgin River.
   The dike failure, which also ruined four bridges and closed
sections of area highways most of Sunday, prompted Gov. Norm
Bangerter to declare Washington County an emergency disaster area.
   Bangerter's declaration was necessary to open disaster relief
coffers. A similar designation by the state Federal Emergency
Management Agency office is expected later this week, said County
Emergency Services Director Tony Hafen.
   FEMA would reimburse up to 75 percent of the losses, with the
remainder covered by state and local governments, Hafen said.
   Teams of local, state and federal engineers and other emergency
service officials fanned out Monday to assess the damage in an
effort to put a price tag on the dike break and help residents
recoup their losses.
   The St. George suburb of Bloomington, 300 miles south of Salt
Lake City, was hardest hit, with up to 40 homes flooded.
   Bangerter said the $3 million dike, part of a reservoir and dam
project 14 miles east of St. George, will be rebuilt.
   After the dike gave way early Sunday, authorities ordered the
evacuation of 1,500 people living along the Virgin River. The haste
with which the evacuation was carried out angered some residents who
said they may have saved more property had they not been so rushed.
   Evacuations were ordered just after midnight but the water did
not reach their homes until well after 3 a.m.
   ``We could have gotten a lot of stuff out if we had been given a
more realistic time,'' said Myron Nelson, whose Bloomington
apartment was flooded. ``We got the TV and the sewing machine out
but there was a lot more we probably could have taken with us had we
known.''

<TEXT>
   French and British broadcast reports said Monday
that 17 trapped survivors of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Soviet Armenia
were found in a wrecked bread factory after living for three weeks
on grain and melted snow.
   The report could not be immediately confirmed. The official
Soviet news agency Tass, which has provided copious news on the
rescue efforts, made no mention of the report.
   In Paris, Europe 1 radio quoted a nurse for the French
humanitarian group Doctors of the World saying the 17 survivors were
found in a bread factory near Spitak, a village in northwestern
Armenia that was virtually destroyed. The nurse was quoted as saying
they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking melted snow.
   The nurse recently told a journalist at the station that the
survivors were apparently found Wednesday, 21 days after the quake,
and the report reached Yerevan on Saturday. The station had an
earlier version of the report quoting the nurse as saying they were
found Saturday.
   The male nurse spoke to Europe 1 on condition of anonymity.
   The London commercial radio station LBC reported that French
medics said the 17 were found Saturday, 24 days after the quake
rocked northwestern Armenia. It also said they stayed alive by
eating grain and drinking melted snow.
   It was not immediately possible to resolve the discrepancy over
when the survivors were found. The radio reports gave no details on
the conditions of the survivors or where they are now.
   The Associated Press was unable to reach by phone several
regional government officials, relief groups, and press
organizations in Yerevan, the Armenian capital. One official at the
republic's Interior Ministry said he knew of a smaller group of
survivors found Dec. 24 or 26, but he had no details and it was not
known if he was talking about the same group.
   The quake killed an estimated 25,000 people in Soviet Armenia and
left about 400,000 homeless. It severely damaged Leninakan, a city
of about 250,000 near Spitak.
   Armenia's Deputy Prime Minister, Vardkes Artsruny, said Dec. 23
that authorities were calling off the search because they did not
expect to find more survivors. He said efforts would focus on
rebuilding the southern republic.
   In the weeks after the quake, rescuers from the Soviet Union and
abroad used dogs, heavy equipment, and often their own hands to pick
through the wreckage in search of survivors.
   In many cases, they were guided by cries for help that sprang up
from countless wrecked buildings.
   The relief efforts provided many dramatic tales of human
endurance and resourcefulness.
   In one case, a woman trapped in her basement for eight days
helped keep her 3-year-old alive by pricking her own fingers and
letting the child suck her blood, a Soviet doctor said.
   Some people have sat in front of bulldozers to prevent the
clearing of debris until it could be searched for survivors.
Authorities wanted to bulldoze the rubble and spread quicklime to
prevent the spread of disease from the corpses.
   The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, was centered
25 miles north of Leninaken.

   President Fidel Castro, celebrating the 30th
anniversary of his revolution, rejected market-oriented economic
reforms and said that for Cuba, it is ``socialism or death.''
   Castro's remarks, in a televised speech Sunday night, seemed
aimed at the Soviet Union and other Communist countries that have
been abandoning strict adherence to Marxist doctrine.
   ``Today we say with more force than ever, socialism or death,
Marxism -Leninism or death,'' he said.
   Castro spoke to a large gathering from the balcony of the
municipal building in the eastern city of Santiago, where he had
proclaimed victory for his revolutionary struggle on Jan. 1, 1959.

   Federal regulators rescued a post-Depression
record 217 savings institutions in 1988, leaving Congress and
President-elect Bush to figure out the best way to pay the $38
billion bill.
   Theoretically, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
the S&amp;L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $45
billion to $50 billion _ to cover the cost.
   But analysts and many members of Congress say regulators have run
up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable.
   ``We still don't know the magnitude of the S&amp;L crisis,'' Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Sunday. ``We're not even
certain what the regulators have been doing the past week, running
up a tab of some $40 billion.''

   Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes
in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching
Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a
little more expensive.
   Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast
expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women,
and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases
on credit.
   Others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduled

Saturday night's choppy seas.
   It capsized in 65 feet of water about a mile from shore, and
strong currents kept rescue workers from searching the site for

   Mike has lived twice as long as might have been
expected when doctors diagnosed his AIDS. Dan Turner and Cristofer
Shihar had one chance in five of seeing 1984.
   They don't know why they've survived what has been a death
sentence for more than 45,000 Americans, but say it may be a matter
of attitude.
   ``A lot of people don't die of the disease, they die because they
give up,'' said Mike, a 34-year-old Chicagoan who was diagnosed with
acquired immune deficienty syndrome in January 1984. He asked that
his last name be withheld.
   According to Judith Wiker, a Chicago holistic therapist who says
she has counseled hundreds of clients with AIDS or AIDS-related
problems, Mike is one of many people with the disease who are well
enough to feel and act normal.
   ``There are a lot of healthy people running around with AIDS,''
she said.
   Scientists are trying to determine just why some people have
survived as long as 10 years with AIDS. The federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta is studying 119 people known to have
lived with it for three or more years.
   ``Is the virus somehow different?'' asks Ann M. Hardy, a CDC
epidemiologist now at the National Center for Health Statistics in
Hyattsville, Md. ``Is it something in their immune system?''
   Does survival time hinge on the mildness or severity of the
infections that attack people with AIDS? Or could the key really be
a ``lifestyle-psychosocial type of thing'' _ a positive attitude and
emotional support?
   All of these possibilities are now being studied, either by the
CDC or in studies funded by the National Institutes of Health.
   For the purposes of the CDC's 2-year-old study, long-term
survivors were defined as people who lived at least three years
after being diagnosed.
   Unlike the estimated hundreds of thousands of Americans who are
infected with the AIDS virus but do not have symptoms, long-term
survivors actually have battled one or more ailments that define
acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ including Kaposi's sarcoma,
pneumonia, damaged immune systems and severe weight loss.
   Most long-term survivors are white homosexual men in their 30s
whose main or only symptom is Kaposi's sarcoma, the skin cancer that
was rare before AIDS became an epidemic, CDC data indicates.
   ``The major issue people are interested in is what way the immune
response for the long-term survivor is different than in the
short-term survivor,'' said Dr. Henry Masur, deputy chief of
critical care medicine at the the Clinical Center of the NIH in
Bethesda, Md.
   ``With any disease, whether it's cancer or pneumonia, in a
healthy person, some people get sick very quickly and die and other
people survive much longer. With breast cancer or colon cancer, some
people will be dead within a few months and some people will go for
30 years,'' Masur said.
   For Mike, an accountant, three years of chemotherapy kept the
skin sores of Kaposi's sarcoma at bay. He then began treatment with
the drug AZT, now called zidovudine, which prolongs the lives of
many with AIDS.
   Mike, who considers himself ``fairly lucky,'' said his only
current health problem is mild leg pain. ``I'm basically as normal
as they get. Nobody would know, if they saw me on the street, that I
had been diagnosed with AIDS.''
   Turner, 42, of San Francisco, was diagnosed with Kaposi's in
February 1982, before most Americans _ including doctors _ had heard
of AIDS.
   ``I do believe one can live with AIDS and strike up a bargain and
co-exist with the virus, as we do with other viruses,'' said Turner.
   He underwent chemotherapy, a year of acupuncture, took megadoses
of Vitamin C for a while, has taken zidovudine intermittently since
early 1988 and still gets alpha-interferon, a genetically engineered
anti-cancer drug.
   ``I go to the gym regularly, and I try to maintain my weight and
my energy level,'' said Turner, who writes and performs music. ``A
friend and I have just finished writing a movie script, which we
hope to sell.''
   Shihar, 38, of Los Angeles, was diagnosed with Kaposi's in
November 1982, and said he's done ``just about the opposite of all
the recommended treatments'' but his illness went into remission
anyway.
   ``I would love to say it was all very spiritual, but I was in
remission before I became spiritual,'' said Shihar, who works for
Northern Lights Alternatives, a New York-based education and support
organization for people with AIDS. ``I think the one thing I hear
from people I know who have survived is they're real stubborn.''
   Ms. Wiker believes ``there is a certain kind of person that is a
survivor with AIDS. That kind of personality is one that starts
living in the moment, a person that is letting go of their past
feelings and fears ... and they're letting go of future projections
about death.''
   That theory is being tested in a federally funded study at the
New York State Psychiatric Institute, where 450 people infected with
the AIDS virus are being tracked for five years to determine whether
their emotional state influences their resistance to the illness.
   ``Most people would like to believe they have control over this,
and if they remain optimistic and cheerful it will help,'' said Dr.
Jack M. Gorman, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and principal
investigator in the study.
   ``And we certainly want to encourage people to remain optimistic
and cheerful, but we don't really know if it makes a difference or
not, and that's what we're trying to see,'' he added.
   Regardless of psychological factors, survival prospects
continually improve in newly diagnosed AIDS cases, thanks to drug
treatments such as zidovudine and an aerosol form of pentamidine, a
medication that fights the rare type of pneumonia that has been
highly fatal to AIDS patients.
   As recently as two years ago, 80 percent of people with AIDS were
expected to die within 24 months, but that has changed dramatically,
said Dr. Nathaniel Pier, a New York City physician with a large
number of AIDS patients.
   The CDC says it can't currently estimate AIDS victims' average
survival.
   ``As of November 1988, we can assist somebody to stay alive and
healthy for two years, with the current therapy,'' Piers said. ``And
a great deal may occur in two years. We've seen an enormous change
from 1986 to 1988.
   ``Many people being diagnosed now may benefit from breakthroughs
that will totally change the surface of the disease.''

   Clarisse, a calf with an electric heart, is
one sign that political fighting over federal funding hasn't stopped
researchers trying to develop a permanent replacement for as many as
400 diseased hearts a year.
   Clarisse got her heart Dec. 8, about eight months after the
National Institutes of Health decided to suspend $20 million in
contracts for research on a permanent artificial heart _ and six
months after the NIH reversed itself.
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Hearth, Lung and
Blood Institute _ a part of the NIH _ questioned in May whether more
than a decade of research would lead to a permanent heart that the
body wouldn't reject.
   Under pressure from members of Congress, Lenfant said in July
that the contracts would not be suspended. The five groups funded
are Hershey Medical Center of Pennsylvania State University; the
University of Utah; Abiomed Inc. of Danvers, Mass., working with the
Texas Heart Institute of Houston; and Nimbus Co. of Rancho Cordova,
Calif., working with the Cleveland Clinic.
   ``Clearly, there is controversy in the medical community over
whether or not the artificial heart is the right device,'' Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., said recently. ``If funding is cut off now, we will
never know if the artificial heart was the right answer.''
   Researchers at Penn State and Utah have been working since the
mid-1970s on electrical versions of the air-driven, or pneumatic,
heart first implanted in Seattle dentist Barney Clark in December
1982 at the University of Utah.
   Recipients of air-driven hearts remain mostly bedridden in
hospitals, linked by tubes to large compressors, unless they get
human heart transplants. Recipients of the electric heart will be
able to walk, exercise and even work.
   ``The advantage of these hearts is that you'll be able to put
everything inside the patient's chest except the battery,'' said
Gerson Rosenberg, assistant chief of Penn State's division of
artifical organs.
   ``Nobody is ever saying that this is going to be as good as a
natural heart, that this patient is going to forget he's got it and
go on to live a normal life. That's not true,'' Rosenberg said.
   Because the devices must meet specific requirements _ such as
pumping eight liters of blood a minute _ designs are similar at all
five research facilities. The Penn State device, which has the size
and heft of a squared softball, has a 10-pound, rechargeable battery
pack on a waist belt. A battery in the heart will let a recipient
take off the external battery for up to 45 minutes.
   The device, designed to last about five years, probably will cost
about the $80,000 to $100,000 that a heart transplant costs,
Rosenberg said.
   Hershey began testing its electric models in animals in 1983. One
implanted Jan. 8, 1983, in a calf named ``E.T.'' _ short for
``Electric Total'' _ enabled the animal to live 222 days _ a record
on any electric artificial heart.
   Since then, the device has grown smaller _ closer in size to a
human heart _ as researchers make use of advancements in a
miniaturized electronics.
   Rosenberg said he expects human tests to begin in the late 1990s.
Researchers had hoped to start the trials in the early 1990s, but
scaling down the electronics proved more difficult than expected.
   Despite the delays in perfecting a permanent heart, there have
been benefits from the research, including better knowledge of drugs
to prevent heart disease or strokes, improved design on commonly
used artificial heart valves, and better techniques and materials
for use in cardiac bypass surgery.
   Rosenberg said the progress that's been made against heart
disease is unlikely to eliminate the need for artificial heart
research.
   ``I don't think anything would please the people working on the
artificial heart more than to hear that something was discovered to
prevent all that,'' he said. ``But I doubt that that will happen.''

   Samuel Gruber wants to change the
perception of sharks as prehistoric, and says the ocean-going
killing machines have a complex immune system that could become an
``antibody factory'' for humans.
   Gruber, a University of Miami biological oceanographer, has been
intrigued with sharks since an underwater encounter with a
hammerhead in 1958.
   ``After 30 years of studying them, the most astonishing thing
I've found about sharks is that they are so sophisticated. They have
so many systems that are in higher animals, that if you didn't know
better, you'd think that _ like the whales _ they evolved on land
and went back to the sea.''
   Gruber studies the lemon shark, unique because it can survive
while motionless in the water, making observation easier. Among the
oddities he has observed are its eyes _ which differ among various
sharks _ its reproductive system and its ``highly generalized but
extremely powerful'' immune system.
   Sharks' eyes are unusual because some can close like a human's
and others are covered by a transparent nictitating membrane, Gruber
said. ``That's just totally unheard of in fish. Sharks have eyes
more or less like a cat's, with split pupils. It certainly cannot be
explained.''
   The reproductive system more closely resembles a mammal's than a
fish's.
   The lemon shark takes up to 15 years to reach sexual maturity,
then gives live birth to a dozen pups every other year. While fish
lay thousands of eggs, the shark gives birth complete with placenta
and umbilical cord.
   Only three of the dozen pups are likely to survive two years,
which has profound implications for human treatment of sharks, which
many people still see as a dangerous pest or, at best, a source of
meat, Gruber said. ``You want to exploit that resource, but you want
it renewable. While a pair of salmon can lay 10,000 eggs and
reproduce its entire species, sharks and whales can only have a very
low number of young after a very, very long period of time.''
   That means they are surprisingly fragile as a species; traps off
South Africa have virtually eliminated sharks in only a few years.
That would have a disastrous effect on many other species, Gruber
said. Sharks are predators, and essential to evolution by
eliminating weaker members of species.
   But humans might have even more reason to mourn the loss of
sharks.
   Products from sharks' immune system have shown promise in
treating diseases, he said. ``They are not only able to make
antibodies, they already have antibodies to many disease that they
would never see or get, such as human smallpox. Why this is I don't
know.''
   When attacked by a disease, sharks generate huge amounts of
antibodies, making them a potential factory for helping humans fight
diseases like AIDS or cancer, he said. ``If we could keep a number
of sharks and raise antibodies, then each person could have his own
shark, his own antibody factory.''
   There is evidence of cancer-fighting potential in the shark's
skeleton, Gruber said. ``Researchers were actually able to isolate a
protein that when injected into the tumor would cause it to dry up
and die.''
   Side effects make such treatment impractical for humans, but
Gruber is interested because he suffers from a cancer of the lymph
system that causes his joints to swell. He goes regularly to
California for an experimental treatment that involves injections of
rat antibodies.
   Despite cancer and occasional accidents including a mangled hand,
nearly drowning and having a shark almost tear his leg off, Gruber
said he intends to continue his underwater research. ``We owe it to
the world to study something like the shark. And you can't do it
from the top of a hill with field glasses.''

growing wheat in a computer-controlled capsule that mimics Earth's
ecosystem.
   The Kennedy Space Center scientists cultivated their garden by
hand for about three years in the 12-by-23-foot ``biomass production
chamber,'' and then turned it over in mid-November to a computer.
The computer makes sure that the wheat, growing hydroponically, gets
enough light, air, water and fertilizer.
   ``If you're truly, permanently going to space, you've got to have
a system like this,'' says plant physiologist William Knott, head of
the project.
   Without such a system, Knott says, astronauts would need regular
shipments of fresh air, potable water and prepared food _
prohibitively expensive for any planned space habitats and
impossible for voyaging spaceships.
   ``Sooner or later, we're going to get tired of sending TV dinners
out and bringing port-a-potties back,'' said agricultural engineer
John Sager.
   One problem is trying to cram enough of the important parts of
the biosphere into a container small enough to fit in a spaceship,
said Ralph Prince, another agricultural engineer. ``In the physical
world, if you model a dam on the Tennessee River, you build
everything smaller. When we model the biological process ... we
can't build people smaller.''
   A life support system in flight might carry several staple crops
such as wheat, rice, beans, soy, potatoes, peanuts and lettuce, and
might carry only 25 gallons of water. Astronauts would have to
recycle water to stretch the supply.
   Another obstacle is converting sewage into a fertilizer that
won't kill the plants, which thrive on a carefully blended chemical
solution.
   A prototype life support system could be ready for a ground test
by 1995, but it could be 2020 before a system would be available for
flight testing, say National Aeronautics and Space Administration
scientists.

<NOTE>Women Control Labor Pain With the Push of a Button</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women may be only a button away from
controlling the severity of their labor pains during childbirth,
according to a North Carolina researcher who studied a
self-administered pain-killing technique.
   The technique, patient-controlled epidural analgesia, lets a
woman control the amount of pain medication she gets. Patients who
used it tended to use less than those who got medication from a
doctor or nurse, said Steven Z. Lysak, who directed a study of 74
women at Wake Forest University Medical Center.
   In addition to potentially limiting fetal exposure to anesthesia,
the self-administered technique provides a psychological advantage
by increasing patient participation in the labor process,
researchers said.
   ``Using this technique, women safely and effectively treated
their own pain throughout the course of labor,'' said Lysak, who
presented his findings last year at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Anesthesiologists.
   Patients who use the technique push a button to administer a
measured dose of a pain-relieving medication. A thin tube inserted
near the patient's spinal cord in the lower back carries medication
to nerves and receptors. The device has a timer to prevent a patient
from overdosing herself.

<NOTE>Researchers Develop Multichannel Stethoscope</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biomedical engineer and an anesthesiologist
are working on a high-tech version of the stethoscope, with three
sound pickups instead of the single amplifier doctors use to chill
their patients.
   The multichannel electronic stethoscope designed by Daniel Benson
and Jeffrey Joseph improves the doctor's ability to hear and monitor
the supply of oxygen to a patient's lungs during surgery, and lets
the anesthesiologist hear the heart and changes in breathing sounds
from each lung.
   The sound is amplified, filtered, mixed and transmitted to a
headset worn by the anesthesiologist, who can isolate each channel
or hear all three.
   It can help determine if an oxygen tube has shifted or is
inserted incorrectly, or if a lung has collapsed, said Joseph, an
anesthesiologist at Chestnut Hill Hospital. ``By using the
multichannel stethoscope and comparing the sounds, you can recognize
problems that much faster.
   ``You can localize even a slight wheeze by turning up the volume
and come up with a good diagnosis.''
   Joseph and Benson, of Thomas Jefferson University, have applied
for a patent for their version of the device first invented in 1819
by Renee Laennec, a French physician. The Patent Office says 324
patents for stethoscopes have been issued in the United States,
including 102 electronic versions and 173 with special acoustic
properties.

<HEAD>Tips To Prevent Ear Discomfort During Airline Travel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Do your ears hurt when your jetliner starts
descending for a landing? Here are some tips from the nation's ear,
nose and throat doctors to relieve the discomfort:
   _Pop your ears to equalize the pressure. Pinch your nostrils,
take in a mouthful of air and, with your mouth closed, use your
cheek and throat muscles to force the air into the back of your nose
``as if you were trying to blow your fingers off your nose. When you
feel a pop in your ears, you may have succeeded,'' said Dr. Robert
Schindler of the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and
Neck Surgery.
   If necessary, repeat the procedure several times, but stop if it
hurts.
   _Try swallowing and yawning to activate the muscle that opens the
Eustachian tube connecting the back of the throat with the middle
ear. Chewing gum or letting mints melt in your mouth will help you
swallow more often.
   _Avoid sleeping during descent. You may not swallow enough to
keep up with pressure changes if you are asleep.
   _If you have allergies, take antihistamines at the start of the
flight or a decongestent pill or nose spray an hour or so before
descent.
   Schindler said the medications will help your ears pop more
easily, but they shouldn't be used by people with heart disease,
high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, thyroid disease or
excessive nervousness.
   If your ears fail to open or pain persists after landing, you may
need to consult your ear doctor, he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Gains In December, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers' confidence about the state of the
economy increased in December, boosted by low inflation, low
unemployment and growth in personal income, a business-financed
research organization reported.
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to
119.8, up nearly 7 points from November, the board said in a report
for release Tuesday. The index had declined in November to 113.1
from October's figure of 116.9.
   People interviewed for the survey were particularly positive
about the current economic situation, the board said, with this
component of the confidence index reaching its highest point since
the boom years of the late 1960s.
   The monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households is conducted for the
board by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.
   ``The consumer's very favorable assessment of prevailing
conditions reflects the continued vigor of the economy and bodes
well for the immediate future,'' said Fabian Linden, executive
director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
   ``Unemployment is at its lowest level in many years, personal
income continues to grow, and the inflation rate is virtually
imperceptible to the average shopper,'' he said in a statement.
``All these factors contribute to a high level of confidence.
   ``Still, there is some uncertainty about the future, with the
policies of the new administration on such major issues as the
federal budget and the foreign trade deficits still unknown,'' he
added.
   Buying plans among those surveyed remained at roughly the same
level for the past few months, the board said. About 7 percent of
respondents said they plan to purchase a car within six months, 3.5
percent intend to buy a home in the period, and nearly 29 percent
plan to buy a major appliance.

<HEAD>Japan Struggles With Influx of Illegal Foreign Laborers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wealth of job opportunities is luring tens of
thousands of South and Southeast Asians to Japan, forcing this once
isolated nation to cope with the problem of migrant labor.
   More than half the foreigners working at companies investigated
by the Labor Ministry between Oct. 16 and Nov. 16 were found to be
working illegally, a recent report showed.
   Poor working conditions and the risk of deportation haven't
discouraged the wave of workers from less wealthy Asian nations, nor
have wages that are low by Japanese standards although, because of
the strong yen, high in the foreign workers' own countries.
   The Japanese government, so far, has responded to the surge in
foreign labor with plans to open its doors wider to foreign
professionals. But it has reaffirmed a ban on manual laborers,
provoking a national debate over the merits of internationalizing
Japan's closed society.
   While government and private groups study the problem, the influx
of illegal foreign workers continues to grow.
   In 1987, the Labor Ministry deported 11,307 foreigners for
working illegally. In the first half of this year, Japanese police
and immigration authorities arrested 7,196 foreigners for working
illegally, up from 5,802 in the first half of 1987.
   But those numbers compare with police estimates that about 70,000
illegal foreign workers are in Japan.
   About half the illegal workers are men.
   Women, often recruited by crime syndicates, long have flocked to
Japan to work, often legally, as ``entertainers.'' Human rights
groups say the gangs that control Japan's underworld often force
them into working as prostitutes.
   Since 1985, however, the number of illegal male workers in Japan
has ballooned as unskilled workers from the Philippines, Bangladesh
and Pakistan find ready employment, Labor Ministry figures show.
   In the ministry's investigation, of 202 foreigners working at
15,796 companies, 111 were working illegally, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   It said 54 of the illegal workers were from Bangladesh, 36 from
Pakistan, 13 from India, two each from Ghana, Taiwan and Thailand
and one each from the Philippines and South Korea.
   Most of the clandestine laborers worked long hours with no
vacations for low wages, having overstayed tourist visas after
finding work at construction sites or in small metal working,
chemical or food processing factories, the report said.
   Despite the government ban, firms that hire foreign manual
workers are not penalized. A shortage of Japanese willing to do
manual labor encourages them to employ foreigners, who often are
reluctant to complain of poor treatment due to the risk of
deportation, said Eiko Shinotsuka, a labor economist at Ochanomizu
University in Tokyo.
   Both men and women working illegally are vulnerable to
exploitation because of their illegal status, said Yaeko Takeoka, a
lawyer familiar with the problems of clandestine workers.
   Japanese employees in the metal working industry receive average
hourly wages of 2,150 yen, or about $17.20. Clandestine workers
receive hourly wages of 500 to 700 yen, or $4 to $5.60, Labor
Ministry figures show.
   But a few months of even low wages in Japanese yen amount to a
fortune for migrant workers due to the lower cost of living in other
Asian countries. Japan's average per capita income is about $17,000,
compared with $550 in the Philippines, $113 in Bangladesh and $360
in Pakistan.
   By living together in small apartments to save on expenses, the
clandestine workers manage to send about half their wages home to
their families. Isolated in a society where they must constantly
hide from police and immigration officials, few plan to stay in
Japan indefinitely.
   ``They just come for short stays,'' Shinotsuka said.
   Economists say the influx of illegal laborers is unlikely to
abate because Japan's 2.4 percent unemployment rate reflects a trend
toward shortages of workers in certain industries.
   A recent report by the National Council for Development of an
Economic Structure of the 21st Century predicted that Japan will
face a shortage of 2.7 million workers by the year 2000 if current
economic trends continue.
   The council recommended that Japan accept unskilled and
semi-skilled foreign workers and suggested establishment of a system
to prevent exploitation of ``guest workers.''
   Numerous commentaries also have urged that Japan welcome its less
affluent neighbors.
   ``In Japan, we don't accept political asylum and we turn our
backs on immigrants. Maybe, in the short run, this is a wise policy
in avoiding problems. However, can we say this policy is right over
the long run?'' wrote commentator Yunosuke Ohkura in The Japan Times.
   Noting that Japanese believe they are ``unique and therefore
superior,'' Mitsunobu Sugiyama of the University of Tokyo said in a
recent article in the Japan Quarterly that ``constant contact with
the people of other nations on this very personal level would do
much to open Japanese eyes and help them better understand the rest
of the world.''
   A recent report by a Labor Ministry advisory panel, however,
concluded that foreign manual laborers were undesirable. Their
unfamiliarity with Japanese language and customs, it said, could
cause social conflict.

<HEAD>Carrier Begins Year With Mediation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, smaller and deeper in debt than a
year ago, begins 1989 facing federal mediation considered crucial to
what the carrier will look like a year from now _ if it still exists.
   ``We simply cannot survive if the National Mediation Board
persists in holding Eastern hostage as it has been doing,'' wrote
Tom Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human resources,
in a Dec. 28 letter to Walter C. Wallace, chairman of the mediation
board.
   Wallace will participate in Jan. 6 mediation at an undisclosed
location between Eastern and its Machinists union. The mediation
sessions, with no deadline set by the federal board, are aimed at
settling a 16-month-old contract dispute that has been before the
board for a year.
   Failure to reach agreement could lead to the mediation board's
declaration of an impasse. That would trigger a 30-day cooling-off
period, after which the union could strike and Eastern could impose
its own work conditions.
   While some union leaders suspect the hard-line Texas Air Corp.
ownership would like a strike so that it could try to break the
strike and bust the union, the struggling airline might not last
through disruptions and much more negative publicity.
   Eastern ended the year with new public questions about its safety
after an emergency landing Dec. 26 in Charleston, W.Va. of an
Eastern flight with a hole in its fuselage. There were no injuries
and company officials say Eastern has one of the industry's best
safety records.
   But the incident came after Eastern earlier in the year went
through a comprehensive Federal Aviation Administration probe and
Department of Transportation scrutiny. Those studies said Eastern
was safe, but its unusually bad labor-management relations could
threaten safety.
   Executives of Eastern's pilots union will meet early this month
to discuss their contract talks, begun about six months ago, with
management. The pilots are also hopeful the National Mediation
Board, which has set final briefs for early February, will agree
with them that Eastern and its Texas Air sister, Continental
Airlines, are being run as a single carrier.
   A single-carrier ruling could lead to unionization of
Continental, to which Texas Air has transferred some Eastern assets
because of its non-union status, the pilots union says. Eastern
officials say Continental is run separately from Eastern.
   The pilots haven't said whether they would honor a Machinists
strike.
   Since Machinists negotiations began, Eastern has laid off 7,233
employees, or about a fifth of its workforce, and lost $319 million,
the company says.
   It has been lobbying ardently for declaration of an impasse,
bringing the 30-day deadline the company says will force movement in
the negotiations.
   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three
quarters of 1988, and its loss for the past decade totals $1.3
billion.
   Management and its largest union, the 8,500-worker Machinists,
are $200 million apart in their latest contract offers. But besides
money, there are important philosophical differences between the two
sides.
   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan firmly
believes workers should have a major role in company
decision-making. His dream has been an employee-owned Eastern.
   The management of Eastern, bought nearly three years ago by
Houston-based Texas Air, has been more interested in slashing the
wages of the non-mechanics in the Machinists union. Mechanics
comprise about half the union, but the management says it must cut
baggage handler and other non-mechanic wages.
   Some baggage handlers, for example, woud have hourly wages cut
over three years from $15.60 to $10. Mechanics, who comprise about
half the union, would be cut only by small amounts. Union officials
have described the company offer as a divide-and-conquer strategy to
split the union between mechanics and the other workers.
   Eastern management also points out that Machinists refused to
take the 20 percent salary cuts agreed to by its pilots and flight
attendants unions in February 1986 in an effort to stave off
bankruptcy or the sale to Texas Air. Machinists leaders say Eastern
employees are being told to suffer even more for bad management that
isn't committed to keeping Eastern alive.
   The unions say Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo is stripping away
Eastern's assets and will abandon a carcass.
   The $365 million sale of Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle
service to New York developer Donald Trump and the earlier spinoff
of Eastern's computer reservations system to Texas Air are cited to
support that argument. Planes and gates have also been sold, and
Eastern reportedly has been offering other assets such as Canadian
routes.
   Eastern says it needs cash infusions to keep operating.
   Bryan, who portrays his union's resistance to Lorenzo as a
virtual holy war, has sought a ``white knight'' to rescue Eastern
employees and allow them to take over the airline. But the only
reported serious talks last year about buying Eastern were with TWA
chairman Carl Icahn, who wanted steep union concessions.
   In a Nov. 9 letter to Bryan, Lorenzo, who hadn't deigned to
communicate directly with Bryan until recent months, said the
contract negotiations were the most realistic way to help the
airline.
   ``Time is running against Eastern,'' Lorenzo wrote.

<TEXT>
   The nation's economy closed 1988 with vigorous
growth, with December posting the biggest increase in the rates of
production and new orders for goods since July, according to a
survey of corporate purchasing executives released Tuesday.
   ``December exited like a lion,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman
of the National Association of Purchasing Management's Business
Survey Committee. ``The continued robust growth capped the final
quarter at what could be the strongest growth rate of the year.
   ``Except for a solid downtrend in the rate of inflation, there
were few signs of the anticipated slowing in this, the seventh year
of the recovery,'' added Bretz, who is director of materials
management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   The group's Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 58.1 percent
in December, compared with 56.6 percent in November. The December
figure was the highest since July's 59 percent. A reading above 50
percent indicates that the economy is generally expanding; below 50,
that it is generally declining.
   The group's seasonally adjusted production index advanced to 61.3
percent, compared with 58.2 percent in November. It was the highest
since July's 62.7 percent, according to the monthly survey of
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies.
   The index of new orders rose to 60.1 percent, up from 58 percent
in November, and the highest since 62.1 percent in July.
   The employment growth rate index slowed only slightly in December
to 57.5 percent. Except for November's 57.9 percent, it was at its
highest level since December 1987.
   New export orders increased at the highest rate since July after
growing at a slower rate for the four previous months, the survey
found. Of those members of the trade group who export, 30 percent
reported higher export orders, up from 22 percent in November. The 6
percent who indicated lower export orders was down from 8 percent in
November.
   Vendor deliveries, which indicate whether companies are receiving
orders faster than they can deliver them, contined to slow in
December, to 54 percent compared with November's 52.1 percent,
reflecting the seasonally strong growth in production, the
association said.
   Inventories also increased, but at a lesser rate than in
November. The seasonally adjusted inventory index was 51.4 percent
in December, compared with November's 52.6 percent. This suggests
that some modest inventory buildup may have occurred to hedge
against announced Jan. 1 price increases and to alleviate shortages
in some commodities, the group said.
   The growth rate in prices was lower for the sixth consecutive
month and was at its lowest level since May 1987, the survey found,
confirming a solid decline in inflation since midyear.
   In another survey last month, a majority of the group's members
said they believed the economy would do better this year than in
1988, with continued growth and slower inflation.

<TEXT>
   The folks at Clemons Boot Co. would like to
stick to making standard-sized boots to sell off the shelf, but
loggers and cowboys keep walking through the door after cutting off
a toe or breaking a leg.
   ``One of the first guys who came to us had a brace that fit on
the inside of a boot,'' said Walt Clemons, the patriarch of the
family business. ``He couldn't find a store-bought boot to fit him.''
   ``A little while ago we made a caulked boot for a guy with a
walking cast,'' said Clemons' son, Bill. ``He was self-employed and
said he had to get back to work.
   ``We'd really kind of like to phase that out. But that's our
bread and butter. People keep us so busy (with custom work) we can't
really do that.''
   The Clemons family _ Walt, his wife, Anita; their son, Bill, and
his wife, Theresa _ specializes in making caulked boots and packers.
   Caulked (pronounced corked) boots have high lace-up tops and
spikes _ known as caulks (corks) _ on the soles. They are favored by
loggers for sure footing on logs, rocks and steep hillsides.
   Packers are lace-up cowboy boots that offer pointed toes and tall
heels to fit a stirrup while riding a horse and ankle support while
walking on the ground.
   With Anita cutting out the leather pieces, Theresa sewing them
together, Walt forming the uppers over the last and Bill finishing
them off with soles, the Clemons family turns out three pairs of
boots a day.
   Although Clemons sells through a few retail outlets in Oregon and
Washington and have filled an order that came out of the blue from
Horsehead, N.Y., they are a small outfit and like it that way.
   ``We're small enough that we don't have people coming in and
telling us what we can and can't do,'' says Anita.
   ``The caulked boot business is such a limited market that the
Japanese and the other countries are not interested,'' says Bill.
``If you were talking dress loafers, we couldn't compete.''
   The $225 they charge for a pair of standard-sized caulked boots
is competitive with mass-produced boots. It's $50 extra for a custom
fit.
   The Clemons family once tried to boost production by hiring some
help, but it didn't work out.
   ``People don't care the way we care,'' Anita said. ``They're used
to getting mill wages and we couldn't pay it.''
   Disdaining cardboard, they put steel shanks and stiff nylon heel
counters in the caulked boots to make them more rugged.
   The foot part of the boot is sewn on with the smooth skin side of
the leather on the inside to make them tougher still.
   ``If the skin side is out you can cut that on a rock the first
day and it won't hold grease,'' to keep the water out, Bill said.
   They rely on satisfied customers to get the word out. ``We've
only advertised two times,'' Bill said.
   Packers with red tops and black bottoms were all the rage for
awhile among working cowboys.
   ``The buckeroos don't make much money, but what little they do
make they put into their gear,'' says Walt. ``You ride the range all
day and a good-looking boot can be something to talk about.''

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. took the No. 1 spot in
domestic securities underwriting in 1988, ending the five-year reign
of Salomon Brothers Inc. in that position, according to a company
that follows the industry.
   Merrill Lynch's total underwritings for the year were $39.7
billion, or 14.5 percent of the $273 billion overall total brought
to market in 1988, according to a report Friday from IDD Information
Services.
   Second overall was Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., with $36.9 billion,
while Salomon Brothers Inc. _ which held the top spot for the
previous five years _ slipped to third place at $33.9 billion, IDD
said.
   Merrill Lynch took first place in three equity-related securities
categories _ common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt
rankings.
   Merrill Lynch managed nearly $5 billion of the $29.6 billion in
common stock offerings, while Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was second
at $4.7 billion and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. was third with
$3.3 billion.
   Merrill Lynch was also first in preferred stock underwriting at
$2.5 billion, which was more than a third of the market, and in
convertible debt underwriting, managing about $1 billion of the $3.1
billion total.
   Goldman Sachs took first place in straight-debt issues, with $34
billion out of a $233 billion market, IDD said. Salomon Brothers
slipped to second place with $32 billion, and Merrill Lynch was
third with $31 billion.
   Goldman Sachs also was first in mortgage-backed debt underwriting
at $17 billion while Salomon Brothers managed $13 billion, according
to IDD.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. underwrote $11.9 billion, or 43
percent, of the market in new junk bonds, the high-risk, high-yield
debt offerings.
   In distant second was First Boston with $3.9 billion, while
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. had $3.1 billion for third place.
   Eurobond offerings increased by 28 percent from 1987 to $180
billion, IDD said. Nomura Securities International repeated in the
top spot with $17.5 billion, followed by Credit Suisse First Boston
with $14.4 billion and Deutsche Bank at $12.1 billion.
   Nomura also took the No. 1 position in international equity
offerings, with $1 billion, IDD said.

<HEAD>Venezuela Plans to Start New Debt Talks Within Two Weeks</HEAD>

   Venezuela, which has a foreign debt of
about $33 billion, will initiate a new round of refinancing talks
with its Bank Advisory Committee within two weeks, the government
said.
   Finance Minister Hector Hurtado and Finance Vice-Minister Eglee
Iturbe de Blanco notified advisory committee chairman Chase
Manhattan Bank that a negotiating team will arrive in New York ``in
the first half of January.''
   Hurtado's message was sent Dec. 31 and published in local
newspapers Monday.
   President Jaime Lusinchi announced the reopening of talks on much
of Venezuela's $33 billion debt in his annual New Year's address.
Venezuela is Latin America's fourth largest debtor.
   Lusinchi also declared a moratorium on principal payments of
foreign commercial bank debt, most of which is included in a $20.34
billion refinancing pact signed in 1986 and modified in 1987.
   The moratorium, which begins Jan. 17, initially affects some $700
million due during 1989 under the existing pact, plus some
commercial bank debt not included in the pact.
   Venezuela has already paid nearly $1.5 billion in principal
refinanced in the $20.34 billion agreement.
   The moratorium does not include principal payment of debts to
multilateral or official financial institutions, foreign
currency-denominated public bonds, trade credits or loans acquired
after 1983, Hurtado said in the message to the banks. Interest
payments are also not affected.
   Talks are likely to be concluded during the administration of
President-elect Carlos Andres Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2.
   Perez advisers say they want to stretch the current 14-year
refinancing pact to 25 years and reduce net yearly debt payments to
no more than $1.5 billion.
   Perez plans to travel Tuesday to Mexico for informal talks on the
foreign debt and other regional issues with Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, Perez' office said Monday.
   The Venezuelan president-elect is promoting a common Latin
American framework for debt talks which would link debt to trade and
reduce payments.
   In 1988, Venezuela paid about $5 billion in public and private
debt service, or half of its total estimated foreign exchange income
of $10.1 billion.

<HEAD>Iraq Cuts Exports To Comply With OPEC Quota, Saudi King Issues Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has cut oil exports by 90,000 barrels
a day in accordance with its new OPEC production quota of 2.64
million barrels a day, the official Iraqi News Agency reported
Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said that as of Jan. 1 Iraq had
stopped trucking 65,000 barrels a day to Jordan's Red Sea port of
Aqaba and another 25,000 barrels a day through Turkey.
   Meanwhile, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Monday launched a
multi-billion deficit budget for fiscal 1989 with a warning that
Saudi Arabia would not be bound by OPEC-fixed oil production quotas
if others violated them.
   Iraq currently exports 1.5 million barrels a day through a
pipeline across Turkey to Mediterranean ports, and another 500,000
barrels a day through a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea
port of Yanbu, the agency said.
   Iraq's quota, matching that of Iran, was set by the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at a cartel meeting in
Vienna in November.
   Previously Iran had a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day, compared
to 1.5 million barrels a day for Iraq, which was heavily exceeding
its quota.
   The former gulf war enemies badly need increased oil revenues in
order to rebuild economies shattered by 8 years of hostilities.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the official Saudi Press Agency said
budget outlays for the world's biggest oil-exporting nation were
approved at a weekly cabinet session chaired by King Fahd.
   Expenditures were set at 141 million riyals, or about $37.6
billion, against projected revenues of 116 billion riyals, or $30.9
billion.
   That left a deficit of 25 billion riyals, or $6.7 billion, down
from 35.9 billion riyals for 1988, to be covered by public
borrowing, the agency said.
   Budget deficits have become a chronic problem in Saudi Arabia and
other oil-producing nations since crude prices started slipping in
the early 1980s because of a world glut.
   The new restrictive OPEC quota system took effect on Sunday in a
fresh attempt to remedy the situation.
   King Fahd stressed the importance of ``discipline and adherence''
to the quotas if prices are to improve.
   He warned that although Saudi Arabia is ``the first state to
abide by what OPEC agrees to... I don't think that anyone can blame
the kingdom if the contract is broken.''
   ``We do not want to see that to happen under any circumstances
and it is hoped that the losses suffered by the OPEC states give an
idea of what can result from a chaos, as happened a few years ago
and again a year ago,'' he added.

<HEAD>Texaco, Saudi Arabia Bgin Previously-Disclosed Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. said
Monday they had begun their previously-disclosed joint venture to
refine and market petroleum in the United States.
   The partnership, known as Star Enterprises, began operation on
Sunday, the first day of the year, the companies said in a statement.
   The partnership will refine, distribute and market petroleum
products under the Texaco trademark in 23 East and Gulf Coast states
and the District of Columbia. It also has the right to buy up to
600,000 barrels per day of Arabian crude oil at prevailing market
prices.
   The companies announced their plans for the venture on June 16
and signed a definitive agreement on Nov. 10.
   The agreement called for Texaco to receive $812 million for a 50
percent interest in its refining assets and marketing system in 23
states. The oil company based in White Plains, N.Y., said it expects
to enjoy an additional $1 billion in cash benefits and savings
resulting from the joint venture. It provides Saudi Arabia, the
world's biggest oil exporter, with a secure outlet for its products
while virtually guaranteeing Texaco a steady stream of crude at
market prices.

<HEAD>A Glimmer of Optimism From the Nation's Economists</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This is for Tuesday PMs. John Cunniff is on vacation. This also
moved in advance.</HEAD>

   Economists will tell you they make their
prognostications on the basis of ``the data,'' not gut feelings
about the economy.
   But some attending last week's conference here of the American
Economic Association were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate
of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand.
   Yes, there were scores of seminars during the conference on such
esoteric topics as ``Empirical Analysis of Price Determinants'' (and
we wonder why Johnny can't understand simple rules of economics).
   But there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter
about what economists might call ``exogenous'' _ or outside _
factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy. Principal among
them, politics _ George Bush's politics, to be more precise.
   Theories about how the president-elect will manage the economy
span the usual spectrum, as you might expect. Yet a predominantly
hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters, based on Bush's
transition performance.
   While some pundits have criticized his recently announced Cabinet
selections as bland, others are impressed by the mix of key
holdovers from the Reagan administration and new choices aimed at
mending fences with old opponents.
   So far, these optimists say, Bush has done several things right.
When the markets reacted negatively in the days following his
election, he moved swiftly to name his ``economic team,'' long
before settling on advisers for defense and other areas.
   Among his earliest choices was Nicholas Brady to remain as
treasury secretary, a pick that was applauded by those who admired
Brady's work as head of the Reagan committee investigating the
October 1987 stock market crash. Having James A. Baker III, a former
treasury secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the
dollar in world markets, as secretary of state also was seen as a
plus by some economic experts.
   Later additions that have drawn praise are Michael Boskin of
Stanford University to chief economic adviser, Clayton Yeutter to
agriculture secretary, Robert Mosbacher to commerce secretary and
Elizabeth Dole to head the Labor Department.
   The Dole move was viewed as especially significant since it not
only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor, but also
helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretary-designate's
husband, Senate minority leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.
   Other rough spots in the road that Bush quickly patched were in
Massachusetts. He initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger,
Michael Dukakis, and also offered to make ex-House Speaker Tip
O'Neill the next ambassador to Ireland. Neither of the high-profile
Democrats will end up serving the new administration, but Bush's
thoughtful gestures weren't lost on the loyal opposition.
   The optimists say Bush's style may help him make strides on
Capitol Hill, where Democratic cooperation will be crucial to
keeping his pledge of no new taxes.
   One economist at last week's conference, James Smith of the
University of North Carolina, said he predicts a great ``Rose Garden
compromise'' along about April that will put a two-year federal
budget in place, restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes.
   That certainly would provide the so-called ``soft landing'' the
economy needs to avert recession in 1989.
   Non-believers would say such fine-tuning went out a long time
ago, about the time Paul Volcker used sky-high interest rates to
squelch inflation. Still, the prospect of striking a delicate
balance in economic policy, between bust and boom, is intriguing _
particularly now, a few weeks before the inauguration when hope
springs eternal.
