<HEAD>Officials Say Libya Has Begun Limited Chemical Weapons Production</HEAD>

   Libya has secretly started producing limited
quantities of chemical weapons at a plant near Tripoli and has
conducted trial runs of its production equipment, U.S. officials
said Tuesday.
   Libya claims the facility manufactures pharmaceuticals, not
chemical weapons. Until now, U.S. officials said Libya was on the
verge of producing lethal gases but had not actually begun doing so.
   ``They have conducted test runs and have some limited
production,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A similar indication was given by State Department spokesman
Charles Redman, who said that if foreign companies withheld further
technical help from the Libyan chemical weapons facility, ``Libya
would find it difficult to begin full production, and would not be
able to sustain limited CW production.'' He declined to elaborate.
   ABC-TV, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, reported Tuesday
night that Libya has been moving material out of the plant in recent
days, perhaps to clear away evidence before an international
inspection.
   There was a spill of toxic chemicals at the plant during an
operational test run last summer, the Washington Post reported in
Wednesday's editions. The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying
that few details were known about the spill.
   The escalation of the U.S. campaign against Libya appears
designed to bolster the American position at an upcoming
international conference on chemical weapons scheduled to begin Jan.
7 in Paris. The U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, plans to press participants to withhold help from Libya for
the facility.
   Attention has been focused on the facility near Rabtha, about 50
miles southwest of Tripoli, after President Reagan told an
interviewer last month that a military attack on the plant had been
discussed and added: ``That's a decision that has not been made
yet.''
   A statement by the official JANA news agency on Tuesday accused
the United States of lying about the plant as an excuse to attack
Libya and kill its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   The movement of a U.S. carrier group toward the Mediterranean on
Tuesday in what the Pentagon said was a normal rotation of forces
prompted speculation in Italy of an impending strike.
   In Los Angeles, Bob Hall, an assistant White House press
secretary accompanying President Reagan on a California vacation,
declined comment on the reports other than to say, ``We have nothing
new on the subject.''
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, also declined to
discuss the reports but denied that the carrier movement was tied to
the situation in Libya.
   ``It's a standard deployment,'' Howard said.
   The United States said it has shown West Germany, Italy, Japan
and other allies convincing proof that the newly built facility is
producing chemical weapons.
   Italian, Japanese and West German companies were involved in the
construction of several plants in the complex housing the alleged
chemical weapons facility.
   Japan has told the United States its companies were helping build
a nearby metallurgical plant, but U.S. officials say that plant
makes canisters. ``Big, big metal canisters,'' said one official.
``What are they for, for pills?'' added the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He indicated the canisters were intended for
use in conjunction with the chemical weapons.
   But a spokesman for the West German government said authorities
there ``had no indication or evidence to verify the American
suspicions'' that German companies were involved in the construction
of a chemical weapons plant.
   Nonetheless, West German officials announced they were examining
the records of one chemical company doing business in the complex,
Imhausen-Chemie.
   ``We are confident that the West German government is taking the
information we have provided very seriously, and is investigating
fully,'' Redman said.
   The United States, along with at least 20 other countries, also
produce chemical weapons. But Redman said that in Libya's case ``it
does happen to be in the hands of a particularly irresponsible
government.'' U.S. officials are concerned Libya make give the
weapons to one of its surrogate terrorist groups.
   The administration of President-elect Bush is expected to revive
the moribund international talks in Geneva on a global ban of
chemical weapons use.

<HEAD>Supporters of Vietnam Forest Memorial Raise Funds to Save Project</HEAD>

   A Vietnam veteran whose plans for a
Vietnam War forest memorial were threatened by a bank foreclosure
sale was bailed out by a flurry of last-minute donations Tuesday,
his supporters said.
   ``This has been a long, long effort, but we did reach our goal,''
said Terry Thompson, a Vietnam veterans' activist from Dayton, Ohio,
who has led a nationwide fund-raising campaign to help save the
project.
   The Veterans National Living Memorial, which Geoffrey Steiner has
planted with more than 30,000 trees since 1980, was scheduled for a
foreclosure sale Wednesday at 10 a.m. The 100-acre tract near
Cushing was being taken by the Randall State Bank, which holds a
mortgage on it.
   Steiner, 39, who received national publicity for his efforts, was
slated to lose the property after failing to repay a loan from the
bank. He secured the loan $8,000 loan with the property in 1984 to
buy a car for his wife.
   The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings last fall to recover
$5,424 still outstanding, and scheduled the foreclosure sale.
   Thompson said Adolph Coors Co. and Minnesota Coors distributors
will pay about 80 percent of the nearly $6,896 needed for Steiner's
debts, legal fees and taxes. The Golden, Colo., brewer is a major
supporter of veterans affairs and one-third of its employees are
veterans, she said.
   The remainder of the money will come from smaller donors, she
said.
   Thompson says she's already talked with Brigid Fitzgerald, an
attorney was handling the foreclosure. She said she and Steiner will
meet Fitzgerald Wednesday with the money and Fitzgerald then will
cancel the sale.
   Fitzgerald said earlier that Steiner could stop the auction by
paying his outstanding debt, plus legal and advertising costs
incurred by the bank.
   Thompson read about the foreclosure proceedings in November in a
Dayton newspaper and launched a fund-raising campaign through her
hometown chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America.
   Since arriving in Little Falls on Monday night, she has been on
the phone with veterans' groups across the nation, seeking to raise
the funds needed to redeem the property.
   She said replies have been slow because chapters have had to
convene their executive boards to approve donations. But she said
she is confident the money can be raised.
   Thompson said they planned to plant a tree Wednesday for Jason
Rother, the Minnesota marine who died after being left stranded in a
California desert when his outfit pulled out during a training
mission.
   Newsweek magazine cited Steiner as one of 50 American heroes in
July 1987. He has said his goal is to plant a tree for each of the
approximately 58,000 U.S. soldiers killed in the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Castro Reportedly Planning to Free Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has pledged the
U.S. Catholic Conference he will free the remaining 225 prisoners
the Havana government has recognized as political, the Washington
Post said in its Wednesday editions.
   The group of prisoners include 44 the Cuban government has
previously described as too dangerous to release from jail, the
paper said, citing an unidentified senior Cuban official and western
diplomats.
   The Catholic conference has been pressing since 1985 for the
prisoners' release, the diplomats were quoted as saying.
   Of the 476 prisoners on the government's roster of those who have
faced political charges, about 225 remain in jail. Some 250 were
released during 1988.
   The political prisoners the government has acknowledged include
those named in a list of about 450 presented to Cuba in May 1988 by
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York City, according to the Post.
   During the summer, Castro said that everyone on that list would
be freed except 44, whom he described as too dangerous. The
government has not admitted that anyone else among its approximately
30,000 prisoners is being held on political charges.
   Castro says now he will free the 44 prisoners he originally
rejected, on the condition they be granted visas to travel
immediatly to the United States, the Post said a high-ranking
Communist Party official confirmed.
   Among those to be liberated are the last four of 64 plantados,
prisoners who refused on principle to participate in rehabilitation
programs or in some cases to wear jail uniforms, the Post said. Some
have been jailed since the first years after the 1959 revolution.
   However, the Post said, it remained unclear whether all of the
prisoners would be eligible to go to the United States. At least 24
released last year were denied visas because of criminal histories,
according to a list drawn up by Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban
Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation.

   Fidel Castro's revolution has eradicated much U.S.
influence from Cuba, but certain vestiges defy 30 years of Communist
rule.
   Thousands of pre-revolutionary era American cars, for example,
still negotiate the roads. Washington imposed a trade embargo in
1960.
   Cubans hang on to their rundown Fords and Chevies because later
model Russian-made Ladas are only available to a limited number of
Cubans. Castro says widespread use of private cars is a luxury Cuba
cannot afford.
   Thus, antiquated as they are, U.S.-made cars are still prized
possessions. The driver of a beat-up 1948 Chevrolet said he turned
down an offer of about $10,000 for his car. U.S. cars a decade older
routinely go for twice that price, equivalent to about five years
pay for the average worker.

   More than a million Cubans have fled the island since Castro came
to power in 1959 by overthrowing the rightist dictatorship of
Fulgencio Batista, but the traffic goes both ways. Many have
returned, and about 200 Americans have even settled on the island.
   A documentary about nine such Americans was shown on television
the other day. One was a rock singer, and several others were
involved in teaching music and dance.
   A Christian missionary here since before the revolution says Cuba
has given her the chance to carry out the Christian ethic of a life
in service to others. Service and self-sacrifice: the same messages
Castro has preached to his countrymen for 30 years.

   A visitor has trouble sorting out the conflicting claims Cubans
make about their revolution.
   According to government statistics, enrollment in colleges and
universities has increased nine-fold since the year before the
revolution.
   A Havana University law student identified only as Gladys was
quoted in an interview with Bohemia Magazine as saying, ``Young
people feel secure about their future. They don't live in
uncertainty as to whether they will be able to continue their
studies or whether they'll be able to find a job afterward.
Sometimes I wonder if it isn't all too easy.''
   There are, however, some clear signs of discontent. A rock group
caused a sensation recently with a song called, ``El Hombre Esta
Loco'' (The Man is Crazy).
   When the group sang the song in mid-November at a local theater,
a crowd of thousands broke into a rhythmic chant, repeating the
title over and over.
   Witnesses said the crowd had discovered a clever way of venting
anti-Castro feelings without leaving themselves open to charges of
anti-government activity.
   Government radio stations stopped playing the song, but it can
still be heard on Radio Marti, the U.S.-funded Voice of America
station beamed to Cuba.

   Castro shuns the notion of high salaries as an inducement for
hard work, but he has allowed an alternate form of material
incentive in an effort to remedy Cuba's terrible housing shortage.
   A Cuban who is unhappy with his existing home can take a leave of
absence from his job and volunteer for work on an apartment
construction crew. The worker is paid the same as on his normal job,
but hours usually are much longer _ up to 70 a week.
   The payoff is that the worker, after two years of arduous labor,
is entitled to move in to one of the apartments he worked on. He
uses about 10 per cent of his income for mortgage payments, and the
apartment is his after about 18 years.

   Many Cubans say the country's food-rationing system does not
provide enough to eat.
   An embittered 30-year-old who was once caught trying to escape to
the United States in a boat spent three years in prison. He said he
now fishes illegally for lobster to support his family.
   The goverment prohibits domestic consumption of lobster because
it is a big source of badly needed foreign exchange.

   Church-state relations are now better than they have been in
years.
   The government expelled 600 priests as counter-revolutionaries in
the early 1960s, but now is inviting some back. Thirty returned last
year.
   Several thousand Cubans attended a high-spirited Mass on New
Year's night that was said by a papal emissary, Cardinal Roger
Ethegaray of France.
   When he asked the congregation what he should tell Pope John Paul
II, a loud and spontaneous chant rose up: ``That he come, that he
come.''
   The pope's visit is expected in 1990.

   Joel Steinberg used to upset Michele Launders
when he stared at her in court. She said Steinberg, charged with
fatally beating the daughter Ms. Launders gave up for adoption,
frightened her.
   ``Now I just stare right back,'' said Ms. Launders, and these
days it is Steinberg and his lawyers who are occasionally unnerved.
   Steinberg is charged with second-degree murder, first-degree
manslaughter and endangerment of a child in the death of 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg. The girl, whom he illegally adopted in 1981, died of
a brain injury three days after she was removed unconscious from
Steinberg's Greenwich Village apartment Nov. 2, 1987.
   Lisa's death in an upscale home _ Steinberg was an attorney, now
disbarred, and his companion, Hedda Nussbaum, was a children's book
editor _ shocked New Yorkers and sparked investigations into how
child abuse cases can slip through the cracks of welfare agencies
and schools.
   Every day since Steinberg's trial began nine weeks ago, Ms.
Launders, 27, has occupied a front-row seat. The trial, on haitus
for the holidays, was being resumed today.
   Ms. Launders sits directly behind Steinberg, staring at his back
and watching his constant note-taking and nervous movements.
   The week before Christmas, she watched him hop out of the room on
his right foot because he had sprained his left ankle in a touch
football game at the Rikers Island jail. She laughed aloud.
   But more often Ms. Launders cries, which Steinberg's attorneys
fear may influence the jury. On Dec. 12, defense lawyer Ira London
sought to have her removed from the front row because she was crying
and holding hands with another woman. State Supreme Court Justice
Harold Rothwax refused.
   ``It's not easy to hide my feelings, but I've acted with
restraint,'' Ms. Launders said outside the courtroom later as she
crushed a cigarette butt. ``The one time I was overwhelmed I left
the courtroom.''
   Ms. Launders met Steinberg in a Nassau County diner in April
1981, through her physician, Michael Bergman.
   Unwed, pregnant and 19, Ms. Launders paid Steinberg $500 for what
he called filing fees to arrange for her unborn child's adoption
into a middle-class Catholic family. She says that when Lisa was
born May 14, 1981, she had no idea Steinberg planned to keep the
baby himself.
   Another baby Steinberg illegally adopted under similar
circumstances from an unwed teen-ager was a 17-month-old boy that
police found tethered to a chair and wallowing in excrement the day
police removed Lisa from the apartment.
   The boy, whom the Steinbergs named Mitchell, was returned to his
biological mother, Nicole Smigiel, of Massapequa Park, who took
custody and changed his name to Travis Christian. She has not
attended the trial, though her mother, Graceann, has sat at Miss
Launders' side from time to time during the trial.
   A middle-level manager for an insurance company, Ms. Launders
said in a recent interview that she has been unable to work since
Lisa's death. ``My mind isn't there yet,'' she said. ``I can't
concentrate.''
   She said she visits Lisa's grave often, sometimes with the girl's
father, whom she refuses to identify.
   Although it's wrenching to attend the trial every day, she said
she comes to court partly because of guilt and partly because she
wants to know what happened. But she also shows up because she wants
to see Steinberg convicted.
   ``It's killing me to do it but I'm not going to stop coming,''
Ms. Launders said. ``I'm going to come here every day until justice
is done. That will be the day Steinberg is convicted of murder and
sentenced to life in prison for what he did to Lisa.''
   Ms. Launders also said she now feels that Ms. Nussbaum, the
prosecution's chief witness, deserves more blame than she has
received. ``She should be on trial,'' said Ms. Launders, ``maybe not
for murder but for other charges.''
   Prosecutors dropped charges against Ms. Nussbaum before the
trial, saying she had been so physically and mentally incapacitated
by repeated beatings that she was not responsible for Lisa's death.

<HEAD>First Payments In Agent Orange Settlement Will Finally Go Out In
'89</HEAD>

   The victims of Agent Orange finally will get
their compensatory payments in 1989, more than a decade after
Vietnam veterans first sued the defoliant's makers and 16 years
after the U.S. pullout from Indochina. The first payments are
expected to go out in March or April.
   More than 64,000 applications have been mailed to veterans or
their families, and 2,000 to 3,000 additional veterans applied
before the Jan. 1 deadline for cash benefits that will average about
$5,700.
   The money for veteran's payments comes from a $170 million fund,
part of the settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought in 1978.
The total settlement was $180 million, but the fund has grown to
$240 million with interest.
   Payments will be made to individuals, to families and to social
service agencies that help Vietnam veterans, said Kenneth Feinberg,
the court-appointed special master who helped settle the suit.
   ``My feelings are ones of frustration and relief,'' said
Feinberg. ``Frustration because it took so long and relief because
those who are entitled to the money will finally get it.''
   The court has estimated that about 30,000 veterans and 18,000
survivor families will be eligible for the special benefits. Early
projections showed eligible veterans would receive an average total
of about $5,700; the most anyone can expect to receive is $12,800.
   ``Even though it may not be enough money, what it does is begin
the healing process,'' said Frank McCarthy, a veteran who was active
in the litigation. ``These children, these families who have lost
loved ones, these totally disabled veterans are the bottom line and
we have to help them now.''
   The federal lawsuit was brought in 1978 by veterans who claimed
exposure to the chemical defoliant _ sprayed over Southeast Asia
during the 1960s by the U.S. military in an attempt to deprive
Communist troops of crops and cover _ caused cancer, birth defects
in their children and other illnesses.
   The herbicide contains the highly toxic chemical dioxin.
   In 1984, hours before the trial was to start, the seven
manufacturers of the chemical agreed to pay $180 million but denied
liability for any injuries.
   The money has been tied up since in legal challenges. The U.S.
Supreme Court cleared the last obstacle in June, and soon after,
U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein announced plans for dispersal
of the money.
   Weinstein, who presided over the case and continues to oversee
the distribution, split the settlement fund.
   The first component sets aside $170 million for the Agent Orange
Veteran Payment Program, which will provide cash benefits to
veterans considered totally disabled under Social Security
guidelines and to the families of veterans whose deaths were linked
to Agent Orange.
   An additional $52 million was earmarked for the Agent Orange
Class Assistance Program, which will distribute grants to social
service agencies that serve Vietnam veterans and their families.
   Of the remaining money, $5 million was distributed to Australian
and New Zealand military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange
in Vietnam, and $13 million went for attorneys' fees and other
expenses.
   The Jan 1. deadline does not affect veterans who later become
aware of an Agent Orange-connected illness or succumb to such a
disease. Those claims can be filed until Dec. 31, 1994.
   Aetna Life Insurance Co. was appointed to process the claims and
set up a separate unit in Hartford, Conn., to administer the payment
program, according to Bill Cotter, a consultant for the company. He
said Aetna already has received back 10,000 filled-out applications
of the 64,000 sent out. A toll-free telephone number drew more than
60,000 calls, he said.
   ``We have had so many different types of calls _ the very angry
veterans who are quite abusive on the phones, the very courteous who
are pleased with the information and the veterans who have broken
down and sobbed,'' he said.
   The assistance program is headed by Dennis Rhoades, a Vietnam
veteran who was director of the American Legion's National Economic
Commission.
   Rhoades said he is reviewing about 140 proposals from agencies
seeking grants from the $52 million fund. He expects to authorize
the first grants in three to six months.

   The Duke and Dutchess of York did not set a trend
by naming their daughter Beatrice _ at least not among parents who
announced the birth of a child in the Times of London last year.
   Alice and Charlotte were the most popular girls' first names
chosen by those parents, says Helen Beard, the paper's social editor.
   ``The royal birth on Aug. 8 seems to have had no effect on the
commoners' choice, at least among Times-reading parents,'' she wrote
on Monday.
   Lists of most popular names have become a favorite feature in the
paper at this time each year.
   One list _ all-names _ comprises the names that most often appear
in cases where parents give their children two or more forenames.
The second list _ first-names _ comprises only the most popular
choice of first forename chosen by parents.
   Ms. Beard wrote: ``A total of 5,531 births were gazetted (in
1988), of whom 2,659 were girls and 2,872 were boys; (in 1987), out
of a total of 5,477, boys were in a majority of 134.
   ``James again led both the first-name and the all-names leagues
for boys. Elizabeth was still way ahead in the girls' all-names
list; but she failed even to obtain a place (among the top 10) in
the first-name league, which is now jointly led by Alice (for the
first time) and Charlotte.
   ``In the all-names leagues, Henry supplanted Christopher, while
Rose, Alexandra and Lucy ousted Emma, Jane and Emily. Katherine is
back among the first names (out goes Rebecca). The list of boys'
first names and their order are little changed, but Christopher,
Robert and Henry squeezed out George and Benjamin.''
   The Times has a daily circulation of about 450,000 in this
country of 56 million people.

   Orthodox Jewish leaders have
reluctantly given the go-ahead for construction of a shopping center
on a plot of land surrounded on three sides by a Jewish cemetery, a
rabbi said Monday.
   The Chicago Rabbinical Council decided that the five-acre parcel
owned by the Jewish Waldheim Cemetery and leased to a developer is
not consecrated land.
   ``The rabbis were very unhappy about it, and had we been asked
(in advance) we certainly would have said no,'' said Rabbi Paul S.
Greenman, a member and past president of the council. ``(But) since
it's already in progress, it can continue.''
   Some people who have relatives buried in the cemetery in this
suburb west of Chicago had objected to the construction of a
Sportmart Inc., sporting goods outlet and three other stores on the
land.
   The Des Plaines Cemetery Corp., which owns the land, said the
land was originally reserved for burials but many Jewish families
have moved from the area, reducing the demand for burial plots.
   Larry Hochberg, president of Sportmart Inc., said when the
controversy surfaced in early December that he had consulted a rabbi
before going ahead with construction plans. He said the rabbi, whom
he would not identify, had assured company officials that graves
would not be harmed by the project.
   Greenman said the council agreed that the project, scheduled for
completion next summer, will not disturb any graves. It also will be
separated from the cemetery by fencing and landscaping.
   Sportmart said in a statement Sunday that it will spend $200,000
on drainage pipes to prevent flooding of nearby gravesites and has
repaved 2,000 feet of cemetery roads.

for 107 hours and 15 minutes, the official Czechoslovak news agency
CTK reported.
   Two teams began the endeavour in the West Bohemian town of
Holysov on Dec. 13 and ended with the new world record on Dec. 17,
CTK said in the dispatch Monday.
   According to the news agency, the previous record of 106 hours 10
minutes was held by English players. The Czechs new record is to be
recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records, CTK said.

<HEAD>Peruvian Inflation in 1988 Hits 1,722 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says consumer prices rose 1,722
percent last year, the highest single-year mark in memory, and one
economic forecasting firm predicts they will rise at more than three
times that rate this year.
   Economists say the rampant inflation is tied to a steep recession
that weakened the economy following a growth rate of 8.5 percent in
1986 and of 6.7 percent in 1987. Economy Minister Carlos Rivas said
last week that early estimates indicate the economy shrank 8.4
percent in 1988.
   ``We are now paying the price for two years of growth,''
President Alan Garcia said recently.
   The crisis has been marked by shortages of basic foods, such as
milk, sugar and bread, and by increasing discontent among the 21
million Peruvians.
   Political analysts say the flagging economy together with a
relentless insurgency by leftist guerrillas are undermining Peru's
frail democracy.
   Rivas said a major cause of record inflation was government
deficit spending to finance consumer subsidies.
   The inflation figure of 158.3 percent set in 1985 had been the
highest since Peru began keeping such records in 1920.
   The National Statistics Institute, in its report Monday, said
consumer prices in December increased by 40.9 percent compared with
the month previous.
   Garcia, a center-left populist, took office in July 1985 and used
Peru's dollar reserves to subsidize imports needed for Peru's
economic recovery.
   Consumer prices surged early in 1988 after the reserves ran out
and the government maintained its program of subsidies through heavy
deficit spending, said economists, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The respected economics analysis firm Apoyo predicted inflation
this year will hit at least 6,000 percent.

<HEAD>Government Considering $81 Billion Cleanup of Nuclear Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is proposing an $81
billion, 20-year program to clean up and modernize the nation's
troubled nuclear weapons production complex.
   ``The cost of modernization and environmental restoration will
require a significant increase in funding for the next two
decades,'' said an Energy Department report for delivery to Congress.
   The $81 billion total includes $52 billion to modernize outdated
facilities, some of which are more than 30 years old, while $29
billion would go toward efforts to deal with radioactive and
chemical contamination at many sites throughout the weapons complex.
   The long-range plan would involve building new facilities in
South Carolina and Idaho as well as phasing out weapons production
activities in Washington state, Colorado and Ohio.
   The Energy Department has refused to release any portions of the
classified document, known as the ``2010 Report'' because it looks
ahead as far as the 2010 fiscal year.
   Gail Bradshaw, deputy chief spokesman for the department, said
this week the department could not release the report's unclassified
executive summary until it had received permission to do so from the
National Security Council.
   A copy of the summary was obtained by Morris News Service and
made available to The Associated Press.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said Dec. 22 the next
administration faces ``hard choices'' in dealing with the problems
of the nuclear weapons complex.
   He told a National Press Club audience that cannibalization of
some warheads to build or upgrade others is something ``we must look
at to keep our options open.'' But Herrington added, ``I do not
anticipate the need'' to resort to such methods.
   The possibility of cannibalizing warheads was raised after safety
and equipment problems closed the nation's three reactors for
producing tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Because
tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be
regularly replenished to keep warheads at peak explosive power.
   Herrington has said it will be spring or summer before any of the
three reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., can be
restarted.
   The 2010 Report raises questions about whether the Savannah River
reactors can be brought back to efficient production of tritium.
   It noted that ``all three reactors are shut down for safety
system improvements and are not expected to be fully operational
until late 1989. Despite these improvements and increasingly
extensive maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve
acceptable production efficiencies.''
   Other key findings of the report:
   _The nuclear weapons complex must be modernized so nuclear
deterrence can continue to be a vital element of U.S. security
policy.
   _Operations of the complex will require environmental, safety and
health remedial actions and a program to ensure that its operations
comply with applicable laws, standards and regulations.
   _Much of the nuclear weapons complex was constructed more than 30
years ago, and many facilities are approaching the end of their
useful lives.
   _Full funding for the modernization and environmental cleanup
effort will probably be difficult to achieve, in view of competition
with other programs.
   The report said that while the budget for fiscal 1990 will be
``generally consistent'' with the plan, accomplishing all
recommendations on schedule probably will require more resources
than are now expected to be available in subsequent years.
   _``Major environmental restoration'' will be required at the
Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, the Hanford Reservation near
Richland, Wash., and the Feed Materials Production Center in
Fernald, Ohio, when nuclear weapons activities there are either
relocated or terminated.
   As an interim measure, certain upgrade steps will be required at
the Rocky Flats Plant to maintain operations ``at an acceptable
level of risk'' while the relocated facilities are being constructed.
   _New production reactors are slated for the Savannah River Plant
and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. DOE has proposed
building a heavy water reactor at Savannah River and a gas-cooled
reactor at the Idaho facility.
   _Both the administration and Congress recognize the need for the
modernization and cleanup program, and ``expeditious
implementation'' of the proposed plan is recommended, the report
summary said.

<TEXT>
   1989 has begun for Soviets with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev warning them not to expect ``manna from heaven'' and a
multitude of signs _ from barren shop shelves to astrology _
heralding another hard year in the building of communism.
   Year IV of ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's driv to refashion Soviet
economy and society, will bring the first national multicandidate
elections in decades, part of the his campaign for
``democratization,'' and continued streamlining in the economy.
   But at the dawn of the year, as Moscow shivered in subzero cold,
such common items as detergent, bath soap, chickens, coffee,
toothpaste, sugar, yeast and candy were hard to find or completely
absent from state-run stores.
   On Sunday the Kremlin announced an export ban on goods ranging
from caviar to children's shoes, an apparent attempt to hoard
chronically scarce Soviet-made products for Soviet consumers.
   In his televised New Year's Eve message, Gorbachev told his 285
million countrymen that improvements in their lives would be gradual
at best in the coming months, and that there would be no miracles.
   ``It is wrong to think, comrades, that somebody will solve our
problems for us and that everything around us will change at the
wave of a magic wand, with the chime of the clock on New Year's
Eve,'' he said.
   ``We see now that it is essential to act with greater
resoluteness,'' said Gorbachev, Soviet leader since March 1985. ``We
are not awaiting and we are not promising manna from heaven, knowing
well that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy, and our road is
difficult.''
   For some, that message may have seemed distressingly like
Gorbachev's forecast at the beginning of 1988, when he said
``immense and hard work'' lay ahead in his drive for economic change.
   The multibillion-ruble cost of rebuilding areas of northwestern
Armenia shattered by the Dec. 7 earthquake also will cause shortages
in the economy, for example in building materials, Prime Minister
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has said.
   On Jan. 1, all 48,000 state-run enterprises in the nation were
put on a pay-their-own-way basis, meaning they are deprived of
government subsidies and forced to find ways to generate enough
revenue to meet costs and payroll.
   For Soviet managers accustomed to top-heavy centralized controls,
which severely limited their initiative but also freed them from
many decision-making responsibilities, ``self-accounting'' is a
mixed blessing.
   They are free to negotiate contracts and pursue the
once-forbidden goal of making a profit, but also in theory may face
bankruptcy if they fail.
   The nation's 130 million workers, too, can theoretically earn
more if they produce more, but run the risk of layoffs if their
factory trims its labor force to cut costs.
   According to Radio Moscow, enterprises that account for 60
percent of Soviet industrial output have been on ``self-accounting''
since January 1988. The jury is still out, however, on whether they
have gained much freedom.
   One Soviet economist, Nikolai Shmelov, has said government
bureaucrats still exercise effective control over some branches of
the economy by issuing them 80 percent and more of their orders they
must fill.
   In March, voters will be called to elect the members of a new
Council of People's Deputies that will choose their membership of
their national parliament and name a head of state with increased
powers.
   The sole candidate for the new presidential post is widely
expected to be the 57-year-old Gorbachev himself, posing further
questions about how democratic the Kremlin's ``democratization''
process can or will be.
   At lower levels, however, voters will be able to choose from more
than one candidate, in contrast to past practice, when electoral
nominees were selected according to social status, age and sex to
fill quotas fixed in Moscow.
   1989 will also bring uncertainty in international relations, as
the Kremlin seeks a working relationship with a new U.S. president
and decides whether to complete its now-frozen military withdrawal
from Afghanistan in time to meet a U.N.-brokered Feb. 15 deadline.
   Shortly before Gorbachev went on TV with his New Year's message,
the official news agency Tass transmitted new year's greetings to
English-language subscribers along with the image of a snake, a
reminder that according to Oriental astrology, 1989 is the Year of
the Snake.
   Some Soviets, in humor or in earnest, note that past such years
in the 12-year Oriental cycle have been the occasion of tragic or
cataclysmic happenings in their homeland, and predict an eventful
1989.
   In 1905, there was an abortive anti-czarist revolution. In 1917,
the Bolshevik Revolution brought the Communists to power. In 1929,
dictator Josef V. Stalin began the bloody campaign to snuff out
private farming.
   In 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union. And in 1953, Stalin
died, and was succeeded by Nikita S. Khrushchev.

<HEAD>Weather Is Biggest Question Mark For Farm Forecasters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weather continues to be the biggest
question mark for Agriculture Department economists trying to figure
out where U.S. farm production may be headed in 1989.
   For example, most analysts say the historical record shows little
chance that the devastating drought of 1988 _ which shriveled crop
production by 30 percent _ will repeat this year.
   But the drought's effects are still apparent in much of the land,
where subsoil moisture has yet to recover. And even long-shot odds
of the 1988 heat and drought repeating are causing USDA economists a
few nightmares.
   The uncertainties are important as the economists look at all
crop prospects, but they are particularly vital for feed grains and
how this year's output might affect livestock producers.
   Dave Hull of the department's Economic Research Service says in
the January-February issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine the
acreage of corn and other feed grains is expected to increase in
1989 because of a relaxation in the government's land-idling
requirements.
   The program changes, he said, could add 8 million to 10 million
acres to this year's corn plantings. In all, the corn area for
harvest next fall could be in the range of 67 million to 69 million
acres, compared with an estimated 56.7 million harvested in 1988.
   Last year's corn production was 4.67 billion bushels, down from
7.06 billion in 1987 and 8.25 billion in 1986. Yields averaged 82.3
bushels per harvested acre, compared with more than 119 bushels per
acre in each of the two previous years.
   ``Many estimates of 1989 corn yields range from 110 to 115
bushels per acre, although these forecasts may be weighting the 1988
disaster and potential weather problems a bit too heavily,'' Hull
said. ``If weather cooperates (in 1989), yields of 120 bushels per
acre are not out of the question, considering long-term trend
increases of more than 2 bushels per year.''
   If that happens, he said, farmers could harvest between 7.7
billion and 8.3 billion bushels of corn next fall.
   Hull said that if 1989 corn production is at the low side of
these projections farmers probably would see some decline in market
prices in the 1989-90 season. The agency currently projects corn
prices will average $2.40 to $2.80 per bushel in the 1988-89
marketing year that began last Sept. 1.
   But if this year's harvest is at the higher end of the projection
range, the price decline would be much sharper as U.S. stockpiles
once again start to rebuild. Hull said prices then could drop in
1989-90 to near the government's price support loan rate of $1.65
per bushel.
   ``If yields return to normal, 1989-90 production of barley, oats
and sorghum also is likely to rebound,'' he said. ``Stocks of barley
and oats would tend to build modestly if production returns to
normal, and prices probably will fall.''
   Soghum output ``is likely to rebound'' this year if yields are
normal, although total use may continue to exceed production, Hull
said. Prices will probably continue to be pegged to roughly 90
percent of corn prices.

   The Agriculture Department says another major
advance has been made in the long struggle against the boll weevil,
for generations a fabled devastator of cotton crops.
   Fred Planer of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service says the latest campaign ended Dec. 3 after 35
weeks of eradication efforts.
   The cooperative project, called the Southeast Boll Weevil
Eradication Program, involved a total of 482,000 acres in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Federal and state agencies,
along with the grower-supported Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation,
cooperated in the venture.
   Planer said USDA and state surveys showed that 99 percent of the
fields in the program sustained no weevil damage in 1988.
   Program activities include trapping surveys using traps baited
with sex scents, or pherromones, to determine weevil numbers and
distribution, and field treatments with malathion, an insecticide
used commonly in mosquito control programs.
   ``The real key to the success of this progrm is uniform
participation of all cotton producers so that weevils can't run away
from one farm and go to another,'' Planer said. ``With uniform
participation, there's no place for the weevils to hide.''
   The Southeast program began in September 1987, following the
successful eradication of the boll weevil through a similar program
in areas of Virginia and the Carolinas, he said.

<HEAD>New Laws Target Aggressive Motorists, Rising Accident Rates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Handcuffed by public refusal to accept
a speed limit on the autobahns, West German lawmakers have issued a
compromise order to curb rising accident rates. It is now the law
that drivers must be polite.
   Aggression in the form of dangerously high speeds and daredevil
maneuvers accounted for many of the 400,000 injury-causing accidents
in West Germany in 1988, according to police and automobile club
statistics.
   The revised rules that took effect Sunday include a prohibition
against blinking headlights to pressure slower drivers to move to
the right, as well as a finder's-keeper's policy on parking spaces,
which are at a premium in most cities.
   A nation renowned for its fast cars and frustrated drivers, West
Germany has more traffic volume than any nation in Europe. It also
suffers the continent's highest injury-accident rate.
   Fatal accidents _ about 8,000 last year _ have been considerably
reduced in the past 10 years. But the number of collisions rose by
more than 10 percent in 1988 and moving violations were up by 28
percent over 1987.
   Recent mild winters, coupled with cheaper gas prices due to a
strong West German mark, have intensified the problem of too many
cars traveling too fast on too few roads.
   ``The problem is that drivers are becoming increasingly
aggressive on the highways, borrowing the idea from Americans that
time is money,'' said Andreas Zimmermann, regional traffic division
chief for ADAC, West Germany's largest automobile club.
   The new ``Intelligent Use of the Streets'' legislation aims to
diffuse some of the aggression by punishing drivers for infractions
that until now have been considered impolite but not illegal.
   The more than 100 minor revisions to the 1971 driving code are
seen as a token of consolation for the outnumbered advocates of
speed limits and environmental protection.
   Public opinion polls have shown the vast majority of West German
drivers favor a retention of the status quo _ no speed limits at
all. They have rallied under the cry of ``Free Ways for Free Folks''
and through the powerful car industry and auto club lobbies fought
off all attempts to cool their engines.
   More than 1 million of the 28 million registered automobiles are
capable of sustained speeds exceeding 125 mph, according to the
ADAC, which is the world's second-largest auto club after the AAA in
the United States.
   Some politicians of the opposition Social Democrat party and the
environmentalist Greens annually have put forward measures to
establish a limit of 60 mph, but have been defeated by the dominant
Christian Democrats and members of their own parties concerned about
voter reaction.
   Short of forcing drivers to slow down, the new laws require them
to cease the widespread practice of using headlights and blinkers to
pressure slower cars into moving out of their way.
   Tailgating also has been outlawed, as well as passing too closely
_ a favorite punishment meted out by drivers miffed at having to
change lanes to get by a slower car.
   Truck drivers hauling dangerous cargo must pull into the nearest
parking turnout when visibility drops to less than 165 feet because
of fog, snow or rain.
   Vehicles long have been prohibited from passing on the right, but
the code revision makes the offense one that can damage a driver's
record and eventually lead to license revocation.
   Many drivers argue that despite the law, German practice on a
three-lane autobahn dictates that slower cars use the right lane,
fast cars the left and the middle lane is to remain open for passing
from both sides.
   Some of the more controversial and less-enforceable rules govern
parking, including a requirement that the first car in a line of
autos circling for a free space has claim to the next open spot _
even if the driver has already passed it by.
   Drivers are also required to activate their warning blinkers as
soon as they see a traffic backup on an autobahn, with the aim of
preventing the kind of multiple smashups that often occur in the fog
or when backups are obscured by a rise or turn in the road.
   Dieter Schulte, parliamentary secretary for the federal Transport
Ministry and a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat
Party, said more than $230 million will be invested in improving
signs and roads as part of the new legal changes.
   ``Not only will these changes reduce the hazards from backups and
passing, but they will also save energy and reduce environmental
problems like noise and exhaust,'' Schulte said.
   Others argue, however, that drivers will begin to depend on the
new signs to warn them of road-blocking hazards ahead and drive even
faster when no warnings are visible.
   ``With the best intentions, the changes may have negative
consequences for safety and the environment,'' Zimmerman conceded.
   Some of the new rules, irreverently referred to as ``the Polite
Driving Act,'' are virtually unenforceable, such as requiring
drivers to alert one another about hazards they themselves may not
react to in time.
   But the regulations are expected to deter some of the aggressive
practices because violations will count against a driver's record.
   West German drivers are not required to renew their licenses once
they have passed initial tests and a two-year probation period,
unless they've accumulated a considerable series of citations in a
short period.
   The point system differentiates between character offenses and
accidents, ascribing a higher penalty for drunken driving than for
killing a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
   Points also are recorded for offenses such as misuse of blinkers
or following too closely, previously punishable only by fines.
   The success of the new system will depend heavily on the driving
public, which to date has shown little interest or understanding of
the revisions.
   Drivers questioned at gas stations over the New Year's weekend
expressed amusement over the effort to get them to mind their
manners.
   ``Sure I'll be polite,'' promised one BMW driver who gave his
name only as Rudolf. ``As long as the trucks and the timid stay out
of the left lane.''

   Daniel Ortega paused for a moment to
ponder his major achievement as president, then responded
confidently: ``Resisting the war policies of the Reagan
administration aimed at destroying the revolution.''
   ``The cost has been social and economic, in losses of lives and
raw materials,'' Ortega said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``But the reality is that the revolution is here.''
   Ortega, 43, heads the Sandinista government brought to power in
1979 by a revolution that ended four decades of dictatorial rule by
the Somoza dynasty.
   President Reagan, charging the new government with fomenting
revolution in the region, began financing Contra rebels in 1981 to
oust the Sandinistas and end what he said was a beachhead for
communism.
   With Reagan leaving office soon and the Contras reduced to what
Ortega calls ``delinquent bands,'' Ortega hopes to restore the
dreams of a socialist society based on equality.
   ``I have the hope that President Bush will work on a constructive
line,'' Ortega said. He declined to elaborate on a proposal his
government is preparing to deliver to Bush.
   Ortega described the Sandinista government as socialist, with its
ideal goal a classic communism in which there is an equal
distribution of wealth.
   ``This is a socialist revolution that is in a stage where a mixed
economy and political pluralism are factors of the socialism that we
have been constructing in Nicaragua,'' he said.
   ``Yes, socialism is a step toward communism, but to speak of
communism, I think that would be utopian right now,'' Ortega said.
``To speak of socialism in which there is social and economic
development and to have a society in which the distribution of
wealth would be really equal and rational, this is a proposal, it is
an objective.''
   Private enterprise exists in Nicaragua and the state does not
hold a majority of the land.
   The government's ideals have crumbled under the weight of an
economy that has worsened yearly. Inflation, Ortega said, stands at
an inconceivable 21,000 percent. Many Nicaraguans are suffering from
hunger for the first time. Meager wages fail to provide the basics,
and tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled the country.
   But he said the fact that the Sandinistas will celebrate their
10th anniversary in power in July means ``there's no doubt the
(revolutionary) process is irreversible.''
   Ortega himself has changed markedly in the past decade. His
railings against the United States and President Reagan have taken
on a softer, more rational tone and he peppers them with facts and
figures.
   In the interview, conducted Saturday, he did not employ the harsh
rhetoric he has used in the past. He simply said the 29,000 dead in
Nicaragua would be comparable in the United States to losing the
entire population of Minnesota.
   Ortega rose to leader of the nine-member Sandinista directorate
following the 1984 elections in which he won the presidency. He
consolidated his control a year later when he became the head of the
party's executive commission.
   Sandinista watchers frequently point to the differences between
Ortega, seen as a pragmatist, and the hardline Tomas Borge, one of
the founders of the party, a directorate member and the current
interior minister. Ortega seems to have won out.
   Ortega is a populist, supported at times even when the Sandinista
party suffers criticism. The press and a majority of citizens call
him by his first name. He frequently is seen in casual clothes _ a
sport shirt and cotton jacket with jeans _ rather than his military
uniform. He drives himself around town in a jeep, along with heavily
armed security agents in identical jeeps.
   Ortega has altered his image as a tough guerrilla fighter jailed
as a teen-ager to that of supporter of the arts, poet and an opera
buff.
   The president speaks quietly and is seen as a good listener. He
frequently travels to the countryside to meet with peasants.
   During a town hall-type meeting a few months ago, Ortega was
applauded when he called to task a factory manager after an employee
complained. He was patted on the back when he handed out Christmas
presents to deprived youths in the capital.
   Political opposition figures often call Ortega a dictator.
Supporters refer to him as ``El Comandante.''
   Ortega has said he hopes to repair relations with the United
States, but vows that his nation's internal politics aren't up for
negotiation.
   Recently, he fondly recalled meeting Bush in Brazil for the 1985
presidential inauguration. The two men shook hands and the guests
packed into the Brazilian congress cheered.
   ``It's a start,'' Ortega said.

   A new game-show video for low-income mothers
will try to make viewers winners by teaching them how to properly
care for their newborns, researchers say.
   The 15-minute video, entitled ``The Baby Game,'' will use a
game-show format to convey information about infant nutrition and
care. It's aimed at people who are turned off by informational
presentations.
   ``We're using the strategy that, if it can be entertaining, it
will be watched; therefore the information will get across,'' said
Dennis Darmek, manager of television services at Marquette
University.
   The university is creating the video at the request of the Hunger
Task Force of Milwaukee's Infant Nutrition Project.
   The video features a host and three contestants affiliated with a
comedy troupe, Darmek said. The mock game show depicts three new
mothers in a hospital being told they were selected as contestants
and asked questions on child care.
   The video comes complete with commercials, which are public
service announcements on infant care, he said. It will be shown to
new mothers at Milwaukee-area hospitals just before they are
released.
   ``This is a last-ditch effort to get across some important
information,'' said Vickie Strattner, a registered nurse and task
force volunteer.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
received his-and-hers silver belt buckles from an admirer as they
prepared to leave this desert resort and wind up their final
presidential vacation.
   Gerry Fitch, 72, of Cherokee Village, Ark., on Monday handed the
president an ornately carved box with the gifts as the Reagans
prepared to board Air Force One at Palm Springs International
Airport.
   ``When I gave it to him, his eyes sprang open,'' Fitch said. ``He
told me, `Thank you very much and have a very happy new year.''
   The buckles were crafted by Fitch and designed by his wife,
Twyla, 70, for a presidential visit in 1986 to celebrate Arkansas's
150th anniversary, but that trip was canceled.
   Reagan's buckle bore a map of the United States, marked with
places where Reagan spent his life in California, including a
horseshoe to mark the president's Rancho del Cielo home in the Santa
Ynez Mountains and a circle to define Hollywood.
   Mrs. Reagan's buckle, imbedded with coral, turquoise and a gold
heart, simply read: ``No. 1 Lady.''
   The Reagans left Palm Springs, where they stayed at the Rancho
Mirage home of millionaire publisher Walter Annenberg, and traveled
to Los Angeles where they will spend time at their Bel-Air home.

   ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak said he
decided against having a female sidekick on his late-night talk show
because it might upset viewers accustomed to seeing him with
letter-turner Vanna White.
   Explaining why he chose sidekick Dan Miller rather than a woman,
Sajak said some viewers might feel ``as though Vanna and I had
gotten a divorce or something.''
   CBS spent more than $4 million to build a new sound stage and
other facilities for Sajak's 90-minute show, which debuts Monday.
The show will rely on a traditional format spiced by live interviews.
   Hip comic Arsenio Hall, whose hour-long syndicated talk show
debuts tonight, says he will try to reach a new audience.
   ``I think people place too much emphasis on the competition; I'm
running my own race,'' he said. ``It's a personal best, it's me
against me.''
   Hall said he will try to create an air of spontaneity and plans
to avoid relying on guests with youth appeal.
   ``I'd love to talk to Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``There isn't
anyone who I would consider too old and square.''

   Millionaire Democrat and U.S. Senator-elect
Herbert H. Kohl says he will continue to run the Milwaukee Bucks
basketball team but will give two trustees control of his other
assets.
   Kohl, who was being sworn in today, said Monday he wanted to
insure that the National Basketball Association team he purchased in
1985 would not be sold and moved from Milwaukee.
   Kohl said his brother, Sidney Kohl, of Palm Beach, Fla., and
Ralph Loewenberg, a New York City investment adviser, would take
control of his assets.
   ``I have taken this step for two reasons: to eliminate the
potential of any conflict of interest and to assure the people of
Wisconsin I will be a full-time senator,'' he said.
   Kohl, 53, defeated Republican Susan Engeleiter for the seat
vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. William Proxmire.
   Kohl said he will continue to release his state and federal
income tax returns each year, but he has refused repeatedly to
release the value of his assets. He said in October his net income
in 1987 was $4.2 million.

   Mayor Thomas G. Dunn, believed to be the
longest-serving mayor of a major American city, pledged his
unwavering service as he was sworn in for his seventh and possibly
last four-year term.
   ``I dedicate every waking moment to this city. I've made it more
than a full-time job,'' the 67-year-old Democrat said Monday after
being escorted into the City Council chambers by a kilt-clad bagpipe
player and wearing shamrock-covered suspenders.
   ``He's a real person,'' said John Surmay, who in 24 years in
Elizabeth has seen only one mayor. ``In this plastic world we live
in, he's not plastic, phony or shallow, and he's not a wimp. He's
made a lot of decisions and is ready to back up every one of them.''

<HEAD>Director Peter Bogdanovich Marries Sister Of Late Dorothy Stratten</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film director Peter Bogdanovich has married the
younger sister of murdered Playboy magazine model Dorothy Stratten,
a lawyer representing Bogdanovich said Monday.
   Stratten, a 1980 Playmate of the Year who acted in a film
directed by Bogdanovich, was shot and killed by her husband, Paul
Snider, in August 1980 in California. The killing reportedly
occurred after Snider learned his wife was having an affair with
Bogdanovich.
   Bogdanovich, 49, married Louise Hoogstratten, 20, also known as
L.B. Stratten, last Friday morning at a hotel in the Vancouver,
British Columbia, area, said Joel R. Junker, a Seattle attorney who
described himself as the director's immigration lawyer.
   The couple had planned a church wedding in Los Angeles later this
spring, but married earlier in Canada on their advice of their
lawyers, Junker said.
   ``That's so Mrs. Bogdanovich, who is a Canadian citizen, would be
able to be with her husband in Los Angeles,'' Junker said in a
telephone interview from his Seattle home.
   Bogdanovich, who directed ``The Last Picture Show,'' ``Paper
Moon'' and ``Mask,'' has filed a petition to obtain permanent
residence status for his wife in the United States, Junker said. Ms.
Hoogstratten had been in the United States on a visitor's visa, the
lawyer said.
   He declined to provide any other details on the couple or the
ceremony and said no statement was available from either Bogdanovich
or his bride.
   Nelly Hoogstratten, Louise's mother, said on Vancouver television
that she was not informed about the wedding.
   ``I've cried before, and I cry now because I've lost another
daughter,'' she said when interviewed on the doorstep of her home.
   Bogdanovich, in a book titled ``The Killing of the Unicorn:
Dorothy Stratten, 1960-1980,'' criticized Hugh Hefner's Playboy
empire for its alleged role in events he said ended in Miss
Stratten's death.
   In the book, Bogdanovich wrote of how he was captivated by the
innocent charm of Ms. Stratten, whom he directed in her best-known
film, ``They All Laughed,'' a comedy with John Ritter, Audrey
Hepburn and Ben Gazzara.
   In the mid-1980s, stories surfaced of a relationship between
Bogdanovich and Ms. Stratten's younger sister.
   Louise Stratten filed a slander lawsuit against Hefner and Burl
Eldridge, who was married to her mother from May 1980 to January
1981.
   The suit contended Hefner and Eldridge falsely told reporters
Bogdanovich had seduced Louise Stratten when she was 13 and also had
sexual relations with her mother after the older sister was killed.
   The lawsuit also said Hefner and Eldridge claimed Bogdanovich had
paid for Louise Stratten to have plastic surgery to make her look
more like her late sister.
   Hefner also said Bogdanovich's published criticism contributed to
a stroke he suffered.
   Louise Stratten dropped the lawsuit in August 1985 and
Bogdanovich said at the time he hoped that resolution would end his
feud with Hefner. Both men publicly made peace.

   Leung Wan Chou shops at convenience stores
and celebrates Thanksgiving since immigrating to this country, but
when it comes to soap operas she heads to Chinatown to rent a
Cantonese version of ``Dallas.''
   The elderly housewife is one of thousands of Asian-Americans
whose years in America have failed to dampen their love for Hong
Kong-style dramas.
   ``I have to watch several tapes (of Cantonese soaps) every night.
Otherwise I can't sleep,'' said Leung, who has moved to a
middle-class neighborhhood outside of Chinatown since immigrating 20
years ago from Hong Kong.
   Chinatown waiter Hui Ming Kee likes to spend the days of his life
watching videotapes of such popular soaps as ``Man in a Net'' and
``Family Feud'' (no relation to the American television program),
both based loosely on ``Dallas.''
   In one sitting at home, he said he watched seven three-hour tapes
without interruption. Hui said the tapes are his major form of
entertainment.
   Asian-Americans lease 900 tapes in an average week at one
Chinatown rental shop, the manager said.
   ``They (customers) nearly emptied out our inventory of the more
popular tapes just before Thanksgiving weekend,'' said Lily Yee,
supervisor of the Hong Kong TV Video.
   The locations are strictly Hong Kong in most tapes and the soaps
often reflect such Confucian ideals as loyalty to the family,
respect for one's parents and dedication to work.

   Ushers at Carnegie Hall move from the back of the
auditorium to center stage tonight when they present a free art
exhibition and concert of Brahms, Chopin, Puccini and Bartok.
   ``It's a great opportunity to show the other ushers _ and
everyone _ just what we can do,'' said five-year usher Brian
Matthews, who organized the event at Carnegie's Weill Recital Hall.
   Matthews, a bass who graduated from the Juilliard School, plans
to sing a Schubert song.
   Nearly half the 63 ushers at Carnegie Hall have musical or
artistic training. Many are pursuing careers in the arts, and find
it convenient to work as ushers at night.
   ``It's ideal for musicians, since it gives us the whole day to
practice,'' said Leslie Warren, one of 17 ushers planning to take
part in tonight's event. Ms. Warren, a graduate of the Eastman
School of Music, is a harpist.
   ``Artists like the job because you can work at night and still
have the light during the day,'' said Jenne Currie, a painter whose
work will be on display. She has studied at Carnegie Hall's
neighbor, the Art Students League of New York.
   ``This concert gives ushers a chance to say they've performed at
Carnegie Hall,'' said Matthews.

   The reporters at the Roosevelt Bulletin
know their readers. Almost all of them.
   There are only 911 people in this tiny central New Jersey town
founded in 1936 as an experiment in socialism and named after FDR.
   ``But there are a lot of people expecting babies,'' said Honey
Socholitzky.
   At 78, Mrs. Socholitzky is a copy editor at the monthly newspaper
run by residents who volunteer to cover their school board, their
planning board and their neighbors.
   The staff is serious about its work. Since the Bulletin's birth
11 years ago, it has grown from a mimeographed newsletter to a sharp
tabloid of 24 or so pages, neatly packaged with modern graphics.
   Its content also has evolved.
   ``We're a small town with some fairly large problems,'' said
editor Mark Zuckerman. ``We have some big decisions that have to be
made.''
   Reporters still write stories about matters such as the geese
camping out at the town's only gas station. But they also pay close
attention to issues facing the little town.
   Decisions must be made on how to pay for a revised sewer plan and
school repairs. The Bulletin reports on the possibilities and the
residents take to the opinion columns.
   ``We've become a little more hard-newsy,'' Mrs. Socholitzky said
recently. ``There are a lot of problems in town in that some people
want to see it grow and some don't.''
   There are about 600 acres of city-owned farmland in the path of
developers, and residents are debating whether to sell to help pay
for some of the needed improvements.
   ``Some people think if we let in the developers we can double the
population and bring in some money,'' Zuckerman said. ``Some people
don't think that's such a great idea.''
   That keeps Bob Clark busy on his planning board beat.
   ``I've always just had a desire to stay involved in the affairs
of the community, '' he said. ``It gets to be a bit of a drain
because you have to keep up with it, going to meetings and so on,
but it's worth it.''
   Clark said his ``real'' job, deputy director of the state
division of investigation, precludes him from political involvement,
but the Bulletin provides an outlet.
   ``Occasionally someone will question the objectivity of a hard
news story, but I chalk that up to them not getting their favorite
quote printed,'' he said.
   The newspaper is as unusual as the town's history. Roosevelt,
named after the president whose New Deal financed its founding, was
established by immigrant Jews who moved here from New York.
   Garment workers would make coats in the winter for sale in a
cooperative factory and grow their own food in the summer. The
experiment in socialism failed after three years but the town
remained.
   Like most of the newspaper staffers, Clark and Mrs. Socholitzky
don't have journalism backgrounds.
   Reporters write their stories and then have them edited in an
office owned by Zuckerman's company. Zuckerman takes care of the
graphics on a computer.
   For Mrs. Socholitzky, editing is of paramount importance.
   ``I took a two-year hiatus once, but I had to come back because I
wasn't satisfied with the quality of the editing,'' she said. ``I'm
a purist grammatically.''
   And she's picky.
   Mrs. Socholitzky once discovered a grammatical error on a list of
ingredients of a baby food company's product.
   ``I wrote to them and said I didn't want to raise a baby on a
baby food with a split infinitive in it,'' she said. ``They wrote
back and said they had already printed thousands of labels, but
would correct their error on the next printing. And they did.''

   Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters
says U.N. peacemaking successes last year _ ending wars in
Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war and Angola _ are unprecedented in the
annals of the world body.
   These successes and warming U.S.-Soviet relations have made the
United Nations ``a better place for the United States to do
business,'' Walters said in a farewell interview.
   The former deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency said
the U.S. view of the world body, once hostile and disdainful, has
changed to appreciation. ``If properly handled,'' Walters said,
``the U.N. can be advantageous in promoting our goals of peace,
prosperity and freedom.''
   ``If it didn't exist, it would have to be invented.''
   He spoke as the General Assembly concluded its 43rd session, a
dazzling year of achievements.
   It was the year of the Nobel Peace Prize for U.N. peacekeeping
operations, the farewell speech by President Reagan, the U.N. debut
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a move to Geneva to
hear PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Walters, 71, who has served as U.S. permanent representative here
since 1985, described what he called an ``extraordinarily
successful'' year.
   ``We got agreements to end the Afghan War, the Persian Gulf War
(between Iran and Iraq) and the war in Angola. There is nothing like
it in the annals of the United Nations,'' said Walters, who is being
succeeded by Thomas Pickering, ambassador to Israel.
   ``And, God willing,'' Walters said, ``We will shut down the
Western Sahara and Cambodia wars very soon.''
   Walters refused to disclose his next posting, but diplomats
speculated he might be assigned to a European capital.
   Last month, Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed agreements
providing for Namibian independence from South Africa and the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. A U.N. independence plan for
Namibia will be implemented next year and U.N. peacekeepers and
observers deployed.
   Walters also said he believed the United States will pay about
$400 million in arrears. He has opposed U.S. withholding of U.N.
dues to protest what Washington considers U.N. bias and inefficiency
and has urged restoration of full funding.
   The United Nations is far more effective today than in the past,
and anti-U.S. name-calling, which flooded this forum several years
ago, is virtually nonexistent.
   ``We no longer get the `blood-sucking vampires of Wall Street
draining the last drop from the toiling masses of the Third World.'
That stuff is gone,'' Walters said.
   He attributed the change almost entirely to the new international
environment and improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``In the old days, if we said it was `black,' the Soviets said it
was `white,''' he said. ``That's no longer there and the possibility
of playing off East against West has largely disappeared.''
   Walters said he gave ``a great deal of the credit to Mr.
Gorbachev, who had the courage to make very difficult decisions. He
clearly was the one who decided to change the style and content of
foreign policy.''
   He added, however, that ``a lot of obstacles were created by the
Soviet Union through its contrariness and desire to inflict its
ideology on others.''
   In the last session, Walters said, one of the most important
achievements for the United States was the adoption of a budget that
prohibits extravagant expenditure and lowers spending.
   Through U.S. appeals to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, he
said, Cuban leader Fidel Castro released 700 prisoners ``he claimed
he didn't have.''
   Walters defended the evaluation of voting records to determine
how often nations side with the United States.
   ``By and large, the nonaligned are aligned against us,'' he said,
referring to the 102-nation Nonaligned Movement. ``Today, the
nonaligned give me far more trouble than the Soviet Union and
China.''
   He said a great deal of the nonaligned vote against the United
States is ``for the sheer pleasure of it.''
   Walters refused to cite nations, saying not all nonaligned
nations were anti-American.
   On U.S.-Iranian relations, Walters said he saw no immediate
prospect of better ties. ``They are at a dead end right now, because
if they expect to get anything from us, they have to release those
hostages first.''
   He said his greatest satisfaction at the United Nations was
Iran's acceptance in July of Security Council Resolution 598, which
led to the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq War and direct peace
talks with Iraq.

<HEAD>Estimate Of One Million Rose Parade Watchers Called a Myth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have said for years that more than
1 million people line up along the 5{-mile route the Tournament of
Roses Parade takes annually, but a more scientific count cuts the
number in half.
   The Pasadena Star-News used a formula devised by Al Hibbs, a
retired physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to estimate
the number of people attending Monday's gala procession of
flower-covered floats.
   It was the first time in the 100-year-old extravaganza that
anyone estimated the crowd size by counting heads, police and
Tournament of Roses officials said. Neither group disputed its
accuracy.
   ``The tournament in the past has never really had a scientific
way of doing it,'' spokesman Ken Veronda said. ``If the Star-News
can come up with a better way, more power to them.''
   Hibbs' formula was based on the assumption that at least 18
inches separate spectators and that at least 10 rows of spectators
line the sidewalk. Multiplying the estimated number of one row by 10
equaled 387,200. Adding the 125,000 holding tickets to grandstand
seats put the total at 512,200.
   That figure is probably high because people don't usually stand
shoulder to shoulder, Hibbs said.
   ``I packed 'em in like sardines,'' Hibbs said. ``I'm giving every
benefit of the doubt to the upper number.''
   The crowd estimate of 1 million appears to have started in a
newspaper account of the 1928 parade that said, ``Warren R. Flynn, a
Santa Fe agent who is an expert at measuring a large assemblage,
placed the crowd at 968,000.''
   Skepticism about the parade's 1 million-plus attendance figures
arose when organizers of the Doo Dah Parade, an offbeat counterpart
to the Rose Parade, used head counts to discount official crowd
estimates.
   In 1987, police said 150,000 people attended the parade down the
same street the Rose Parade follows, but an estimate made by
counting heads in photographs revealed a total of 50,000, said Doo
Dah Parade organizer Peter Apanel.

   Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping captured
first place in a Beijing bridge tournament for ``old comrades'' last
week, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported today.
   Deng, honorary chairman of the China Bridge Assocation, topped a

   It said the 84-year-old leader was the oldest player.
   Deng's passion for bridge is well known, and China-watching
publications in Hong Kong have even speculated on the political
significance of who he chooses as his card partners.
   Charges that he once took over a train to transport bridge
partners was one of the reasons cited when he was purged during the

   The White House says representatives of the
United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization have
discussed possible PLO assistance in investigating the airliner
bombing over Scotland that took 270 lives.
   President Reagan says he would be happy to receive any
information that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat might offer to help
solve the mystery of Pan American Flight 103, which crash Dec. 21 en
route from London to New York.
   Arafat has condemned the bombing.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the United States stopped short of formally
requesting PLO assistance.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Monday
that Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, met on
Saturday at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis with Hakam Balaoui, the PLO
representative in Tunis.
   Popadiuk said the meeting was requested by Balaoui to introduce
himself to Pelletreau. He said it was not a continuation of the
contacts, which the United States calls a dialogue, which began with
a meeting Dec. 16 between Pelletreau and three members of the PLO
executive committee.
   ``The discussion centered on Middle East issues,'' Popadiuk said.
``The ambassador took the opportunity to mention that the United
States would welcome any information the PLO is able to develop
concerning the Pan Am tragedy.''
   ``This is in line with what we have already publicly stated, and
is true for the PLO as well as anyone else who may have information
on the bombing,'' he said.
   The administration official who spoke anonymously said, ``This
was not a request for assistance from the PLO.''
   The official said Balaoui took note of Pelletreau's comments and
told the ambassador he would relay them to Arafat.
   Earlier Monday, Reagan was asked about reports that Arafat had
offered his assistance in the investigation.
   ``We've not heard from him,'' the president. ``We will be happy
to hear from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell
us.''
   The exchange took place as Reagan stepped off Air Force One at
Los Angeles International Airport after spending New Year's weekend
in the Palm Springs area.
   He and his wife, Nancy, were then driven to the brick,
ranch-style home in the expensive Bel Air section of Los Angeles
where they will live after they leave the White House Jan. 20.
   They are expected to remain behind the high walls of the estate
until they return to Washington Thursday, except for an appearance
at a $1 million fund-raising event Wednesday night for the Nancy
Reagan Center for teen-age drug addicts, to be opened in a renovated
hospital in nearby Pomona.

<HEAD>Scientists, Consumers Unhappy with Soviet Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was hard to tell the Soviets from the Americans
without a scorecard this week as squabbling grew louder over
spending huge amounts on a Soviet space shuttle project while other
needs go begging.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday, without giving
details of the debate, that some scientists involved in the project
joined consumers upset by food and clothing shortages in questioning
the value of the program.
   In the years before scientists here revealed their own shuttle
program, they assailed the U.S. project as too costly and of
questionable use. Many Soviet scientists said they could gain the
same goals with more standard, single-use rockets.
   Pravda said in a full-page article devoted to the development and
testing of the Soviet shuttle that a ``major rethinking and a fierce
clash of ideas, concepts and proposals are under way'' even within
the space shuttle program.
   The Soviets successfully launched the space shuttle Buran
(Snowstorm) on Nov. 15 on an unmanned 3-hour, 20-minute test flight.
   ``Tons, speed, heights, automation, and etc.,'' wrote A. Rudenko,
a Pravda reader from the Moldavian capital of Kishinev, on Buran.
``But where are the expenditures, the billions of rubles of the
national means?''
   ``Where is the mutual connection with the people's well-being?
How many years has Buran delayed fulfillment of the food program,
the output of good- quality shoes, clothes, and the improvement of
medical care for Soviet citizens?'' he asked.
   Pravda said that only a small part of the Soviet shuttle's
program has been fulfilled, and the Buran has yet to prove that it
can perform useful work in orbit.
   The newspaper said that the reaction of Soviet citizens to the
1961 launch of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was much more positive than
the reaction to the space shuttle program, even though people were
poorer then.
   It said the hopes for a better life that people lost during years
of corrupt government and a stagnant economy were to blame.
   The techonological advancements of the shuttle program eventually
will work their way into everyday life, however, Pravda said.
   It lamented, ``We have one pole of exclusively high technology _
Buran _ and a pole of failures, of technological quagmires _ the
agro-industrial complex, household goods, shoes, clothes.''
   Pravda said ways must be found to connect the two poles.

   He says he is a hard-working chef chasing the
American dream. But the U.S. government contends Carmine Esposito is
the ``Al Capone of Italy,'' a ruthless mob boss linked to a dozen
killings.
   Esposito, 31, facing a Jan. 13 deportation hearing, is fighting a
return to Italy that he says would mean certain death at the hands
of mobsters or corrupt law enforcement officials.
   ``Would the `Al Capone of Italy' come to Chicago and work like a
dog? Would he leave behind his protection and his money?'' he
demanded in a recent interview from the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center, where he has been held in solitary confinement
for 21 months.
   ``Would the `Al Capone of Italy get up at 4 a.m. each day to go
buy meat, to make sausage alone, to deliver it at night ... not have
enough time in a day to even wash yourself?''
   But the U.S. government has concluded that Esposito is the man
named in an extradition request from Italian authorities.
   The document charges that Esposito ordered or committed 12
killings in Italy from April 1982 through June 1983 while holding a
top post in the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, a criminal clan similar
to the Mafia that operates in and around Naples, near Esposito's
hometown of Acerra, Italy.
   ``Esposito is big fish,'' said Italian Judge Vicenzo Scolastico,
who was involved in the investigation of the organization.
   ``As a member of the (Camorra's policy-making) Council of Nine,
Esposito had people strangled. Some had to dig their own graves
before they were shot. Bodies were mutilated or disappeared.
   ``He is one of the last great Nuova Camorra figures still at
large, and if he ever decided to talk, he could cast light on many
unsolved crimes,'' Scolastico added in an interview with The Chicago
Tribune.
   Esposito was arrested in March 1987 as he and several employees
finished lunch at Bravissimo, the modestly successful restaurant he
and his wife opened in May 1986. He also worked as a chef there, and
earlier had worked as an auto body repairman, car salesman and
sausage-maker.
   He entered the United States in 1984, had no trouble with the law
and appeared to have been what he claimed _ a contented,
hard-working immigrant whose sweat earned him a growing business and
a home in the suburbs. He earned enough money to send his children
to parochial schools.
   But all that changed with Esposito's arrest. A lengthy court
fight drained his resources and forced his family onto public-aid
rolls. He also said his prison confinement has worsened a heart
condition.
   ``The authorities make him out to be a one-man crime wave,'' said
Esposito's attorney, Philip Parenti, ``and for all that, there is
not one eyewitness, one photograph, one fingerprint.
   ``There is not one piece of corroborating evidence, except for
the pentiti.''
   ``Pentiti,'' which literally means ``penitent'' but has taken on
the more pedestrian definition ``informant.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Scorza argued that even though
some informants' criminal histories might raise questions, those
matters are best addressed in Italian courts. The U.S. government
does not have to prove Esposito's innocence or guilt, Scorza said.
   ``Besides,'' he said, ``the witnesses almost always are
(informants) in gangster cases. And in this instance, the people
pointing at him are saying, `I did it with him.'
   ``They're not doing it to save their necks. They're confessing to
the crimes as well.''
   Esposito admits to having known Camorra members while working at
his father's auto body shop in Acerra, to fixing their getaway cars
and on at least one occasion, to sawing off the barrels of shotguns.
   His refusal to join the Camorra, he said, resulted in harassment
by Italian police, and later in his decision to pack up his family
and run. He left Acerra and spent the next three years in several
Italian cities _ Caserta, then Rome and Milan, before heading for
the United States.
   ``In Italy, the Camorra have so much influence with the
government and with police, there is no way to be safe,'' he said.
``Always I think, `If only I am successful to reach the United
States, it will be different.
   ``Now,'' he concluded, ``I am not so sure.''

<HEAD>Searchers Recover Part Of Tail Section</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of the tail section of Pan Am
Flight 103 and other wreckage has been found in remote moorland 15
miles east of this Scottish town, and Canadian experts have joined
the crash investigation.
   The discoveries of wreckage made Monday near the village of
Langholm and other finds made in previous days meant searchers had
located just 20 percent of the aircraft, which was destroyed by a
bomb.
   ``The area is very rough terrain and there has been no
confirmation yet from the accident investigators about what parts of
the aircraft are there (other than the tail part),'' local police
superintendent Angus Kennedy said.
   All 259 people aboard the New York-bound flight died when a bomb
smuggled onto the Boeing 747 blew it apart over Lockerbie on Dec.
21. Authorities have found three of the 11 people presumed to have
died on the ground.
   Kennedy said no bodies were recovered Monday, but that the body
of passenger Ingrid Smith of Britain was among 13 identified that
day. Her husband, Capt. Bruce Smith, a Pan Am pilot, accused local
police during the weekend of being ``paralyzed by inexperience and
incompetence'' and of delaying the return of victims' bodies to
their relatives.
   Area police chief John Boyd said he sympathized with bereaved
relatives, but ``every effort'' was being made to positively
identify the victims and return them to their families. He said
Monday that 81 of the 242 recovered bodies have been released.
   ``The trauma and grief experienced by relatives continues to be
uppermost in our minds.''
   Pan Am's senior representative at the crash site, Robert Gould,
vice president for operations, said the police had been ``thoroughly
professional.''
   Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which investigated
the suspicious 1985 crash of an Air-India jumbo jet, joined the
investigation Monday, said Superintendent Pat Cummings of Ottawa.
   An Indian government inquiry concluded that the crash off
Ireland, in which 329 people died, was caused by a bomb, probably
placed on board in Canada where the flight originated. A similar
inquiry by Canadian aviation authorities reached no firm conclusion
but suggested that evidence points to a bomb.
   The Flight 103 investigation is focused on the Lockerbie crash
site, Frankfurt Airport and London's Heathrow Airport. The flight
originated on a Boeing 727 in Frankfurt and, following a stop in
Heathrow, left for New York on the jumbo jet.
   U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of
responsibility for the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused
mostly on Palestinian extremists opposed to Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat's Middle East peace initiative.
   FBI Director William Sessions said Sunday that he welcomed any
information Arafat could provide in identifying suspects.
   The London weekly newspaper the Sunday Express reported without
attribution Sunday that Arafat had vowed to dispatch an
assassination squad to hunt down and kill the bomber.
   Les Jardine, spokesman for the regional council that governs
Lockerbie, said council officials would meet soon with residents of
the village to discuss plans to rebuild what was destroyed by
falling wreckage and burning fuel.
   Ten houses were destroyed, a crater 100 feet long by 30 feet deep
where they once stood, and another 30 homes were badly damaged.

   Findlay College President Kenneth Zirkle
spends his days at school and his nights at prison. But he's no
criminal.
   Zirkle teaches an introduction to business course to 24 inmates
at the Allen County Correctional Institution.
   He helped set up classes at the western Ohio prison, and at the
nearby Lima Correctional Institution, to give inmates an opportunity
to earn a college degree while on the inside.
   ``I have been involved in higher education for a long time, but
this is one of the most exciting ventures that I have ever been
in,'' Zirkle said.
   ``I think that, pragmatically, many of them see this as looking
good on a resume as they go before a parole board seeking to be
released from prison,'' he said.
   ``Secondly, and which I think is more pervasive, is the fact that
most of these people really are committed to trying to better
themselves,'' he said. ``Most of the time, if you talk to them, they
can tell you why they are there and they can tell you what led to
it. They are very fearful of going back.''
   The classes were established 4{ years ago at the maximum-security
prisons.
   ``We went in with certain stipulations, obviously, that we would
not be offering all programs. For example, it does not make a lot of
sense to offer teacher's education there because when the person is
no longer incarcerated, it is almost impossible to get a job in
public education with a prison record.
   ``So what we tried to do is offer those areas of our program that
would have the most interest with the inmates, and, from a very
pragmatic society standpoint, would enable these people to come out
and be productively employed,'' he said.
   Zirkle and his staff put together a curriculum that offers
associate degrees in business areas like accounting and computer
science and in the humanities.
   ``We have a pretty broad spectrum of programs that are offered.
When we started we thought we would have 40 or 50 students involved,
and the next thing we know we have 200 involved in a full-time
basis,'' he said.
   Inmates have to take 12 hours of courses. About 35 professors
have volunteered to help, he said.
   ``There are no part-time students. They either take full-time or
we are not involved with them,'' he said.
   Helping inmates redirect their lives was not a new for Zirkle. He
put three ex-prisoners in high-level jobs while he was coordinator
of residence halls at Penn State University in the early 1970s.
   Most inmates are good students who have never been given the
chance, he said. Their drive and willingness to learn is impressive,
he said, and learning they can succeed in college gives them the
confidence and hope that they can turn their lives around.

<HEAD>Captain Charged in Ferry Sinking that Left 67 Dead</HEAD>

   Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry
captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded with New
Year's travelers, sank off the Caribbean coast. Sixty-seven people
drowned and 14 were missing.
   Officials said 46 people survived the sinking of the ferry Justo
Rufino Barrios II in Amatique Bay on Guatemala's east coast Sunday.
   Juan Pablo Ezquibel was arrested after authorities determined
that about 120 people were aboard the 30-ton ferry, which was
authorized to carry 90, said Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola,
second-in-command at the Puerto Barrios naval base.
   He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a
16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and
sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
   Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking,
but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to
requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of
the ferry's wheel once it was under tow. He said the patrol boat
captain believed the ferry's rudder was unmanned while under tow.
   Esquibel radioed that he had taken the wheel just as the boat
began to capsize, Giron Arreola said.
   Giron Arreola also said that passengers ran to one side of the
ferry while it was under tow just before the ferry sank.
   ``It appears the boat rode a wave and that as it was leaning the
people ran to one side out of fear,'' he said. Although seas were
only 1-to-1{ feet, passengers were not used to traveling by sea, he
said.
   No Americans were on board, he said.
   A morgue official said 13 bodies were identified.
   Navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and other private craft
searched for the missing Monday.
   Puerto Barrios, 187 miles northeast of Guatemala City, the
capital, is Guatemala's main east coast port. There are no roads to
Livingston and most travel along the coast is by boat.
   The Rufino Barrios Maritime Transport firm owns the ferry and
operates two other ferries along the Livingston-Puerto Barrios route.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In making their wedding plans, Rhonda
Hufford and Todd Kellermann chose musicians, pink dresses and gray
tuxedos. And they were tested for AIDS under a year-old law some
officials say isn't worth the cost.
   The nation's only premarital AIDS testing law may not be a law
much longer, primarily because, like the Kellermanns, the
overwhelming majority of those tested have shown no signs of the
AIDS virus.
   Illinois' mandatory testing program took effect Jan. 1, 1988. But
only 23 of the 150,000 people tested in the first 11 months were
found to be infected with the virus, the state Department of Public
Health said.
   That's about one in 6,500 tested.
   The cost of the AIDS test in Illinois, including the doctor's
visit, ranges from $25 to $125 per person, said state Health
Department spokesman Tom Schafer. Based on a ``conservative'' $35
per test average, the cost of finding each of the 23 infected people
came to more than $228,000, he said.
   Still, to receive a marriage license for their June wedding,
Kellermann and Ms. Hufford, a nursing student, had to show the Macon
County Clerk's office a certificate verifying they had been tested.
   ``I'm easygoing about it,'' said Kellerman, a 22-year-old
Springfield computer analyst. ``As long as they make it a law,
there's not much you can do about it.''
   But the law has resulted in a 25 percent drop in the number of
marriage license applications in Illinois, state Public Health
Director Bernard Turnock said. Hundreds of Illinois couples have
gone to bordering states to tie the knot.
   ``They don't want to take the AIDS test,'' said Janet Hudacek of
the Lake County, Ind., clerk's office, which has seen a six-fold
increase in the number of Illinois residents seeking marriage
licenses. ``Mostly it's the cost.''
   To the north, in Kenosha County, Wis., officials are selling more
marriage licenses to Illinoisans than to Wisconsin residents.
   Through Dec. 8, they said, 1,073 Illinois couples got married in
Kenosha County _ 51 percent of all licenses issued. The previous
year, 58 Illinois couples were married there of 1,021 licenses
issued, said Michelle Riley, a clerk in the county offices.
   Because the number of people with AIDS infections detected
through premarital testing is so low and the cost so high, Turnock
plans to recommend to Republican Gov. James R. Thompson that the law
be scrapped. Democratic state Rep. Grace Mary Stern, who was
rebuffed this spring in efforts to dump the testing law, has filed
legislation for this session to end the testing.
   But Republican Rep. Penny Pullen said repealing the law would
send a message that Illinois no longer sees AIDS as a serious
problem.
   ``This program is giving thousands of Illinois couples the good
news that they are not infected,'' she said. ``In this society, with
its current mores, that can be very good news indeed, and yet it's
very unlikely that couples would demand the test of each other if
the state did not demand it.''
   Illinois is the only state with a premarital AIDS testing law.
Louisiana repealed its version of the law last year.
   ``I think other states are still looking at doing it but I doubt
they will because they're finding really it's not very cost
effective,'' said Tracey Hooker, a staff associate at the National
Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's
defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers.
   The AIDS virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to
their infants before or during birth.

   Top-ranked Notre Dame defeated No. 3 West Virginia 34-21 in the
Fiesta Bowl to give the Fighting Irish their eighth national
championship in college football and the first since 1977.
   Notre Dame's Tony Rice, a junior, threw for two touchdowns and a
career-high 213 yards as the Irish finished the season undefeated at
12-0.
   In other bowl games Monday, No. 11 Michigan upset No. 5 Southern
California 22-14 in the Rose Bowl; No. 9 UCLA beat No. 8 Arkansas
17-3 in the Cotton Bowl; and No. 13 Clemson edged No. 10 Oklahoma
13-6 in the Citrus Bowl.
   Seventeenth-ranked Syracuse defeated No. 16 Louisiana State 23-10
in the Hall of Fame Bowl; No. 2 Miami defeated No. 6 Nebraska 23-3
in the Orange Bowl; and No. 4 Florida State defeated No. 7 Auburn
13-7 in the Sugar Bowl.
   Notre Dame's victory assured it of the top spot in the final
Associated Press poll.
   Rice completed seven of 11 passes, including a 29-yard scoring
strike to Raghib Ismail late in the second quarter and a 3-yard pass
to Frank Jacobs early in the fourth quarter.
   West Virginia, which finished 11-1, had to be satisified with the
first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history.

<TEXT>
   A woman who recovered the $65,000 in cash
she had left behind in her hotel room didn't even thank the two
maids who turned the money in, hotel officials said.
   Cathy Dean and Paula Vaughan found the money in a shoe box
Saturday while cleaning a suite at the Residence Inn.
   ``As a child, I went to church every Sunday,'' said Ms. Vaughan,
26. ``I was taught that if you find something that doesn't belong to
you, you turn it in.
   ``It makes you feel good, like the glow you get after you give
birth to a baby,'' she said.
   Ms. Dean, 36, said she was shocked at finding the money.
   ``I about passed out,'' she said. ``I held onto it real tight as
we took it back to the front desk.''
   A woman who had checked out earlier in the day returned Saturday
evening to claim the money, said hotel general manager Linda
Catalina. She refused to identify the woman, and said hotel
officials did not question the guest about why she carried so much
cash.
   Police had no plans to investigate the source of the cash,
either, said detective Sgt. Harold Moore.
   ``It's the lady's money as far as we know,'' Moore said Monday.
``She could have sold a house and been taking the money to a bank.''
   Laura Butkovic, another hotel manager, said the guest did not
offer the maids a reward when she returned. In fact, she appeared so
relieved about recovering the money she apparently forgot to thank
them, she said.
   But the hotel will not forget the act of honesty. Ms. Catalina
said she contacted the Residence Inn's headquarters in Washington,
D.C., to report it. She said the maids will receive some sort of
reward.
   ``It's employees like these who make our guests feel safe,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Hockey Star Misses Flight; Questioned By Authorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Czechoslovak hockey player
who wants to play in the National Hockey League missed his team's
flight home and was believed to be seeking asylum, Canadian hockey
officials said.
   Peter Nedved, the offensive star of an international hockey
tournament, disappeared Monday from a home where he had been staying
and missed the flight that took his colleagues back to
Czechoslovakia.
   ``He is currently in the hands of the immigration people,'' Ted
Taylor, organizer of the Mac's Midget Hockey Tournament, said Monday
night. ``I'm assuming he maybe has asked for it (asylum) by now.''
   Immigration authorities could not immediately be reached for
comment, and a spokesman for the External Affairs Department in
Ottawa said he had no information about Nedved.
   Taylor said he had no idea whether the 6-foot-2, 165-pound
forward will be allowed to remain in Canada. But he has had several
calls from members of Calgary's strong Czechoslovak community
offering help.
   Nedved said in a weekend interview that he wanted to return to
Canada as a visitor but would ``prefer to play here.'' He led the
tournament in scoring and the team from his town of Litvinov won the
event.
   ``I would say he was the rave of the tournament. Everybody was
talking about him,'' Taylor said.
   In a weekend interview, Nedved said he hoped to play for the
Czechoslovak national team and the NHL.
   ``I don't plan that far ahead,'' he said with a smile. ``But I'll
be able to give you a better answer in five years.''
   Nedved's father played on Czechoslovakia's national team as did
an older brother before being drafted into the army. That fate would
await Peter in Czechoslovakia.
   Nedved's team had been in Calgary since Dec. 10, and he was
staying in a southwest Calgary home along with a Canadian player. He
was last seen by his hosts just after midnight Sunday as he slept on
a couch.
   The athlete left the home early Monday, taking only his hockey
equipment with him, Taylor said.
   The organizer tried to reach the team's coaches, but they were
already on their way to the airport. Taylor contacted the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.
   He said police told him Nedved ``would be looked after. It was
out of my hands.''
   Taylor said Nedved apparently does not know English very well
because he had a Canadian friend telephone girls for him, including
Taylor's 18-year-old daughter.

   A strong earthquake was recorded today off the
southern tip of Japan near the Ryukyu islands of Yaku and Tanega,
the Royal Observatory reported.
   The quake, which measured an estimated 5.5 on the Richter scale,
was recorded at 12:45 p.m. (11:45 p.m. EST Monday) and was centered
about 100 miles south-southeast of the Japanese city of Kagoshima,
the observatory said in a statement.
   Observatory reports never mention whether there may have been
casualties.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the
ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated
areas while a magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage.

   A woman and her three children suffocated
in the back of a pickup truck as the family was driving home from
Mexico, unaware carbon monoxide fumes were seeping into the camper
shell, officials said.
   The children, ages 3-6, and their mother were found unconscious
Monday at the Calexico Port of Entry when her husband pulled up to
the border station following a three- to four-hour wait, said police
Sgt. Bill Matus.
   The discovery prompted officials to check other cars, and two
children were found unconscious in the back of another pickup truck.
They were taken to a hospital, where they remained today for
observation.
   U.S. Customs Service officials identified the dead as Micaela
Iniguez Aguilar, 26; and her children, Horacio Aguilar, 6, Francisco
Javiar Aguilar, 4, and Camilio Aguilar, 3.
   The father, Horacio Aguilar, 36, was unhurt and was unaware the
fumes were seeping into the truck, Matus said.
   Inspectors and paramedics tried to revive the four, but they were
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital here.
   The pickup truck had a faulty exhaust system and the bed had
holes in it, allowing carbon monoxide to seep into the back, said
John Miller, a Customs Service spokesman.
   He said the family, all Mexican nationals, were returning home to
the San Joaquin Valley town of Laton after a holiday visit to
Mexicali.
   Holiday traffic caused a massive backup at the border station
about 100 miles east of San Diego. Matus estimated traffic was
delayed three to four hours and, ``that could have contributed to
the whole thing.''
   Miller declined comment on the delays except to say that all
eight lanes at the border station were open.
   Matus said that when the family encountered the backup, the
mother moved from the cab to the back to check on the children.
   Shortly after the first discovery, Mexican border agents went car
by car to warn motorists in line about carbon monoxide dangers.
   They discovered Angelica Ortega, 11, and Armando Ortega, 12, of
Niland, Calif., unconscious in the back of another pickup, also
covered. The children were revived and taken to a hospital, Customs
spokeswoman Bobbie Cassidy said.

<TEXT>
   Now that President-elect Bush has nearly filled
his Cabinet, his next major challenge is to fashion a legislative
package that he can push through a Democratic-controlled Congress.
   The problem of the nation's budget deficit looms as the
overriding test for Bush, but his aides also are looking to move
legislation on issues that Bush stressed during his campaign,
including childcare, education, the environment and ethics.
   The Bush team has said the budget deficit will take priority, and
much of his legislative program will depend on the fiscal package he
is able to work out with Congress.
   ``We'd have to have the framework first for dealing with the
budget,'' said Craig Fuller, the Bush transition co-director.
   But he said Bush will still pursue commitments he made during his
campaign. That would mean legislative proposals in such areas as
environment, childcare and education.
   In the area of government ethics, where President Reagan vetoed a
package from Capitol Hill last fall, Bush said recently that he will
send an ethics bill to Congress ``very, very early.''
   In his proposals on lobbying by government officials after
they've left office, Bush applies the same standards to Congress as
to executive branch workers, said Boyden Gray, who will serve as
Bush's White House legal counsel.
   As his budget team toils over the the fiscal framework they will
take into congressional negotiations, small groups of aides are
working on that and other building blocks of the Bush agenda.
   Research teams headed by Jim Pinkerton, head of policy
development for Bush's transition operation, have gathered data from
cabinet departments including synopses of measures pending in
Congress and issues seen as key in the new congressional session.
   Much of the ``serious policy analysis'' on the Bush legislative
package is expected to occur early in January, said Robert Teeter,
co-director of Bush's transition team.
   The early proposals are expected to center on a domestic agenda,
stressing the ``kinder, gentler'' approach to government that Bush
discussed during the campaign.
   Spending proposals _ such as his plan to expand Medicaid coverage
_ ultimately will hinge on how the budget negotiations turn out. For
instance, Bush's commitment to the tough anti-drug stance he took
during the campaign could be tested in talks on financing the
massive new anti-drug legislation Congress passed this fall.
   The bill calls for $2.7 billion in new spending, but Congress
initially appropriated only $976 million.
   But other items, such as the ethics package, don't have a
significant pricetag.
   One idea is to stress presidential leadership on projects that
don't involve large sums of money, such as an international
conference Bush has proposed to deal with the problem of global
warming of the atmosphere from carbon dioxide.
   Bush wants a revised clean-air bill, and said in the campaign the
nation must have ``a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a
clear timetable.''
   He said he will work with Congress ``on the exact amounts and
exact methodology'' to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulpher dioxide
emissions.
   On one of the acid-rain sticking points, Bush proposes burden
sharing of the costs among ratepayers nationwide rather than just in
the polluting regions.
   The Clean Air Act has been up for renewal every year this decade,
but Congress has been unable to agree on the provision dealing with
acid rain.
   ``There will be a long negotiation on acid rain and clean air
authorization,'' predicted Bush adviser Bob Grady.
   Environmentalists also are waiting to see how the Bush team
handles some of the regulatory aspects of environmental protection
and cleanup, a subject on which the Reagan administration was
heavily criticized.
   Another controversial topic is offshore oil drilling. Congress,
in an ad hoc approach, has tacked on a drilling prohibition for the
California coast, for example, when passing appropriations for the
Interior Department each year.
   Bush, a former oilman, has shied away from blanket bans, saying
he will look at the drilling situation on a tract-by-tract basis.
   Bush also emphasized education issues during the campaign. His
proposals include a $500 million merit schools program, $50 million
for magnet schools, and $50 million for programs in teaching reform
and innovation.
   He also promised to push for a big increase in Head Start
funding, to extend it to all eligible 4-year-olds.
   Bush during the campaign pledged a childcare plan, to include a
government refund for childcare expenses for the poor, with a $1,000
tax credit per child under age 4.
   Differences between Bush's childcare plan and versions offered by
Congress are expected to spark a battle. The new president also will
send Congress his plan for YES, or Youth Entering Service to
America. It calls for $100 million to match private sector grants
for young people to volunteer in community service programs.

   A 22-year-old woman was seen walking on a beach
minutes after she jumped more than 200 feet from the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, authorities said.
   Maria Bertoline jumped Monday morning from the bridge, which
connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, and was taken to St. Vincent's
Medical Center with a possible broken spine, said a police
spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Bertoline was listed in guarded condition early today with
fractures and was under observation, said a nursing supervisor who
would not identify herself or comment further.
   Housing Authority police officers driving across the bridge
spotted Bertoline, wearing a nightgown, on the opposite side of the
span, but by the time they turned around, she had jumped.
   ``About four or five minutes after she jumped, we saw her walking
along the beach at Fort Wadsworth,'' said Officer Martin McKeon.
``We couldn't believe it.''
   Bertoline's father, Joseph, said his daughter had been under
treatment for depression and had ``boyfriend problems.''

<HEAD>British Businessman Thomas Loel Guinness Dies in Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British businessman Thomas Loel Evelyn Bulkeley
Guinness, a former aviator and member of Parliament, has died at age
82.
   Guinness suffered a heart attack at his Acapulco, Mexico, home
Friday, went to Houston for treatment and died Saturday, relatives
and a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Guinness, whose family made its fortune in banking and is related
to the Guinness brewery dynasty, was in the House of Commons from
1931 to 1945.
   He was one of the first people in Britain to own a plane, and
later commanded a squadron of fighter planes during World War II. In
1944, he was promoted to wing commander.
   After the war, he inherited a fortune from his father and for a
time was president of the former British United Airways.
   Guinness had been at his home near the sea in Acapulco, when he
had a heart attack, son William Guinness said here Monday. The elder
Guinness had often been under the care of Houston heart specialist
Dr. Michael DeBakey, his son said.
   ``He was a very private man,'' William Guinness said. ``He was a
very fine gentleman. He was 82 and getting old, but it did come as
quite a surprise.''
   Guinness had a home in the Swiss city of Lausanne but spent much
of his time in the United States, his son said.
   A funeral was scheduled for today in Houston, and burial Friday
in Lausanne.
   Guinness is also survived by a daughter, Lady Dufferin, and
several grandchildren.

   Two barges carrying 33,600 tons of oil caught fire
and exploded on the Yangtze River, blocking traffic along China's
longest waterway, official news reports said today.
   The People's Daily said the fire occurred about 50 miles upstream
from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province. It said the barges, part
of a fleet belonging to the Nanking-Yangtze Oil Shipping Co., were
set adrift after the lead boat ran aground early Sunday.
   Fires started on both barges and the boats exploded shortly
before 9 a.m.
   The crew abandoned the main boat after it beached and there were
no reports of casualties.
   The daily said fire spread across the width of the fire-slicked
river where the two explosions took place.
   The cause of the fires is still under investigation.

<TEXT>
   The centennial Rose Parade bloomed with
love as Southern California's Most Romantic Couple exchanged vows on
a flower-bedecked float as an audience worthy of Prince Charles and
Princess Diana watched.
   Monday's Tournament of Roses parade also featured the return of
Shirley Temple Black as grand marshal after a 50-year absence, a
reunion of Rose Queens, 275 horses, 20 marching bands, and 60 floats
decorated with more than 20 million flowers.
   In Dallas, mimes, clowns, mascots and 650 pompon dancers took
part in the 32nd annual Cotton Bowl Parade.
   On a float fitted with an orchid-covered gazebo and dubbed
``Romance in California,'' Ron Simms and Carie Humphries were wed
before hundreds of thousands of spectators and a TV audience
officials estimated at up to 350 million in 32 countries.
   By comparison, the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana
was seen by about 650 million worldwide.
   ``This is like a fairy tale come true,'' said Simms, 23. ``It's a
chance to show everybody what true love is about.''
   The couple was selected from thousands who entered The Search for
the Most Romantic Couple in Southern California contest.
   Other floats carried children fighting cancer and a Vietnamese
refugee who made a harrowing escape by boat in 1980.
   Mrs. Black, who last served as grand marshal in 1939 when she was
the 10-year-old child star Shirley Temple, led the parade despite a
recent admission that she is allergic to roses.
   ``Dark red roses cause me a problem. No other roses do,'' she
said, adding that she is already campaigning for a third stint as
grand marshal.
   Rose Queen Charmaine Beth Shryock reigned with her court on a
float followed by one reuniting many former Rose Queens, including
80-year-old Holly Halsted Balthis from 1930.
   The parade began in 1890 as a hunt club that entertained
residents of the Los Angeles suburb with rose petal-covered horse
and buggy teams.
   Police in previous years have estimated the crowd size at about 1
million, but this year declined, saying the number was too difficult
to arrive at.
   The Pasadena Star-News, conducting its own head count, estimated
the number of spectators as 500,000.
   The crowd was described as well-behaved. There were 188 arrests,
mostly for drunkenness, compared with 444 last year, said parade
spokesman Ken Veronda.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Demonstrate After Incident With African</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 Chinese students demonstrated in Beijing
today against ``hooliganism'' and for women's rights after an
African man allegedly accosted a Chinese woman in her dormitory.
   The protest march and a subsequent class boycott marked the third
time since Dec. 24 that tensions between Chinese and Africans have
provoked fights or demonstrations in China.
   Last week, thousands of Chinese in Nanking demonstrated against
African students following a Christmas Eve fight that began when the
Africans tried to bring Chinese women into a dance.
   In Hangzhou, 56 African students have been boycotting classes for
a week. They say Chinese authorities have accused them of having
AIDS.
   Chinese authorities in Nanking today said four African students
have been expelled for participating in the Christmas Eve brawl at
Hehai University in the east-central city. At least one has been
arrested and the other three detained for questioning.
   The officials denied African allegations that Chinese
paramilitary forces beat and used electric truncheons to shock
African students during a clash Saturday in a guest house outside
Nanking where the blacks had been sequestered _ supposedly for their
own safety _ for nearly a week.
   In Beijing today, Chinese students at the Beijing Languages
Institute held a two-hour march, carrying banners saying,
``Hooligans Go Home,'' ``Protect Women's Rights,'' and ``We Demand A
Safe Campus,'' eight participants said.
   Chinese students said 2,000 students later boycotted classes.
   The students said they wanted their school to fix locks on
dormitory doors, provide better lighting and upgrade security. They
said they wanted foreign students ``to respect Chinese customs.''
   The incident in Beijing occurred early Sunday when a Chinese
woman went to the bathroom and was accosted by an African student in
her third floor dormitory hall, Chinese and foreign students said.
   A roommate of the woman said the African followed her classmate
into the bathroom and asked her to leave the building with him.
   To buy time, she agreed and told him to wait downstairs.
   The African then sneaked into the woman's room, her roommate said.
   When the woman returned, the African attempted to grab her but
she screamed and ran down the stairs. On the second floor she
slipped on broken glass and severely cut her leg, Chinese students
said.
   ``I saw him run after her,'' said the roommate, who was awoken by
her roommates' cries. ``She was yelling, `Save me! save me!'''
   She said her roommate could not speak to an Associated Press
reporter because ``all she can do is cry.''
   African students at the languages institute said they did not
know exactly what happened on Sunday morning. They said they
believed Chinese were using the incident as an excuse to oppose
relationships between foreign men and Chinese women.
   Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese are
often openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is
very different from their own. The tensions become explosive when
Chinese women are involved.
   In Nanking, Su Xiaoxun, an official at the Jiangsu province
foreign affairs office, denied allegations by African students and
diplomats that Chinese forces attacked and tortured Africans at a
guest house on Saturday.
   The Benin Embassy's first secretary, Gobo Bio Mamah, reported
allegations that Chinese militia stripped students and administered
electric shocks as torture during Saturday's attack.
   Daouda Diakite, a 24-year-old student from Mali, said Chinese
militia shocked his classmates around their genitals.
   The 140 mostly African students had been forced to the guest
house on Dec. 26 following the African-Chinese clash and anti-black
protests during which thousands of youths threw rocks and destroyed
property at African dormitories.
   In Nanking, Alex Dzabaku Dosoo of Ghana has been arrested in
connection with the Christmas Eve clash. A Benin student, Ludovic
Dossoumon, was sentenced without trial to 15 days in prison as
``punishment,'' diplomats say.

   No one seems to want Dale Aupperle's job.
   The situation is so bad that each of the nearly 400 households in
this Macon County community of 1,000 will soon receive instructions
on how to get on April 4's ballot for village president.
   Aupperle, 37, is completing a four-year term and would like to be
replaced.
   But with the deadline for filing candidacy petitions only two
weeks away, no one has bothered to enter.
   Village Clerk Cheryl Lehman this week will mail the requirements
for filing nominating petitions to each household, for the job of
president or trustee.
   Aupperle asked Lehman to make the special mailing after Monday's
village board meeting was canceled for lack of quorum.
   He said he doesn't really want to give up the village post, but
demands on his time are increasing and will only get worse.
   ``I'm the first vice president of the American Society of Farm
Managers and Rural Appraisers,'' said Aupperle, senior vice
president of the Magna Trust Co.'s Farm Management Department.

<HEAD>Former Sears, Allstate President Dies Of Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archie R. Boe, former president of Sears, Roebuck
and Co. and Allstate Insurance Co., has died of cancer at age 67.
   Boe, who joined Allstate in 1941 and worked for the insurance
company or its parent, Sears, until retirement in 1984, died Monday
at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
   ``He was one of the first corporate executives to adapt
long-range planning, known as strategic planning, into the corporate
world,'' said Ray Ewing, a former Allstate spokesman who worked with
Boe for 20 years.
   ``He had a good sense of foresight and planning that was really
unique.''
   Known mostly as a car insurer, Allstate expanded into other areas
of coverage in 1957 under Boe's leadership.
   ``That's the reason Allstate is so big today,'' Ewing said.
   Boe was named Allstate president in 1966, and chairman and chief
executive officer in 1972. In 1982 he was named president of Sears,
a post he held for two years.
   Boe was born in Estherville, Iowa. He graduated from Drake
University in 1941 with a finance degree.
   He earned a master's degree in business from the University of
Chicago, was inducted into the Chicago Business Hall of Fame in
1987, and served on several corporate boards.
   Survivors include his wife, Elaine; son, Michael; stepson, Dr.
James Day; and stepdaughters Constance Day and Randee Gregos.

<TEXT>
   A streamlined Christian Science Monitor with color
photographs, fewer pages and less advertising was redesigned to save
time for readers of the 80-year-old newspaper, its editors say.
   Concern over the new appearance, which started with today's
editions, and other changes prompted an exodus in November of top
management at the church-run daily newspaper, including the
departure of Pulitzer Prize-winning editor Katherine Fanning.
   But the changes in the 80-year-old newspaper, which has lost
money for years, were based on five years of reader research, news
executives said Monday.
   ``Readers told us that because of the demands on their time, they
want greater selectivity in topics covered by the Monitor, more
concise articles and a design and layout that helps them absorb the
paper's editorial content,'' John H. Hoagland Jr., manager of the
Christian Science Publishing Society said Monday in a statement.
   ``In short, they continue to look to the Monitor for the context
and perspective of events, and want a serious paper that can be read
thoroughly in about 30 minutes.''
   The weekday newspaper with a circulation of about 170,000 is
still tabloid shaped. But it will be 20 pages, smaller by about
eight pages than its previous format. This was accomplished by
keeping national advertising to two pages and eliminating local and
classified ads.
   In addition, the newspaper's staff of 160 is among the 800
members of the publishing society and broadcasting operation due for
cutbacks of 20 percent to 25 percent, said spokesman Don Feldheim.

<HEAD>War Veterans Offer $5,000 Bounty To Laotian Insurgents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. war veterans seeking the release of
colleagues they claim are being held in Laos said today that they
are offering anti-communist Laotian insurgents $5,000 to destroy a
government building.
   The veterans have formed a ``war council'' and are offering the
money for the first significant government building the insurgents
destroy, group spokesman Ted Sampley said.
   ``We believe the only way the truth and any living American
prisoner of war will ever be liberated from Laos is if the Pathet
Lao (communist party) are driven from Laos,'' he said. ``We're going
to encourage (the insurgents) to take on the Pathet Lao any way they
can.''
   Sampley, who spoke in a telephone interview from the United
States, is chairman of the National Steering Committee For Vietnam
War Veterans. The private lobbying group has accused the U.S.
government of failing to secure the release of Americans held from
the Indochina War, which ended with communist victories in Cambodia,
Laos and Vietnam in 1975.
   The Laotian government has repeatedly denied holding any
Americans from the war and has reacted angrily to private
initiatives.
   The U.S. government also has criticized these private
initiatives, preferring official contacts with the Laotian
authorities, whom it says have increased cooperation in recent
months.
   A total of 547 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action, or MIA, in Laos, but U.S. officials said all but one are
presumed dead.
   ``If the Reagan administration will encourage private citizens to
help the Contras (insurgents in Nicaragua), then by God we can help
the Laotians against the Pathet Lao communists,'' said Sampley, a
former Green Beret from Kinston, N.C.
   He said the $5,000 had been donated by a private U.S. citizen but
would not identify the person.
   Insurgents based along the Thai and Chinese borders have fought
the Laotian government since the Pathet Lao seized power in December
1975, but do not appear to pose a major security risk. The U.S.
government says it gives no support to the insurgents.
   In October, Sampley led a group of Americans to Thailand. On the
Mekong River, which separates Thailand and Laos, they floated
currency notes stamped with another reward offer _ $2.4 million to
anyone who brings out a live prisoner.
   Two members of the group were detained by the Laotians for 41
days after they illegally crossed to the Laotian side of the river.
   Last month, U.S. and Laotian experts conducted their fourth joint
excavation of a U.S. warplane crash site in Laos and found one set
of human remains.
   The MIA issue was expected to be discussed during talks this week
between Laos' deputy foreign minister, Soubanh Srithirath, and
Richard Childress, director of Asian affairs at the U.S. National
Security Council.
   Childress was accompanied on the trip by Ann Mills Griffiths, the
head of the National League of POW-MIA Families, a private lobbying
group.
   The official Laotian radio said Soubanh and Childress met in
Laos' capital of Vientiane on Monday and were expected to meet again
today.
   ``The consultative meeting proceeded in a good and
straightforward atmosphere,'' said a text of Monday's broadcast,
which was seen in Bangkok today.

recently been found in a wrecked bakery, saying the last survivor
was rescued 10 days ago.
   Tass, the official news agency, contradicted French and British
broadcast reports that said 17 people had, by eating grain and
melted snow, survived in a devastated bakery in the town of Spitak
for more than three weeks.
   ``The Western press reports ... have no foundation,'' Tass quoted
Norik Muradyan, chief of rescue operations in the town, as saying
today in a telephone interview.
   ``The last living person was removed by rescuers from the ruins
of buildings and structures in Spitak 10 days ago,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Since Thursday, the bodies of 28 more earthquake victims have
been pulled from the rubble, bringing the total of recovered bodies
to 24,888, Tass said.
   In Paris, Europe 1 radio on Monday quoted a nurse for the French
humanitarian group Doctors of the World as saying the 17 survivors
were found in a bread factory near Spitak, a village in northwestern
Armenia, on Wednesday. The nurse, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, was quoted as saying they stayed alive by eating grain
and drinking melted snow.
   The London commercial radio station LBC reported that French
medics said the 17 were found Saturday.
   The quake, which left about 400,000 people homeless, leveled
Spitak, where 25,000 people had lived. It measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale.

   A former prosecutor who claims she
was fired for her provocative outfits has declined an offer to pose
in Playboy magazine for fear it could lead to disorder in the court.
   ``If I'm going to have men on a jury, those men probably will
have seen me in Playboy, and I don't know if that would color their
thinking, or if it would just make them uncomfortable to be in a
courtroom with me, or me uncomfortable to be in a courtroom with
them,'' Brenda Taylor said Monday.
   ``We have been talking to her representative,'' said Elizabeth
Norris, communications director for Playboy Enterprises in Chicago.
``Nothing has been settled.''
   Earlier, Taylor had said she wasn't sure about taking the offer
because of how it might affect her chances of getting a law job.
   Taylor, 25, was dismissed in September from the Broward County
State Attorney's Office, where she worked in the County Court
division. She mostly handled drunken driving cases.
   Her firing came two weeks after she filed a discrimination
complaint accusing her boss, Assistant State Attorney John
Countryman, of saying she looked like a ``bimbo'' and a
``manhunter'' because of the short skirts and tight dresses she wore
in the courtroom.
   Chief Assistant State Attorney Ralph Ray Jr. cited shortcomings
in her job performance as the reason for the dismissal.
   Since leaving the State Attorney's Office, she has been working
in private practice handling civil cases from donated office space.

<HEAD>Keysville Mayor, All-Black Council Slate Win Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEYSVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired black schoolteacher who helped
resurrect this racially divided town's government has won
re-election as mayor in Keysville's first locally supervised
election since the Depression.
   Mayor Emma Gresham, 64, defeated 67-year-old challenger Joseph U.
Cochran, who is white, by a vote of 127-61 on Monday as her
all-black slate of City Council candidates defeated Cochran's slate
of four whites and one black by similar margins.
   ``I feel that God has blessed us again,'' Mrs. Gresham said.
``This means we can continue for progress in Keysville. People can
see the change. They must have, for me to get that many votes.''
   The east Georgia town has about 230 registered voters and is 70
percent black.
   Cochran said he wasn't surprised by the results in light of a
ruling earlier Monday by the Burke County Board of Registrars
rejecting challenges he had filed against 84 black voters.
   Cochran contended that the 84 voters, including 35 who live in a
newly annexed area, did not live within town boundaries.
   ``Since the town's boundaries have not been established, I can't
see hardly how you can annex more property into it,'' Cochran said.
   The Washington-based public interest law firm that helped
Keysville organize and conduct the election, Christic Institute
South, disputed Cochran's contention that the town limits were in
question.
   The institute's attorney, Alan Gregory, said the annexation was
cleared in advance by the U.S. Justice Department and approved by
the Georgia secretary of state's office.
   In addition to the 35 voters living in the annexed area,
``they're challenging the same 49 people that were challenged in the
last election,'' he said. ``Those were nullified by the registrar at
the end of the vote tallies. There is no reason for those people to
be challenged again.''
   Sixty-three of the challenged voters cast ballots.
   Cochran said Monday night he had not decided whether to appeal
the registrars' decision.
   Keysville's government was revived in January 1988 when Mrs.
Gresham and council members won one-year terms in a contested
election.
   Monday's election was for 20-month terms. Subsequent elections
will be for four-year terms under a new charter awaiting approval by
the Georgia Legislature.
   For reasons lost to time, Keysville deactivated its government in
1933. In the 1980s, black residents began a move to reactivate it in
order to get municipal water, sewers, fire and police protection,
all of which the town lacked. There were problems with defining the
boundaries, however, as the original 1890 charter described the city
limits as everything within a half-mile radius of a schoolhouse that
was demolished around 1895.
   White residents went to court to block the move to reactivate the
government. They denied they were worried about a possible black
government, saying they were concerned that installing basic
municipal services would tax poor blacks out of their homes.
   Mrs. Gresham and a council were elected the first time in 1985,
but white residents contended in court that since the city limits
were not specific, the vote should be thrown out. A state court
agreed and issued an order forbidding the Keysville officials from
taking office.
   Opponents used the same argument to try to prevent elections last
year, but ultimately lost in federal court.

<HEAD>AIDS Charity Favored By High Society Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A charity that counts Nancy Reagan among its
supporters is being investigated because of a report that it misled
donors and sometimes gave less than half its donations to AIDS
research, officials said.
   ``It seems that their expenses were enormously high for the
amount of money they were giving to the organizations they
promised,'' said Lanie Accles, a spokeswoman for state Attorney
General Robert Abrams, who has subpoenaed the Creo Society's records.
   The investigation follows a Dec. 27 Better Business Bureau
report, which found, based on the organization's records, that: ``Of
13 events in 1987 and 1988, seven yielded less than 50 percent to
charity,'' the bureau's minimum acceptable standard.
   The bureau's New York Philanthropic Advisory Service, which
investigated Creo for four months, said Creo had given it four sets
of inconsistent financial statements.
   Creo, founded in 1983, describes its mission as ``raising funds
for charitable purposes, notably for AIDS-related organizations.''
   In addition to Mrs. Reagan, supporters of the organization have
included U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and King
Juan Carlos of Spain.
   The organization, whose name means ``I create'' in Latin and ``I
believe'' in Spanish, has sponsored several lavish, high-society
benefits, including a production of the musical ``Hair'' at the
United Nations last May that was to raise $2 million for ``children
affected by AIDS.''
   Solicitations for the event were ``particularly unclear and
potentially misleading,'' the bureau said.
   Less than half that amount _ $829,668 _ was raised, about $1,000
under the cost of production, according to Creo's records.
   Records indicated that $74,000 went to AIDS-related charity, but
the organization's president, Marshall Yeager, acknowledged Monday
that that figure relied on pledges that have yet to be received.
   The amount Creo has given to charities from its events ranged
from 6 percent of the $15,000 raised at a film benefit last
September to 83 percent from a December benefit that raised
$2,425,000.
   Yeager defended the various figures given by Creo to the bureau.
   ``The figures were different because they wanted things reported
in a different way,'' he said.
   Rhonda Klein Singer, the bureau's executive vice president and
general counsel, said she believed Creo should be forced to register
with the state as a professional fund-raising organization.

<HEAD>Five Die In Clashes Between Rival Moslem Militias</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias blasted each
other with grenades, mortars and cannons in Beirut's southern slums
all night, and police today said five combatants were killed and
seven others wounded.
   Thousands of residents remained huddled in basements and bomb
shelters as the fighting raged into a fourth day, police said.
   The sound of explosions reverberated across the Lebanese capital
as militiamen of the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for hope, and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, battled under parachute
flares.
   Iran had planned to send its deputy foreign minister, Mohammed
Javad Larijani, to Beirut to try to attain a cease-fire, according
to radio stations in Moslem west Beirut. But Larijani flew to the
Soviet Union today, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   It was not clear if the trip to Moscow, Syria's main backer, was
connected to the fighting in Lebanon. Syria is Lebanon's main power
broker and its troops, though in the vicinity of the fighting, have
stayed clear.
   The new casualties brought the toll to 25 killed and 54 wounded
in four days of fighting in the slums and on the northern fringe of
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   A police spokesman said the two militias fought from house to
house in Beirut's Ghobeiri neighborhood after nightfall Monday, when
Hezbollah fighters, wearing their trademark black headbands, overran
a police station.
   The fighting in south Beirut and south Lebanon tapered into
sniper fire at dawn, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing regulations.
   ``It's not a cease-fire. They're simply tired and need a rest,''
the spokesman said. ``They will be at it again.''
   Six cease-fires called by Syrian peacekeeping troops have failed
to curb the hostilities.
   In May, Syria sent 4,500 toops into the slums, a cluster of
low-income districts stretching over 16 square miles on Beirut's
southern flank.
   The Syrian intervention came after a three-week bloodbath between
Amal and Hezbollah in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000
wounded.
   But both sides clashed again in November. Forty people were
killed and 87 wounded in that round of street fighting in west and
south Beirut.
   The Syrians have 7,500 troops in west Beirut in addition to the
contingent in the slums. They also maintain about 25,000 troops in
northern and eastern Lebanon under a 1976 mandate from the Arab
League to halt the Moslem-Christian civil war, now in its 14th year.

<HEAD>Hotel Where Chaplin Lived And Robert Kennedy Died Closes Its Doors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 68-year-old Ambassador Hotel, a landmark
where Charlie Chaplin once lived and where Robert Kennedy was
assassinated, checks out its last guest today and closes its doors.
   Employees and visitors walked the nearly empty lobby Monday as
Christmas decorations were taken down. People snapped pictures and
swapped memories about the hotel, which had once put up the likes of
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and actress Elizabeth Taylor, but
which has lost money in recent years.
   Elvira Bell, a maid, met such stars as Miss Taylor, Lena Horne,
Harry Belafonte, Bing Crosby and Ray Charles during her 31 years at
the hotel. She remembered how a party thrown by singer Don Ho left
pineapple juice in the hallway.
   ``In those days, the music was so loud that it began to run you
crazy,'' said Ms. Bell, 60, who'll now try to collect unemployment
payments. ``Now I miss it. I have dropped tears when I see those
singers on TV. They're getting so old and I wonder, `How about me?'''
   The hotel, which sits on 23.5 acres of expansive greenery on
Wilshire Boulevard, faces an uncertain future, said spokeswoman
Margaret Burk. Two companies are negotiating to buy it, she said.
   The Ambassador dramatically came into the national limelight when
Sen. Robert Kennedy was assassinated there on June 6, 1968. He was
shot to death as he made his way through the hotel's kitchen toward
a news conference moments after declaring victory in California's
Democratic presidential primary.
   But the hotel had been a landmark for years before, thanks in
part to its famous Cocoanut Grove nightclub, where such stars as
Sammy Davis Jr., Nat ``King'' Cole and Bob Hope performed.
   Khrushchev slept at the hotel and newspaper tycoon William
Randolph Hearst entertained there.
   But despite its history, the Ambassador will not have a ceremony
to mark its closing, Ms. Burk said. Management decided against a
party because people have known for two years that the hotel would
be closing.
   Duke Russell, 62, a bellhop at the hotel during the summer of his
freshman year in high school, came back for a last, short visit with
his wife.
   ``I have a good feeling about this place,'' said Russell, now
retired. ``In 1941, this was a rather exciting, elegant, plush
place.''
   Another visitor, Betty Szeden, who first set foot in the
Ambassador 30 years ago as a model in a fashion show, came back
Monday with her husband to catch the bus to the Rose Parade.
   ``It was sad and quiet last night,'' she said. ``But I'm glad to
see it again.''

   Bartender Cy Hunt isn't suggesting that
Walpole drown its latest sorrow in drink, but he's come up with a
mud-colored concoction he says has residents talking about the
town's selection as a landfill.
   It's called a Sludge Deluxe Frappe, and it's been on the menu at
the Barleycorn Pub in the center of town since Dec. 21 when the
state announced its selection of Walpole as a landfill for the
millions of tons of sludge to come from the cleanup of Boston Harbor.
   The town, which is already home to the state's maximum security
prison and neighbor to a minimum-security institution, hopes to
reverse a final vote on the landfill question on Wednesday.
   ``People here don't want the sludge,'' said Hunt, who has tended
bar at the Barleycorn for five years. ``This is a way to get them to
talk more about it.''
   The $3.75 drink is a mixture of a coffee and Irish liqueurs
topped with shredded coconut and chocolate jimmies.
   ``Everybody gets a laugh out of it,'' said Hunt, ``but it also
gets them talking about the problem.''

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities say they have legally
registered a Polish-U.S. friendship organization in what appears the
government's first official approval of such a group.
   At least two other organizations seeking to promote Polish-U.S.
relations have attempted to gain legal status since 1987, but were
denied permission.
   The Poland-USA Association, registered in the western city of
Poznan, will be allowed to operate nationwide, the state-run PAP
news agency said in a dispatch Monday. Its goal will be to
familiarize Poles with current social, economic and political issues
in the United States.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Warsaw said the embassy was aware of
the group.
   As part of planned political reforms, the government of Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has been working on a draft law to
make it easier for individuals to form private associations.
   Poland has friendship societies with at least 45 other countries,
ranging from Iceland to Libya to Canada and the Soviet Union.
   A thaw in U.S.-Polish relations since early 1987 has led to the
lifting of sanctions Washington imposed on the Warsaw government
after it stifled the Solidarity free trade union movement in a
December 1981 military crackdown.

<HEAD>Fog Covers Eastern United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Dense fog and freezing drizzle covered the nation's eastern half
today, and light snow fell over northern border states from Maine to
North Dakota.
   Fog was so thick Monday on Lake Pontchartrain that Louisiana
police closed the 26-mile causeway to New Orleans.
   Advisories for dense fog were in effect today for central
Florida, southern Louisiana, Houston, San Antonio, Texas; Arkansas;
and Bakersfield, Calif.
   Freezing drizzle made bridges and overpasses slick in the Topeka,
Kan., area and glazed roads around Pocatello, Idaho.
   In six hours overnight, an inch of snow fell in International
Falls, Minn.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Limestone, Maine; Hibbing, Minn.; and
Rome, N.Y.
   Light rain fell from northern Mississippi to the Tennessee Valley
and North Carolina and in the Pacific Northwest. Clear skies
prevailed from the central and southern Rockies to much of
California.
   Winds were gusty again along the east slopes of the Rockies. Fort
Collins, Colo., recorded gusts of 60 to 70 mph Monday night.
   A low-pressure system over the northern Plains was partly
responsible for Colorado's high winds, and was expected to spread
snow over the Great Lakes area and north Atlantic Coast states as it
heads east today and Wednesday.
   A snow advisory was in effect for much of Ohio today, and a
winter storm watch was posted for tonight for northern New Jersey
and the New York City area.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the Great Lakes to the
upper Ohio Valley and New Jersey; rain from the middle Atlantic
Coast states to the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and the lower
Mississippi Valley, and in the Pacific Northwest, with some snow in
eastern Washington state.
   High temperatures were forecast in the teens and 20s from the
northern Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and
northern New England; 20s over sections of Nevada; 50s and 60s from
the California coast to the southern Rockies, Oklahoma, the northern
half of Texas, Arkansas, the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Atlantic Coast; 70s from the southern half of Texas to the Gulf
Coast and northern and central Florida; 80s in southern Florida and
the southern tip of Texas; and 30s and 40s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees below zero at Sault Sainte Marie, Mich., to 73 degrees at
McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.

   Farmers lamented the loss of scores of
animals as emergency officials tallied the damage from the wall of
water that swept down the Virgin River after a dike broke, flooding
50 homes and 100 apartments.
   ``We lost 114 pigs,'' Ron Cannon said Monday. ``We only found 33
alive. The rest have floated away.''
   On Don Taylor's 40-acre farm, the New Year's Day flood in
southwest Utah washed out roads, moved buildings and sheds off their
foundations and left 27 cows, two calves, four horses, a goat and
the family cat missing.
   Authorities evacuated 1,500 people before the 12-foot wall of
water surged from the 200-foot-wide gap in the earthen dike at Quail
Creek Reservoir early Sunday. No people were injured, but an
undetermined number of livestock were killed and four bridges were
washed out.
   By Monday, the flow from the broken dike had slowed to a trickle.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter has declared Washington County an emergency
disaster area. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives
arrived Monday to begin determining whether the county will be
declared a national disaster area.
   Such a declaration would make people eligible for federal
reimbursement of up to 75 percent of their losses, said Washington
County Emergency Management Director Tony Hafan. The rest would come
from state and local governments.
   Officials estimate it will take at least six months to design and
rebuild the 2,000-foot-long, 50-foot-high dike. The $3 million dike
was part of a $23.5 million reservoir and dam project 14 miles east
of St. George that was completed three years ago.
   In Washington five miles east of St. George, the bridge
connecting the city with Washington Fields remains out, making a
15-mile detour to get from one city to the other necessary.
   A bridge on Utah 9 connecting Interstate 15 and Hurricane still
stands, but is unusable because highway approaches on either side
were undermined and washed downstream.
   ``About 750 people use that bridge each day to go to work and to
go to school at Dixie College,'' said Hurricane City Manager Rick
Marshel.

   A U.S. sailor approached a cage holding circus
tigers and was attacked through the bars by one of the beasts,
suffering a broken arm and cuts, police said today.
   Circus workers rescued Donald Jude McKaig when they heard his

   McKaig, 26, a sailor on the amphibious cargo ship St. Louis,
climbed over a 6{-foot-high fence late Monday to approach the cage
where six tigers were kept for a circus in Sasebo on Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu.
   McKaig was taken to a hospital at the U.S. Naval Base in Sasebo,
where the St. Louis is based, and later was transferred to a U.S.
Naval hospital in Yokosuka, 27 miles southwest of Tokyo, the
official said.
   Police said he suffered a broken arm and cuts.
   McKaig's hometown was not available immediately.

<HEAD>Utah, Montana Governors Sworn In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two governors began work today, an incumbent in Utah and a
Republican in Montana who was the first GOP candidate to win that
state's highest office in 20 years.
   In Salt Lake City, Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter, who barely
survived a three-way gubernatorial election in November, began his
second term as the state's 13th governor. Val Oveson, the incumbent
lieutenant governor also was sworn in during Monday's ceremony.
   Stan Stephens, a former Montana state senator who moved to the
state from Canada 40 years ago to harvest wheat, took his oath in
Helena after Allen Kolstad, a farmer-businessman from Chester and
also a former state senator, was sworn in as lieutenant governor.
   Bangerter, who trailed Democrat Ted Wilson by more than 30
percentage points in the polls this past summer, rallied to claim a
40-38 percent victory over Wilson. Independent Merrill Cook had 22
percent.
   Bangerter, 55, said he followed the advice of the late British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill: ``Never give in, never give in,
never, never give in, except to convictions of honor or good sense.''
   Bangerter was sworn in before a crowd of 1,400 at the Capitol
Rotunda.
   Stephens, 59, told the inaugural audience at the Capitol in
Helena that he assumes the job of chief executive with a ``deep
sense of responsibility'' knowing of the troubles that beset Montana.
   ``The Montana economy has been depressed,'' Stephens said. ``We
have endured the ravages of drought and forest fires and of being
perceived negatively on the barometric scales of business and
commerce.
   ``Montana's spirit has been bruised, but never broken,'' he said.
   Stephens, who portrayed himself as a harbinger of change during
his two-year campaign, pledged that change will be for the better.

   The U.S. dollar was lower in modest European
trading today, pressured by sporadic selling in Asian and European
markets. Gold prices rose on the dollar's weakness.
   ``We see commercial interests selling dollars that are coming out
of the Far East,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank in
Frankfurt.
   Frankfurt and Milan dealers said trading volume was likely to
stay moderate until the New York market opens.
   ``There's no real hard news to trade on,'' said one trader in
Milan.
   In Tokyo, markets were closed for an extended New Year holiday.
In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 123.80 yen, down from 125.10 yen
in Tokyo last Friday.
   The British pound jumped nearly two cents against the dollar,
apparently boosted by government assurances that it will keep
raising interest rates if necessary to combat inflation.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.7615 West German marks, down from 1.7725
   _ 1.4925 Swiss francs, down from 1.5025
   _ 6.0185 French francs, down from 6.0600
   _ 1.98875 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0020
   _ 1,299.50 Italian lire, down from 1,305.25
   _ 1.1895 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.826, from $1.8062 late
Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.30 a troy ounce, up
from $410.05 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413.30, up from $411 dollars bid
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 70 cents to close at a bid
$414.11, compared with Saturday's $413.41.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.07 a troy

   Police shot, wounded and captured a man sought
in a double slaying and the abduction of a couple, but another
suspect escaped, authorities said.
   Edward Furnace, 23, was arrested Monday at an apartment in Van
Nuys about 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, police Lt.
William Hall said.
   Officers staking out the apartment fired when Furnace let himself
inside while carrying a semiautomatic rifle and refused to drop the
weapon, Hall said.
   He was booked for investigation of murder at the jail ward of
County-USC Medical Center after treatment at another hospital for a
gunshot wound to the thigh, Hall said.
   Police aided by a tracking dogs searched nearby buildings for the
other suspect, but were unable to find him, Officer Bill Frio said.
   On Sunday night, the two men fired shots at four other men at an
apartment building in Van Nuys, police said.
   One of the victims, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, died at
the scene, and his 28-year-old companion died at a hospital a short
time later, Officer George Moreno said.
   Their identities were withheld until relatives could be notified,
Hall said.
   Timothy Brown, 24, was in stable condition at Northridge
Community Hospital with a gunshot wound to the back, Hall said. An
18-year-old man who was with the three wounded men escaped gunfire
by ducking under a car, then running away.
   ``The investigation revealed that the same two suspects, just
prior to the shooting incident, had come to the apartment building
and accosted two other victims at gunpoint,'' Moreno said. The armed
men took the man and woman to a vacant apartment, then left the
couple unharmed.

<HEAD>Try A Lasorda With Reagan, But Hold The Schwarzenegger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In more than one unfriendly ballpark, Dodger
manager Tommy Lasorda has probably been called chopped liver.
   But fried mozzarella? Or escarole and beans? Or littleneck clams
in a garlic pesto sauce over linguine? (Try shouting that last one
with a mouthful of peanuts).
   Lasorda has been called all of these and more, not from the
stands, but on the menus of various Southern California eateries
that have honored him and other celebrities by naming foods after
them.
   While restaurateurs find the rotund manager of Los Angeles' World
Series champion baseball team one of their favorite people to name a
food after, a number of other notables have also been bestowed such
honors.
   For example:
   _The Ronald Reagan is a baked ham and Swiss cheese triple-decker
sandwich at the Legends of Hollywood delicatessen; a liverwurst and
bologna triple-decker at the Stage; and a roast beef, ham and
American cheese hero at the Substation.
   _The Arnold Schwarzenegger is a triple-decked turkey, liver and
salami sandwich at Legends of Hollywood; a No. 518 Muscle Sandwich
with avocados, vegetables, cheese and mushrooms on whole wheat at
Larry Parker's Beverley Hills 24-Hour Diner; and an omelet filled
with Swiss cheese and chopped tomatoes at the Ocean Park Omelette
Parlor in Santa Monica.
   Having a meal named after them doesn't seem to be too hard to
swallow for some celebrities.
   Just ask Dick Clark, who's a sandwich piled high with turkey at
the Stage.
   ``Turkey is good for you, what can I say,'' Clark said. ``I'm
honored to be in the presence of the Tommy Lasorda chopped liver,
but I'm a little disappointed they gave the peanut butter and jelly
to David Letterman.''

   Six weeks before the promised Soviet
withdrawal of all troops from Afghanistan, members of the Kabul
government have moved dependents to new homes near the Soviet
border, Western diplomats said today.
   The diplomats also said the country's ruling Peoples Democratic
Party is changing its name and that of its newspaper in an effort to
broaden its appeal and remove references to the bloody 1978
revolution it rode to power.
   The moves coincide with the exodus of Soviet civilian advisers
from the Afghan capital and warnings from foreign embassies that
their nationals leave the country unless they have essential
business, the diplomats said.
   Under U.N.-mediated accords, half of the roughly 100,000 Soviet
troops that had been in Afghanistan fighting Moslem guerrillas left
the country by Aug. 15 and the balance are to be out by Feb. 15.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan to prop up the government
in 1979.
   In the western part of the country, the Soviet pullout has begun
from Shindad and Herat, said the Islamabad-based diplomats, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. They quoted Afghan officials as
saying the the main military withdrawal will begin Jan. 15.
   The diplomats said senior members of the Peoples Democratic Party
of Afghanistan have been allocated apartments in Mazar-e-Sharief,
165 miles northeast of Kabul. Most of them have sent their
dependents and household goods to town near the Soviet border.
   The Special Guard, which protects party and government officials,
has increased to at least 4,000 members and is expected to rise to
20,000 to withstand guerrilla attacks when the Soviets leave, the
diplomats said.
   Special Aeroflot flights have taken Soviet advisers from the
capital, and the Soviet Embassy has been reduced to about 100
workers, the diplomats said.
   The ruling party will change its name to the Liberal, Democratic
and National Party and adopt ``free market policies along the lines
of Western Social Democratic parties,'' said one Western diplomat,
citing Afghan sources.
   The name of the party newspaper has been changed from Truth of
the April Revolution to the more moderate Message, diplomats said.
   ``The symbolism of junking the name of the (April 1978)
revolution ... is probably only the first in a series of steps
designated to paper over the image of the (party) as a revolutionary
communist party,'' another diplomat said.
   A cease-fire President Najib offered on New Year's Day has been
ignored by guerrillas and by government troops.
   State-run radio said 82 people _ including 79 guerrillas _ were
killed and 40 wounded in fighting Sunday and Monday. It said the
three others were civilians. There was no independent confirmation.
   Western diplomats reported that 132 people were killed in heavy
bombing by the Soviet and Afghan air force just north of Kabul on
Dec. 26 and Dec. 27.
   The diplomats estimated that 100 guerrillas, 20 civilians, and 12
government troops were killed in the bombing.
   Anti-communist guerrillas also have renewed attacks on other
government-held cities. Tass today reported that security forces
uncovered a guerrilla storehouse in the capital with 84 rockets,
grenades and more than 300 rifles.

   An 88-year-old retired fruit picker who
authorities said had trouble getting along with others is accused of
using his walking cane to beat two fellow retirement home residents
to death.
   Henry Thomas was arrested Sunday night, his cane and clothes
splattered with blood.
   One of Thomas' roommates, Max Nickbarge, 90, was slain early
Sunday. Also killed was 73-year-old Myrtle Smith. Four others
suffered injuries ranging from a fractured skull to broken bones and
cuts.
   Nine people lived at Reflections I, a small wood-frame house
about 30 miles northeast of Tampa, and Thomas shared a 10-by-9-foot
room with two others.
   Thomas did not get along with the other residents, said Dade City
Police Chief Phil Thompson.
   ``There was some bitterness in the home between our suspect, Mr.
Thomas, and the other residents of the home,'' Thompson said.
``Evidently, that bitterness ... had been building. Evidently, in
the early-morning hours of New Year's Day, this thing came to a head
and Mr. Thomas took his action.''
   The owner of the home, Helen Tear, said Thomas would get angry at
Nickbarge for picking things up and moving them around in the house.
She said he also got angry when his roommates squabbled.
   The bodies were discovered by staff members.
   ``We feel the murder weapon involved is the cane of Mr. Thomas,''
Thompson said. ``It is a heavy, oak-type cane.''
   Thomas was being held without bond in the Pasco County Detention
Center Monday. He is charged with two counts of first-degree murder,
and charges were being prepared in the injuries to the four other
residents, Thompson said.

<HEAD>Trevor Tutu Arrested Outside Courthouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today handcuffed and
arrested Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu, for
failing to appear in court for traffic violations.
   The arrest came minutes after the 32-year-old son of the black
Anglican church leader faced a court on another charge.
   Tutu shouted at police during his arrest and urged his immediate
release. ``I have already been threatened with death,'' he told
reporters.
   The arrest came after he appeared in Kempton Park Magistrate's
Court because of remarks he allegedly made to police Dec. 31 when
they told him not to leave his luggage unattended at an airport.
   Police have not said what remarks he may have made, and the court
case was postponed until Feb. 15.
   As Tutu left the courthouse, police handcuffed and arrested him
on charges of failing to appear in court for three traffic
violations. He was then taken to Johannesburg Magistrate's Court.
   While he was being arrested, Tutu called one superintendent a
``stupid hooligan.''
   He was questioned at the second courthouse and taken to police
headquarters for investigation of other possible charges. He told
reporters he intended bringing an urgent court action for his
release and protection from possible police violence.
   Trevor Tutu is the eldest of four children of Archbishop Tutu,
leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning.
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
being cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was
briefly detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the
detention of black children.
   The Dec. 31 incident began when police told him not to leave his
luggage unattended at Jan Smuts Airport.
   Police have warned South Africans not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas, which has killed 35 people and injured
more than 660 in the past 2{ years.

   Peter Bogdanovich has married the younger sister
of Dorothy Stratten, a murdered Playboy playmate with whom
Bogdanovich was once romantically linked, the movie director's
lawyer said.
   Bogdanovich, 49, whose films include ``The Last Picture Show,''
``Paper Moon,'' and ``Mask,'' married Louise Hoogstratten, 20, also
known as L.B. Stratten, near Vancouver, Canada, on Friday, said
attorney Joel R. Junker of Seattle.
   Dorothy Stratten, the 1980 Playmate of the Year who acted in one
of Bogdanovich's films, was shot to death by her estranged husband,
Paul Snider, in August 1980 in California. The killing reportedly
occurred after Snider learned his wife was having an affair with
Bogdanovich. Snider committed suicide after killing Stratten.
   Nelly Hoogstratten, Louise's mother, told Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. Television that she was not informed about the wedding.
   ``I've cried before, and I cry now because I've lost another
daughter,'' she said when interviewed on the doorstep of her home in
Vancouver.
   In his book ``The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten,
1960-1980,'' Bogdanovich said Hugh Hefner's Playboy empire played a
role in her death.
   He also claimed Hefner demeaned Stratten.
   Bogdanovich wrote of how he was captivated by Dorothy Stratten,
whom he directed in the movie ``They All Laughed,'' a comedy with
John Ritter, Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazzara, and quoted her as
expressing distaste for the lifestyle of at the Playboy mansion.
   He once called her ``the noblest person I ever met.''
   She was the subject of the 1983 movie ``Star 80,'' and the 1981
television movie ``Death of a Centerfold.''
   In the mid-1980s, stories surfaced referring to a relationship
between Bogdanovich and Stratten's younger sister.
   The younger Stratten later filed a slander lawsuit against Hefner
and Burl Eldridge, who was married to her mother from May 1980 to
January 1981.
   The lawsuit contended Hefner and Eldridge falsely told reporters
Bogdanovich had seduced Louise Stratten when she was 13 and had sex
with her mother after Stratten was killed.
   The lawsuit also contended Hefner and Eldridge falsely claimed
Bogdanovich had paid for Louise Stratten to have plastic surgery to
make her look more like her late sister.
   She dropped the lawsuit in August 1985 and Bogdanovich said at
the time he hoped that resolution would end his feud with Hefner.

   A nephew of the late President Gamal Abdel
Nasser today returned home to stand trial for complicity in
terrorist attacks on Israeli and U.S. diplomats. He was arrested
upon his arrival.
   Police apprehended Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser at Cairo
International Airport after he stepped off a flight from London, the
government's Middle East News Agency reported.
   He was dressed in winter clothes when officers brought him into
the courtroom for today's resumption of the trial, which involves 20
defendants.
   The 20 are alleged to belong to a group called Egypt's
Revolution. Among them is President Nasser's eldest son, Khaled, who
remains a fugitive.
   Prosecutors allege Egypt's Revolution launched attacks from 1984
to 1987 in which two Israeli diplomats were killed and six wounded.
Two U.S. diplomats suffered minor injuries.
   Khaled Nasser and 10 co-defendants are charged with murder,
undermining Egypt's security and damaging relations with the United
States and Israel. The indictment demands the death penalty for them.
   The remaining nine defendants, including Gamal Nasser, are
charged with complicity in the attacks. The indictment requests
prison terms of up to 25 years for them.
   All the defendants are in custody excetp Khaled Nasser, who was
in Yugoslavia when the indictment was returned and has refused to
come to Egypt for the trial, which began in November.
   Egypt's Revolution claimed responsibility for the attacks in
statements that opposed Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel,
criticized the United States and professed the pan-Arab philosophy
nurtured by the late president.

   Volunteers labored to save 1,400 sea
birds contaminated by one of the worst oil spills in the Pacific
Northwest as other workers collected more than 2,000 dead waterfowl
to prevent eagles and other predators from poisoning themselves.
   Meanwhile, cleanup crews planned to return by helicopter today to
clean remote wilderness beaches of oil globs from a barge that
collided with the tugboat towing it Dec. 22, spilling as much as
231,000 gallons of fuel oil off Grays Harbor.
   Oil from the spill has been found along almost 300 miles of
Pacific beaches, reaching as far north as Canada's Vancouver Island
and as far south as Newport, Ore.
   More than 4,800 sea birds have been contaminated, and more than
half of them have died, said Ron Holcomb of the state Department of
Ecology.
   A cleanup center in Ocean Shores has received about 2,500 birds,
of which 540 died, Holcomb said. Cleanup work also continued on a
smaller scale at a second center in Astoria, Ore.
   Holcomb said 15 cleaned birds were released Monday along Hood
Canal, a saltwater inlet 60 miles inland.
   Other volunteers have collected more than 2,000 dead birds to
prevent eagles and other predators from eating them. Washington has
the largest wintering eagle population in the 48 contiguous states.
   The beach cleanup crews worked Monday in areas 70 miles to 90
miles north of Grays Habor. Cleanup operations on remote wilderness
and Indian reservation beaches required the use of helicopters, said
Olympic National Park's chief ranger, Chuck Janda.
   ``It's probably safe to state there's hardly an area of the
park's 60 miles of coastline that hasn't been impacted in some way
by oil, as either evidenced by birds coming ashore or the globules
of oil,'' Janda said.

   The body of a woman missing for more than
three years was discovered by a daughter in a locked freezer in the
family home near here, police said.
   A suspect was arrested and was expected to be charged today in
the death of Dorothy Tyburski, 37, who was reported missing in
October 1985, said police Sgt. Erne Sayre. The suspect's name was
not released.
   Tyburski's clothed, frozen body was found Monday by a daughter,
Kelly, 20, who pried the lock off the freezer in the basement of her
mother's home, Sayre said.
   The cause of Tyburski's death was undetermined, Sayre said. An
autopsy will be performed.
   Investigators searched for Tyburski for about two years, but
dropped the case because of a lack of leads, Sayre said.
   Tyburski lived with her husband, Leonard, who is dean of students
at Mackenzie High School in Detroit, and the couple's two daughters
before she vanished, police said.
   Plymouth is about 25 miles west of Detroit.

   Sweden and Poland have reached agreement
on the border dividing their territorial waters in the Baltic, the
Foreign Ministry said today.
   The agreement, which followed 10 years of negotiations, will be
signed shortly when Foreign Minister Sten Andersson visits Warsaw,
the Svenska Dagbladet daily said.
   Sweden will get 75 percent of the 200-square-mile area, which was
under negotiation for 10 years, the ministry said in a statement.
The area is southeast of the Swedish island of Gotland.
   In January 1988, Sweden and the Soviet Union resolved a similar
dispute over 5,400 square miles.
   ``It's extremely satisfying that we have been able to reach an
agreement with yet another country concerning the division of the
Baltic,'' Andersson said in a statement.
   ``The agreement means that we have clarified the fishing rights
and the exploitation of other riches from a very important part of
the Baltic,'' he said.
   Sweden and Finland still are disputing Baltic territorial waters.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of President Saddam Hussein
plans to relax restrictions on foreigners wishing to visit Iraq, an
official publication reported today.
   The weekly magazine Al-Ittihad said Hussein signed a decree Dec.
26 loosening requirements to enter the country. It magazine, which
is published by the Federation of the Chamber of Commerce, did not
give specifics.
   An official source, who requested anonymity, said that once the
decree takes effect, most Arab nationals and many other foreigners
will be allowed to enter Iraq without visas. He did not elaborate.
   Any foreigner who wishes to travel to Iraq now needs a visa, for
which an application must be sent to Baghdad, cleared by the Foreign
Ministry and approved by an embassy.
   The decree will become effective only after it is officially
published, and the source said he did not know when that will occur.
   The move will not affect Iraqis, who will need government
permission to leave the country.
   Hussein embarked on a liberalization campaign after the
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war took effect
Aug. 20. He announced in November that the formation of additional
political parties will be allowed after 20 years of single-party
rule by his Baath Arab Socialist Party.

<HEAD>Scientists Begin Probe of Ozone Loss Over Arctic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA research plane took off for the Arctic
today on the first flight of a six-week search for signs that the
Earth is losing its protective ozone layer over the region.
   The high-altitude ER-2 airplane departed from Sola Air Base at
the west coast city of Stavanger, where the project is based, to
analyze the atmospheric layer 12 miles above the planet's surface.
   Many of the 150 Americans and Europeans in the $10 million
project are veterans of a 1987 expedition that documented an ``ozone
hole'' over Antarctica.
   For several years, experts have warned that man-made chemicals,
especially chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerators, aerosol cans,
cleaning processes and in making plastic foam, were destroying the
ozone layer.
   Ozone protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays,
and studies have shown that a decline in the ozone can lead to
increases in skin cancer and eye damage.
   Scientists at Sola say the Arctic hole appears to be smaller than
the one over Antarctica, but could be more dangerous because it is
closer to where more people live.
   Last March, an international group reported evidence that ozone
also is being lost in other places, especially in northern latitudes
where Europe and North America have high populations.
   ``The idea here is to look at what happens not only in the
vortex, but what consequences it could have for the ozone at lower
latitudes,'' Ivar Isaksen, a University of Oslo professor, said
before the project began.
   The vortex is a swirl of westerly winds over the Arctic. The
project, sponsored by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is also aimed at exploring stratospheric clouds that
form near the vortex and find out what role they play in ozone loss.
   The ER-2, a modern version of the U-2 spy plane, will be
supplemented by a modified DC-8 flying at lower altitudes. The
planes, carrying a variety of measuring instruments, will fly 10 to
12 missions in the area between northern Norway, Greenland and the
North Pole.
   Weather balloons will also be sent up, and scientists working in
a hangar at the Norwegian air base will compile and analyze the data
through a computer network.
   The scientists may release preliminary findings when the project
ends in mid-February, but complete results will not be available
until after several months of study and discussion, said Dr. Adrian
Tuck, a project chemist and meteorologist.

<HEAD>New Homes, Government Push Construction Spending Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An increase in single-family home building and
government projects pushed construction spending up by 0.8 percent
in November, the third consecutive monthly gain, the government said
today.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$411.1 billion in November, following a 0.2 percent rise in October
and a 0.9 percent jump in September.
   Even with the gains, construction activity as a whole was up only
a lackluster 1 percent for the first 11 months of 1988, compared
with the same period of 1987. The figures are not adjusted for
inflation.
   Rising interest rates have dampened activity in most sectors.
Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 10.77 percent during the last
week of 1988, the highest in 13{ months.
   Apartment and office building construction in particular have
been sluggish, held back by high vacancy rates in many parts of the
country, especially the Southwest.
   In November, residential construction rose 0.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $200.4 billion, reflecting a 2.3 percent gain in
single-family home building. Apartment construction dropped 1.9
percent.
   Non-residential construction dropped 0.8 percent in October,
falling to an annual rate of $92.3 billion. Declines in office
building and in commercial projects such as shopping centers more
than wiped out gains in hotel and motel construction and in
industrial buildings.
   Hotel and motel building was up 6.6 percent and factory
construction rose 1.3 percent. The industrial sector has been one of
the strongest this year as manufacturers expand capacity to meet
demand generated by a boom in export sales.
   Office construction posted a 2.5 percent decline in November,
while commercial projects dropped 2.2 percent.
   Government construction climbed 4 percent to an annual rate of
$81 billion, reflecting increased spending for schools, sewer
systems and roads. Highway construction, the largest government
category, rose 2.7 percent in November to an annual rate of $26.6
billion.

   A Swedish appeals court today rejected a
request for immediate release by a suspect accused of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme.
   A court clerk said the three-judge panel ruled unanimously that
Christer Pettersson, 41, will remain in custody until Jan. 13, when
prosecutors must formally charge him, seek a second extension or
release him.
   Palme, Sweden's four-term prime minister, was shot on the night
of Feb. 28, 1986, walking home from a movie in Stockholm.
   Pettersson, who has a history of violent and petty crimes and
psychiatric treatment, was arrested Dec. 14 after the largest
manhunt in Sweden's history.
   Newspapers and the two national television networks have reported
that he was identified by as many as three witnesses as being at the
scene of the shooting.
   Prosecutors have released virtually no information about their
case, and neither Pettersson's name nor picture has been published
in Sweden in keeping with Swedish press regulations.

   Bomb threats forced unscheduled landings at
airports in Switzerland and Italy and delayed two departures from
Geneva, authorities said today.
   The Scandinavian airline SAS, prompted by a bomb threat
reportedly from an Iranian Shiite Moslem group, maintained the
highest alert in its history, causing flight delays for a third day.
   Airlines have been especially sensitive to threats since a bomb
exploded aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet on Dec. 21, killing 270 people on
board and in the Scottish village of Lockerbie.
   ``In most cases, such calls prove to be a hoax,'' said Peter
Gutknecht, spokesman at Kloten airport. ``But we have to take every
threat seriously.''
   An Alitalia DC-9 was on a flight from Paris to Venice when the
pilot was told by Munich air controllers of an anonymous bomb threat
and decided to land at Kloten airport in Zurich, Switzerland. The
flight continued early today after a search.
   A Tunis Air Boeing 737, on a flight from Geneva to Tunis, took
off today morning following a 10-hour stopover at Milan's Malpensa
airport during which Italian bomb disposal experts determined no
explosives were aboard.
   Another anonymous threat forced about 30 passengers of an
Istanbul-bound Pan Am Boeing 727 to spend the night at Geneva
hotels. Their flight continued this morning after the plane was
searched.
   The departure of a 727 of the British charter airline Dan Air
with about 170 British children returning from a Swiss holiday was
delayed by several hours Monday after Geneva police received a
telephone call from a man who said security forces had 15 minutes to
evacuate the plane. Police said the caller identified himself as a
member of the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end
British rule of Northern Ireland.
   The plane was searched, but no bomb was found.
   Passengers flying Scandinavian Airlines System from some 90
airports worldwide were asked to identify their luggage before it
was loaded onto planes, and cargo was undergoing extra scrutiny, SAS
officials said.
   Domestic fliers in Sweden took their own baggage to the aircraft,
and unattended bags were hustled into secure areas and x-rayed.
   SAS spokesman Knut Lovstuhagen said delays were ``minimal _ up to
30 minutes.''
   The heightened security measures began Sunday after a telephone
caller told police in Budapest on New Year's Eve that SAS would be
the target of a bomb attempt.
   In Manila, Philippine Airlines today released the names of four
people that officials say may be members of a Palestinian faction
planning to hijack or blow up an Asian airliner this month.
   Airline spokesman Rollie Estabillio said the four are believed to
be members of a Palestine Liberation Organization faction led by Abu
Musa, who is supported by Syria and Libya. Estabillio said the names
were provided by Japanese authorities.

   Torture murderer Gary Heidnik, on death row
since July, took an overdose of anti-psychotic medicine and is
hospitalized in critical condition, his psychiatrist said.
   ``He may not survive,'' said Dr. Clancy D. McKenzie. ``He's on a
respirator. If he does survive this, he could have severe liver
damage or brain damage, and he could die of the side effects.''
   Heidnik, 45, a self-proclaimed minister, was convicted of
murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in a
basement torture chamber in his Philadelphia home.
   Lt. William Balzer, spokesman at the State Correctional
Institution at Pittsburgh, said a guard found Heidnik unconscious in
his cell about 3 a.m. Sunday.
   Heidnik remained in critical but stable condition today at West
Penn Hospital, prison spokesman Tom Seiverling said. He declined to
elaborate. A hospital spokeswoman referred all calls to the
penitentiary.
   Though prison officials would give few details, McKenzie said
Monday that doctors at West Penn told him Heidnik took an overdose
of Thorazine, which he probably had been stockpiling for three
months.
   Heidnik was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, rape,
aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.
   Arguments were scheduled for Feb. 9 on post-trial motions and
sentencing of Heidnik on 16 other charges.
   McKenzie, who contended prison officials refused to allow him to
treat Heidnik, also questioned the medical care the inmate received
in prison before the suicide attempt.
   ``With a history of more than 15 suicide attempts, many of them
with Thorazine, I would have been very careful to make sure he
wasn't stockpiling them,'' McKenzie said.

<HEAD>British Foreign Secretary Urges Israel To Match PLO Diplomacy</HEAD>
<UNK>By ABDUL-JALIL MUSTAFA</UNK>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary,
urged Israel to give a ``matching response'' to Yasser Arafat's
peace overtures and said British officials hoped to meet PLO leaders
next week.
   Howe, who today wound up a two-day visit to Kuwait, also said he
would ask Arab states to help locate the terrorists responsible for
the Dec. 21 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland that killed
270 people.
   The British foreign secretary spoke to reporters after meeting
with the Emir of Kuwait and Kuwait's foreign minister.
   Howe said William Waldegrave, Britain's deputy foreign secretary,
will visit Tunis next week and ``hopefully he will have the
opportunity to meet with PLO leaders.''
   Last month, Waldegrave met in London with Bassam Abu Sharif, PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat's media adviser, for the first high-level
contact between Britain and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The United States last month lifted a 13-year ban on the PLO and
agreed to initiate a dialogue with Arafat after he explicitly
recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   ``We have welcomed the recent statements by the Palestine
leadership ... We must all now look to the new government of Israel
to make a matching response,'' Howe said. ``We will certainly go on
urging that message on the prime minister of Israel, Mr. (Yitzhak)
Shamir.''
   He said the message was based on ``the right of Israel to a
secure existence and the right of the Palestinian people to self
determination.''
   Howe said his talks with the Kuwaiti leaders covered ``a lot of
bilateral and regional issues.
   ``We have, of course, discussed our cooperation on security
matters,'' he said.
   ``I know that our friends in the gulf will do all they can to
help us identify those responsible (for the Pan Am bombing), for
there must be no safe haven for people responsible for such wicked
actions,'' Howe said.
   Commenting on U.S. allegations that Western nations helped build
a chemical weapons plant in Libya, Howe dismissed as ``speculation''
reports the United States was preparing military action against the
alleged plant.
   ``As far as the report of chemical warfare capabilities in Libya
is concerned, we find any report of that kind very disturbing,'' he
added.
   Howe is on a six-nation tour that will also take him to Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, North Yemen and Djibouti.

<TEXT>
   The home of country music is singing the
blues after the sale of its last locally owned music publising
company to CBS Records.
   Tree International Publishing, ranked as Billboard magazine's No.
1 country music publisher for the last 16 years, is being sold to
New York-based CBS for a reported $45 million to $50 million, The
Tennessean reported today.
   The company, whose catalog of music copyrights includes more than
35,000 songs by such artists as Willie Nelson, Buck Owens, Merle
Haggard, Harlan Howard and Roger Miller, was the last major
publishing property in the city that had not been acquired by an
out-of-town conglomerate.
   `I'm saddened by the whole thing,'' said Roger Sovine, the
Nashville head of Broadcast Music Inc. and a former Tree executive.
``It's the end of an era.''
   But company officials defended the sale as being good for the
city.
   ``Nashville will be the headquarters for all CBS publishing,''
said Tree International owner Buddy Killen. ``This is great for
Nashville.
   ``We're going to quadruple the size of Tree very quickly.''
   Killen, 52, said he will be president of CBS-Tree Publishing.
Tree vice president Donna Hilley will be chief operating officer.
   Country Music Foundation executive director Bill Ivey said the
sale was sad, ``but it's also a final step in a trend that has been
going on for decades.''
   In the 1980s, such companies as Acuff-Rose, Cedarwood, House of
Gold and Combine Music also went to out-of-town conglomerates.
   ``This is the loss of what has historically been Nashville's area
of financial control. We're substituting control in New York or Los
Angeles. And it's not a fair trade in any sense,'' Ivey said.
   He described the new character of Music Row as ``colonial
operations in every segment of the industry.''
   CBS Records President Tommy Mottola called the sale ``a marriage
of two highly compatible partners.''
   ``It's fitting that country music's leading publisher be united
under the same roof with the leading record company in the world,''
he said.
   But Sovine said it will not be the same.
   ``The big conglomerates can't work with songwriters in the same
way that Buddy did with Tree. He created a place for people to make
music. He was the best and I hate to see it go away.''

   Princess Diana, her two sons, mother and two
sisters flew to Antigua today for a weeklong vacation in the
Caribbean.
   Police and bodyguards kept photographers from taking pictures of
Diana, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, as they boarded a
British Airways flight at Heathrow Airport.
   The princess and her children were traveling with her mother,
Frances Shand-Kydd, and sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady
Jane Fellowes.
   A spokesman at the Antigua and Barbuda High Commission in London,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the princess and her
family were headed for the island of Tortola in the British Virgin
Islands. Buckingham Palace said it could not confirm the report.
   ``This is a private holiday treat which Mrs. Shand-Kydd has
planned for quite some time,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman,
who by custom was not identified.
   During Diana's last holiday in the Caribbean, on the island of
Eleuthera, photographers snapped pictures of the princess as she
sunbathed in a bikini while pregnant with Prince William.
   Diana's husband, Prince Charles, remained at the estate of his
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in Sandringham, where the royal family
celebrated the holidays.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens complained today
that European countries are not consulting Israel about Middle East
peace steps and said Israel is ready to suffer isolation from the
world for the sake of security.
   In the the new foreign minister's first news conference with
foreign correspondents, Arens said Israel does not approve of the
European Community's plan announced Monday to start a Middle East
peace initiative by encouraging an international conference on the
region.
   ``I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of
intitiative, the members of the European Community were to meet with
us, were to consult with us, were to coordinate with us,'' he said.
   Arens, 63, a former ambassador to the United States, also renewed
Israel's criticism that the U.S. decision to hold talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization was damaging the fight against
international terrorism.
   Arens became foreign minister with the formation of Israel's new
government on Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud bloc of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which has opposed an international Middle
East peace conference.
   Arens said his government does not welcome isolation but must
think first of security.
   ``We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease
the sense of isolation ... if they are steps that would endanger the
state of Israel,'' Arens told the Foreign Press Association.
   Meanwhile, Lova Eliav, a member of the center-left Labor Party,
said today he and three other Israeli parliament members will attend
a European symposium this month on Middle East peace alongside PLO
representatives despite Israel's ban on meetings with PLO members.
   ``We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peace
with them through compromise,'' Eliav said. ``The more we speak the
better.''
   The conference, titled ``A European Initiative For Peace in the
Middle East,'' was initiated by several members of the European
Parliament. It will be held in Paris on Jan. 12-13.
   Eliav said the other Israeli lawmakers planning to attend are Ora
Namir, also of the Labor Party, Yair Tsaban, leader of the socialist
Mapam Party, and Shulamit Aloni, head of the Citizens Rights
Movement.
   The PLO is banned in Israel as a terrorist organization. The
Citizens Rights Movement and Mapam have called on the government to
revoke its ban, and public opinion polls indicate the majority of
Israelis support a policy change on this issue.
   Last month the United States launched a dialogue with the PLO
after Chairman Yasser Arafat recognized Israel and renounced
terrorism.

   Children who lost five schoolmates in a New
Year's Day house fire returned to class today after their teachers
were briefed on how to help them cope with their loss.
   Classes at the 147-pupil Remer Elementary School started later
than usual to give teachers time to meet with psychologists,
counselors and clergy members, said Principal Mike Doro.
   The briefing was intended to help teachers cope with the tragedy
that struck this north-central Minnesota town of 400 residents and
to teach them how to help the children, Doro said.
   ``Being a small elementary school, it's like one big family,''
Doro said Monday.
   Eight children, five of them pupils at Remer Elementary, and two
adults were killed early Sunday when the house caught fire as they
slept.
   Investigators said Monday the cause of the blaze may never be
known.
   ``The extent of the fire makes it very difficult,'' Deputy State
Fire Marshal Elmer Baltes said as he surveyed the smoldering ruins
of the home.
   Possible causes include a wood-burning stove, electrical
problems, smoking, a Christmas tree and children playing with
matches, Baltes said.
   Arson has been ruled out, and an oil-fueled space heater appeared
to have been turned off and apparently did not cause the fire,
Baltes said.
   The dead were identified as John and Nancy Watson's four children
_ Jenny, 14, Samantha, 11, Edward, 9, and William, 8; Mrs. Watson's
brother-in-law and sister, Jean and Becky Smischney; their two
children _ Jay, 10, and Kimberly, 8 _ and the children of neighbors
_ Robin Bastle, 12, and her sister, Michelle, 10. The Smischneys
were visiting from Bemidji.
   ``I feel so sorry for the Watsons,'' the Bastles' mother, Nancy,
said Monday. ``I have a daughter left; they don't have any
children.''
   Nancy Watson and her husband had been celebrating her 32nd
birthday when the fire broke out early Sunday. When she returned to
find her home in ashes, she became hysterical and tried to run into
the house. She remained hospitalized for observation today.
   Friends and neighbors set up a memorial fund at a bank and jars
in a cafe to accept donations.
   ``In a crisis like this, there will be a lot of people who will
help in any way they can,'' said Doris Berczyk, 61, who was
collecting donations at a cafe she owns.
   The Rev. H.N. Williams of the Remer Alliance Church said churches
were considering a joint memorial service at the school.
   ``In a small town you're touched by everybody,'' resident Valerie
Pound said. ``Everybody will pull together and help any way you can.
Even though it's not going to bring the kids back, the families will
know that everyone in this town is hurt by what happened and is
behind them.''

   Six clergymen went under bridge overpasses and
through city parks to meet the homeless in an overnight visit that
served as a spiritual kickoff to a $1.2 million fund-raising drive.
   The 12-hour look at life on the streets for the city's estimated
20,000 to 25,000 homeless people was enlightening, participants said.
   ``Our tradition addresses the widowed, the homeless and the
downtrodden,'' said Rabbi Shaul Osadchey of Congregation Brith
Shalom in Bellaire, who unsuccessfully tried to sleep on a park
bench. ``I was surprised by the scope of the problem. I wasn't used
to the homeless who are mentally ill.''
   The clergy members, accompanied by United Way president Betty
Beene and Jewish Community Center President Bubba Silberstein, are
leaders in the 1989 Houston Campaign for the Homeless.
   The campaign officially starts Wednesday, but the Sunday night
venture began a spiritual effort for many participants.
   ``God led us to last night's experience,'' said Ms. Beene, a
Southern Baptist. ``And with God's leadership, we can change this
problem.''
   The religious leaders were dropped off at about 1 a.m. Monday at
a gathering spot for the homeless under an elevated freeway near
downtown, where about 40 people have made camp.
   The clergymen spent the rest of the night wandering about the
city, stopping at Tranquillity Park, City Hall and Sam Houston Park.
   ``Most of the homeless you never see,'' said the Rev. Steve
Bancroft of Trinity Episcopal Church. ``The ones who end up on the
street are those who've run out of options.''

   Workers today pulled two more
bodies from the murky waters of Guanabara Bay, raising to 53 the
number of confirmed deaths in the New Year's Eve sinking of a
sightseeing boat.
   One of the bodies found today was identified as that of Paolo
Mantegazza of Turin, Italy, according to Valmir Rabelo of the Fire
Department's Maritime Group. He had been reported missing by the
Italian consulate in Rio.
   The other body, a woman, was not identified immediately.
   Police have said they would seek homicide charges against two
cruise officials and two port guards in connection with the sinking.
Authorities said Monday they were investigating allegations that the
guards were paid to let the boat sail overloaded into choppy waters.
   It was still not clear how many passengers were missing because
cruise operators said the passenger list went down with the 100-foot
flat-bottomed craft. Estimates of those on board ranged from 130 to
150, but it was not known how many were rescued by nearby boats.
   Tables, chairs and a broken wooden staircase on the sunken boat
blocked an underwater search Monday, said Col. Jefferson Cardoso de
Bem, who heads the Fire Department's Maritime Group.
   The double-decked Bateau Mouche was carrying revelers who paid
$220 a ticket to dance, drink and watch fireworks off Copacabana
Beach when it sank Saturday night in about 65 feet of water at the
mouth of Guanabara Bay near Rio's Sugar Loaf mountain.
   The navy released a statement Monday that conflicted with reports
of witnesses who said the boat was overloaded and lacked enough life
jackets.
   The statement said navy inspectors checked the craft on
Wednesday, finding ``satisfactory safety and navigational
conditions'' and ``a number of lifejackets above what was
necessary.''
   The navy statement also confirmed survivors' reports that the
boat was inspected again two hours before it capsized. It said
``there were 149 people aboard ... within a permitted capacity of
153.''
   Precinct police chief Irineu Barroso, who is in charge of the
case, said he would seek homicide charges against the owner of
Itatiaia Turismo, the tourist agency that booked the trip; the owner
of the Sol e Mar restaurant that operated the boat; and two port
authority guards who stopped the boat Saturday then allowed it to
continue its trip.
   Barroso said he would also seek charges of corruption and
accepting bribes against the guards. There have been no arrests in
the case.
   ``After taking statements from survivors, we can see something
was not right,'' Barroso said. ``I believe someone will go to jail
for this.''
   The navy said it would investigate ``rumors of bribes or
negligence'' regarding the patrol boat guards who inspected the boat.
   TV Globo, the country's largest commercial network, said Monday
there were reports of up to 30 more victims trapped inside the
wreckage.
   ``We could find more bodies caught inside the boat,'' de Bem
said. ``But it's hard to tell. No one has an accurate idea how many
survivors there are, and our divers are having problems searching
the boat and the visibility is very bad.''
   Rio de Janeiro state Gov. Wellington Moreira Franco suspended
Itatiaia's Turismo's operating license.

   Jim Bakker returned to the TV pulpit with
his wife for the first time in two years, and blamed his downfall
and subsequent indictment on Satan, not on PTL's sex-and-money
scandal.
   ``I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and Tammy
Bakker,''' he told viewers Monday on the first broadcast of ``The
Jim and Tammy Show.''
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, made no direct pitch for
contributions Monday but on this morning's show Bakker promised a
book in exchange for donations. The hourlong program is scheduled to
run five days a week.
   ``We don't want to raise funds on this program every day,''
Bakker said today, adding that ``for everyone who sends $100, or $25
or more, I want you to have a copy of this `Crisis Book of
Scripture.''' The book contains biblical quotations that can help
readers deal with life crises such as divorce, he said.
   ``We're still believing God will restore Heritage (USA) totally
and back to the lifetime members who built it,'' Bakker said.
   The broadcasts originated in the living room of the Bakkers'
borrowed home and was sent by satellite to a half-dozen stations,
mostly cable, in California, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and
Louisiana, Bakker said.
   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''
Mrs. Bakker said as the show began Monday. She wore her trademark
heavy eye makeup and broke into tears two minutes into the hourlong
show.
   Bakker, 49, and a former top associate were indicted last month
on charges of diverting $4 million in PTL money for their benefit.
   The Bakkers had not preached together on television since January
1987. Two months later, allegations surfaced of his 1980 sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker said his last television show at PTL featured the
groundbreaking for the Crystal Palace Church, a proposed 30,000-seat
church at PTL's Heritage USA. The church was never built and a
federal bankruptcy court last month approved the sale of Heritage
USA to a Canadian businessman.
   Bakker, however, holding a drawing of the glass church, said he
had not given up.
   ``I believe that someday we will still build it,'' Bakker said.
``I believe that was the last straw for Satan. I think the devil was
mad that something so beautiful was being built.''
   Callers to a ``prayer line'' telephone number Monday _ not
toll-free _ were asked to give their name and prayer request but
were not asked directly for funds.
   Bakker frequently referred to the family's recent experience.
   ``You can make it,'' he said. ``If Jim and Tammy can survive
their holocaust of two years, I know God will help you to survive.
There's times when I did not want to live. There's times when I
prayed to die. But I know this: God was always there.''
   It is unknown yet how many people watched the show.
   ``We honestly don't know how many may be carrying it or portions
of it today, because it simply went up on the satellite,'' said the
Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms.
   One city Bakker named as receiving Monday's broadcast did not.
   Steve Burleson, president of Asheville Christian Cable Network,
said he didn't carry the program and hasn't decided whether to
televise it.
   ``I'm all for presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I'm
simply not interested in another wall-to-wall begging program,'' he
said. ``And I think that's the consensus of the viewers here.''

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle resigned from
the Senate today and his successor, Republican Dan Coats, was sworn
in immediately.
   ``Today is the day I officially leave the United States Senate,''
Quayle said at the swearing-in ceremony in his office in the Hart
Office Building. ``It's been eight great years ... (and) I am
looking forward to the challenge of the next eight years.''
   Quayle will be sworn in as vice president Jan. 20.
   Coats was sworn in by Indiana Gov. Robert Orr, who appointed him
to Quayle's seat. Also present at the swearing-in were Mrs. Quayle,
Coats' wife and children, and the state's senior senator, Republican
Richard Lugar.
   ``I am deeply grateful for the governor's confidence in me,''
Coats said. He noted it was Quayle who first drew him into public
service 12 years ago, and Coats worked for Quayle for 3{ years.
``Now he's becoming my boss again as president of the Senate,''
Coats said.
   Quayle's only public advice to his successor was to work hard.
Quayle said he has not decided how much time he will spend in his
capacity as Senate president after he takes office as vice president.

   A member on Michigan Democratic Rep. Bob Carr's
staff helped plaster the nation's capital with posters urging the
ouster of Washington Mayor Marion Barry, a spokesman for the
congressman said today.
   District of Columbia police said the ``Dump Barry'' signs first
appeared Monday morning, after a week in which the mayor was
criticized widely for visiting a hotel room where police later found
traces of cocaine.
   Paul Frick, 25, an assistant on Carr's staff, was in a car seen
traveling through the city putting up the signs, said Jeff Eller,
Carr's press secretary.
   Eller said Frick, a Washington resident for four years, has been
reprimanded.
   ``This has nothing to do with the congressman,'' he said. ``Our
office is in no way involved in any of this kind of activity.''
   Frick was at work today but would not comment on the incident.
   Barry has denied any involvement with drugs but has acknowledged
visiting Charles Lewis, a former city employee, at a downtown hotel
several times last month.
   Police investigators discovered traces of cocaine in the hotel
room after Lewis checked out on Dec. 23, but could not say how long
the drug had been there.

   Nancy Gardner hangs out on the subway platform
defiantly chain-smoking, a tough customer in leather and denim.
Other commuters give her wide berth.
   Anybody can see she's looking for trouble.
   And when it arrives _ often in groups of teen-age thugs who
victimize people in and around subway stations _ Gardner wants
nothing more than to get in the thick of it.
   For the last three months, that's been her job.
   As part of an elite, 23-officer plainclothes unit of the transit
police known as the Repeat Offender Robbery Strike Force, Gardner
and her partner, Officer Roger Fanti, spend hours loitering around
subway stations, waiting for crime to happen and trying to ensure
that the subway offers no escape.
   So far, the unit has chalked up 42 arrests, and Gardner is
responsible for eight of those.
   ``I especially get satisfaction out of robbery arrests,'' said
Gardner, 26, who at 5-foot-4 and 110 pounds, has had to push around
perpetrators twice her size. ``A lot of bad guys show no remorse and
don't think twice about taking people's property and leaving them
injured and bleeding. We try to get the best possible case so they
do time.''
   One evening during the busy Christmas shopping season, Gardner
and Fanti spent hours following a group of teen-agers as they tried
to rob a shopper at Macy's, wandered in and out of the subway and
nearby stores and finally made a grab for racks of clothes from one
shop.
   Four of the would-be shoplifters ended up in handcuffs, and
Gardner suffered a bruised knee in the struggle. She knows that
violence comes with the job, but it is a job she always has wanted
to do.
   ``When I was growing up, I always thought cops were heros,'' said
Gardner, a 3{-year veteran of the transit police who hopes to become
a detective. ``Now I want to make a difference for my son. Every
little bit counts.''

<HEAD>Government to Open Up Archives to Clear Up Armenian Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will open the archives of
the Ottoman Empire to clear up charges that 1.5 million Armenians
were massacred by Ottoman Turks during World War I, according to a
report published Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz told the Istanbul daily Milliyet
the archives were not in organized form and at least 10 years were
needed to put the documents in order.
   ``But we will release to the scholars the documents related to
the Armenian incident in four months,'' Yilmaz said.
   In the summer of 1915, a crumbling Ottoman Empire regarded
Armenians as a dangerous foreign element with friends and cousins
among the Russian enemy. The Ottomans accused the Armenians living
in eastern Turkey of helping the invading Russians during World War
I and ordered the whole Armenian population deported to Syria.
   Armenians were rounded up, their homes destroyed and their
property seized. Hundreds of thousands died from beatings,
starvation and exposure during the trip.
   Turkish officials have disputed the 1.5 million figure, saying
there were only 1.4 million Armenians living in Turkey at the turn
of the century. They say 300,000 Armenians were killed in the
turmoil of deportations and local reprisals. Historians have
estimated 600,000 dead.
   Both sides claim to have documents proving their version of the
events and brand as forgeries documents that support the other
side's claim.
   A group of prominent Turkish historians interviewed by the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday welcomed the news that
the Ottoman archives would be opened up soon for scholarly research.
   They said, however, that the move should have been made earlier.
   ``If the Ottoman archives had been made public earlier, the
Armenian issue would not have become so gangrenous by now,'' said
Attila Ilhan, a poet who has also written historical novels.
   Armenian underground organizations killed 30 Turkish officials
and their dependents abroad from 1973-84 in revenge for the alleged
massacre of Armenians.

<HEAD>Judicial Relatives Work At Avoiding Conflicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DYERSBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family members who serve as judge,
prosecutor and defense attorney in Dyer County Juvenile Court say
they work hard at avoiding conflicts of interest.
   ``It looks like a kangaroo court,'' said James O. Lanier, the
public defender.
   His brother, David W. Lanier, is the juvenile court judge. The
public defender's son, James E. Lanier, is a prosecutor.
   Judge Lanier requires all attorneys, defendants and parents to
sign a waiver before he hears a case in which his brother or nephew
are attorneys. The waiver acknowledges that everyone is aware of the
relationships.
   So far, no one has refused to sign.
   But the judge, who has been on the bench in this western
Tennessee community since 1982, said he does not believe his nephew
should prosecute cases in his courtroom.
   ``I don't think there will be any conflict of interest, but it's
not good practice for the three of us to all be in the courtroom,''
he said.
   But James E. Lanier said he sees no conflict. ``None of us are in
collusion with each other,'' he said.
   State Attorney General Charles W. Burson has issued a legal
opinion requested by James O. Lanier saying the arrangement violates
no state law.
   Gil Campbell, executive director of the Tennessee Bar
Association, declined to comment.
   Other Tennessee officials said it is common for parties in legal
proceedings to be related, but not to the extent of the Laniers.
   James O. Lanier, the public defender, also has asked the state
Board of Professional Responsibility for an ethics opinion on the
matter. The board is made up of nine private attorneys appointed by
the state Supreme Court to supervise the legal profession.
   James O. Lanier and his son practiced law together for seven
years before the younger Lanier became assistant district attorney
general in October.

<HEAD>Government to Double Police Force To Prevent Election Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will more than double
its police force to prevent violence during February's parliamentary
elections, a police official said Tuesday.
   The government will recruit 38,000 extra police officers,
increasing the size of the force to 64,000 before the elections,
said the police official, who requested anonymity.
   The need to increase the police force is apparently due to
soldiers being withdrawn to their barracks by Jan. 15.
   New President Ranasinghe Premadasa has said he won't extend
emergency laws beyond that date. The laws gave powers to the
military to detain militants from Sinhalese and Tamil communities
who have vowed to disrupt the elections.
   National elections were called for Feb. 15 by former President
Junius R. Jayewardene, who left office on Tuesday after 11 years in
power. Voters will elect 225 Parliament members to six-year terms.
   Sinhalese militants are waging an anti-government campaign to
protest a July 1987 peace plan offered to Tamil rebels fighting for
a separate homeland in northeast Sri Lanka. The mostly Hindu Tamils
form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, but are a majority
in the northeast.
   At least 8,500 people have been killed since Tamil rebels
launched their campaign for a separate state in 1983. The Sinhalese
anti-government campaing has claimed at least another 1,000 victims.
   In the latest violence Monday, at least five people, including a
ruling party candidate for next month's elections, were shot and
killed, police said.
   U.M.S. Dassanayake, the candidate for the Yapahuwa electorate in
the Northcentral Province, was killed at his residence, by gunmen
believed to be Sinhalese militants, police said. In the north, a
village leader was killed by Tamil rebels, they said.
   The other victims included at least three Sinhalese extremists,
whose bodies were found in a southern town, police said. They were
believed to have been shot by a pro-government group opposed to the
militants.

<HEAD>Dictionary Seeks Compromise on `Jew'; Jews Not Satisfied</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The following contains references to racial epithets, especially
16th graf, which some readers may find offensive.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Concise Oxford Dictionary has offered a
compromise in its long-running quarrel with Jewish groups over its
inclusion of the word ``Jew'' as a racial slur.
   The Jewish campaigners say they welcome the change but believe
it's not enough.
   The disputed entry defines ``Jew'' as ``1. person of Hebrew
descent; person whose religion is Judaism... 2. (derog., colloq.; R)
person who drives hard bargains, usurer. ...''
   And as a verb: ``(derog., colloq.; R) cheat, bargain with
(person) to lower his price.''
   ``Derog., colloq.; R'' stands for ``derogatory, colloquial,
racially offensive.''
   According to a letter from S.J. Tulloch, senior assistant editor
of the dictionary, to the Council of Christians and Jews, the next
edition will add: ``The stereotype, which is now deeply offensive,
arose from historical associations of Jews as money-lenders in
medieval England.''
   The aim, Mrs. Tulloch wrote, is to put things into context.
   But council director Canon Jim Richardson said he wished the
dictionary simply would drop all the pejorative definitions.
   Mrs. Tulloch wrote that dictionaries had to record, not to pass
judgment, and that ``Jew'' pejoratively ``is still current both as a
noun and as a verb.''
   Richardson, an Anglican clergyman whose organization fosters
Christian-Jewish understanding, disagreed. ``She said it was in
common practice. We actually doubt that and ask: Is it really in
use? Couldn't it be left out?''
   ``The Jewish community is very sensitive about the definition of
`Jew' in the Oxford Dictionary,'' he said in an interview. ``The
definition of `Jew' as a usurer, as a person who strikes a hard
bargain, promotes an anti-Jewish attitude.''
   He said the lexicographers' latest step was ``very much a move in
the right direction, but we won't be satisfied until it (the
definition) is scrapped, because it is dangerous.''
   Mrs. Tulloch wrote: ``The meaning of Jew that you mention is
certainly offensive, but that is not grounds for omitting it from
the dictionary, nor does our inclusion of it imply that we condone
its use in this sense. Instead, it should be carefully labeled, so
that the reader understands the context in which it exists.''
   Shimon Cohen, a spokesman for Lord Jakobovitz, the chief rabbi of
Britain, said he was ``somewhat pleased'' with the proposed change,
but also wanted the pejorative definitions removed altogether.
   Other British dictionaries also include pejorative definitions of
``Jew.'' Chambers 20th Century Dictionary, published in Scotland,
defines the word as ``usurer, miser.'' The Longman Dictionary of the
English Language attributes its origin to ``the alleged sharpness of
Jews in business dealings.''
   Chambers, Longman and Oxford also list the meanings of ``kike,''
``sheeny,'' ``wog,'' ``nigger'' and ``chink'' with notations that
they are offensive slang.
   In the United States, Webster's New World Dictionary has restored
obscene words and racial slurs after prolonged banishment.
   David B. Guralnik, editor-in-chief until his recent retirement,
expunged the words in the 1970s in a practice mocked by some British
lexicographers as ``Guralnikism,'' but restored them in the latest
edition published in September.
   The verb to ``jew'' is defined in Webster's as ``to swindle;
cheat; gyp'' with the warning: ``This is a vulgar and offensive
usage even when not consciously expressing an anti-Semitic
attitude.''
   ``Times have changed,'' said the present editor in chief,
Victoria Neufeldt. ``There is far more acceptance in print of all
the vulgar terms and what David Guralnik called the true obscenities
_ ethnic slurs.''
   In a telephone interview from her Cleveland office, she said she
did not think dictionary inclusion of such words encouraged their
usage.
   ``Putting `ain't' in the dictionary hasn't made `ain't' more
acceptable. Dictionaries don't have that power,'' she said.
   In 1973, Marcus Shloimovitz, an English Jewish textile merchant,
took the Oxford Dictionary to court to force it to stop defining a
Jew as ``a grasping or extortionate money-lender or usurer.''
   He argued that ``the Jewish race includes sages, scholars,
judges, scientists and people from the arts and stage. They have
done great service for their countries. They are not cheats or
unscrupulous usurers.''
   Shloimovitz lost because he failed to prove the dictionary
entries caused him personal suffering. But the lexicographers
subsequently toned down the disputed definitions.

<HEAD>ACT College Entrance Exam To Change Next Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ACT, the predominant college entrance test in
28 Midwestern and Western states, will be revised in October to
offer a more detailed evaluation of students' reading, science and
math skills.
   Since the exam taken by nearly 1 million college-bound students
each year was devised in 1959, colleges that were once seen as
institutions for the academically elite now deal with a greater
variety of students, including an increasing number with remedial
needs.
   ``There is a much more heterogenous group going to college,''
said Richard L. Ferguson, president of the American College Testing
Program in Iowa City. ``As colleges are challenged by students with
a broad range of skills, they need better information for
placement.''
   The new exam, which will be lengthened by 15 minutes to two hours
and 55 minutes, will supply colleges with 12 scores and subscores to
give a more detailed assessment of students.
   The current ACT consists of five scores: in English, math, social
science, natural science, and a composite score.
   The new test will provide three scores in English: a total score,
and subscores in mechanical skills and rhetorical skills.
   An expanded math test will provide a total score and separate
subscores in pre-algebra and elementary algebra, intermediate
algebra and coordinate geometry, and in plane geometry and
trigonometry.
   A section on reading skills will provide and total score and two
subscores: one in social studies and science, and a second in art
and literature.
   The ACT also will include a new science reasoning test.
   ``What we are really doing is generating a new reading test that
really measures reading skills, and another test in science that
really measures science skills,'' Ferguson said.
   Booklets outlining the changes, which were the result of eight
years of review, are to be mailed out the first week in February to
high schools and colleges, Ferguson said.

<HEAD>Outgoing U.S. Envoy Says American Troops Will Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. troops will remain in South Korea
as long as the threat from North Korea remains and as long as South
Koreans desire their presence, outgoing U.S. Ambassador James R.
Lilley said Tuesday.
   A majority of the people in South Korea believes the U.S.
military presence is ``still necessary to ensure the security of
Korea,'' Lilley said in departing Seoul, pointing to polls showing
that 60 percent wanted the troops to stay.
   About 42,000 American troops are stationed here under a mutual
defense pact.
   Echoing North Korea's calls, some radicals in South Korea have
demanded the U.S. troops pull out, saying they obstruct
reunification.
   In view of North Korea's military presence and its invasion in
1950 that started the three-year Korean War, the diplomat said, ``It
is essential that we stay strong, well-prepared and well-trained.''
   He said the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises are
necessary for bilateral security.
   North Korea last week called for an end to the exercise in a
meeting with South Korean lawmakers in Panmunjom to try to arrange
parliamentary talks to improve relations. North Korea said an end to
the exercise was a precondition to progress in such talks.
   Lilley also said Washington ``fully supports'' South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo's proposals to promote dialogue and reduce
tensions with North Korea and develop better relations with
socialist countries.
   Citing South Korea's economic growth, Lilley said the United
Sates ``will continue to seek a fair chance for U.S. firms to
compete in the Korean market,'' while calling on Seoul to further
liberalize its economy, including its import and capital markets.
South Korea posted a trade surplus of about $10 billion with the
United States last year.
   He cautioned that ``there will be problems ahead and we will not
always agree on how best to solve them. Nevertheless, I am confident
of the future. There is an underlying mutuality of interests which
characterizes the U.S.-Korea economic relationship.''

<HEAD>Racial Tensions Spread to Beijing</HEAD>

   Racial tension spread to Beijing on Tuesday as
about 200 Chinese students demonstrated against an alleged attack on
a Chinese woman by an African student. Posters calling for tighter
campus security appeared at two colleges.
   The protest and class boycott at the Beijing Languages Institute
was the third incident between Chinese and Africans in the last nine
days in China, and the first to occur in the capital.
   Chinese officials in Nanking denied African allegations that
Chinese paramilitary forces beat and used electric truncheons to
shock African students during a clash Saturday. They also said four
Africans involved in a Dec. 24 brawl with Chinese had been expelled
from a Nanking university. Of the four, one has been arrested and
three detained for questioning.
   A third racially related incident continued in Hangzhou, where 56
African students have been boycotting classes for a week because
they allege Chinese authorities say they all have AIDS.
   In Beijing, Chinese students marched for two hours, carrying
banners in Chinese and English. ``Hooligans Go Home'' and ``We
Demand A Safe Campus,'' said two banners in Chinese. A banner in
English said, ``No Offend Women's Rights.''
   Chinese students said the last boycott involved about 2,000
students. Final exams are Saturday, so classes are important.
   Students said they wanted their school to fix locks on dormitory
doors, provide better lighting and upgrade security. They said they
wanted foreign students ``to respect Chinese customs.''
   Chinese students also put up wall posters criticizing the
leadership of the Student Union at the institute, which they said
organized the action but did not participate because it was afraid.
   ``We don't need this kind of leadership,'' said one of the
posters about the school-appointed group. ``Student Union, get the
hell out of China!''
   A wall poster, titled ``Whither Respect?'' was posted at Beijing
University, China's most prestigious college.
   ``The languages institute school is forever forgiving such
incidents,'' the poster said. ``We want to know why Chinese women
have to continually suffer such treatment.''
   Another poster told the story of the racially related incident in
Nanking.
   According to Chinese and foreign students, the problem at the
Beijing Languages Institute occurred at 4:30 a.m. Sunday when a
Chinese student went to the bathroom and was accosted by an African
student in her third floor dormitory hall.
   They said the African sneaked into the woman's room while she was
in the bathroom and attempted to grab her when she returned.
   She screamed and ran down the stairs. On the second floor she
slipped on some broken glass and severely cut her leg, Chinese
students said.
   ``I saw him run after her,'' said one of the student's roommates,
who was awakened by her classmates' cries. ``She was yelling, `Save
me! Save me!'''
   She said her roommate could not speak to a reporter because ``all
she can do is cry.''
   African students at the languages institute said they did not
know exactly what happened Sunday. They said they believed Chinese
were using the incident as an excuse to oppose relationships between
foreign men and Chinese women.
   Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese often
are openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is
very different than their own. The tensions become explosive when
Chinese women are involved.
   Cbinese students are also unhappy with the way the government and
their schools are treating them and have jumped on the African issue
as a pretext to vent complex feelings of discontent about their
position in society.
   Last week, thousands of Chinese in Nanking demonstrated against
African students following a fight Dec. 24 over Chinese women.
   Su Xiaoxun, an official at the Jiangsu province foreign affairs
office, denied allegations by African student and diplomats that
Chinese forces attacked and tortured Africans at a guest house
Saturday.
   Daouda Diakite, a 24-year-old student from Mali, said Chinese
militia shocked his classmates on their genitals.
   The 140 mostly African students had been forced to the guest
house on Dec. 26 following the African-Chinese clash and anti-black
protests during which thousands of youths threw rocks at African
dormitories and destroyed property there.
   On Monday, a diplomat from Ghana, Y.N. Ohene-Akrasi, said China
had broken its promise not to move the students from the guest house
until an African delegation returned to Nanking.
   On Tuesday, the chairman of the delegation, the ambassador from
the Congo, went to the Foreign Ministry but it ``refused to grant
him any audience'' to discuss the situation in Nanking, he said.

<HEAD>Men Given Heavy Sentences for Looting in Quake Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six people have been convicted of looting in the
wake of the Armenian earthquake, including a man who received an
eight-year sentence for stealing food and three others sentenced for
taking an empty safe, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   The report in Sovietskaya Rossiya was the first on sentencing of
looters in the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated much of northern
Armenia. It said the sentences were handed out by the Armenian
Supreme Court, but did not say when nor whether they would be served
in labor camp or prison.
   V. Manukyan, 36, of Yerevan, ``using the general grief on the
first day after the earthquake,'' stole about $2,600 worth of food
from a storage house in Leninakan, the report said. He was caught
and given an eight-year sentence, the newspaper said.
   S. Oganesyan, a driver for the Armenian Education Ministry and
two friends, A. Gevorkyan and V. Borzikh, stole a safe from the
ruins of a bakery in Spitak, the paper said.
   ``Each was given six years _ and that only because the safe
turned out to be empty. In other circumstances the sentence would
have been stiffer,'' it said.
   The newspaper also reported that A. Babayan, 22, was sentenced to
five years for passing himself off in Spitak as an ambulance doctor
and stealing gold from bodies. A sixth person, R. Ayrapetyan, was
given three years for stealing from cars in Leninakan.
   The Armenian Academy of Sciences reported several new tremors
Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to editors of the official
Armenian news agency Armenpress.
   A temblor hit Spitak at 8:10 a.m. Saturday, registering 6.5 on
the 12-point Soviet scale, which is different from the Richter
scale. A quake of that magnitude can knock pictures from walls and
slightly damage buildings, but almost all of Spitak already was
destroyed.
   Armenpress editors also said the Academy of Sciences reported
five minor tremors Sunday in Leninakan and Kirovakan, and six
tremors Monday.
   The editors said that reports six people were killed by one of
the aftershocks were ``only rumors.''
   The official Tass news agency also denied reports broadcast in
France and Britain that 17 survivors had been found recently in
Spitak.
   ``The last living person was removed by rescuers from the ruins
of buildings and structures in Spitak 10 days ago,'' Norik Muradyan,
chief of rescue operations in the city, told Tass.
   ``The Western press reports that supposedly 17 living people were
found in Spitak on the 24th day after the natural disaster have no
foundation,'' Muradyan was quoted as telling Tass.
   Since Dec. 29, the bodies of 28 more earthquake victims have been
pulled from the rubble, bringing the total recovered bodies to
24,888, Tass said.

   The 101st Congress convened today with leaders
of the Democratic-controlled chambers pledging cooperation with a
George Bush White House, but with tensions already mounting within
the Capitol over a proposed hefty pay raise for lawmakers.
   President-elect Bush, acting in his role as vice president,
gaveled the Senate into session and then immediately administered
the oath of office to the new and re-elected senators in groups of
four.
   The Senate chamber was outfitted with new gold curtains behind
the presiding officer's chair and new carpet throughout. There were
new benches upholstered in bright scarlet for staff members. ``It's
all for television,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., showing off the
accommodations to constituents.
   The galleries were packed with spectators, including Lady Byrd
Johnson, widow of the late president and mother-in-law of Virginia's
new Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb.
   In the House, the chamber was packed by members, their families
and friends as Texas Democrat Jim Wright was re-elected speaker in a
party-line vote of 253-170 with two members voting ``present,'' over
Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois.
   The speaker entered the chamber to a standing ovation before
leading the mass swearing-in ceremony.
   Democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers, 55-45 in the
Senate and 259-174 in the House. Today, there was talk of
cooperation with Bush from leaders of both parties.
   ``By working together, we can help our new president fulfill his
promise of `a kinder, gentler America','' Wright said in his
statement accepting re-election.
   ``We're very optimistic that we're going to be able to work with
President-elect) Bush and we can solve some of the problems,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., House majority whip. ``We need to have
that cooperation. ... We'd like to resolve some problems and get rid
of some of this confrontation.''
   ``I think at least at the outset ... the appropriate tone is one
of cooperation and a spirit of bipartisanship, and let's see how far
we can go with that,'' said Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., House minority
whip.
   Moving to get a jump on other lawmakers, Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,
announced a bill to force roll-call votes before Congress accepts
any pay increase, and delay any approved raise two years _ until
after the next election. Under current law, Congress automatically
gets a boost proposed by the president unless it votes it down.
   ``Congressional pay adjustments have become a perpetual source of
debate, controversy and embarrassment,'' Tauke said.
   President Reagan is expected to call for a substantial pay raise
next week for members of Congress to take effect March 1 unless
rejected before then by both houses. An advisory commission has
recommended a 50 percent boost for lawmakers, federal judges, and
top executive branch officials, with members of Congress giving up
lucrative honorariums in exchange.
   Current congressional pay is $89,500 a year, and the commission's
proposal would raise it to $135,000.
   ``If the president goes ahead and proposes a pay raise we're
prepared to go ahead and eliminate the honorariums,'' Coelho said.
   While the Democratic-controlled Congress awaits Reagan's proposal
on the pay issue, on most of the nation's biggest issues it's
waiting for the new president-elect to make his positions known.
   Lawmakers from both parties reaffirmed today their hope that
relations with the Bush White House will be good.
   But Cheney and Coelho, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning'', had
differing views on possible tax increases.
   ``None of us would like to increase taxes but we're willing to
listen and watch and we hope that as we get into this, and we have
to get to the crunch, that if he (Bush) can't reach the magic number
without raising revenue, that he would say so and we would go ahead
and do it,'' Coelho said.
   ``I think the American people voted overwhelmingly in opposition
to a tax increase and I don't believe that he should be giving away
or making a concession on that point before we even sit down at the
table to negotiate,'' said Cheney.
   New and re-elected members of the House and Senate were being
sworn in today, and then the two chambers scheduled organizational
chores for two days. Among them: a joint session on Wednesday to
count the electoral votes for president.
   After completing its organizational chores, Congress will adjourn
until Jan. 20, although hearings could start before then on some of
Bush's legislative proposals.
   President Reagan sends his final budget to Congress Jan. 9, and
Bush is expected to submit his own ideas after taking office. Before
fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1, Congress and the new president must agree
on how to cut more than $25 billion in spending, or to raise taxes,
in order to meet the goals of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   Awaiting Bush's proposals before offering their own are House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and the Senate's new majority leader,
George Mitchell of Maine. Mitchell succeeds Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., who will also play a key fiscal role as he moves over to
the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee.
   Bush pledged repeatedly during the campaign he would not support
any new taxes, but many Democrats are openly skeptical he can keep
that promise.
   Among the doubters are the chairmen of the House and Senate
Budget committees _ both new to those posts _ Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. Sasser has publicly predicted
that Bush would be coming to Congress within two years asking for a
tax increase.
   Bob Michel, R-Ill., who returns as the House minority leader,
said he suspects some new taxes might have to be combined with
spending cuts for the deficit goals to be achieved.
   ``I suspect down the road a piece that may be part of the
answer,'' Michel said in a television interview last weekend.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, re-elected Senate Republican leader,
said he hasn't seen any indications that Bush is softening his
anti-tax position. But he warned demands on the federal till are
increasing, including tens of billions of dollars needed to bail out
failing savings institutions and to reopen the nation's nuclear
weapons plants, which have been plagued by safety problems.

<HEAD>November Increase in Construction Spending Reflects Housing Activity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending rose 0.8 percent in
November, reflecting an increase in work on homes and government
projects that more than offset slower building of offices and
shopping malls, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
   November's seasonally adjusted construction spending _ at an
annual rate of $411.1 billion _ marked the third consecutive monthly
increase. Revised figures put spending at $407.8 billion in October,
$406.9 billion in September and $403.2 billion in August.
   For the first 11 months of 1988, construction spending was up a
lackluster 1 percent over the same period of 1987. That figure was
not adjusted for increased construction costs, which were up 1.5
percent.
   The November spending increase was largely driven by a increase
in spending on housing construction, which was up 0.7 percent to
$200.4 billion. The housing figure included a 2.3 percent rise in
spending on single-family homes.
   There was a 1.9 percent decrease in apartment construction.
Economists said that reflected after-effects of the 1986 federal tax
overhaul, which made such projects less attractive, and high
apartment vacancy rates, particularly in the South.
   ``Until we see vacancy rates decline, we're not going to see a
whole heck of a lot of construction in those markets,'' said Mark
Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   Rising mortgage interest rates likely will dampen growth in
single-family housing in 1989, said John Savacool, an economist with
the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. He said recent
increases in single-family construction ``aren't going to stick.''
   However, Obrinsky predicted another reasonably strong year for
single-family homes, though not equal to 1988. He said mortgage
rates could drop in the second half of the year and ``take some
sting'' out of expected increases early in the year.
   Spending on non-residential construction was down a seasonally
adjusted 0.8 percent in November to $92.3 billion, including a 2.5
percent drop in work on office buildings.
   There was a 1.3 percent increase in spending on factories and
other industrial projects, and Savacool said that was a result of
continued strong export markets. While companies first increase
production by investing in new equipment, ``eventually you have to
build some new structures to put additional equipment in,'' he said.
``It's finally starting to show up.''
   The weakness in office construction, meanwhile, reflects high
vacancy rates, Obrinsky said.
   ``The same has been true for shopping centers and malls,'' he
said. ``They seem to have been a bit overbuilt.''
   Hotel and motel construction was up 6.6 percent for the month and
other commercial projects, such as shopping malls, were down 2.2
percent.
   Spending on construction of government projects was up 4 percent
in November to $81 billion, including a 2.7 percent increase in the
largest category of highways. Also up was spending on construction
on schools and sewer systems.

   A man stole an unoccupied transit authority
bus today and drove it through three counties as police gave chase,
and at least 14 people were injured, authorities said.
   The half-hour chase ended when the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority bus crashed into a tree in front of a shop.
   Middletown Police Chief Frank McKenna said Middletown officer
Leroy Alexander, 39, was injured when he was struck by the bus as
police vainly tried to halt it by setting up a roadblock of squad
cars midway through the chase.
   Details were still sketchy, but at least 12 people were reported
injured in a pileup related to the chase, authorities said.
   The driver, who was not immediately identified, was also injured,
authorities said.
   Transportation authority spokesman James Whitaker said the bus
was stolen from a depot in Philadelphia shortly before 7 a.m. ``He
apparently drove it to a number of locations before the chase
began,'' Whitaker said.
   Authorities began the pursuit in Middletown Township in Bucks
County, north of the city, when the bus was spotted on a road that
has no transit route, McKenna said.
   State police Sgt. Hal Lacey said the bus eventually came south on
a state highway, with at least one state police car and four local
police cars in pursuit. When the bus became bogged down in traffic,
police cars pulled in front to try to end the chase, he said.
   When the traffic cleared, the bus rammed two police cars and hit
the police officer before leaving the scene. The bus went through a
portion of Philadelphia into Lower Moreland Township, in Montgomery
County, where it finally stopped after ramming a tree.
   Elle Rudolph, a spokeswoman for St. Mary Hospital in Langhorne,
said Alexander was in guarded condition with multiple injuries.
   Edward Ennis, a police dispatcher in Lower Moreland township,
said several people suffered serious injuries in a traffic accident
that was caused by the pursuit.
   Between five and 12 cars ran into each other at an intersection a
couple of blocks from the place where the bus finally came to rest,
either because they had been hit by the bus or because they were
trying to avoid it, authorities said.
   A dispatcher who declined to give her name said 10 injured people
were taken to Holy Redeemer Hospital and Medical Center, two were
taken to Abington Memorial Hospital and one was flown by helicopter
to Hahnemann University Hospital.
   Abington spokeswoman Linda Miller said one of the two injured
persons at that hospital was the 35-year-old man who had driven the
bus. The man's name and condition were not immediately released.
   Ennis said the chase ended when the bus hit a tree in front of
the Huntingdon Valley Cheese Shop in Lower Moreland township
northwest of the city. The chase ``caused pretty bad'' traffic
tieups in the area, Ennis said.

<HEAD>Arens Says Europe Making Peace Moves Without Consulting Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens complained Tuesday
that European nations were making Middle East peace moves without
consulting Israel, and he said his nation was willing to suffer
isolation in the world for its own security.
   Four members of Israel's parliament, meanwhile, planned to defy
Israeli law and meet with officials of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, three Palestinians were
reported wounded in clashes with soldiers, and troops demolished or
sealed three houses of Arabs suspected of attacks on soldiers or
Arabs cooperating with Israeli authorities.
   Three residents of Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp were sentenced to
14 years in prison each for throwing firebombs, taking part in riots
or belonging to groups organizing the nearly 13-month-old
Palestinian uprising, the army said.
   Arens, in his first news conference with foreign reporters,
criticized the U.S. decision to hold talks with the PLO. He
emphasized that negotiating with the PLO could not further the peace
process, but he refused to outline Israel's plans for reaching peace
with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors.
   Arens said Israel does not approve of the European Community's
plan, announced Monday, to start a Middle East peace initiative by
encouraging an international conference on the region.
   ``I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of
intitiative, the members of the European Community were to meet with
us,'' he said. ``I think there is probably no reason why European
countries should not listen with considerable attention to our
opinions, to our feelings.''
   Arens, 63, became foreign minister with the formation of Israel's
new government Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud bloc of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which has opposed an international Middle
East peace conference.
   Arens, a former ambassador to Washington, also criticized the
U.S. talks with the PLO, saying: ``We are concerned that this
decision might impair our ability to fight the plague of
international terrorism.''
   Asked if Israel felt isolated by the Europeans and the United
States, Arens said his government does not welcome isolation but
will accept it if necessary for its security.
   ``We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease
the sense of isolation ... if they are steps that would endanger the
state of Israel,'' he said.
   Also Tuesday, an Israeli legislator said he and three colleagues
plan to attend a European symposium on the Middle East, defying a
ban on meetings with PLO officials.
   ``We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peace
with them through compromise,'' said legislator Lova Eliav. ``Our
generation must speak to the Palestinian leadership, and the
Palestinian leadership is the PLO.''
   Those attending the meeting in Paris on Jan. 12-13 include Eliav
and Ora Namir of the mainstream Labor Party, Yair Tsaban of the
socialist Mapam Party, and Shulamit Aloni of the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement.
   The PLO is banned in Israel and meetings with its members are
illegal, but the four legislators have parliamentary immunity.
   Recent opinion polls show a majority of Israelis support talks
with the PLO.
   In Jabalya, soldiers demolished one Palestinian home and sealed
parts of two others after arresting residents suspected of attacks
on Israeli soldiers or Arabs cooperating with Israel, the army said.
   The action against the Arab homes came Monday night, after two
other Palestinian houses were demolished earlier in the day.
   The army statement announcing the sentencing of three
Palestinians to prison said that all three were from the Jabalya
camp but that house demolitions were not tied to their cases.
   The moves against Palestinian houses seem to be part of a
stepped-up campaign to try to halt the Palestinian uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel also deported 13 Palestinians on Sunday. The International
Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday appealed to Israel to stop
such deportations, saying they violated international law.
   In the West Bank, soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinians
during clashes with stone-throwing youths in the towns of Ramallah
and Tulkarem, Arab news reports said. One of the victims was an
8-year-old boy shot in the back, a hospital official said. The army
said it was checking reports of injuries.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 345
Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died in violence.

<HEAD>Maryland Boy Gets Third Transplanted Liver</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surgeons tried to transplant a third liver
Tuesday into a Maryland boy whose second operation was made possible
by a mother of another young patient who volunteered the organ
intended for her child.
   Jason Point, 5, of Deale, Md., went into surgery at 6 a.m., said
Lynn McMahon, spokeswoman for Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The
operation was expected to last 10 to 12 hours.
   Jason was in critical condition with an abscess in his liver
going into Tuesday's surgery.
   In November, Jason received a liver originally intended for Candi
Thomas, 6, of Accokeek, Md., after the girl's mother offered the

<HEAD>Government Says Would Consider Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government considers the issue of
making the Solidarity trade union legal again a topic for discussion
at proposed talks with the opposition, a government spokesman said
Tuesday.
   ``Our standpoint is the following: let's sit down, as we have
agreed, without preconditions let's talk about everything, therefore
about Solidarity too, and let's try to come to agreement as far as
the time, form and assumptions of setting union pluralism into
motion,'' said spokesman Jerzy Urban.
   ``It would be a mistake to state that one does not want to
consider the issue of Solidarity,'' he said in an opening statement
at his weekly news conference.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has refused to enter the talks _
first proposed during a wave of strikes in August _ until he
receives a clear signal of official intention to make his union
legal again.
   Asked about Urban's comments, Walesa reiterated his position in a
telephone interview: ``I'm saying clearly and frankly: there is no
freedom without Solidarity. The sooner all sides, including the
authorities, realize it, ... the sooner we will make progress and
solve the problems Poland faces.''
   The government has said it is willing to talk about anything, but
Urban appeared to be emphasizing more forcefully than before that
the government wants talks on the opposition's chief demand _ the
restoration of Solidarity.
   He said the government wants to discuss how to implement a
long-suspended 1982 law that provided for trade union pluralism, and
said he meant by that more than simply coexistence of branches of
the official union movement OPZZ.
   Urban said Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, at a Communist
Party plenum last month, asked Central Committee members about their
stance toward the ``aims of a portion of the people for a resumed,
legal existence, in appropriate form, of a union under the name
Solidarity.''
   ``The party leader, Wojciech Jaruzelski, in summing up the first
part of the plenum, left the issue open for reflection and
consultation,'' Urban said.
   The plenum, which began Dec. 21-22, was broken into two parts. It
will convene again in mid-January, with the Central Committee
members instructed to give their answer to the questions posed by
Rakowski about Solidarity.
   Urban referred to the present as a ``touchy moment'' and appealed
to observers to ``show patience.''
   He said there was ``vigorous discussion'' not only among
authorities, but also among the opposition, and alleged that some
former associates of Walesa believe he has betrayed Solidarity.
   ``I hope that illustrating the opinions and program of Lech
Walesa's rivals will not be understood as an expression of our
solidarity and political friendship with Mr. Walesa. Personally I
would prefer to hang myself than be suspected of that,'' Urban said.

   The menu will include caviar, truffles and
lobster sauteed in saffron sauce as President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, attend a fund-raiser Wednesday night for the Nancy Reagan
Center for teen-age drug addicts.
   Hotel magnate Barron Hilton has pledged to raise $1 million for
the center by throwing the lavish welcome-home party for the Reagans
at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills.
   The center, for those aged 12 to 18, is to be established in a
former hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Organizers say they need
$10 million to buy and renovate the structure.
   Television personality Merv Griffin will be master of ceremonies
and singer Frank Sinatra and comedian Don Rickles will entertain at
the dinner.
   To attend both the dinner and a reception, about 65 people are
paying $25,000 for a table of 10. About 950 who will attend the
dinner alone will pay $10,000 for a table of 10.
   The hotel said the black-tie gala would be the only welcome-home
party for the Reagans before they relocate in Los Angeles after he
leaves office Jan. 20. The president and first lady are vacationing
at the Bel Air home where they will live. They will return to
Washington Thursday.
   The main course for the dinner will be tournedos of veal.
Appetizers will include shrimp, crabs, oysters, clams, smoked duck,
steak tartare and smoked salmon and sturgeon as well as shrimp
sauteed in garlic and the lobster tails in saffron sauce.
   The 125 waiters will serve a variety of California wines.

   Police searching for a man wanted in the
fatal shooting of a fellow officer cheered when they found him
already dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the face.
   ``I might sleep tonight,'' Navajo County Sheriff Gary Butler said
Monday afternoon, shortly after officers burst into a ranch cabin
and found the body of one of two men sought in the Saturday night
slaying of Deputy Bob Varner.
   The other man was arrested Monday.
   Varner, a 51-year-old Navajo County sheriff's deputy, died Monday
at a Phoenix hospital from wounds he suffered when two men in a car
he stopped on Interstate 40 opened fire.
   Officers surrounding the cabin cheered when the SWAT team radioed
from the house that the man, tentatively identified as Douglas
Savory, 45, was dead. ``The suspect is dead _ self-inflicted,'' said
the voice on the radio.
   ``Mr. Savory was an extremely dangerous man,'' Butler said.
``Every time we had contact with him, he turned on us. He shot
officer Varner before he even had a chance to react. He turned on
two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him. Every time that
we made contact with him, I ended up with several bullet holes in my
patrol cars.''
   Hundreds of officers from several law enforcement agencies took
part in the search.
   The other man, identified as Raul Lopez, was arrested in Holbrook
about 30 miles east of here, officials said. He was charged this
morning with 10 felony counts of assault, burglary and other charges
stemming from the shooting and the subsequent manhunt.
   Flagstaff Justice of the Peace James Sedillo visited Lopez in his
hospital room at the Flagstaff Medical Center to file the charges.
Lopez is being treated for frostbite.
   Rancher John Thompson, the cabin's owner, had called police early
Monday morning when he discovered someone had broken in.
   The cabin is less than a quarter-mile from Interstate 40, and
traffic was rerouted around a 33-mile stretch of the highway for at
least six hours until the man's body was found.
   Authorities said a California warrant accused Savory of robbery
and kidnapping in a gun store robbery last September in which five
other people were arrested.
   No further information was immediately available on Lopez.

   Johnny Cash smoked a cigarette just 30
minutes before he had double heart bypass surgery, but he left the
hospital Tuesday with a vow to give up smoking and other unhealthy
habits.
   ``I'm 56 now and I never want to go through this again,'' the
country singer said as he left Baptist Hospital with his wife, June
Carter Cash, three weeks after his surgery.
   Cash will have his work cut out for him, according to his
physician, Constantine Potanin, who said Cash should give up
smoking, change his diet and exercise more.
   Cash underwent double bypass heart surgery Dec. 19, six days
after doctors discovered that critical arteries around his heart
were 90 percent blocked.
   The operation and subsequent convalescence was ``a great
soul-searching experience,'' Cash said. His surgery took place one
week after fellow country star Waylon Jennings had triple bypass
surgery in the same hospital.

   Notre Dame's football team may have ended up
No. 1 in the nation, but Coach Lou Holtz had to settle for No. 2.
   After winning the national championship Monday night by beating
West Virginia, Holtz received a telephone call from the White House.
At the time, Holtz was in the Notre Dame locker room speaking with
the university's president, Rev. Edward A. Malloy.
   ``The president is on the phone,'' an assistant coach yelled to
Holtz.
   ``I'm talking to the president,'' Holtz said.
   ``No,'' the aide said, ``it's the other president.''
   Holtz took the call only to find out it wasn't President Reagan
but Vice President-elect Dan Quayle. In any case, Holtz accepted an
invitation to bring the team to the White House at an unspecified

   Borge, a naturalized U.S. citizen who is still revered in his
native land, was reported to be spending a quiet birthday at his
vacation home in Christiansted, St. Croix, in the former Danish West
Indies.
   With him were his wife, five children and eight grandchildren, as
well as Niels-Joergen Kaiser, director of Copenhagen's Tivoli
amusement park. Borge described Kaiser as his only friend ``because
all the rest disappeared from age.''
   The state television scheduled a 90-minute special on Borge in
what was billed as an unusual glimpse of the entertainer off-stage.
National radio in Sweden also broadcast a special program of one of
Borge's performances.

   Retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland has
been first many times in his career, but it took him about 30 years
of golfing before recording his first hole in one.
   Westmoreland, 74, made the shot on Monday using a 6-iron on the
142-yard third hole at the Yeamans Hall Club in nearby Hanahan. It
was witnessed by his wife and golfing partner, Kitsy Westmoreland.
   ``The laws of probability finally caught up with me,'' he said.
``I figured if I played long enough, I'd have to get one.''
   Westmoreland, former commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, gave
credit to luck, not athletic prowess.
   ``It was not a very good shot,'' he said. ``Then, it suddenly
disappeared. I was curious, still not believing it was a hole in
one. But it turned out to be.''

   Entertainer Cab Calloway, who underwent

but stable condition Tuesday, an improvement from his previous
critical condition.
   ``He wishes everyone a happy New Year and is resting
comfortably,'' said Wendy Serkin, a spokeswoman for White Plains

Calloway lives in White Plains.
   Calloway, who turned 81 on Christmas Day, became ill in Tokyo on

emergency surgery the following day.
   Hospital officials were not disclosing the nature of Calloway's

   Calloway is known as the ``King of Hi-de-ho,'' a refrain famous
from the 1931 hit ``Minnie the Moocher,'' which he wrote with Irving
Mills.

<UNK>CBS Buys Music Publisher for Reported $45 Million to $50 Million</UNK>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a merger of music industry giants,
Tree International Publishing, the largest country music publisher
in the world, has been sold to No. 1 CBS Records for a reported $45
million to $50 million.
   ``It offers us many, many opportunities simply because CBS has
the ability to commit so much money,'' longtime Tree owner Buddy
Killen said Tuesday. ``Nothing changes but the cash flow.''
   He refused to disclose the pricetag on Monday's sale, but The
Tennessean neswpaper of Nashville valued it at $45 million to $50
million. The deal is believed to be the largest financial
transaction in the history of Nashville's Music Row.
   ``Tree belongs to Nashville, and I didn't want to let that
change,'' Killen said. ``I wasn't going to settle until they agreed
to all my prerequisites. That is, we had to stay in Nashville. We
had to keep the name Tree International. We had to keep all our
employees. And the headquarters had to be here.''
   Killen, 52, will remain as president at the company and will
become a CBS executive. Tree Vice President Donna Hilley will be
chief operating officer.
   CBS Records President Tommy Mottola called the sale ``a marriage
of two highly compatible partners.''
   ``It's fitting that country music's leading publisher be united
under the same roof with the leading record company in the world,''
he said.
   ``The purchase of Tree International is CBS Records' first
acquisition since becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony
Corp.,'' Mottola said. ``It will provide us with a solid base upon
which to build a significant music publishing entity.''
   Tree has 40 exclusive songwriters and its own multistory office
building. The company has ranked as Billboard Magazine's No. 1
country music publisher for 16 consecutive years.
   Its catalog of music copyrights includes more than 35,000 songs,
including the standards of Willie Nelson, Buck Owens, Merle Haggard,
Harlan Howard and Roger Miller.
   The deal marks the end of an era for the Nashville music
business, which has seen locally controlled publishing companies
sold off one by one to outside concerns. In the 1980s, such
publishing companies as Acuff-Rose, Cedarwood, House of Gold and
Combine Music went to out-of-town conglomerates. Tree was the last
major publishing property that had not been acquired.
   CBS was purchased by Sony for a reported $2 billion in late 1987.
But CBS's old song publishing division was purchased by SBK
Entertainment World at that time. With the Tree purchase, Sony-CBS
is re-entering the publishing field.
   CBS Records boasts such stars as Michael Jackson, Bruce
Springsteen, George Michael, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Terence
Trent D'Arby, Willie Nelson, Sade, Chet Atkins, Pink Floyd and
Rosanne Cash.

   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi is stalling on
reforms needed to mollify a populace fed up with a lingering civil
war and a foundering economy, while Moslem fundamentalists in his
coalition fight proposed changes.
   Sudanese and Western experts agree he needs to come up with
solutions, and soon. Otherwise, they fear a return of street
violence like that which gripped the country for four days last week.
   Many Sudanese believe Mahdi allowed the war and the economic
problems to drag on too long, taking no decisive action until the
course of events pushed him into it.
   What finally turned the streets into arenas of broken glass and
burning barricades was Mahdi's imposition of steep price increases
at a time when unrest already seethed over his refusal to endorse
officially a draft peace agreement negotiated by a coalition partner.
   ``What we need is action,'' said Mohamed Omer Beshir, a veteran
political observer and lecturer at Khartoum University's Institute
of African and Asian Studies. ``We need any action to stop the war.
   ``Every day of the war makes the economic situation worse, and if
things get worse, the people will not stay silent. They will react.''
   But Beshir doesn't expect new demonstrations right away.
   ``The prime minister ... doesn't have the support of the people
any more,'' Beshir said. ``But as for demonstrations again, not
necessarily. Things in Sudan aren't always that logical.''
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, wasn't so
sure.
   ``It's basically an explosive situation,'' he said. ``The reasons
the people took to the streets last week still are there. While the
situation might be dormant today, it could reignite any time.''
   Last week's trouble followed smaller food riots late last year
and severe and widespread criticism of Mahdi because he refused to
endorse the peace agreement. It was signed Nov. 16 by the Democratic
Unionist Party and Sudan People's Liberation Army and followed
several failed efforts by Mahdi to come to terms with the rebels.
   Despite support for the agreement from across the Sudanese
political spectrum except for the fundamentalist National Islamic
Front, Mahdi stalled until too late to convene a constitutional
peace conference Dec. 31, as the agreement required. The Democratic
Unionists quit the coalition.
   Most observers in Sudan see Mahdi's refusal to act on the peace
agreement was an attempt to satisfy the fundamentalist coalition
partner at the expense of the centrist Democratic Unionists.
   The Islamic Front flatly rejected the pact because it would
freeze the country's legal code, which is based on Islam's
1,350-year-old code of ethics and laws by which Moslems are supposed
to live.
   ``El-Mahdi is like someone trying to ride two horses. No one
knows how long he can keep this up,'' said Beshir. ``We need
immediate action, but it doesn't look like el-Mahdi will provide it
soon.''
   As tensions built, the prime minister announced that salaries
were being increased by up to 500 percent, then followed the news
two days later with steep price increases on sugar and cigarettes
and a 15 percent sales tax on locally manufactured commodities.
   ``If the people had been hopeful on peace, maybe the government
would have gotten away with the price increases,'' the Western
diplomat said. ``This way, they just made the people too angry to
sit and take it any more.''
   The street violence enticed the government to roll back the price
increases and make the salary increases retroactive to July 1, and
the disturbances slowly stopped.
   ``It was all very Sudanese to see how things all went back to
normal on Saturday, with the usual terrible traffic and people at
their desks,'' said the diplomat. ``It looked like all hell had
broken loose on Thursday, and there was chaos.''
   Indicative of restiveness in the army was that the generals
refused to honor Mahdi's request that they intervene to help police
put down the trouble.
   ``The military refused to get involved,'' said a Western military
source. ``The price increases affected the military as well, and
they didn't like it a bit.''
   The foreign expert said the Sudanese military viewed the
tentative agreement as ``a means to end the war, but Sadek didn't
take it.
   The current government is the third reshuffle since Mahdi was
elected in April 1986, after Mahdi brought in the National Islamic
Front last year as a counter to his traditional enemy, the
Democratic Unionists.

<HEAD>Fighting Intensifies Between Rival Milities in Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias blasted each
other with gunfire Tuesday as fighting intensified in the sector of
Beirut where the 15 Western hostages are believed held, and in
southern Lebanon.
   Police said nine people were killed and 19 wounded on the fourth
straight day of clashes between the pro-Syrian Amal, Arabic for
``hope,'' and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or ``party of God.''
   The latest deaths brought the casualty toll to 29 killed and 66
wounded since the violence began Saturday, said a police spokesman,
who demanded anonymity. It was the heaviest fighting between the two
militias since November.
   Amal and Hezbollah gunners lobbed mortar and gun shells at each
other in south Beirut's Shiyah district as militiamen staged
hit-and-run grenade attacks, the police spokesman said.
   Amal mounted a barrage of tank fire on Hezbollah strongholds in
the Hajjaj neighborhood, but ``but our fighters turned back the
attack,'' Hezbollah said.
   Hezbollah fighters wearing black headbands defended sandbagged
positions in the Ghobeiri and Moawadd districts, which face
Amal-controlled territory.
   Syrian peacekeeping troops in south Beirut appeared to be making
no moves to stop the fighting.
   ``The Syrians ... only call on the combatants through
loudspeakers to cease firing, but fighting starts again once the
Syrian officers leave the area,'' said Abu Ali Jouma, a south Beirut
resident who fled his apartment.
   Jouma said he was taking his wife and three children ``to stay
with relatives in west Beirut until this is over.''
   Syrian troops had ``taken adequate security precautions'' to
prevent the fighting from spreading to west Beirut, according to a
source at the Syrian military command, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The source said ``no military crackdown on either side is
contemplated at the moment.''
   It was the heaviest fighting since November between Amal and
Hezbollah in their struggle to dominate Lebanon's 1 million Shiite
Moslems, the country's largest sect. The street battles in November
left 40 people dead and 87 wounded.
   The police spokesman said there was not way of knowing whether
the fighting had affected the 15 Western hostages believed held by
members of Hezbollah in the slums of south Beirut. The hostages
include nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a
Belgian.
   In an effort to end a three-week bloodbath in May between Amal
and Hezbollah that left nearly 300 people dead and 1,000 wounded,
the Syrians sent 4,500 troops to the slums that stretch across more
than 16 square miles.
   Syria also has 7,500 troops in west Beirut and 25,000 soldiers in
northern and eastern Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate to
halt the 14-year-old civil war between Lebanon's Christians and
Moslems.
   The Syrian military presence does not include the villages in
southern Lebanon.
   On Tuesday, Amal and Hezbollah gunners traded howitzer shells in
five villages in southern Lebanon near the self-designated security
zone Israel patrols just north of its border, a police spokesman
said.
   Smoke billowed from houses hit by howitzers in Jbaa, Ein Bouswar,
Jarjou, Arab Saleem and Louwaizeh, said a resident of the town of
Nabatiyeh, reached by telephone from Beirut.
   Most civilians left the villages more than two years ago, after
Hezbollah set up guerrilla bases there for launching attacks against
Israeli troops in the security zone and against pro-Israeli
militiamen in Lebanon.

   The Soviet bloc made concessions in human
rights reforms and allowed better monitoring of compliance in the
draft version of the Helsinki Conference's final accord presented to
the members Tuesday.
   Western diplomats hailed the document as including landmark
agreements, including greatly enhanced freedoms for Soviet bloc
citizens to travel, emigrate, circulate and receive information,
practice religion and reunite with relatives in the West.
   The document unexpectedly contained firm dates for a disputed
human rights conference in Moscow, tentatively scheduled from Oct.
22 to Nov. 15, 1991. It includes one key U.S. and British
requirement for agreeing to a Moscow conference _ a commitment by
hosts of such meetings for free access to the forums.
   The draft, worked by nine neutral and non-aligned nations at the
Vienna forum was introduced to a closed-door meeting of delegations
Tuesday. Diplomatic sources afterward made a copy available to The
Associated Press.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has recommended that
President Reagan accept a Soviet proposal to hold the conference, a
U.S. official said. If Reagan takes Shultz's advice, the stage also
will be set for a new round of East-West negotiations to reduce
conventional troops, tanks and artillery in Europe.
   The consensus of all 35 nations _ the United States, Canada, the
Soviet Union and all European states bar Albania _ is required for
final accord at the Vienna meeting, which opened in November 1986.
The meeting's purpose is to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki
Accords on humanitarian issues, including human rights.
   Diplomats from both the Soviet bloc and the West said a first
glance at the draft document indicated it could serve as the basis
of a final agreement in time for foreign ministers of all states
present to meet in Vienna Jan. 17-19, as suggested by Austria.
   Outstanding difficulties however include:
   _ East German objections to a requirement to phase out minimum
currency exchange requirements for foreign visitors. East Germany
earns millions of dollars in hard currency each year from visiting
West Germans required to exchange such sums;
   _ Continuing difficulty over the precise zone within Turkey to be
included in new talks on conventional security from the Atlantic to
the Urals. Diplomats hope to resolve this this week.
   _ Last-minute insistence by Cyprus that a follow-up meeting on
the peaceful settlement of disputes be held in Nicosia. This has
drawn objections from Turkey.
   The Soviet Union and its allies are still not ready to guarantee
completely free emigration or to dismiss the idea ``that it is
legitimate to put people in prison for what they say or what they
believe,'' U.S. ambassador to the conference Warren Zimmermann said
in an interview last week.
   But the proposal of a Moscow human rights conference and Kremlin
conduct at the Vienna forum have shown that ``the Soviet Union has
elected to put human rights at the top of its own agenda,''
Zimmermann said.
   On Tuesday, Zimmermann declined to comment on the draft document
until he has studied it thoroughly.
   The draft document provides for the solution of all outstanding
emigration cases at the latest six months after the Vienna
conference ends.
   It also says citizens who may be prevented from emigrating on
grounds of national security _ a frequent reason given for refusing
Soviet exit visas _ shall in the future be informed of the exact
restrictions their work might place on foreign travel.
   The draft outlines plans for annual conferences on human rights
in each year before the next Helsinki review conference, due in
Helsinki in 1992.
   The human rights conferences will take place in Paris May 30-June
23, in Copenhagen June 5 to July 29, 1990 and in Moscow, according
to the draft document.
   The final accord is to include a separate mandate worked out by
the 16 NATO nations and seven Warsaw Pact countries for new
23-nation talks on reducing conventional forces and weapons in
Europe.
   Those talks are to replace negotiations on Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction which have been going on in Vienna without agreement
since 1973.

   The Ministry of Civil Affairs has become China's
first government agency to hire employess on the basis of a civil
service examination, an official report said Tuesday.
   The ministry has employes 30 of nearly 900 people who responded
to a public notice announcing the exam, the China News Service said
in a report that appeared in Hong Kong newspapers Tuesday. It did
not say what the test contained.
   Most applicants were about 35 years old, had post-high school
education and were working at small- to medium-sized enterprises,
the report said.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang proposed a civil service system
last year to make the government more efficient. The functions of
party and government officials often overlap in China, where
political connections frequently play a key role in obtaining jobs.
   Last month, the southern province of Guangdong held the country's
first large-scale civil service exam, in which 120,000 applicants
participated.

   Police have arrested nine people and detained five
others for heroin trafficking, an official report said Tuesday.
   About 160 people, including state employees, were implicated in a
drug operation in Baoji City, in northern Shaanxi province, the
China Daily said.
   It said authorities seized about 15 pounds of heroin worth more
than $189,000 and located 12 locations for processing the drug, the
report said.
   It said the heroin came from Gansu province, about 180 miles west
of Baoji. Smugglers reportedly use southern China routes to
transport heroin from Burma, Laos and Thailand to Hong Kong, but
reported cases of heroin use in China are rare.
   The report did not say whether the heroin was sold to Chinese or
was destined for the international market.

   Two barges carrying oil caught fire and exploded
on the Yangtze River, killing one firefighter and leaving seven
other people missing, official news reports said.
   The Xinhua News Agency said the fire on one of the barges had
been extinguished as of Tuesday afternoon but the other was still
burning.
   The fires broke out Monday about 50 miles upstream from Wuhan,
capital of Hubei province, blocking all traffic on China's longest
waterway, it said.
   The fires on the barges, part of a fleet belonging to the
Nanking-Yangtze Oil Shipping Co., started simultaneously, Xinhua
reported.
   One firefighter was killed and eight others were injured while
fighting the fires, and seven other people were still missing, it
said. It was not immediately clear whether the missing people were
firefighters.
   The fire spread across the width of the oil-slicked river where
the two explosions took place, halting river traffic for several
hours, the news agency said.
   The fire, one of the most serious ever on the waterway, caused
damages estimated at $2.7 million, it said. The cause was still
under investigation, Xinhua said.

   President-elect Bush swore in new senators in
one of his last official duties as presiding officer of the Senate
on Tuesday, then renewed ``loud and clear'' a campaign pledge
against new taxes.
   The vice president gave the oath of office to 32 senators elected
last fall and to one appointed senator, Dan Coats, R-Ind., who was
named to replace Vice president-elect Dan Quayle.
   Speaking with reporters after a picture-taking session, Bush said
he intended to work with Congress ``to solve the defcit'' but would
hold fast to his oft-repeated campaign pledge against supporting a
tax increase.
   ``It's funny, I've talked to about 33 new senators and not one of
them has said that to me,'' Bush said when asked if a possible tax
increase had been discussed.
   He said of his campaign pledge, ``The American people have heard
it loud and clear.''
   Despite Bush's comments, many Democrats and some Republicans
believe he will have to change his mind to win agreement on a
comprehensive plan to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Bush's appearance at the largely ceremonial first Senate session
of the new Congress was has next-to-last expected official duty as
the Senate's constitutional presiding officer.
   He was to preside again on Wednesday in a joint session of
Congress called to formally count the electoral votes that delivered
Bush the presidency in last November's election.
   After swearing in members in groups of four in the Senate
chamber, Bush recreated the scene individually for most of the newly
elected and re-elected senators in the ornate Old Senate Chamber
down the hall from the present one.
   He posed with senators and their families and joked with
reporters and photographers, at one pont ``swearing in'' in jest a
group of photographers.
   ``I'm going to make a little news up here for you guys,'' Bush
joked.
   However, when asked about whether he planned to resist a subpoena
to testify in the trial of former White House aide Oliver North,
Bush retorted: ``I don't want to make that much news.''
   Bush also met privately with Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill.
   John Sununu, Bush's incoming chief of staff, said the session was
to discuss ``a few loose ends'' and was set up at Crane's request.
Bob Foster, a Crane aide, said that the congressman had ``requested
the meeting to talk about legislation,'' including trade measures.
   Crane is the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means trade
subcommittee. ``They knew each other when Bush served in Congress
and he (Crane) just wanted to see him since he was up here. It won't
be that easy to see him (Bush) once he becomes president,'' Sununu
said.
   The vice president still has one Cabinet post to fill, that of
energy secretary, and he has not yet filled the ``drug czar''
position created by Congress last year.
   Bush aides said they expected announcements on these posts ater
this week.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Suspends Aid To Refugee Camp After Suspicious Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. agency has suspended aid to a
refugee camp run by the Khmer Rouge after a fire at a medical clinic
prompted security concerns, an aid official said Tuesday.
   Security personnel informed the U.N. Border Relief Operation that
the clinic at the O'Trao camp, controlled by the Cambodian
guerrillas, was damaged by a Dec. 24 fire, the official said.
   After the blaze, the U.N. agency and private volunteer groups
under its protection stopped supplies and visits to the camp, said
the aid official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The clinic was run by Thailand's Catholic Office For Emergency
Relief and Refugees.
   ``The Thai authorities asked us not to go there for security
reasons,'' the official said.
   O'Trao, in northeastern Sisaket province near the Cambodian
border, houses about 17,000 refugees. It is one of four U.N.-aided
refugee camps controlled by the communist Khmer Rouge, who have been
charged with widespread human rights violations against refugees.
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest of three guerrilla groups fighting
the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government.
   The official said the cause of the blaze at the clinic was not
known. He said it might have been set by radical Khmer Rouge
guerrillas unhappy that increasing numbers of refugees have had
access to the Western-influenced clinic.
   The official said that a few days before the fire, a Cambodian
medic had been shot and seriously wounded at the O'Trao clinic.
   The Khmer Rouge recently have moved at least 5,000 refugees out
of O'Trao. Aid officials said the guerrillas apparently planned to
use the refugees to populate areas of Cambodia from which Vietnamese
troops have withdrawn.
   The Vietnamese and Cambodian government forces have staged border
attacks to stop the resettlement, diplomatic sources said.
   On Jan. 1, a shell crashed into a house at the U.N.-assisted Site
8 refugee camp, killing a woman and her child and seriously injuring
her husband, officials said. Another woman suffered head cuts.
   Site 8, the largest camp run by the Khmer rouge, houses about
35,000 refugees from the Cambodian civil war and is near the border.

   Farmers who do not have an approved
conservation plan for highly erodible land have less than a year in
which to comply, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The plans, subject to USDA approval, are blueprints for managing
and reducing erosion of highly susceptible land.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said farmers must have their conservation plans approved by
the end of 1989 to remain eligible for USDA program benefits.
   Most farmers who still need a conservation plan will receive
written notice from local agency offices within the next few weeks,
he said.
   About 65 percent of the nation's farmers who participate in USDA
crop programs already have obtained approval for their conservation
plans, Scaling said. But an estimated 800,000 have not yet done so.
   ``We know some farmers are holding off because they are afraid
the rules for erosion reduction were too rigid,'' Scaling said.
``That's a misconception. The final rule provides for flexibility in
reaching acceptable erosion reductions base on local conditions and
standards in field office technical guides.''
   Farmers who have highly erodible land and fail to develop
acceptable plans stand to lose USDA farm program benefits, including
price and income supports, crop insurance, Farmers Home
Administration loans, Commodity Credit Corp. storage payments,
Conservation Reserve Program annual payments and other benefits.
   Scaling said farmers who do not have plans approved by Dec. 31,
1989, will forfeit benefits on all the land they farm, not just on
the highly erodible acres.

<HEAD>Panel Conditionally Approves Evacuation Plans For 17 N.H. Towns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government licensing panel said Tuesday it
refused to believe teachers would abandon pupils in an emergency and
had conditionally approved evacuation plans for 17 New Hampshire
towns around the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   The $5.6 billion plant was completed two years ago and operation
has been held up in disputes over the adequacy of the evacuation
plan.
   A three-member panel of the commission's Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board said, in a 290-page decision dated Friday and
released Tuesday, it found ``reasonable assurance that adequate
protective measures can and will be taken within the New Hampshire
portion'' of the evacuation zone.
   Four conditions were attached to the approval. Three seemed
technical: state submission to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency of satisfactory personnel rosters for workers at emergency
reception centers, extended hours at one center if necessary for
decontamination of workers arriving from the other three centers
after those centers close, and confirmation that promised plan
revisions had in fact been made.
   The fourth requires resolution of an omission in forecasts of
road traffic in an emergency: traffic of people going from jobs in
the evacuation zone to nearby homes.
   Tuesday's decision was hailed by backers of the plant. Opponents
said they would appeal.
   ``This is very good news,'' said Ron Sher, spokesman for the
plant. ``We were quite certain the plans would be approved,'' said
Richard Strome, head of the state's Emergency Management Agency.
   On the other side, Jane Doughty, spokeswoman for the Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League, said, ``They have no basis to ignore that
sworn testimony'' that teachers would leave. She added: ``It's human
nature to take care of your family first.''
   Six Massachusetts towns lie in the Seabrook zone, but that state
has refused to participate in the planning on the grounds that it
would be impossible to move crowds off the beaches near the plant in
an emergency.
   The plant lead owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, has
submitted a plan for Massachusetts for which the board still has to
schedule public hearings.
   On Nov. 18, President Reagan gave FEMA authority to draw up such
plans and carry them out if a state refuses the job.
   In hearings last summer, the board heard testimony from 13
teachers working in the evacuation zone that ``the teachers would
promptly leave the schools and their pupils in order to care for
their own children and other dependents,'' and they believed other
teachers would do so, too.
   There was similar testimony from some officials of the five New
Hampshire towns that have refused to take part in planning.
   ``We must recognize that these claims were made with the
knowledge that Seabrook has yet to be licensed, and that its
licensing may still be prevented,'' the decision said.
   The panel said 597 teachers working in the zone signed a petition
stating they ``do not accept the conflict of duty which the
emergency response plan assigns us.''
   ``The concept of abandoning their children was not expressed to
them when their signatures were gathered,'' the decision said.
   ``The board does not accept the implied conclusion of the
teachers' testimony that virtually all of the teachers in the (zone)
will abruptly abandon their pupils without even pausing to account
for them and seeing them to a school bus,'' it said. ``We would
expect teachers to perform better than the general population in an
emergency.''
   The board said it relied heavily on expert testimony that trained
workers with well-defined emergency roles do not generally leave
their jobs, and on testimony by Dennis S. Miletti, professor of
sociology at Colorado State University, that experience in
hurricanes and other disasters shows that crises ``elicit altruistic
public behavior'' in which a ``therapeutic community'' is formed.

<HEAD>Bomb Threats Cause Four Unscheduled Landings, Delay Two Departures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bomb threats against airlines in the wake of the Flight 103
disaster prompted four unscheduled landings, delayed three
departures and kept security tight in Asia and Europe on Tuesday.
   The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, T. Allen
McArtor, told U.S. airline representatives in London to have ``a
heightened level of security on all American flights operating out
of European and Middle Eastern airports.''
   A bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21, sending the Boeing
747 crashing into the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all 259
aboard and 11 on the ground.
   Two Air-India planes made unscheduled landings at airports in
Indonesia and Malaysia on Tuesday after receiving warnings that
bombs were on board, but no bombs were found in either plane, the
officials said.
   An Air-India Boeing 747, flying from Sydney, Australia, to
Singapore with 281 people aboard, landed at Ngurah Ray International
Airport in Bali, Indonesia, Tuesday afternoon.
   Authorities received a warning that an explosive device had been
planted on board, said Widiana, a security officer at the airport.
The Boeing 747's final destination was Bombay, India.
   Earlier Tuesday, an Air-India Airbus carrying 137 passengers on a
flight to Madras, India, returned to Subang International Airport in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, after a bomb warning also turned out to be a
hoax, officials said.
   Many Asian airlines have tightened security precautions after a
warning that terrorists plan to hijack or blow up a commercial
airliner in the region this month.
   An Alitalia DC-9 was on a flight from Paris to Venice late Monday
when Munich air controllers told the pilot of an anonymous bomb
threat. The pilot decided to land at Zurich's Kloten airport, where
the plane was searched before resuming its trip Tuesday.
   A Tunis Air Boeing 737 was on a flight from Geneva to Tunis late
Monday when it was forced to land in Milan, Italy, because of a bomb
threat. The plane was searched and took off on Tuesday.
   An anonymous caller to a Pan Am booking agent Tuesday delayed a
flight from New York to Buenos Aires for two hours Tuesday during a
stopover in Rio de Janeiro, said the privately owned Jornal do
Brasil radio.
   The caller reportedly telephoned the airline and said a bomb was
aboard. Airport police took all passengers off the plane, which was
searched. Nothing was found and the plane was allowed to continue on
to Buenos Aires, the radio said.
   Another anonymous threat forced 30 passengers of an
Istanbul-bound Pan Am Boeing 727 off the plane while the plane was
searched. They spent Monday night at Geneva hotels before continuing
Tuesday morning.
   About 170 British children returning from a Swiss holiday were
evacuated from a 727 of the British charter airline Dan Air on
Monday. Geneva police received a telephone call from a man who said
security forces had 15 minutes to empty the plane.
   Police said the caller identified himself as a member of the
Irish Republican Army. A search turned up nothing.
   ``In most cases, such calls prove to be a hoax,'' said Peter
Gutknecht. spokesman at Kloten airport. ``But we have to take every
threat seriously. Unfortunately, publicizing them will encourage
pranksters.''
   Gutknecht said security measures at Swiss airports ``continue to
be very stringent and can hardly be improved.''
   Scandinavian Airlines System, alarmed by a bomb threat reportedly
from an Iranian Shiite Moslem group, maintained the highest alert in
its history Tuesday, causing flight delays for the third day.

   For freshman Rep. Ronald K. Machtley, who made
a national splash in November as the only challenger to defeat a
House chairman, it didn't take long on his first day in Congress
Tuesday to savor the perks of office.
   ``Look, there's Cooter,'' he told his family during their walk to
the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol when he spied a fellow
newcomer, Rep. Ben Jones, a Georgia Democrat best known for his
portrayal on television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' of the good ole
boy Cooter. ``I've met him. He's a nice guy.''
   It's like that in Washington for members of Congress, who are big
fish at home but in the capital are just one of 535 lawmakers, most
of whom have little notoriety.
   Machtley, R-R.I., is unlikely to immediately acquire the clout of
the man he defeated two months ago, 14-term veteran Democratic Rep.
Fernand J. St Germain, the chairman of the House Banking Committee.
For now, he's starting at the bottom, a member of the minority party
in the House and with no seniority, either.
   His surprising victory over St Germain, by a 56-44 percent
margin, came in his first try for public office, and made him one of
just six challengers to defeat an incumbent. Machtley is one of just
33 freshmen in the 435-member House.
   ``I accept that I won't go down there and turn Congress
upside-down legislatively,'' the 40-year-old lawyer said last week
from his office in Newport, R.I. ``But I have the educational
background so that I'll do a good job.''
   Machtley, a Naval Academy graduate who went on to become an
attorney, defeated St Germain after a campaign in which he took
popular positions in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, such as
favoring a woman's right to abortion and reduced spending on
President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile defense proposal.
   He was also boosted by his rival's ethics problems, which
centered on accusations that St Germain had accepted favors from
lobbyists. The Justice Department and House Ethics Committee have
studied those allegations but never moved against St Germain.
   ``I've tried to be realistic,'' he says. ``I've said I'd go down
and try to put people first and my own wealth second, and that I'd
do the best I can.''
   His work began Tuesday, a day that featured much pomp and
circumstance but little of substance.
   He and his wife Kati, who for now are staying with their two
children at a local hotel, began their day working out in an
exercise room at 8 a.m.
   He was in his Longworth House Office Building suite across the
street from the Capitol an hour later. Like most freshmen, he faces
an early-session case of chaos, since he has almost no office
equipment, a bare desk and empty bookshelves, and still gets lost a
lot.
   ``I'm learning my way around,'' he said.
   A few family members gathered in his office, and his wife,
children, parents and mother-in-law accompanied him to the Capitol
to watch a two-hour session of the House that culminated in members
taking the oath of office.
   ``It's a real big deal,'' concluded his 12-year-old daughter,
Erin.
   Then it was back to his Longworth office, where a small group of
lobbyists, staff and other lawmakers dined on cold cuts, soda, beer
and wine, and mingled with relatives who told of the days Machtley,
while in the Naval Academy, earned spare change by diving for balls
in golf course ponds, polishing them up and selling them.
   ``I was the one who had to clean them,'' said his younger sister,
Susan Carl.
   Above the din of the reception, Machtley juggled interviews with
Rhode Island reporters and posed for photographs with his family. It
was all interrupted by a strange series of loud buzzes, a well-known
sound to the ears of Capitol Hill veterans.
   ``What is that?'' he asked his aides.
   It turned out to be the signal used to summon members to the
House floor for a vote.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced today he would
not seek re-election in 1990, but added, without elaboration, that
he aimed to continue working in public service.
   ``This will be my last term as governor of Massachusetts,'' he
told a crowded news conference.
   Though he lost the presidential race two months ago, Dukakis said
that loss had little impact on his decision. Even if he had not run
for president, he said, he probably would have not sought an
unprecedented fourth four-year term.
   He gave no immediate indication of his long-term plans, including
whether he would seek the presidency again in 1992 or seek any other
elective office. Asked for a hint to his future, Dukakis would say
only, ``Public policy and public service is what I'm all about, it's
what I love.''
   He said he intended to spend the last two years of his term
fulfilling his responsibilities, wrapping up his programs and
working to make certain he was succeeded by a Democrat. He said he
would announce his legislative agenda later this week. He did not
endorse anyone as his successor.
   Dukakis said he would miss the governorship, but had no regrets,
``It's one of those moments. ... There's a certain sadness. I've
loved this job,'' he said.
   Dukakis' announcement comes at a time when Massachusetts is
facing a fiscal squeeze. He has acknowledged a shortfall of at least
$600 million for the current fiscal year in the state budget, which
totals $11.6 billion. He has ordered spending cuts but has not said
whether he will seek new taxes.
   In recent weeks, Dukakis had been urged by fellow Democrats to
announce his plans so they could begin making their political plans
for the governorship.
   ``One has to make a decision; I've made that decision,'' he said.
   ``It seemed to me desirable to make the decision now, rather than
later,'' he added.
   At age 55, Dukakis is midway through his third four-year term as
governor of Massachusetts. He has already served longer as the
state's governor than any of his predecessors.
   He was first elected to the Massachusetts governorship in 1974,
then lost the Democratic primary when he sought re-election four
years later. But he won back the post in 1982 and was re-elected in
a landslide in 1986.
   During the second week of December, Dukakis took a week-long
vacation, his first since the presidential election, in Florida.
   Before leaving, Dukakis said he planned to spend some of his
vacation time reflecting on the campaign against Republican George
Bush and on his own plans for the future.
   In the past few weeks, speculation has mounted about Dukakis and
his plans, with some saying he would seek a rematch with Bush in
1992, or would run for governor again, or would drop out of politics
for some sort of academic position.
   In a recent poll, Dukakis appeared to enjoy a commanding lead in
popularity statewide compared with such likely Democratic
challengers as Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn. The survey, taken by
Dukakis' political operation, said he would defeat Flynn to a margin
of 67 percent to 27 percent if the gubernatorial election were now.
   In his interview two weeks ago, Dukakis said he wanted to make
the next two years ``the best two years the state has ever had.''
But he gave no hint of how that goal might relate to his political
plans.

<UNK>$1 Million Checks A `Bad Joke'</UNK>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The timing was right, just after Christmas and
about the date that income tax forms arrive. But everything else was
phony about the $1 million checks sent to a dozen people nationwide,
say Postal Service officials.
   They regard the hoax as such a bad joke that they don't plan to
pursue it.
   According to bank and postal authorities, someone in the Phoenix
area found a packet of checks from a discontinued account, wrote the
checks and marked them ``sweepstakes winners'' in imitation of a
television commercial, then used envelopes bearing the return
address of various companies to mail them.
   Officials of First Interstate Bank told one victim of the hoax
that about a dozen people had called about the checks. Officials
declined to release the recipients' names.
   The checks were signed ``Percy Eubanks Jr.''
   Percy Eubanks Sr. said his son, who once worked for a fast-food
restaurant here, had closed the First Interstate account months ago.
   The phone number listed on the checks for the younger Eubanks has
been reassigned to Virginia Hughes, who said she had received four
or five calls.
   Ms. Hughes said one of her call came from Bonnie Benson of
Barnesville, Ohio, who said she called the bank as well.
   ``You don't sneeze at a million dollars. You never know,'' Ms.
Benson said.
   She said she believes the prankster got her name and address from
an advertisement she ran in a national club's newsletter.
   Bonnie Baker, an employee of The Arizona Republic, tipped
reporters from her newspaper after receiving a check herself. She
said she got hers in a subscription-payment envelope for Phoenix
Newspapers Inc.
   ``I would like to go and deposit it. You know it's not true, but
deep down you hope it is, kind of like the old `Millionaire' TV
series,'' Ms. Baker said.
   The perpetrator of the joke mailed the envelopes using
magazine-selection stamps rather than U.S. postage stamps, the women
said. However, the stamps were canceled, and the envelopes were
delivered.
   The U.S. Postal Inspector's Office and Phoenix police said they
didn't plan to pursue the case because it was so obviously a hoax
that they would have difficulty proving criminal intent.

<HEAD>Abrams Admits Mistake in Contra Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top State Department official for Latin
American policy said in a farewell interview released Tuesday that
the Reagan administration made a mistake in mouse and Senate on Tuesday,
but President-elect Bush administered
at least one oath that wasn't on the schedule.
   Bush, soon to be the nation's 41st president, turned to the
photographers surrounding him in the Old Senate Chamber and asked
them raise their right hands and to swear an oath _ an oath of good
conduct during his administration.
   The moment came in a banter-filled pause during the ceremonial
reenactment of the oath of office for senators.
   At one point, Bush turned to reporters and announced: ``I'm going
to make a little news up here for you guys.''
   He was then asked if he planned to contest his subpoena to
testify at the Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide Oliver
L. North.
   ``I'm not going to make that much news,'' Bush replied.
   Although most senators eagerly strode down the Senate aisle to
take the oath to ``preserve and protect the Constitution of the
United States against all enemies foreign and domestic,'' there was
one prominent absentee.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., postponed taking the oath so he
could be in Providence, R.I., to watch his son, Patrick, take his
own oath of office as a member of the Rhode Island Legislature.
   ``That's something that as a proud father he could not miss,''
said Melody Miller, a Kennedy staff member.
   In both House and Senate there was much talk of bipartisan
cooperation with the incoming Bush administration. Dozens of
senators walked up to Bush who was seated in the presiding officer's
chair in the Senate to shake his hand and wish him well.
   ``Because President-elect Bush has served in this House, I am
encouraged that he will exhibit appreciation for the constitutional
responsibilities of the Congress and will seek avenues of
cooperation,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   Wright was re-elected speaker, 253 to 170 in the
Democratic-controlled House, and his vanquished opponent, House
Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois, announced achievement of a
record.
   Michel said he is ``the first man in our history to suffer the
indignity of losing this contest for speaker five times in a row.''
   He also had a wish list.
   ``We should ban proxy voting, reduce the numbers of
subcommittees, cut staff, cut spending, halt abuses of franked
(free) mail, stop campaigning at taxpayers' expense and, most
importantly, blow the doors off this chamber and let in the clean,
fresh air of open debate.''
   Scores of members' small children dressed in their
starched-and-pressed finest were on hand as the House opened its
session precisely at noon.
   But soon some were squirming in their parents' laps or crawling
over the seat backs and along the floor.
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., placed a toddler on the Republican
committee table. The child walked along its length, holding onto the
congressman's lapels for support.
   Outside the chamber members stood in long lines to pick up their
electronic voting cards and the lapel pins that identify them as
members of Congress, authorized to enter the Capitol without walking
through metal detectors.
   One freshman congressman, Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., was seen,
still wearing a charcoal gray topcoat, standing in a sixth-floor
corridor of the Longworth House Office Building.
   He was looking at directional signs and muttering to himself.
   ``Sixteeen-oh-five, 1605,'' Poshard said. ``It's got to be around
here somewhere. Which way?''
   A reporter escorted the new congressman to his new office.
   In the Senate, children and other senatorial relatives and
friends were confined to the galleries, filling every seat.
   Lady Bird Johnson, sitting near her daughter Lynda, watched
son-in-law Charles Robb take the oath of office as a U.S. senator
from Virginia.
   The ceremony occurred on the 40th anniversary of the day her
husband, the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, first took his oath
as a U.S. senator.
   The Senate chamber was resplendent.
   Since the 100th Congress adjourned in October a patterned,
dark-blue carpet had been laid down, the presiding officer's chair
framed with a backdop of gold curtains bordered with blue and red,
and the staff benches in the corners of the chamber upholstered in
brilliant scarlet.
   ``It's obviously all been done for television,'' Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., told a group of constituents.
   The convening of the Bicentennial 101st Congress _ 200 years
after the first Congress got things going in 1789 _ marked a
changing of the guard in the Senate.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, is taking over as majority leader
from Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Byrd, about to become chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
said the burdens of leadership had been lifted.
   ``The bags under my eyes are gone,'' he said. ``I'm enjoying the
quality of life.''
   Mitchell said he is challenged by his new responsibilities.
   ``I'm not only learning something new every day; I'm learning
something new every 10 or 15 minurtes,'' he said.
   One new senator, Republican Conrad Burns of Montana, came to
Washington from his only other public office: Commissioner of
Yellowstone County.
   What are the differences between the two jobs?
   ``Bigger zeroes,'' Burns replied.''

   Five cents won't get you a cup of
coffee at Wilson Cain's coffee shop anymore, but patrons of the
Southside Pharmacy Coffee Shoppe have been over-tipping for 25 years
anyway, Cain says.
   Cain raised the price of his coffee to 50 cents a cup on Monday.
   ``I have given you coffee for 25 years at five cents a cup. Due
to inflation, it's time to start paying for coffee. The new 25-year
price will be 50 cents,'' Cain told customers in a sign posted
behind the cash register.
   ``I swore I'd never do it,'' said Cain, who's also a city
councilman. ``It's the clientele I've got that looks at me and says
`Hey, your coffee is too cheap.' They forced me. Most of them would
leave a tip that was greater than the cost of the coffee.''
   Customer Rebecca Looney agreed that the price hike was justified.
``It's just paying for all the cups I drank before,'' she said.

   A fierce legal battle is shaping up in El
Paso County's courthouse _ not between litigants, but between two
district judges who covet the same courtroom.
   One judge got so steamed up Monday that he threatened to hold
court under a tree to make his point _ and this desert city is not
known for an abundance of trees.
   The gavel started to fall Friday, when newly elected District
Judge Jose Troche went home thinking his papers, books and other
property were stowed safely in the sixth-floor office of his
predecessor, Ward Koehler.
   One of Koehler's last acts as district judge was to decree that
Troche would get his old office and courtroom. The one-page order
was posted on the office door Friday.
   But Monday morning, Troche got a rude surprise _ in place of
Koehler's order was the nameplate of Koehler's former political
rival, Judge Peter Peca Jr. Some of Troche's files and papers had
been stacked on a table in a jury room down the hall; others were
stashed in Peca's former second-floor office, and even in a trash
can.
   Troche and Koehler were outraged.
   ``Judge Peca has resorted to some awfully highhanded tactics to
try to take over the courtroom,'' said Koehler.
   Peca, on the other hand, considers the courtroom his due. El Paso
has 11 district judges and 10 courtrooms. For the past two years,
Peca had been like a loser at a game of musical chairs, banging his
gavel in whichever courtroom happened to be free. Now, he said, he
has seniority.
   ``Troche is a new judge,'' he said. ``He can take his turn
without a courtroom.''
   Troche has asked county commissioners to intervene in his behalf.
In the meantime, he's scheduled a plea in the disputed courtroom.
   ``We're going to take the plea,'' he said. ``Even if we have to
do it under a tree someplace, we're going to do it.''

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Bess Myerson's boyfriend Carl
``Andy'' Capasso asked a federal judge Tuesday to recommend that he
be moved to a halfway house to help him earn money and deal with
family problems.
   Capasso, 43, a millionaire contractor, has been in a Lewisburg,
Pa., prison since pleading guilty to federal tax evasion charges in
January 1988.
   He was acquitted Dec. 22 along with Ms. Myerson, 64, a former
Miss America who was the city's cultural affairs commissioner, of an
alleged divorce-fixing scheme.
   Defense attorney Jay Goldberg asked U.S. District Judge Charles
E. Stewart to recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Capasso be
moved to a minimum security facility in midtown Manhattan which
provides a transition for prisoners re-entering society. Capasso is
scheduled to be released from prison June 26.
   ``There is a family crisis involving the children,'' said
Goldberg.
   Capasso has two children, 16 and 14, and three grown
stepchildren. Goldberg told the judge that the 16-year-old,
particularly, suffered because of the latest trial.
   Capasso also needs to earn money to pay a $500,000 fine, Goldberg
said.
   ``We're dealing with a nonviolent offender who erred with respect
to his income tax,'' the lawyer said.
   The judge said he would consider the request.
   The government is opposed to any action by the judge, said David
Lawrence, deputy chief of the U.S. attorney's criminal division.
``We think it's inappropriate,'' he said of the request.
   ``We think it's for the Bureau of Prisons to decide (without a
judge's recommendation) where Mr. Capasso should spend the remainder
of his six months. The family situation, the business situation, has
been raised time and time again before the court,'' he said.

<HEAD>Doctors Offer Mixed Reviews on AMA Plan for Treatment Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by the American Medical Association to
develop treatment guidelines for doctors may lead to ``cookbook
medicine,'' one critic said Tuesday, but supporters contended
medical care could improve.
   ``What this plan may do is encourage doctors to learn more about
what works and what doesn't work and do it in a more structured
way,'' said Harold Luft, a professor of health economics at the
University of California at San Francisco and a supporter of the
plan.
   But critics said the guidelines could hamper doctors in their
treatment of patients.
   ``The standards will either be inordinately vague to the point of
being unacceptable (or) if they are strict the AMA is likely to
disown them,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public
Citizens Health Research Group in Washington, D.C.
   Under the AMA plan, announced last month, clinical experts in
medical specialties will issue guidelines on appropriate treatments
for various problems, said Dr. John Kelly, director of the
Chicago-based organization's newly created office of quality
assurance.
   Research on patient health will be used to develop the
recommendations, said Kelly, a California emergency-care physician.
   The first guidelines, to be issued by the end of 1989, probably
will deal with areas in which the preferred treatment is still
unclear, Kelly said. A condition such as clogged coronary arteries,
for example, has several rival therapies.
   The goal is to provide doctors with better information on
treatment choices, he said.
   ``What we believe is if the guidelines are credible, physicians
will follow them. If a physician chooses to practice outside of what
the guidelines are, he may have to document why he does it,'' Kelly
said.
   ``The question is, are they going to be precise guidelines or are
they going to be `anything goes'?'' asked Wolfe.
   ``This may lead to cookbook medicine,'' he added. ``It amounts to
writing out recipes to tell doctors how to treat their patients. A
lot of doctors are going to come out on the wrong side of this
recipe or cookbook and they're not going to like it.''
   Luft defended the plan. ``In general, it will probably improve
the practice of medicine if it's done with sensitivity,'' he said.
``One needs to be concerned, however, that guidelines are not set in
concrete and are not so broad as to be meaningless.''
   Luft said the AMA's involvement was ``encouraging. I would worry
much more about cookbook medicine if it (guidelines) was coming from
insurers and the government.''
   Doctors have been under great pressure from insurance companies,
patients and government agencies to set treatment guidelines, said
Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission for the
Accreditation of Healthcare Organzations in Chicago.
   ``If physicians don't do this themselves, governments or payers
(insurance companies) will do it for them,'' he said. ``The AMA is
the right organization to do this.''
   The AMA is the nation's largest organization of physicians with
more than 280,000 members, said Dr. James Todd, the group's deputy
executive vice president.
   Luft said the guidelines may also help physicians defend
themselves against malpractice lawsuits.
   ``A doctor will be able to say `Look. I followed the guidelines
set down by the AMA. I didn't do anything wrong,''' he said.

<HEAD>New Congress Opens With Friendly Talk, Controversy Over Pay</HEAD>

   The Democratic-controlled 101st Congress staged
opening ceremonies on Tuesday filled with pomp and pageantry and
spiced by controversy over a recommendation for a large pay raise
for lawmakers.
   On a day given over largely to swearing-in ceremonies and
receptions, Democrats pledged cooperation with theadministration. Leaders
of both parties laughed off a question about
higher taxes.
   President-elect Bush ad incoming Bush
ministered the oath of office to new and
newly re-elected senators in groups of four. A few hundred feet
across the Capitol, Speaker Jim Wright swore in House members.
   Wright, D-Texas, in a speech marking his election to a second
term as speaker, vowed to use the next two years to attack ``the
budget deficit, the trade deficit and the social deficit caused by
the widening gap between rich and poor.''
   He offered Bush ``unstinting cooperation'' toward a bipartisan
foreign policy, but his rhetoric on other matters was more
restrained. Without mentioning taxes, he prodded Bush to submit
budget plans within six weeks if possible, and said Democrats were
eager to help the new president improve education, child careesident Reagan
notifying him
that Congress was in session. This they did, and when asked by
reporters about the possibility of higher taxes, the lawmakers
laughed in unison.
   Bush has said he will fight any proposal to reduce the deficit
through new taxes, but many Democrats and some Republicans believe
he will have to change his mind to win agreement on a comprehensive
deficit-fighting plan.
   Opening day was a combination of the carefully scripted and the
unexpected.
   Freshman Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., arriving for his first day
on the job, stood perplexed in the hallway of a House office
building. ``Sixteeen-oh-five, 1605. It's got to be around here
somewhere. Which way?'' he muttered aloud.
   A reporter escorted him to his new office.
   Events went more smoothly on the Senate and House floors,
followed by a seemingly endless series of lunches and parties to
celebrate victories won last November.
   The Senate bore a new blue patterned carpet for the occasion, as
well as new scarlet benches in the corners for staff aides to view
the proceedings. The galleries were packed with spectators as Bush
swore in 32 elected senators and Dan Coats, R-Ind., appointed to
replace Vice President-elect Dan Quayle.
   Quayle mingled with his former colleagues on the Senate floor.
Incoming White House Chief of Staff John Sununu also attended.
   The pomp was nowhere better on display than in the Senate, where
outgoing majority leader Robert C. Byrd off West Virginia was named
president pro tempore, the post that goes to the longest-serving
senator of the majority party.
   First a resolution was passed appointing Byrd. Then, as he took
the presiding officer's chair, a resolution was approved notifying
the House of his appointment. Finally, a resolution was approved
congratulating him for attaining his new position.
   The atmosphere was less staid in the House, where many lawmakers
were accompanied to the opening-day session by spouses or young
children.
   Republicans waged a symbolic battle to rewrite House rules to
their liking, but majority Democrats brushed them aside. Republican
leader Bob Michel said his troops would make their views known in a
``clear and forceful manner'' all year.
   If no one wanted to talk about taxes, Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, was
eager to begin a debate over Reagan's expected recommendation for a
hefty pay raise for members of the House and Senate.
   ``Congressional pay adjustments have become a perpetual source of
debate, controversy and embarrassment,'' he said, in calling for a
two-year delay in any increase and requiring a roll call vote in
both houses before salary hikes take effect.
   Reagan is expected to call for a substantial pay raise next week
for members of Congress to take effect March 1 unless rejected
before then by both houses. An advisory commission has recommended a
50 percent boost for lawmakers, federal judges and top executive
branch officials, with members of Congress giving up lucrative
honorariums in exchange.
   Current congressional pay is $89,500 a year, and the commission's
proposal would raise it to $135,000.
   While Mitchell says the Senate will vote on any proposed pay
raise, Democratic leaders in the House say they are hoping to have
Reagan's proposal take effect without a vote.
   Under current law, Congress automatically gets a boost proposed
by the president unless it votes it down.
   Leaders in both parties spoke of cooperation on the first day of
the session.
   ``We're very optimistic that we're going to be able to work with
Bush and we can solve some of the problems,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., House majority whip. ``We need to have that cooperation.
... We'd like to resolve some problems and get rid of some of this
confrontation.''
   ``I think at least at the outset ... the appropriate tone is one
of cooperation and a spirit of bipartisanship, and let's see how far
we can go with that,'' said Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., House minority
whip.

   A blind minister who was rescued by a part-time
bus driver after falling under a commuter train on New Year's Day
says his savior deserves a full-time job.
   ``I am so lucky,'' said Albert Barnett Jackson, 35, who broke his
ankle in the accident as he was on his way to a New Year's Day
service. ``But I always believe that there is a reason for
everything.''
   Jackson said that Charles Welch, the part-time Chicago Transit
Authority bus driver, should get a citation and a full-time job from
the CTA for his heroics.
   ``And for me, well, all I can say is hallelujah. I'm here and
alive, so it will be a good year,'' Jackson said.
   Welch said he was riding on a southbound elevated train when he
saw Jackson tapping his white cane along the platform.
   ``I won't forget that picture,'' Welch said Monday. ``I had
flashbacks all last night of him walking up to the train and then
just disappearing.''
   Jackson, an associate minister at the People's Missionary Baptist
Church, was trying to board the train when he stepped between two
cars and fell onto the tracks.
   ``I thought I had gotten to the (train) door and so I stepped
ahead and suddenly, before I knew anything, I was down on the
tracks,'' Jackson said.
   ``And I screamed out, `Help me, somebody, oh help me, somebody.'
And this voice, which I now know was Charles, told me, `Don't move.
Don't touch anything and don't move,''' he said.
   Welch raced to the next car to tell the conductor not to start
the train, then went to assist Jackson, who was lying very close to
an electrified rail.
   Welch jumped down on the tracks and grabbed Jackson's arm. He
also retrieved the man's cane and braille Bible. Another man then
helped carry the victim to a bench.
   Jackson said he also survived a fall off a train platform in
1972, and a stabbing and robbery in his North Side apartment in 1986.
   For Welch, who has been a part-time bus driver for 16 months, it
was the second time he has helped out in an emergency. He once
wrestled a gun away from a young passenger on his bus.

   President Reagan spoke with the Democratic and
Republican leaders of Congress from his Bel Air home Tuesday, saying
he is confident that with their support, President-elect Bush ``will

   The White House said Reagan received a telephone call from the
leaders and spoke with them for two minutes. On the telephone on
Capitol Hill were Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine;
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.; House Majority Leader Tom
Foley, D-Wash.; and House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   The White House announcement quoted the president as saying:
   ``Thank you and welcome back. Congratulations to all of you on
your election to lead your parties in Congress. Please extend my
best wishes to all of your newly elected colleagues sworn in today.
This is the last of these phone calls for me, and I want to thank
you all for your many kindnesses to Nancy and me over the years.
   ``As I hand over the reins to George Bush in a few days, I'll

continued prosperity and peace. I look forward to getting back and
seeing all of you in the two short weeks remaining.''

<HEAD>Jazz Pianist Dies; Composed `Canadian Sunset'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eddie Heywood Jr., a popular jazz
pianist who composed ``Canadian Sunset,'' has died. He was 73.
   Heywood had a weak heart and had been in failing health, said
family friend Fenton Walsh. He died at home Monday night.
   His widow, Evelyn, hoped to have memorial services for him in
Atlanta, his hometown, and New York, where he was a popular
participant in the late-night cafe society, Walsh said.
   The jazz player's version of Cole Porter's ``Begin the Beguine''
was popular in the 1940s, and after being sidelined by problems with
his hands, Heywood returned with his composition of ``Canadian
Sunset'' and other songs in the mid-1950s. His gentle-sounding tunes
often were constructed around nature themes.
   He was named as a new star by Esquire magazine in 1945 and
recorded with vocalists Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald, as well
as recording his own albums.
   Heywood had moved here from Martha's Vineyard about three years
ago, Walsh said. Walsh is part of a local jazz group called The
Unidentical Jazz Twins, and met Heywood at the Coral Square Mall in
Coral Springs after his group played ``Canadian Sunset.''
   ``He burst into tears. He couldn't believe people still were
playing that,'' Walsh said.
   Heywood is survived by his wife and two sons, Robert and Edward.
   There are plans to start an Eddie Heywood Scholarship Fund, Walsh
said. Arrangements were incomplete.

   With six weeks to go before Soviet
troops are to be out of Afghanistan, the chairman of the
Pakistan-based Afghan resistance on Tuesday announced a last-minute
effort to form a transitional government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi said a consultative council _ with half
its members drawn from guerrilla commanders fighting Soviet and
Afghan government troops _ would convene within two or three weeks.
The council would draw up a transitional government.
   Apart from the difficulty of selecting and convening the more
than 400 members of such a council, the decision offers the
resistance little time to maneuver.
   The Soviet Union's first deputy foreign minister and ambassador
to Kaubl, Yuli Vorontsov, planned to arrive in Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital, on Wednesday and meet Mojaddidi by the end of the
week. It will be the second session between the Kremlin's Afghan
specialist and the rebels in attempts to find a political settlement
to the Afghan war.
   The first meeting, in the Saudi Arabian city of Taif last month,
was the Kremlin's first official recognition of the Moslem
guerrillas it has been fighting for more than nine years. It was a
tacit acknowledgment that Moscow is exploring a non-communist
alternative to Preisdent Najib, head of the embattled government in
Kabul.
   Vorontsov was in Tehran on Tuesday meeting Iranian-based leaders
of Shiite Moslem Afghan guerrillas, who operate separately from the
Sunni Moslem groups based in Peshawar.
   The main guerrilla alliance consists of seven squabbling parties
who operate out of Peshawar under the name of the Islamic Unity of
Afghan Mujahedeen.
   The group, generally called the alliance, rotates its
chairmanship among the leaders of the seven groups every three
months. Mojaddidi, who became chairman Jan. 1, is the leader of the
Afghan National Liberation Front, one of the alliance's relatively
moderate but least militarily effective groups.
   The decision to convene a consultative council, or shura, was
announced after a fractious three-day meeting of the alliance's
140-member executive council. The council, comprised of 20
representatives from each of the seven parties, failed to
unanimously endorse the plan, alliance sources said.
   Some executive council members also opposed more meetings with
Vorontsov, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Mojaddidi said the council was a temporary measure because the
war in Afghanistan makes an election impossible. At least two of the
seven guerrilla leaders have advocated the election of a national
parliament instead of summoning a consultative council.
   But Mojaddidi said the alliance's supreme council, consisting of
the top leader of the seven Peshawar-based parties, approved the
shura plan a week ago.
   He told a news conference the shura would have 400 or 500
members, with an equal number to be nominated by each of the seven
parties. After the news conference, however, he told reporters each
party would name 60 delegates for a total of 420.
   He said 50 percent of the delegates would be rebel commanders.
The rest would include well-known intellectuals, tribal leaders and
``good Moslems.''
   He rejected the participation of any officials of the current
Soviet-style Kabul government.
   Mojaddidi's formula appears to exclude the Iranian-based Shiite
guerrilla groups, but he said the seven Peshawar-based parties were
free to nominate people who did not belong to their own ranks.
   Shiites comprise only about 17 percent of Afghanistan's
population, but they make up about 40 percent of the Afghan refugees
who have fled their country since 1978 when a communist government
seized power through a coup and needed the Soviet Union's 1979
military intervention to survive.
   Of the estimated 15 million Afghans, one-third now live outside
Afghanistan _ 3 million in Pakistan and 2 million in Iran.
   Asked whether the former Afghan king, Zahir Shah, would be asked
to participate in the shura, Mojaddidi said any of the
Peshawar-based groups was free to invite anyone.
   The new attempt to form an interim government will take place in
Pakistan, Mojaddidi said. Asked where and how it would operate, he
first predicted confidently that the Najib government would fall
quickly after Feb. 15, when the Soviet Union is scheduled to
withdraw its last remaining forces, estimated at about 50,000.
   But in response to questions, he said that if the guerrillas were
not in control of the capital, the interim government would operate
in provinces they did control.

   President Reagan asked Congress on Tuesday to
ratify a treaty signed by more than a score of nations pledging
punishment for terrorists who attack ships at sea or oil platforms
offshore.
   ``The seizure of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985,
and the murder of American passenger Leon Klinghoffer, demonstrated
that no country, or form of transportation, is immune from the
criminal savagery of those who engage in terrorist acts,'' Reagan
said.
   He said the agreement consists of a convention covering shipping
and a protocol that deals with fixed platforms offshore.
   He said they are modeled on earlier treaties dealing with
aircraft hijacking and sabotage and ``include provisions requiring
states to provide severe punishment for such offenses, and to
extradite or prosecute those who commit them.''
   Work on the treaty began in 1986 under the auspices of the
International Maritime Organization on the basis of an initial draft
co-sponsored by Italy, Austria and Egypt.
   Both the convention and protocol were adopted at an international
conference in Rome in March. The United States and 22 other states
signed the convention and the United States and 20 other nations
signed the protocol dealing with platforms.
   ``It is clear that the convention already has broad support in
the international community, and it is hoped that all states will
join in this major step to deter acts against the safety of maritime
navigation,'' the president said.

<HEAD>Reagan Decides Against Steps To Curb Oil Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan announced Tuesday he has
decided against tariffs or other action to curb oil imports,
although conceding that ``the free world will become increasingly
dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure sources.''
   The president acted on the recommendation of Commerce Secretary
William Verity, who he said reported to him that import restrictions
``would not be cost effective and, in the long run, would impair
rather than enhance national security.''
   Verity's report was the outcome of an investigation requested in
December 1987 by the National Energy Security Committee, a domestic
oil industry group which said the president should use his powers to
restrict import of goods where imports would hurt national security.
   Reagan said Verity concluded that ``there has been a substantial
improvement in U.S. energy security'' since the last similar
investigation in 1979.
   ``However, declining domestic oil production, rising oil imports
and growing free world dependence on potentially insecure sources of
supply raise a number of concerns, including vulnerability to a
major supply disruption,'' the president said.
   ``The investigation found that the maintenance of U.S. access to
sufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economic
security, foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness,'' he
said. ``Given these factors, the secretary of commerce found that
petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''
   Imports of crude oil and refined products currently are running
at about 41 percent of consumption, up from 31.5 percent in 1985 but
not yet back to the 47.7 percent recorded in 1977, the peak year for
imports. Several forecasts, including those of the Energy
Department, predict that imports will reach and pass 50 percent in
the 1990s.
   A department study concluded in 1987 that a $10-a-barrel tariff
would add 120,000 jobs in the oil industry but cost 400,000
elsewhere in the economy; would bring $46 billion worth of benefits
at a cost of $200 billion. Secretary John Herrington has said
exemptions that would be politically necessary in any tariff plan to
accommodate Canada and residential users of home heating oil in the
U.S. Northeast would make it unworkable.
   Reagan said that, in deciding not to recommend any import
restrictions, Verity took into account the administration's program
to improve energy security.
   In particular, Reagan cited decontrol of oil prices and
elimination of allocation controls as actions his administration has
taken to strengthen the domestic oil industry.
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains over 555 million
barrels, compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago,'' he said.
   ``Today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supply
disruption than in 1973 or 1979,'' he added.
   ``Despite these improvements, important energy security concerns
remain,'' the president said, citing rising oil consumption,
declining U.S. crude production and rising oil imports.
   ``In addition, projections show that the free world will become
increasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure
sources.''
   In a message to Congress that accompanied his statement, the
president urged the lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices,
permit expanded oil exploration in Alaska and the Outer Continental
Shelf, liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers,
streamline nuclear power licensing procedures and sell the Naval
Petroleum Reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo.
   The administration has advocated all these measures in Congress
in recent years, but without success.
   The 1979 study was requested by the Treasury Department in 1978.
Based on that study, then-President Carter determined that oil
imports were a threat to U.S. security.

<TEXT>
   Texas Democrat Jim Wright, re-elected Speaker
of the House, pledged Tuesday to cooperate with George Bush and
called on the president-elect to submit his budget recommendations
within a month after taking office.
   ``Today I pledge to President (elect) Bush the earnest and
unstinting cooperation of the leadership of cooperatin of the
leadership of this House in seeking true bipartisanship in every
area of our nation's foreign policy,'' Wright said a his speech to
his colleagues accepting a second term as speaker.
   ``Because President-elect Bush has service in this House, I am
encouraged that he will exhibit appreciation for the constitutional
responsibilities of the Congress and will seek avenues of
cooperation between our executive and legislative branches,'' he
said.
   Wright said Republicans and Democrats within Congress must also
learn to work together. The speaker _ known for strong-arm
parliamentary tactics _ said he now is ``eager to encourage'' a
House Republican role in policy making.
   Wright said the domestic agenda was plagued with ``three
deficits: the budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the social
deficit caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor'' as
costs soar for housing, higher education and health care.
   ``By working together, we can help our new president fulfill his
beautiful promise of `a kinder, gentler nation,''' he said. ``We in
the House leadership are eager to help him attain the goals he has
expressed of wider access for all Americans to education, to child
care, to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment.''
   Wright specifically pointed to cooperating with Jack Kemp, the
former Republican congressman who Bush has chosen to head the
Department of Housing and Urban Affairs. Kemp has long been an
advocate of urban low-tax ``enterprise zones'' to lure business back
to the inner city.
   For Congress to carry out its responsiblities on time, including
approving a fiscal 1990 budget by April 15, the new president must
submit his recommendations ``not later than Feb. 20,'' said Wright,
who drew cheers from his colleagues for promising to get the
legislative work done on time.
   Wright, himself the subject of a probe for allegedly violating
ethics rules in his personal finances and for revealing government
secrets, said he and Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., would
quickly appoint a panel to review House ethics rules.
   The speaker also repeated his promise to pursue changes in
federal campaign law, including a bill passed by the House but not
the Senate last year to have polls close at the same time across the
nation in presidential elections.
   ``We can clean up the murky areas of campaign financing... and
reduce the influence of special interests,'' he said.
   ``To profess love for democracy but disdain for politics is to
pretend to honor the product while despising the process that
creates the product,'' Wright said.
   ``Politics is as necessary to the functioning of a free society
as water is to the flow of a river,'' he said. ``It doesn't have to
be filthy and corrupted, and neither does the river.''
   The Conservative Campaign Fund, a right-wing political action
committee, filed on Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission a
complaint against Wright. The group contends that Wright and his
supporters illegally staged and financed a gala salute to the
speaker four weeks before the November election without properly
declaring it a campaign event.
   House Republicans wondered aloud about Wright's promise to treat
them more fairly, as the Democrats rammed through on Tuesday a
revised version of the House rules further limiting the GOP
minority's parliamentary options in battling for their views.
   ``Was it just flim-flam, or was it serious?'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., a conservative opponent of the speaker.

<HEAD>Connecticut To Celebrate Nation's First Constitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Rev. Thomas Hooker delivered a
sermon one Sunday in 1638, his oratory sparked the creation of the
world's first written, democratic constitution _ one that served as
a model for the U.S. Constitution.
   This year marks the 350th anniversary of that document, known as
the Fundamental Orders, and the state of Connecticut plans to
celebrate with ceremony and symposiums.
   The constitution, adopted on Jan. 14, 1639, also will be put on
public display for the first time in 20 years.
   In his now famous sermon, Hooker, a Congregationalist minister,
asserted that the power of government lay in ``the free consent of
the people'' and ``that the choice of public magistrates belonged
unto the people, by God's own allowance.''
   His words spurred free planters to adopt the Fundamental Orders
at a meeting in Hartford.
   ``Throughout the Colonial period, all other states, except
Connecticut and Rhode Island, had royal governors and were basically
run by an aristocracy,'' said Ralph G. Elliot, chairman of the U.S.
Constitution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut. ``No state had
greater self government than Connecticut, starting in 1639.''
   The state plans to spend $35,230 to mark the anniversary. The
main event will be a public display of the 1639 Fundamental Orders,
the Royal Charter of 1662, the state consitution of 1818 and the
state constitution of 1965 at the Old State House in Hartford.

<HEAD>Bakker Makes Fund-Raising Pitch During Second Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PINEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jim Bakker appealed
for money Tuesday, the second day of his new show being broadcast to
a half-dozen stations.
   But the retired judge who ruled over the PTL bankruptcy case said
Bakker could not handle the millions of dollars raised in his first
show.
   In his second broadcast since he was forced off the air two years
ago in a sex-and-money scandal, Bakker asked listeners to send in
``$100, or $25 or more'' in return for a ``Crisis Book of
Scripture.''
   Bakker told viewers he did not want to raise funds every day, but
expressed the belief the Heritage USA complex that was recently sold
to a Canadian businessman would be restored to the PTL members who
paid for it.
   Meanwhile, on ``CBS This Morning,'' Rufus Reynolds, the judge who
supervised the $65 million sale of PTL's assets, said his ``stomach
cringed'' at the way Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled the
money he raised in the name of religion.
   ``They just wasted a lot of it,'' he said. ``Why take religious
money collected for one purpose and throw it away for another?
That's the whole picture.''
   The broadcasts of the new ``Jim and Tammy'' show originated in
the living room of the Bakkers' borrowed home and were sent by
satellite to a six stations, mostly cable, in California, Ohio, New
York, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, Bakker said.
   Bakker, 49, and a former top associate were indicted last month
on charges of diverting $4 million in PTL money for their benefit. A
trial date is expected to be set Jan. 17.
   The Bakkers had not preached together on television since January
1987. Two months later, allegations surfaced of his 1980 sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn, forcing Bakker to
leave the PTL ministry.
   Bakker said one of his supporters donated money to put him back
on the air for the first month.
   Mrs. Bakker said Tuesday she did not think daily fund-raising
would be necessary.
   ``I believe God is going to start touching people's hearts,'' she
said. ``I believe that we're not going to have to tell the people,
that God will tell the people.''
   But in the interview, the judge who ordered the Bakkers in a
civil suit to repay the ministry $7.7 million in excessive benefits
said Jim Bakker was ``not a very good businessman.''
   Reynolds, who retired as a bankruptcy judge Saturday, said Bakker
once chartered a plane for $130,000 ``just to take him out to
California _ kept it out there two weeks. Things like that. Just
money that you wouldn't think about spending, he did.''

<HEAD>Trial Begins in INS Sweep Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration agents seeking illegal aliens
unlawfully used pretexts to enter job sites and sweep up
Hispanic-looking workers, civil rights lawyers argued Tuesday at the
start of a federal trial over the raids.
   But a government lawyer contended the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has met constitutional requirements on
searches, and noted that rulings by judges in other parts of the
country have upheld INS practices.
   The central issue in the case before U.S. District Judge Robert
Aguilar is the type of evidence the INS must show and what type of
warrant it must present in entering a workplace and questioning and
arresting workers who cannot prove legal residency.
   An array of groups representing Hispanics, labor unions and
employers is seeking strict regulation of the agents who go to
factories and farms in search of illegal aliens.
   The case affects only an INS region that covers most of northern
and central California, from Bakersfield to the Oregon line. But
lawyers in the case say it could be influential elsewhere.
   In opening statements and testimony from the first of more than
100 expected witnesses, the plaintiffs contended the federal agency
since at least 1982 has violated constitutional standards that
require warrants to identify the person or evidence being seized.
   ``Witnesses will establish that there is a consistent pattern of
non-specific or general warrants,'' said Suzanne Needles,
spokeswoman for the Employment Law Office of the San Francisco Legal
Aid Society.
   ``A warrant would name two persons, but the INS would arrive with
as many as 20 agents with guns drawn and visible, approach the
property at high speed, locate the two persons named, and then
approach anyone who appeared to be Hispanic, detaining U.S. citizens
(as well as) undocumented workers.''
   According to court papers, in 25 northern California raids the
INS identified 32 people in search warrants but made 481 arrests.
   Aguilar has issued a preliminary injunction outlining warrant
requirements for workplace entries. But Francisco Garcia, a lawyer
for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
contended the INS violated those standards last year in raids on a
Sacramento factory and a Fort Bragg fishery.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, representing the INS, contended
the agency has the right to enter a workplace with a warrant based
on information that illegal aliens are there. Once inside, agents
can question and arrest specific aliens, he said.
   ``The INS used the warrants of inspection solely for entry
purposes and, after entry, independently developed the probable
cause to arrest illegal aliens,'' Russoniello said in papers filed
with the court.
   The lawsuit seeks court orders requiring specific warrants to
arrest workers and prohibiting the INS from targeting workers of
Hispanic ancestry for ``arrest and abuse.''
   The case stems from INS raids in 1982 known as Operation Jobs
because they were supposed to create job openings for U.S. citizens
and legal residents. The first witnesses were from a mushroom farm
in Petaluma that was raided by the INS in 1982, allegedly without a
warrant or the owner's consent.
   Aguilar has issued a number of rulings against the INS in the
case, but several have been reversed.
   He declared in 1982 that agents violated privacy rights by
surrounding a workplace and questioning workers on the mere
suspicion that they might be illegal aliens.
   After the Supreme Court overturned that ruling, Aguilar issued a
new injunction in 1985, barring the INS from detaining or
questioning workers who had not been specifically identified in a
warrant. He also prohibited the INS practice of referring to one or
two workers in a warrant along with unspecified ``others.''
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld Aguilar's
finding that the INS had an apparent ``systematic policy and
practice'' of illegal searches. But the court overturned the
requirement of specifically identifying workers.

   A Jehovah's Witness who was given a blood
transfusion against her will won an appeal Tuesday that set aside a
lower court's order for the transfusion, her lawyer said.
   The lawyer, Donald Ridley of the Jehovah's Witnesses, said the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court in Brooklyn also ruled
that a hearing must be held before any new order for a transfusion
is issued.
   The woman, Denise Nicoleau, 35, of Moriches, is in critical
condition after giving birth to a boy by Caesarean section Thursday
at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital on Long Island.
   After the birth, the woman continued to bleed and doctors
performed an operation to stabilize her, but those efforts failed
and on Friday doctors ordered a transfusion.
   However, Ms. Nicoleau, a registered nurse, and her husband Rico,
a radiologist, told the hospital they did not want the transfusion
because it conflicted with their religious beliefs.
   Jehovah's Witnesses contend blood transfusions violate the
biblical passage in Leviticus that reads, ``Whatsoever man ... eats
any manner of blood, I will cut him off from among his people.''
   The hospital obtained a court order from state Supreme Court
Justice Saverio Fierro in Hauppauge permitting the transfusion.
   Relatives surrounded Ms. Nicoleau's bed in an attempt to prevent
the transfusion. Three were arrested on criminal trespass charges.
   Hospital spokesman Richard Semple said Tuesday that Ms.
Nicoleau's condition has improved, but she remains critical. He
refused to comment further.
   Ridley said there is no proof that the transfusion kept his
client alive. Rather, he said, ``It could have exposed her to fatal
complications.''
   He said Ms. Nicoleau ``doesn't want to die. She wants her medical
problems solved by non-blood means.''
   Under state law, ``competent'' adult patients generally have the
right to determine their own medical treatment.

<TEXT>
   Former White House chief of staff Donald Regan
says he hopes President-elect Bush will avoid President Reagan's
``baffling reluctance to give orders, or even guidance, to his close
subordinates.''
   In a paperback re-issue of his book, ``For The Record,'' Regan,
who was ousted as Reagan's chief of staff in February 1987, said
Bush, immediately after his inauguration, ``ought to tell his
Cabinet and his staff exactly what he wants them to do, laying out
his objectives in every field of policy in a way that cannot
possibly be misunderstood.''
   In the paperback update of Regan's book, which caused a stir in
the spring of last year with its harsh judgments of Reagan's
presidential management style, Regan also said Bush should consider
a recession inevitable and must be prepared to deal with it.
   Regan could not immediately be reached for comment on the chapter
that he added to his original ``For the Record,'' and spokeswoman
Kathy Reed said the former chief of staff was in Florida. The
re-issue of Regan's book is scheduled to hit the newstands and
bookstores on Feb. 1.
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman at Bush's transition headquarters
here, said that ``to my knowledge, he (Bush) has not solicited
advice from Donald Regan. I do believe they have always had a
cordial relationship.''
   The initial publication of Regan's book caused a furor in the
nation's capital, as Reagan and his wife, Nancy, denounced the
former chief of staff for telling insider stories. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater labeled Regan's work as ``a kiss-and-tell
story in the mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency
or the first family for personal self-interest.''
   In his initial book, Regan, among other things, depicted Reagan
as a hands-off president who was a reluctant decision-maker, and
said much of the Reagan's schedule was dictated by Nancy's reliance
on the advice of an astrologer.
   In ``The New Presidency,'' the chapter Regan added in the
paperback to be published by St. Martin's Press, Inc., the former
chief of staff said that while he believes Bush ``understands the
lessons of Reagan's successes,'' he also said Bush ``must sometimes
stand against his advisers.''
   ``As long as he listens to his own instincts, and to the voice of
his own experience, the American people will be well-served,'' Regan
said of Bush.
   ``It is to be hoped that President Bush will make it equally
clear from the start of his administration that he has learned from
Reagan's shortcomings _ his baffling reluctance to give orders, or
even guidance, to his close subordinates, and the tendency to permit
some of his advisers to manage the presidency for effect rather than
for results,'' Regan said.
   He said Bush ``must bring the White House's relationship with the
news media under control, so that he and his people spend the
greater part of their time dealing with the reality of the nation's
problems, rather than catering to the natural tendency of the media
to transform the presidency into entertainment.''
   A source in the Bush transition office, declining to be named
publicly, said Bush has not spoken with Regan except during a chance
encounter the pair had at Burning Tree Country Club, a suburban
Maryland golf course, when Bush when there last summer to play golf
with longtime friend James A. Baker III.

   The 101st Congress opened Tuesday with leaders

<HEAD>Nasser Nephew Arrives To Stand Trial in Terror Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nephew of the late President Gamal Abdel
Nasser was arrested Tuesday after returning from self-imposed exile
in London to stand trial on charges of complicity in attacks against
Israeli and U.S. diplomats.
   Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser was immediately hauled into court,
then released on $260 bail.
   He and 19 other defendants are alleged to belong to a group
called Egypt's Revolution. Prosecutors allege the group launched
attacks from 1984 to 1987 in which two Israeli diplomats were killed
and six wounded. Two U.S. diplomats also suffered minor injuries.
   Among the defendants is President Nasser's eldest son, Khaled,
who remains a fugitive in Yugoslavia. He is one of the prime
defendants and could face a death sentence if convicted of the
charges against him.
   Gamal Nasser, a physician accused of failing to report a gunshot
wound inflicted on an attacker by one of the American victims,
pleaded innocent. The trial adjourned until Jan. 24.
   The late president's nephew was arrested at Cairo International
Airport after he stepped off a flight from London, ending a 14-month
absence.
   He and Khaled Abdel Nasser were outside Egypt when the indictment
was issued last February against the 20 defendants.
   The indictment charged Khaled Abdel Nasser and 10 co-defendants
with murder, undermining Egypt's security and damaging its relations
with Israel and the United States. It demanded they be condemned to
death.
   The remaining nine defendants, including Gamal Nasser, were
charged with complicity of various kinds and could be sentenced on
conviction to prison terms of up to 25 years.
   The trial began in November.
   Tuesday's hearing was mainly procedural, with the lawyers
demanding an end to solitary confinement imposed on the 11
defendants facing possible death sentences.

<HEAD>Courts Reject Appeals to Block Hangings in Gandhi Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two courts on Tuesday rejected appeals to
block the hanging of two Sikhs for the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, news agencies reported.
   In one appeal, the Supreme Court refused to consider Kehar
Singh's petition that said his sentence should be commuted to life
in prison because of excessive delay in carrying it out, the United
News of India and Press Trust of India reported.
   The men were convicted and sentenced in 1986.
   The news agencies also reported that the Delhi High Court
rejected Kehar Singh's appeal challenging the president's refusal to
grant him clemency.
   The other condemned man, Satwant Singh, is not appealing.
However, Kahar Singh's appeals have also stayed his execution under
Indian law.
   Kehar Singh's lawyers vowed to take the clemency part of his
appeals before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman rejected clemency Monday after
the Supreme Court ordered him to reconsider his refusal in November.
He gave no explanation of Monday's decision, which automatically
lifted a stay blocking execution of the two convicted men.
   Warrants reordering the execution were issued immediately after
the president's decision. The date has been kept secret for security
reasons.
   The two men are being held on death row in New Delhi's maximum
security Tihar Jail.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   One of them, Beant Singh, was killed in a shootout with other
bodyguards minutes later. The other was Satwant Singh, 24.
   Kehar Singh, 54, is a maternal uncle of Beant Singh and unrelated
to Satwant Singh. He was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to
death.
   Mrs. Gandhi's assassination evidently was carried out in revenge
for an army raid she had ordered on the Golden Temple in Amritsar,
the holiest Sikh shrine, four months earlier to rid the complex of
Sikh militants holed up inside.
   The militants have been fighting a six-year guerrilla war for a
separate nation in northern Punjab state.
   They claim discrimination by the country's Hindu majority, who
comprise more than 80 percent of India's 880 million people. Sikhs
make up less than 2 percent of the national population but hold a
slight majority in Punjab.
   More than 2,400 people were killed in Sikh militant violence in
1988.

<HEAD>U.N. Begins Monitoring Cuban Troop Pullout from Angola</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. military observers in Angola formally
began work Tuesday to monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops,
just one week before the first contingent of 3,000 soldiers is to
leave.
   The United Nations announced that the first 30 men of a projected
70-man observer group started operations in the southern African
nation as part of the U.N. Angola Verification Mission.
   The Cuban Mission, meanwhile, said the first contingent of about
3,000 men will leave Angola on Jan. 10.
   The official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported that Brig. Gen.
Pericles Ferreira Gomes of Brazil, the chief military observer of
the verification mission, arrived Tuesday in the Angolan capital of
Luanda and established his headquarters there. He will command
observers sent by Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Congo, Czechoslovakia,
India, Jordan, Norway, Spain and Yugoslavia.
   ANGOP, monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, also reported that U.S.
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson met Tuesday with Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos to discuss the situation in southern Africa.
   Jackson, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential
nomination last year, also met with Foreign Minister Afonso Van
Dunen, ANGOP said.
   Jackson began a four-day visit to Angola Monday as part of an
African tour.
   The Cuban troops have been helping Marxist Angola fight rebels
backed by South Africa and the United States. Under an agreement
signed Dec. 22 by Cuba and Angola, the entire force is to be
withdrawn by July 1, 1991.
   The first contingent is to leave before April 1. That is when
adjoining Namibia, or South-West Africa, begins its one-year
transition to independence, granted in another agreement signed on
Dec. 22.
   The Namibia accord was signed by South Africa as well as Angola
and Cuba.
   South Africa occupied Namibia, a former German colony, during
World War I and has governed it since then.
   The Security Council on Tuesday was back to square one in efforts
to create a U.N. Namibia peacekeeping force as five permanent
members _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France, each with veto power _ stood firm on cutting costs and the
102-member non-aligned movement refused.
   On Saturday, hours before the 1989 council was formed, the 15
council members failed to create the force because of a deadlock
between the five permanent members and the six members on the
council from the non-aligned movement. A seventh non-aligned
country, Malaysia, now is on the council.

<UNK>Husband Charged in Death Of Wife Found Frozen in Ice Chest</UNK>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The husband of a long-missing woman was
charged with murder Tuesday after his wife's body was found frozen
in a locked ice chest at the couple's home, authorities said.
   Leonard Tyburski, 45, of Canton Township was arraigned in 35th
District Court on one count of murder in the death of Dorothy
Tyburski, 37, who disappeared in October 1985. The degree was not
specified.
   ``I've been a lawyer, a prosecutor and a judge for more than 30
years and this is definitely a little different,'' said Judge James
Garber, who arraigned Tyburski. ``It's not your everyday thing.
   ``It has some indications of Edgar Allen Poe and even some Alfred
Hitchcock,'' the judge said after ordering Tyburski held without
bond in the Wayne County Jail.
   Tyburski is in charge of attendance at Mackenzie High School in
Detroit, school officials said. He will undergo psychiatric
evaluation to determine if he is competent to stand trial, Garber
said.
   One of the couple's two daughters, 20-year-old Kelly Tyburski,
pried the lock off the chest-type freezer and found her mother's
clothed body Monday, according to detectives.
   ``I believe (the freezer) was there during the whole time period,
but it never came into play,'' said Canton Township Police Detective
Keith Lazar. He said investigators searched for the woman for about
two years before dropping the case for a lack of leads.
   The daughter ``was suspicious, the actions of her father, she was
dreaming about it, that her mother was somewhere ... in the house,''
he said. ``Her father made up stories about why the key was missing
for the freezer.''
   The cause of Mrs. Tyburski's death was undetermined, Lazar said.
An autopsy was scheduled for later this week.
   Neighbors of the family said the Tyburskis seemed friendly, but
that they seldom spoke with Mrs. Tyburski, who kept to herself and
raised rabbits in the garage of the family's suburban home about 25
miles west of Detroit,.
   Tyburski had reported his wife missing, said Lt. Larry Stewart, a
Canton Township police detective assigned to the case, and he told
police his wife may have left because of emotional problems stemming
from the death of a sister.
   Police never suspected foul play in the disappearance and handled
it as a missing person case, questioning Tyburski more as a source
of help than as a murder suspect, he said.
   ``We've done a lot of work and come up with nothing,'' he said.
``All investigations led nowhere.''

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
requirements Tuesday for the land disposal of 72 types of wastes,
part of a continuing program that eventually will ban the disposal
of more than 450 hazardous materials unless they are first treated.
   The EPA said the 72 waste products under the latest proposed
regulations involve about 1.7 billion gallons a year of hazardous
waste including some cyanide-containing industrial wastes.
   The proposed treatment is expected to cost industries involved
about $25 million a year, the agency said.
   The most toxic and most widely discharged wastes already are
banned from land disposal without prior treatment under existing EPA
regulations covering 62 types of wastes.
   The agency said in a statement that most of the 72 types of
wastes covered by the latest proposed regulation will meet the
proposed treatment requirements if incincerated before being buried.

<TEXT>
   The official Soviet news agency Tass on Tuesday
denied reports in the Western news media that 17 more survivors were
found in a ruined bakeshop more than three weeks after the Dec. 7
earthquake in Armenia.
   French and British broadcast reports said the survivors existed
on grain and melted snow until they were discovered in the wrecked
city of Spitak in northwestern Armenia.
   But Tass quoted Norik Muradyan, chief of rescue operations in
Spitak, as saying Tuesday in a telephone interview:
   `The last living person was removed by rescuers from the ruins of
buildings and structures in Spitak 10 days ago.
   ``The Western press reports that supposedly 17 living people were
found in Spitak on the 24th day after the natural disaster have no
foundation.''
   The agency said 28 additional bodies were pulled from the rubble
since Thursday, bringing the total of recovered bodies to 24,888.
   Europe 1 radio in Paris on Monday quoted a nurse for Doctors of
the World, a French humanitarian group, as saying the 17 survivors
were found in a bread factory near Spitak on Wednesday. It said the
nurse, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported they survived by
eating grain and drinking melted snow.
   The London commercial radio station LBC reported that French
medics said the 17 were found Saturday.
   The quake leveled Spitak, where 25,000 people had lived.

<HEAD>California Congressman Offers Advice On Dealing With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Dornan offered advice to
President-elect Bush on Tuesday for dealing with the AIDS epidemic:
launch a just-say-no campaign involving sex and make experimental
drugs available to people with the disease.
   ``There's no such thing as safe sex, there's safer sex,'' Dornan,
R-Calif., told a news conference.
   Dornan said a special review board should be set up to approve
use of experimental drugs on terminally ill patients who request
them.
   In a letter to Bush, Dornan also suggested that federal money
intended to finance treatment of AIDS patients should be funneled
through a single federal program.
   ``Such a program would replace the existing programs that are
overburdened, inadequate, and inappropriate to the specific health
care needs of AIDS patients,'' Dornan wrote.
   ``I also believe that AIDS can only be brought under control
through a fundamental shift in our values pertaining to sexual
relations,'' Dornan wrote. ``That is why I would encourage you ...
and your eventual surgeon general to adopt a `just say no' approach
to dealing with the question of what constitutes safe sex.''
   Dornan said he was not making a moral statement about homosexual
behavior but was concerned about stopping the spread of the disease,
which renders the body incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections.
   He said it was ``fine'' if homosexuals wanted to practice safe
sex by using ``erotic telephone conversations.''

   At least 323 people died on the nation's highways
during the four-day New Year's holiday weekend, but the toll
reported Tuesday was well below a pre-holiday projection by safety
experts.
   The National Safety Council had estimated that between 350 and
450 would die in a statement released before the weekend tally began
at 6 p.m. local time Friday. The count ended at midnight Monday.
   The state with the highest toll was California, where 39 traffic
deaths were reported, followed by Florida with 34 deaths and Texas
with 31.
   Statisticians for the Chicago-based council said about 330 people
could be expected to die in traffic accidents during a three-day
non-holiday weekend at this time of the year.
   Last year, 375 people were killed in highway accidents during a
four-day observance of the holiday. The highest toll for a New
Year's weekend was logged in 1965, when 564 people were killed
during a three-day holiday.

<HEAD>Survivor of Manhunt Charged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A frostbitten man sought in a weekend
manhunt after the fatal shooting of a sheriff's deputy was charged
in his hospital bed Tuesday with 10 felony counts stemming from the
death.
   Raul Lopez, 31, was told of the charges in his room at Flagstaff
Regional Medical Center, where he was in fair condition with
frostbite.
   The charges include assault and burglary stemming from the
Saturday night shooting of Deputy Bob Varner and the subsequent
manhunt.
   Lopez was one of two men sought by police. The other, Douglas
Savory, 45, who police believe was the primary gunman in Varner's
death, was found dead Monday with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in
the face.
   Sedillo set bond at $311,675 for Lopez and scheduled a Jan. 11
preliminary hearing in Navajo County Superior Court in Holbrook.
   Police arrested Lopez on Monday without incident after he was
seen limping along a street in Holbrook, about 33 miles east of
Winslow, where Savory was found dead.
   Varner, 51, was shot three times on Saturday night after he tried
to make a traffic arrest on Interstate 40, the east-west freeway
across northern Arizona. He died Monday.
   The attackers abandoned their stolen California car near Joseph
City and briefly took hostage a Joseph City couple in their home.
The men stole the couple's car and abandoned it in a ditch, fleeing
on foot, authorities said.
   Navajo County Sheriff Gary Butler called Savory ``an extremely
dangerous man.'' On Monday, he said, Savory shot at officers and a
police helicopter and then shot himself.
   ``Every time we had contact with him, he turned on us,'' Butler
said. ``He shot officer Varner before he even had a chance to react.
He turned on two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him.
Every time that we made contact with him, I ended up with several
bullet holes in my patrol cars.''
   Police said little was known about Lopez, who they described as a
survivalist.
   Sedillo said the absence of homicide charges left him no choice
but to allow bond for Lopez. He said county officials had told him
they were preparing other counts.
   Arizona law allows a person to be charged with murder or other
felonies committed as the result of the defendant's participation in
a different crime.
   Sgt. Allan Schmidt of the state Department of Public Safety said
Savory died two to three hours before his body was found.
   Cabin owner John Thompson had called police early Monday after he
went to the cabin and saw that someone had broken in.
   The cabin is less than a quarter-mile from Interstate 40, and
traffic was rerouted around a 33-mile stretch for at least six hours
on Monday until Savory's body was found. Officers cheered when they
learned Savory was dead.
   Schmidt said a California warrant from San Bernardino County
accused Savory of robbery and kidnapping in a September gun-store
robbery in which five other people have been arrested. Savory also
allegedly was involved in manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons
and explosives, Schmidt said.
   Lopez apparently separated from Savory on Saturday night and
spent part of that night hiding under a boat along the Little
Colorado River, officials said. Lopez walked along the river Sunday
to Holbrook, where he spent the night at a motel, they said.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters President Says Hoffa Advised Him To Make Mafia Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARRENSBURG, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Teamsters President Roy Williams
says he reluctantly helped mob bosses obtain a $60 million loan from
a union pension fund on the advice of Jimmy Hoffa after his family
was threatened.
   Williams said two men working for Nick Civella, the late Kansas
City crime boss, blindfolded him in 1974 and took him to a building
and threatened to kill his wife and children if he didn't use his
influence to obtain the loan for Civella.
   ``So what the heck can you do?'' Williams said. ``I went along,
that's all. And who are you if you don't protect your family?''
   His remarks were published Tuesday in the Warrensburg
Star-Journal, which interviewed him last month at his farm south of
Warrensburg near Leeton.
   Williams, 73 and in poor health, was released from a federal
prison in Springfield in September after serving three years of a
10-year sentence for attempting to bribe then-Sen. Howard Cannon of
Nevada in 1979.
   Williams was Teamsters president from 1981 until April 1983, when
he was forced to resign in order to stay out of prison while
appealing his conviction.
   He is cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department in New York,
which has filed a civil suit aimed at removing Teamsters officials
and mobsters who allegedly have corrupted the union. Last month, he
gave a deposition from his home that was beamed to New York by
satellite so that a federal judge could observe the proceedings and
make comments.
   Williams joined the Teamsters in 1938 as a truck driver and later
became a protege of Hoffa, who was Teamsters president from 1958 to
1971. Hoffa disappeared in 1975 and was presumed murdered.
   Williams said Hoffa advised that he help get the $60 million loan
for Civella and the Argent Corp. to buy Las Vegas casinos.
   ``He said: `You can run but you can't hide. You can quit, but you
can't hide. And they were here a long time before us and they will
be here a long time after we are gone. And they are in every large
local union, every council, including the AFL-CIO, and they thrive
on pension plans. Because they don't intend to work. That's where
the money is.'''
   Williams, who was paid $1,500 a month by Civella from late 1974
until mid-1981 in exchange for securing the loans, said the loans
were repaid and that the union no longer has money invested in Las
Vegas.
   Williams said he knew nothing about the skimming of gambling
receipts from the Las Vegas casinos, which led to the Argent Corp.
skimming trial that resulted in prison terms for mob bosses from
Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Kansas City.
   In the interview, Williams claimed he never attempted to bribe
the Nevada senator and that he was set up by Frank Fitzsimmons, who
was Teamsters president while Hoffa was in prison.
   Williams was convicted in 1982 along with four other men of
offering Cannon exclusive rights to buy a choice piece of
Teamster-owned property in Las Vegas at a bargain price. In
exchange, the senator was to help in defeating legislation to
deregulate the trucking industry. Cannon was never charged, and the
legislation became law.

<HEAD>PLO Adviser: Arafat Ready to Help, But Don't Expect Too Much</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Tuesday
that investigators should not expect too much help from the group in
tracking down the bombers of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The adviser, Khaled Hassen, repeated the Palestine Liberation
Organization's offer to help in the investigation. But he said FBI
director William Sessions was mistaken when he asserted Sunday that
Arafat has a ``wealth of information'' to give to the investigation.
   ``I think the PLO is ready to help but that doesn't mean what the
director of the FBI said, that Arafat has a wealth of information,''
Hassen said in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 comercial
network.
   ``It doesn't mean we have a file that we can pick up and give to
the Americans and say, well, it was done this way by so and so,'' he
said.
   Hassen was asked if a radical Palestinian faction led by Abu
Nidal, which opposes Arafat's peace overtures to Israel, might be
responsible for the Dec. 21 crash, in which 270 people died.
   ``I doubt that Abu Nidal would do something like that,'' he said.
``Because they (the victims) were Americans. Abu Nidal was always
against Israelis and against Palestinians (loyal to Arafat), but not
against Americans, not American people.''
   Asked what Arafat would do if it turned out that a Palestinian
group was responsible, Hassen said: ``All those who are under the
protection of any of the Arab governments _ we can do nothing to
them. If Arafat can get hold of them he will put them in front of
the court.''
   He said he thought Arafat would not hand over the suspects to the
United States or Britain for trial.
   ``If he got them, and they are Palestinians he has to put them in
front of the Palestinian court.'' He did not elaborate.
   Hassen said he did not think the bombing was the work of
Palestinians seeking to undermine the PLO's peace efforts.
   ``I don't see any organization which is up to the standard of
doing what was done if it is a bomb and if it is that kind of
technology they are talking about on television. There must be
either a government or a highly experienced secret branch
somewhere,'' he said.
   Another PLO official, Faisal Aouidha, said in a separate
interview that it would not be difficult to discover the
perpetrators.
   ``I am sure there are ways and means we can find out, one way of
the other, and it's not very difficult to find out,'' Aouidha, a PLO
spokesman in London, said on the British Broadcasting Corp.
television news.
   ``We know the people, we know how to get with them, the countries
they live in and we are really convinced it's not Palestinian groups
which have done it _ which gives us a better way even to go into an
investigation of the matter,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi has stepped up a campaign to
improve Libya's foreign image and rebut charges that he is building
a chemical weapons plant.
   In recent weeks, the Libyan leader purportedly helped free two
French girls held hostage in Lebanon, offered to return the body of
a U.S. pilot killed in a 1986 attack on Libya, and invited
television correspondents to interview him.
   In addition, he has appealed to international organizations from
the United Nations to the Arab League to defend him, and he has used
friendly nations to convey to Washington his contention the plant
does not produce chemical weapons.
   ``There is no doubt that the Libyans have launched what has
become known as their charm offensive in Europe,'' said a British
Foreign Office official Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Tuesday that Libya has secretly started producing limited quantities
of chemical weapons at the plant near Rabtha, about 50 miles
southwest of Tripoli.
   A statement Tuesday by the official Libyan news agency, JANA,
accused the United States of lying about the plant as an excuse to
attack Libya and kill Gadhafi.
   The United States, along with at least 20 other countries,
produces chemical weapons.
   Attention has focused on Libyan-U.S. relations in recent weeks
after President Reagan told an interviewer that a military attack on
the plant near the Libyan capital of Tripoli was under
consideration, although Gadhafi says the facility makes
pharmaceuticals.
   A U.S. carrier group steamed toward the Mediterranean on Tuesday
in what the Pentagon said was a normal rotation of forces, but the
movement prompted speculation of an impending strike.
   Italian newspapers and politicians billed the ships as a direct
threat to Libya. The U.S. Navy has said the movement of the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and 12 other
ships in its battle group is part of a ``previously scheduled,
routine deployment to the U.S. Sixth Fleet.'' A Reagan spokesman on
Tuesday declined comment on the reports.
   Gadhafi's reaction to the U.S. charges is more conciliatory than
his response to threats of an attack three years ago. But whether he
will succeed in winning allies is unknown.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that he did not believe the U.S.
would bomb the country in '86,'' said Lisa Anderson, a Columbia
University professor and a leading U.S. specialist on Libya.
   ``Now, I think he takes threats on the part of the U.S. _ and
even floating ideas in op-ed pieces by people who are not part of
the (Reagan) administration _ extremely seriously.''
   Shortly before the April 15, 1986, strike on Tripoli and
Benghazi, Gadhafi threatened a campaign of subversion in the United
States. Earlier that year, he defied U.S. forces to cross his ``line
of death'' in the Gulf of Sidra off Libya.
   But since the U.S. State Department alleged in September that
Libya was on the verge of making chemical weapons, Gadhafi has
portrayed himself as the victim of U.S. aggression.
   After the United States said it was talking with allies about a
possible raid on the factory, Gadhafi called Dec. 24 for the release
of hostages, particularly two French girls held in Lebanon by a
Libyan-backed Palestinian group for a year.
   Marie-Laure Betille, and her sister, Virginie, were handed over
to French officials in Tripoli six days later. Gadhafi followed up
with an appeal on French TV for the release of the girls' mother.
   But in France, newspapers alleged he was using the children to
boost his image.
   Anderson said in her telephone interview that during his 20 years
in power, Gadhafi won support domestically but has not learned how
to generate positive international public opinion.
   Gadhafi also offered to return the body of a U.S. soldier, using
the Vatican as an intermediary. There has been no indication whether
the offer will be fulfilled.
   Arab governments have rallied behind Gadhafi and the Arab League
council met in emergency session in late December to denounce the
U.S. warning.
   Gadhafi dispatched a top aide, Staff Maj. Abdulsalam Jalloud, to
Italy in November for talks. Italy's foreign minister, Giulio
Andreotti, then sent a telegram to U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz describing Libyan assurances about the plant.
   Libya, again through the Italians, then invited the United States
to visit the plant. Washington said it needed more than one trip.
   Libya says it abides by all accords on chemical arms. It plans to
send Jalloud to a multinational conference on chemical weapons this
week in Paris.

   Rescue workers ended their search
inside the sunken Bateau Mouche on Tuesday and said all bodies now
were off the tourist boat, which capsized on New Year's Eve and
drowned at least 53 revelers.
   Two bodies were recovered from the bay on Tuesday.
   Valmir Rabelo of the Fire Department's Maritime Group said that
``any further search for victims will be on the bottom of Guanabara
Bay. We doubt we will find more bodies, though it's possible one or
two might wash up on Rio beaches in the next days.''
   The victims had sailed out hoping to watch a fireworks display
from the ocean off famed Copacabana beach.
   Police still have no exact count of how many were on the
flat-bottomed boat when it sank 15 minutes before the New Year.
Estimates range from 130 to 150. Owners said the only passenger list
sank with the boat.
   The number of rescued also is not known. Operators of one boat
said they alone saved 30 people.
   Rio Gov. Wellington Moreira Franco told a news conference
Wednesday, ``Evidence shows that someone is responsible for this
tragedy, and they will be punished. We will make sure that those who
are responsible for the sinking will go where they belong _ to
jail.''
   Survivors told of overloading, of not as many life jackets as
needed, of life preservers tied to boat rails and of the boat
swaying precariously from side to side in the rough seas shortly
before it sank.
   But a navy communique on Monday said the excursion boat was
neither overcrowded nor dangerous and carried more than enough life
preservers, according to inspections on Dec. 28 and just two hours
before the tragedy.

   A federal appeals court Tuesday temporarily
barred the judge in the Iran-Contra case from giving prosecutors a
summary of Oliver L. North's defense, possibly delaying the former
White House aide's trial.
   The three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed
to consider North's challenge of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's decision to let prosecutors see the summary of classified
information defense lawyers want to elicit from high government
officials during the trial.
   In a related development, Gesell refused to allow further
censoring of 300 classified documents prosecutors want to use as
evidence against North. The ruling again raised the possibility that
major charges against North could be scuttled if the government
refuses to divulge classified information at the trial.
   But an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was too early to assess the impact of Gesell's
decision on the case against North.
   The judge's decision does not spell the end of the case, the
official said, adding that it may only force prosecutors to drop
certain documents as evidence against North.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gesell denied a motion filed last month by independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh to seek to accommodate objections of U.S.
intelligence agencies to the court's Dec. 12 order.
   Meanwhile, North's lawyers subpoenaed Secretary of State George
P. Shultz and four other State Department officials, including
Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, the top department
official for Latin American policy. Also subpoenaed were
Undersecretary Michael H. Armacost, legal adviser Abraham Sofaer and
M. Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant. North also has had
subpoenas issued for President Reagan and President-elect Bush.
   North is scheduled to go to trial Jan. 31 in U.S. District Court.
   But the appellate panel's action could delay the trial while it
considers what the defense called ``grave constitutional issues''
involving North's right to a fair trial.
   Gesell's refusal to accomodate some of the objections of U.S.
intelligence agencies to divulging certain classified information in
the prosecution exhibits also raises new problems for Walsh.
   The judge is insisting, for instance, that references to Iran,
Israel and Central American nations remain in the documents, despite
a government request that the nations be referred to by letter. The
CIA and other agencies also object to the judge's requirement that
the full text of intelligence reports be presented verbatim.
   Gesell, meanwhile, granted Walsh permission to subpoena North's
daily diaries of his activities that were kept throughout his
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The judge gave North until Jan. 18 to either produce the spiral
notebooks or object to turning over the material, which would be a
key piece of evidence for prosecutors.
   In the dispute over the summary of the defense case, the defends
contends that giving the 162-page document to Walsh will give
prosecutors an unfair look at the defense strategy for the former
National Security Council aide.
   The appellate panel agreed to consider North's request for a writ
of mandamus that would permanently bar Gesell from turning over the
defense summary to Walsh. It also issued an administrative stay that
prohibited Gesell from proceeding with his original plan to give
Walsh the summary by 4 p.m. on Tuesday.
   ``The purpose of the administrative stay is to permit the court
sufficient opportunity to consider the pending motion and petition
and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,''
said the brief order by Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, James Buckley
and David Sentelle.
   The stay has no time limit, so it could delay the scheduled start
of North's trial on charges he conspired with three co-defendants to
illegally divert more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   The summary would provide prosecutors with ``a detailed road map
to the defense case and to potential cross-examination of
prosecution witnesses,'' North's lawyers said in court papers.
   ``No defendant in the history of federal criminal jurisprudence
has been compelled to reveal before trial the details of anticipated
defense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issue in the
case,'' North's lawyers said.
   In reply papers filed Tuesday, Walsh told the appeals court that
he needed access to the defense summary in order to determine
whether the classified information North wants to disclose in
testimony is relevant to the case.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the defense must
notify the government of its intention to disclose any classified
information at public trial.
   In addition to seeking to disclose thousands of pages of
documents, North has proposed revealing a variety of secrets,
possibly about covert operations, while questioning current and
former government officials called as witnesses in the case.
   Former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, also charged in the
case, are scheduled to be tried separately.

   The only sailor sent to the brig for the
drowning of a recruit during rescue-swimmer training has been
released, but neither his case nor the debate over the Navy's
practices is over.
   A court-martial in September convicted Petty Officer 3rd Class
Michael Combe, 28, of negligent homicide and conspiracy to commit
battery in the death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19.
   Combe's 90-day sentence would have been up Dec. 21, and he was
released about two weeks early for good behavior, said Cmdr. Dennis
Hessler, a spokesman for the Pensacola-based Naval Education and
Training Command. He also was reduced in rank one grade.
   Mirecki drowned March 2 in a training pool at Pensacola Naval Air
Station after several instructors pushed him back in the water when
he panicked and climbed out, shouting that he wanted to quit the
voluntary training. The job of a rescue swimmer is to jump out of
helicopters to aid downed fliers.
   Combe was accused of repeatedly forcing Mirecki's head under
water.
   Other students said they were ordered to face away from Mirecki
and sing the ``Star Spangled Banner'' while he was in the water with
Combe.
   Combe, of Tempe, Ariz., is on leave, but has been attached to the
Pensacola base's Facilities Maintenance Department pending further
action on his case, Hessler said. It is unlikely he will return to
the Rescue Swimmer School, he said.
   The court-martial's verdict will not be final until it is
reviewed by Vice Adm. John S. Disher, chief of naval education and
training.
   Disher, who could approve or reject the decision, has yet to
receive a transcript of the case, and Hessler said it would be at
least a month more before the admiral decides.
   At that point, Combe can appeal to the Judge Advocate General's
Office in Washington, D.C. His lawyers have said they intend to
appeal if the admiral upholds the decision.
   Once the admiral's review is complete, Combe's commanding officer
could recommend to the Naval Military Personnel Command in
Washington that the sailor receive an administrative discharge. One
reason allowed for an administrative discharge is conviction of a
felony, which would include negligent homicide, Hessler said.
   Mirecki's death spurred numerous changes designed to make
rescue-swimmer training safer and a review of all hazarous training
in the Navy. But the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, issued an interim report that charged the Navy
failed to go far enough to improve the safety of rescue-swimmer
training.
   The new regulations prohibit instructors from touching trainees
and require training to cease immediately if a student is panicky,
fatigued or asks to quit.
   ``Sharks and daisies,'' the exercise being conducted at the time
of Mirecki's death, also was banned. In that drill, instructors
playing the role of panicked drowning victims would grab trainees in
head holds. The students were supposed to extricate themselves by
dragging the instructors underwater to break their holds.
   The interim GAO report stated that the new rules allowing
students to drop out or take time out are ``not adequately
formalized or standardized,'' leaving too much room to instructor
discretion.
   The report also contended instructors are inadquately screened to
determine their suitability for the high-risk training and don't
receive proper training for that job.
   Court-martial testimony revealed Mirecki had a fear of being
dragged under water, but that information was not given to
instructors although it was available from his training and medical
records.
   A pathologist concluded Mirecki literally was scared to death
when his phobia triggered heart failure that was followed by
drowning.
   Four other enlisted instructors received administrative penalties
of rank reductions or fines in the case, and the commanding officer
of the Naval Aviation Schools Command was reprimanded before his
retirement earlier this year.
   One other court-martial was held. Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, 32, of
Princeton, Ill., was acquitted of dereliction of duty. Torchia had
been officer in charge of the swimmer school.

   Investigators have little hope of ever
finding the missing bodies of 28 people killed in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, police sources said Tuesday.
   In London, the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
called for tighter security for all American flights in Europe and
the Middle East in the wake of the bombing of the jumbo jet.
   A government prosecutor in West Germany said the bomb had been in
the forward luggage compartment that contained baggage loaded both
in Frankfurt and London.
   Flight 103 exploded over Scotland and crashed Dec. 21, killing
all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Flaming wreckage was
scattered over 150 square miles of countryside.
   Police sources, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said investigators see little chance that the missing bodies of 20
passengers and eight residents would ever be found.
   They are believed to have died in the Sherwood Crescent area of
Lockerbie, where parts of the plane's fuselage and wings crashed,
forming a 30-foot-deep crater. Investigators fear that little or
nothing remains of them, the sources said.
   ``The search is still going on for bodies and it will continue
... (but) it would be quite unrealistic for anyone to have an
expectation that we would be able to find all of the victims'
bodies,'' said police Superintendent Angus Kennedy.
   Kennedy said between 80 and 90 percent of the plane's structure
had been located and charted on maps, including most of the huge
tail section, but only 20 percent had been picked up.
   Collecting the wreckage is a long process because many pieces
must be picked up by helicopter from a huge, partly inaccessible
area, he said.
   T. Allen McArtor, head of the FAA, met with representatives of
U.S. airlines operating at Gatwick Airport and called for ``a
heightened level of security on all American flights operating out
of European and Middle Eastern airports.''
   McArtor told airport and security chiefs he wanted to see greater
use of screening halls where only selected baggage now is thoroughly
searched. The officials agreed but emphasized problems of space and
expense.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727, switching
to the larger Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport.
   In London, The Independent newspaper said one of the items found
by searchers is a piece of the luggage that belonged to Lebanese
student Khalid Jaafar, who news reports have said may have
unwittingly carried the bomb aboard.
   The Independent quoted an unidentified civilian searcher as
saying that part of a zippered bag that was recovered contained the
21-year-old student's identity card and a roll of currency ``from a
country in the Middle East.''
   The bag was ``clearly nowhere near where the bomb exploded,'' the
searcher was quoted as saying.
   Kennedy refused to comment.
   Jaafar's father, Nazir, who lives in Dearborn, Mich., has denied
U.S. and British reports that his son, who lived in Frankfurt, may
have been duped by Middle East terrorists into carrying the bomb
aboard.
   Hubert Harth, a spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor, said the
bomb that destroyed the jet was in the forward luggage compartment,
which contained all of the baggage from Frankfurt Airport and some
of the baggage from Heathrow.
   ``That's where the bomb was, but we still don't know whether it
got on board the flight in Frankfurt or in London,'' Harth said,
noting that the information came from Scotland Yard.
   An adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said investigators should
not expect too much help from the Palestine Liberation Organization
in tracking down the bombers.
   The adviser, Khaled Hassen, said in an interview with Britain's
Channel 4 comercial network that FBI director William Sessions was
mistaken when he asserted Sunday that Arafat has a ``wealth of
information'' to contribute.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said
his government was ready to help find those responsible for the
crash, but did not give specifics.
   As search teams continued to hunt for wreckage and victims,
police said 126 of the 242 bodies recovered had been released to
relatives.
   In Lockerbie, more than 130 Pan Am employees from around the
world were expected to join about 100 relatives of the crash victims
at a memorial service Wednesday at Dryfesdale Presbyterian parish
church.
   Les Jardine, spokesman for the Dumfries and Galloway Regional
Council, said the 2,500 residents of Lockerbie hope the service will
mark the end of the international attention the town has received
for the past two weeks and enable them to return slowly to normal
life.

   Authorities have expelled a
Pakistani nuclear physicist suspected of helping his country make a
nuclear bomb, the Justice Ministry said Tuesday.
   Abdul Qadr Khan, 52, was arrested Dec. 24 and put on a plane to
Pakistan ``as an undesirable alien'' the same day, according to
Ministry spokeswoman Toos Faber.
   In 1985, a Dutch court sentenced Khan in absentia to four years
in prison for stealing confidential papers from a Dutch uranium
enrichment plant. However, that verdict was overturned two years
later on a legal technicality.
   Khan, who left the country in 1975, denies the allegations. Mrs.
Faber said Khan was put on a list of undesirable aliens despite
reversal of his conviction.
   Khan, who is Dutch-trained and married to a Dutch women, was
accused of carrying out the theft while working here in the nuclear
industry. He was suspected of stealing information in 1974 from the
West European consortium Urenco at its plant in Almelo, Netherlands.
   After he returned to Pakistan, he worked as chief of a uranium
enrichment facility in Kahuta.
   Pakistan says its nuclear facilities are used only to produce
energy, but India and other foreign countries suspect Pakistan of
trying to make nuclear weapons.
   Authorities detained Khan on Dec. 24 on suspicion of carrying
forged identity papers during a routine traffic check at the city of
Bergen op Zoom, near the Belgian border, Mrs Faber said. Bergen op
Zoom is the hometown of his wife, Hanny, the official said.

<UNK>Oil From Dec. 22 Spill Seeps Into Strait of Juan de Fuca</UNK>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SHORES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil from a 231,000-gallon spill off
the central Washington coast nearly two weeks ago has drifted more
than 100 miles into the Strait of Juan de Fuca separating the state
from Vancouver Island.
   The spill has killed more than 3,200 sea birds, state officials
said, with more expected to die despite hand-cleaning by volunteers.
The latest bird cleaning station was set up Tuesday at Neah Bay, on
the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula.
   For residents of Port Angeles on the southern shore of the
strait, the appearance of oil brought to mind the December 1985
spill of 239,000 gallons of Alaska crude into the city's harbor when
the a tanker ran aground, the worst oil disaster in Washington's
waters. Estimates of birds killed in that disaster ranged as high as
4,000.
   Oil from the Dec. 22 has been detected as far south as Newport,
Ore., and as far north as the coast of British Columbia, a 300-mile
stretch. The leak began when a tugboat towing an oil barge punched a
hole in the barge in high seas. The hole was plugged and the barge
taken to Portland, Ore., for repairs.
   Damage to the coastline from the oil and the cleanup, including
raking up the beaches and the use of helicopters and other machines,
will be hard to measure, said Chuck Janda, Olympic National Park's
chief ranger.
   Forty beach-cleaners worked Tuesday on northern wilderness
beaches soiled over the weekend when storm waves brought in oil
thought to have dissipated at sea, said Doug Zimmer, a spokesman for
the state Department of Wildlife.
   Roughly 5,000 birds have been contaminated by the oil, he said.
Volunteers recovered more than 2,600 birds, which are cleaned and
kept in holding ponds until natural oils critical to their buoyancy
return. But about 800 have died.
   Volunteers in the Neah Bay area reported seeing flocks of birds
unable to fly but resisting capture. A dead, oil-coated seal also
was found near the bay, though the cause of its death was unknown.
   Washed and healthy birds are being shuttled from the biggest bird
cleanup center at Ocean Shores, near the site of the spill, to Hood
Canal, a saltwater inlet 60 miles inland from the coast where the
birds won't meet with more oil, Zimmer said.
   Thirty cleaned birds were released Monday and Tuesday along Hood
Canal, near members of their own species, he said. Last week, 12
birds were released.

   Snow and freezing drizzle fell across the Great Lakes region on
Tuesday, causing slippery road conditions, while temperatures in the
upper Mississippi Valley dipped to 15 below to 30 below zero with
the wind chill factor.
   Snow accumulated over much of Wisconsin and Minnesota and in
northern Indiana and northwest Ohio, falling at the rate of 2 inches
an hour at Alpena, Mich., on Tuesday afternoon.
   Freezing rain caused several multiple car accidents in the
Indianapolis area.
   Marquette and Escanaba, Mich., measured 4 inches of snow, while
Houghton Lake, Mich., received 3 inches.
   Snow advisories were posted in much of northern and central Ohio,
western Pennsylvania and the West Virginia Panhandle. A winter storm
watch was posted for the mid-Atlantic Coast from Long Island to
Delaware in preparation for the approaching low-pressure system.
   Snowshowers lingered Tuesday afternoon over southern Minnesota
and southern Wisconsin, with wind gusts of up to 45 mph blowing snow
across the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes.
   Scattered rain was reported from Alabama into the Carolinas, and
light rain fell along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Dense fog settled into the central California valleys Tuesday
morning.
   Winds continued to be strong and gusty on the east side of the
northern Rockies. Wind gusts reached 74 mph at Livingston, Mont.,
and 49 mph at Cody Wyo.
   Mobile, Ala., reached 77 degrees Tuesday, setting a record
temperature for the date. The old record was 76 degrees in 1952.
   The low in the nation this morning was 13 degrees below zero at
Gunnison Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees below zero at Detroit Lakes, Minn., to 85 degrees at
Harlingen and Kingsville, Texas.
   For Wednesday, the National Weather Service forecast widespread
rain from the Pacific northwest into the northern Plateau and
northern California. Rain and a few thunderstorms will develop
across the southern Plateau region with wet snow spreading across
parts of northern Arizona. Winds will be gusty at times from the
central Appalachians to the mid Atlantic Coast and southern New
England.
   High temperatures will rise into the 40s or 50s across much of
the nation. Highs will be in the single digits and teens from the
northern Great Lakes into New England, in the 20s and 30s from the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley to the lower Great
Lakes, the lower Ohio Valley, the central Appalachians and to the
mid Atlantic Coast. Highs will be in the 30s across the central
intermountain region.
   Highs will be in the 60s along the southern California coast and
from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas into western Oklahoma, southeast
Colorado, across Texas and southern Louisiana and to central
Florida. Highs will be in the 70s across the southern parts of Texas
and southern Florida.

   President Reagan will undergo surgery at
Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington on Saturday for correction
of a long-standing contraction of the ring finger of his left hand,
his doctor said Tuesday.
   Col. John Hutton, the Army doctor who is the White House
physician, described the procedure as elective surgery and said it
should not interrupt the president's normal schedule, except that he
will have a bandage on his left hand.
   Hutton said the president would be admitted to the hospital
Friday, the operation would be performed on Saturday and the
president is expected to return to the White House on Sunday.
   He said an axillary block, a form of regional anesthesia numbing
the arm, would be used for the operation. He said no general
anesthesia is anticipated.
   The operation is expected to take two to three hours, he said.
   ``The president's contracture was minimal but present when he
took office in 1981, and has been followed over the past eight
years,'' Hutton said. ``Within the past year, it has progressed to
the degree that surgical therapy is now necessary.''
   The condition is known as Dupuytren's Contracture, after Baron
Dupuytren, a French surgeon who described it in 1833.
   The White House described the condition as ``a progressive,
usually painless contraction of the digits'' which is common in men
over 60.
   Reagan, 77, last underwent surgery in January, 1987, when he was
operated upon for a prostate condition.
   Reagan's previous operations as president have been performed at
Bethesda Naval Hospital. White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said
Walter Reed was chosen because the hand surgeons who will perform
the operation are at that hospital.
   The physicians will be Dr. George Bogumill of Georgetown
University, a consultant at Walter Reed; Col. Alan Smith and Maj.
Paul Perlik of the Hand Service at Walter Reed, and Hutton.
   Hutton said the president would rest in his room after the
operation and should be ambulatory by afternoon. The surgery is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m. EST.
   The White House distributed a fact sheet from the Hand Surgery
Section of the Walter Reed Orthopedic Department saying the
condition most commonly affects the ring or little finger or both.
   The sheet said it affects men up to ten times more frequently
than women and the chances of a person contracting it over the age
of 60 may be as much as one in five.
   It said the treatment, when surgery is required, consists of
surgical removal of the affected tissue when the first knuckle is
contracted, or bent inward, 30 degrees or more, or when the second
or third knuckled are affected. It said the operation usually
results in full correction at the first knuckle, but often leaves
some residual contraction at the second knuckle.
   After treatment, it said, the patient wears a bulky dresing from
the fingers to the upper arm for one to three days. Active motion is
encouraged.
   A smaller dressing is then used. Sutures are removed 10 to 14
days after surgery.
   It takes about six to eight weeks for the patient to recover the
ability to use the affected finger.
   Dr. Charles Lane, a hand specialist in private practice in
Beverly Hills, said the cause of the disease is unknown.
   He said the disease causes a thickeninging of the gristle under
the skin, resulting in limited motion of the fingers.
   ``It pulls the fingers down so the fingers can't be
straightened,'' Lane said.
   He said this could be particularly troublesome in the case of
someone like Reagan who has to shake hands frequently because ``he
would be tickling people's palms.''
   ``Also, it's hard when you shave and when yhou try to get your
hands in your pockets,'' he said.
   He said the operation is delicate but not particularly risky.
   When told that Reagan would spend Friday and Saturday nights in
the hospital, the doctor commented, ``Medicare would never pay for
that. They make us do them all as outpatients. Two nights is
probably just a matter of convenience.''
   Lane said patients are often required to wear a dynamic, or
spring, splint to help straighten the fingers after the operation
and sometimes also do exercises as part of their therapy.

   There were 132,976 cases of AIDS
reported to the World Health Organization by 177 countries by the
end of 1988, according to a WHO survey released Tuesday.
   The total, which represents all cases ever reported to WHO, is
2.8 percent higher than that of Nov. 30, chiefly due to updated
reports from the United States, with 80,538 cases as of Dec. 14, and
from other Western countries.
   Uganda, with the second-highest number of cases, 5,508, has not
filed a new report since August. France ranks third with 4,874 cases
listed by the end of September.
   The actual number of cases worldwide is estimated by WHO at more
than 350,000. Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the WHO's global
program on AIDS, predicted that during 1989 and 1990, more than
400,000 new cases are expected to occur, with another 600,000
anticipated in the following three years.
   The WHO estimates at least 5 million people are infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, sharply reducing its
previous projections of the spread of the disease. About 20 percent
to 30 percent of HIV-infected people develop AIDS within five years,
according to WHO.
   In March 1987, a WHO report said 50 million to 100 million people
may be infected by 1991. But a new estimate last month put that
projected figure at 6 million to 7 million. Dr. Mann spoke of
``dramatic evidence'' of behavioral change in some high-risk groups,
including homosexuals, prostitutes and intravenous drug users.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   A computer hacker charged with infiltrating
systems in the United States and England, was declared ``a very,
very great danger to the community'' Tuesday by a judge who renewed
his imprisonment without bail.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made her ruling after
Kevin David Mitnick, 25, pleaded innocent to computer fraud charges
and his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail.
   Attorney Alan Rubin argued that Mitnick is ``being held
incommunicado'' and is being treated more harshly than men charged
with violent crimes.
   ``My client is being portrayed as some sort of Machiavellian
figure _ either out of government paranoia ... or some other
government agenda I'm not aware of,'' said attorney Alan Rubin.
   Rubin accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness of
the case and suggested that Mitnick be released to his family with a
tap placed on his telephone.
   But the judge, citing Mitnick's previous misdemeanor conviction
on a similar computer related crime, rejected that suggestion.
``Isn't it highly likely he'll do it again?'' she asked.
   Rubin insisted he wouldn't repeat the action. A Mitnick associate
who turned him in has told of the young man's genius with computers
and his alleged ability to tap into computers operated by the
National Security Agency, among others.
   The super-secret NSA is responsible for electronic eavesdropping,
gathering data from U.S. spy satellites and conducting sophisticated
signals intelligence.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Weidman, said he will file further
charges against Mitnick next week. ``We believe he's extremely
dangerous and should not be allowed any access to a computer or
telephone,'' Weidman said.
   Mitnick is being held in a maximum-security cell at the federal
Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is not allowed to make phone
calls unless he is monitored by an administrator.
   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraud
charges. He is accused of unauthorized use of MCI long-distance
codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and the
University of Southern California, and of causing $4 million damage
to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Leonard DiCicco, 23, an associate who reported Mitnick to
authorities, has described the defendant as ``a big fat slob of a
guy who couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computer
somewhere.''
   ``It's scary to think of the things he's capable of,'' said
DiCicco.
   The 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick, clad in a khaki prison uniform,
answered, ``Not guilty,'' twice when asked for his plea to the
charges against him.
   His trial was tentatively set for Feb. 21 but Judge Pfaelzer said
that would be changed if a new indictment is filed.
   ``I have no doubt that he is a very, very great danger to the
community,'' she said. ``I also believe he is a flight risk.''
   She ordered restrictions on his telephone use to remain in effect.
   When Rubin objected to Mitnick being housed in a high security
area of the prison, Ms. Pfaelzer declared: ``The court thinks high
security is entirely appropriate with this defendant.''
   Rubin said he believed authorities were reacting to ``technology
fear and other reports of computer viruses'' elsewhere in the nation.
   Mitnick reportedly used the code name ``Condor'' in his
electronic activities, taking the name from the 1975 film ``Three
Days of the Condor,'' in which Robert Redford played a CIA
researcher and telephone expert.
   DiCicco contends that Mitnick is obsessed with two things _ fast
food and computers. ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees
and work on computers,'' DiCicco said.

<HEAD>Singer Given Until Feb. 1 To Accept $5.3 Million From NBC Or Face
New Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has given singer Wayne Newton
until Feb. 1 to accept a reduced $5.3 million award in his libel
suit against NBC or face the prospect of proving his case again in a
new trial.
   U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker's decision, filed last week in
Fresno, Calif., came after attorneys for Newton argued for a new
trial solely on damages while NBC attorneys sought a complete rerun
of the original 1986 Las Vegas trial, which lasted eight weeks.
   Crocker said in the ruling that he was ``convinced that the
issues of liability and damages are so intertwined that they should
be determined by the same jury.''
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, was not immediately available
for comment on what the entertainer would decide to do.
   Newton won a record $22.8 million verdict against the network
when a jury ruled the singer was defamed in a series of NBC
broadcasts that linked him to organized crime figures.
   Crocker, however, later threw out all but $5.3 million of the
award, and gave Newton the option of accepting the money or seeking
a new trial strictly on damages.
   Both sides submitted lengthy legal briefs in October in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, where the case was transferred for a
retrial scheduled for May.
   The Newton-NBC case stems from an Oct. 6, 1980, broadcast
entitled ``Wayne Newton and the Law.''
   In the report, NBC correspondent Brian Ross reported that Newton
had gone to organized crime figure Guido Penosi for help with a
problem.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.
The hotel has since been sold and is currently owned by Japanese
businessman Ginji Yasuda.
   Galane has suggested he will call as witnesses such luminaries as
President Reagan, Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball to testify in
Newton's behalf for assessing damages in a new trial.

   A man who stole a Philadelphia
transit bus from a depot early Tuesday took police on a half-hour,
fender-bending chase through two states, leaving a police officer
and 15 other people injured, authorities said.
   The chase ended at 7:45 a.m. when an officer fired at the bus and
the alleged thief, Glen A. Barhight, 35, of Croydon, rammed the
vehicle into a large elm tree in Lower Moreland Township, Police
Chief Frank Amabile said.
   The bus was the second belonging to the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority stolen in the past week.
   Barhight was scheduled to be arraigned on charges of aggravated
assault, recklessly endangering another person, receiving stolen
property and causing a catastrophe, authorities said.
   Amabile said there was no indication he was hit by a bullet, but
an unidentified Abington Memorial Hospital spokeswoman said he was
in stable condition with a graze wound to his head, abdominal
injuries and cuts to his left arm.
   Middletown officer Leroy Alexander, 39, who was crushed between
the bus and a patrol car, was listed in guarded condition with
abdominal injuries at St. Mary Hospital in Langhorne, spokeswoman
Elle Rudolph said.
   Authorities said 14 people were injured when the bus hit their
cars just blocks before the crash. Six were admitted tohospitals
with problems ranging from cuts to neck and back injuries; the rest
were treated and discharged.
   SEPTA spokesman James Whitaker said the bus was stolen from a
depot in northeast Philadelphia. Amabile placed the time at 4:30
a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
   The first report of the stolen bus came shortly before 7 a.m. in
the township of Middletown, where Police Chief Frank McKenna, who
alerted police departments about the stolen bus, said the bus
knocked down a traffic light.
   At 7:15 a.m., the bus started crossing a bridge into Trenton,
N.J., from Morrisville, according to Lower Moreland Detective Sgt.
James Cummings.
   Bridge personnel tried to stop the bus, because it was oversized,
but the vehicle continued, damaging overhead signs, Cummings said.
It turned around and came back into Pennsylvania on U.S. Route 1, he
said.
   When the bus got bogged down in traffic, police cars pulled in
front to try to end the pursuit.
   McKenna said Alexander, a 16-year officer, got out of his car and
approached the bus. As he tried to open the rear doors, the traffic
cleared and the bus pulled away, dragging Alexander ``the length of
two cars'' and pinning him between the bus and a police car, McKenna
said.
   At least two officers fired at the bus during the chase.
   The bus continued into Philadelphia and then into Lower Moreland,
where it crashed after hitting about 13 cars, authorities said.
   On Saturday, a SEPTA bus was stolen in Upper Darby and struck a
dozen cars in Philadelphia. The driver in that incident escaped.

<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that Joel Steinberg,
accused in the slaying of the 6-year-old girl he illegally adopted,
must submit to an examination by a psychiatrist retained by
prosecutors.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax, who is presiding over
the murder trial, said he would grant the Manhattan district
attorney's request to have Steinberg examined because his lawyers
appear to be presenting an insanity defense even though they are not
saying so.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with
second-degree murder in the November 1987 beating death of Lisa
Steinberg, the girl he illegally obtained from an unwed teen-ager
and raised as his own.
   The judge's ruling forces Steinberg to decide whether he will
argue that he is not criminally responsible by reason of mental
disease or defect.
   When a defendant claims he is insane and therefore not
responsible, the prosecution has the right to examine him to try to
disprove that claim.
   Rothwax left it to lawyers for both sides to work out an exam
schedule.
   The judge said that if the defense does not invoke an insanity
defense at any point in the remainder of the trial then the
prosecution psychiatrist will not be called and there will be no
harm to the defense case.
   If the defense clearly presents an insanity defense later, then
the prosecution will be prepared to rebut the testimony, the judge
said.
   Ira London, one of Steinberg's lawyers, said he will probably not
argue insanity and will probably refuse to allow prosecution
psychiatrists to examine Steinberg. He said the judge misunderstood
the defense position.
   Rothwax noted that the defense last month asked to be allowed to
enter an insanity plea and was turned down with permission to try
again.

   Maoist guerrillas killed seven villagers by
slitting their throats during a raid, and an anti-rebel death squad
wounded this town's Marxist mayor in a bomb attack Tuesday, police
said.
   A column of Shining Path guerrillas swept into the farming hamlet
of Occollo, on Ayacucho's western outskirts, late Monday night and
ordered villagers to assemble in the central plaza, police said.
   The rebels then picked out seven men and slit their throats,
charging they belonged to a village self-defense patrol organized to
resist the Shining Path, the police said.
   Rebels have executed hundreds of peasants they suspect of being
local patrol members since the military organized the groups several
years ago in villages across Ayacucho state.
   Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast of Lima, is the cradle of the
Mao-inspired Shining Path. In its eight-year fight, the group has
claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   A placard left by attackers outside the house of Mayor Fermin
Azparrent in Ayacucho warned him to leave town within two weeks or
face death, police said. They said the threat was signed by the
Rodrigo Franco Command.
   The Franco group surfaced in July when it killed a defense
attorney for leftist guerrillas and vowed to rid the country of
rebels and influential people it considers soft on subversion.
   The mayor, a vocal critic of the government's anti-terrorism
policies, told The Associated Press he was cut by flying glass but
not seriously injured in the early morning bombing at his home.
   Azparrent, a member of the Marxist coalition the United Left, the
second strongest party in Peru's Congress, said the bomb exploded at
the front entryway, destroying the door, demolishing furniture and
shattering windows and lights.
   Ayacucho's San Cristobal University, criticized by the right wing
as a hotbed of radical thought, also was bombed but there were no
injuries and police said there was only minor damage.
   The Franco group has issued death threats to nearly a dozen
journalists, many of whom are known to be strongly anti-guerrilla
but also have been harsh critics of Peru's center-left government.
   Officials have rejected charges that the death squad is linked to
the ruling Aprista Party and have said its members will be captured.

   The son of Archbishop Desmond
Tutu said Tuesday he engineered his own arrest at an airport to
promote an advertising agency he heads.
   Trevor Tutu made the declaration to reporters after going to
court Tuesday first to face charges stemming from the airport
incident and then to answer minor traffic violations.
   ``We're in the business of playing with people's minds,'' Tutu,
32, told reporters at his news conference. He said he tricked police
into arresting him mainly ``to tell people that TuMult had arrived.''
   He serves as chairman of TuMult, a black-oriented advertising
agency formed a few months ago. He said the name was chosen to sound
like his last name, which gained international fame in 1984 when his
father won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Earlier Tuesday, Tutu and a former girlfriend appeared in a
suburban magistrate's court to face charges of violating civil
aviation laws.
   The charges relate to an incident over Tutu's luggage Saturday at
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport. The case against Tutu and Joan
Rhodes was postponed until Feb. 15.
   But Tutu was taken into custody by Johannesburg police as he left
the Kempton Park courthouse, driven to police headquarters, and
fined $160 for failing to answer three traffic summonses.
   He pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed vehicle and parking
twice in a loading zone.
   At the news conference, Tutu said he and colleagues planned the
airport incident as a promotion stunt.
   Tutu said he changed into dirty, old clothes while heading into
Johannesburg on a flight from Swaziland. He said he then placed
luggage near some policemen at the airport and told them he was a
servant acting on instructions of his white employer.
   He said the police did nothing until he came back later to remove
the bags and told them the parcels could have contained bombs.
   At that point, he said, many policemen converged, and he was
arrested, Tutu said.
   ``I tied down 5,000 guys,'' Tutu said of security personnel. He
repeatedly mocked police, saying at one point: ``They don't know
what they're doing.''
   Police have warned South Africans not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas.
   Tutu is the eldest of four children of Desmond Tutu, who leads
the Anglican Church in southern Africa. The father won the Nobel
Prize for his campaigning against the country's system of racial
discrimination.
   Trevor Tutu said his father did not know in advance of his recent
activities but added: ``As long as I'm using peaceful means, he
doesn't mind.''
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving.
   In 1985, he was briefly detained after arguing with police at a
courthouse about the detention of black children.

   A passenger bus ran off a roadside cliff and
tumbled 165 feet down a ravine in the Andes mountains, killing 13
travelers and injuring 30, the government newspaper said Tuesday.
   The crash occurred late Monday night near Huambos, a mountain
hamlet 400 miles northeast of Lima, the La Cronica newspaper
reported.
   In preliminary reports, officials blamed the crash on poor
driving conditions caused by fog and wet roads, the newspaper said.
   The privately owned bus was en route from the highland town of
Chota to coastal Chiclayo, 120 miles west, La Cronica said.
   Two weeks ago, a bus crash in the Andes killed 21 passengers.
   Authorities said accidents in the mountains occur with greater
frequency from December to March, due to heavy seasonal rains that
worsen conditions on roads already poorly paved or made of dirt and
gravel.

   A judge on Tuesday ordered Dartmouth College
to lift suspensions against two former editors of the Dartmouth
Review, a conservative student newspaper, citing the bias of a
disciplinary board member.
   Grafton County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl's ruling did not
address First Amendment claims and other broad issues in the
students' underlying lawsuit, which he termed ``a massive legal
battleground.''
   In a state lawsuit and a companion federal action, Review
staffers accuse Dartmouth of violating their rights and
discriminating against conservatives. The two former editors sought
reinstatement while they pursue those lawsuits.
   Mohl also left the door open to further disciplinary action by
the Ivy League school against former Dartmouth Review staffers
Christopher Baldwin and John Sutter by a reconstituted disciplinary
panel.
   Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale, Ill., and Sutter, 22, of St. Louis,
were suspended in March for 18 months for their role in a classroom
encounter with a black professor of music, William Cole. A third
Review staffer involved in the incident has completed his six-month
suspension; a fourth served probation.
   The students, who are white, denied any racial motivation but the
incident sparked renewed racial tensions on the Hanover campus.
   Mohl ruled that disciplinary panel member Albert LaValley's
presence on the panel ``was fundamentally unfair'' to the students.
   LaValley's objectivity was disputed because of a letter he had
signed four months before the incident. The letter condemned the
off-campus weekly Review for ``slanderous articles'' that
``seriously threatened the principle of academic freedom'' and
complained of ``sexist and racist'' characterizations of faculty
members.
   ``No citation is needed to conclude that the letter LaValley
signed, and that he testified that he agreed with, demonstrates
substantial bias and prejudice on his part against students who
write for The Dartmouth Review,'' Mohl wrote.
   ``Had the content of the letter been known to the (disciplinary
board), the court cannot imagine the (board) reaching any conclusion
other than that LaValley should not sit on the ... panel.''
   The decision noted that LaValley, who was not identified in the
decision other than as a panel member, discussed the letter with the
disciplinary board chairman the day hearings for the students began.
   LaValley could not recall details of the letter at the time and
said he believed he could be objective. Others on the panel, whose
members include students, faculty members and administrators,
accepted his judgment, the court wrote.

   A motor launch carrying more than 150
people was reported to have sunk in the central Philippines, with
most passengers saved but at least five people dead and 19 missing,
the coast guard said Wednesday.
   Lt. Felix Claro, coast guard operations officer in Iloilo city,
said a mayor in Romblon province gave the casualty figures in
reporting by radio that the vessel Gem sank Tuesday off Looc Bay,
about 150 miles southeast of Manila.
   Claro said the mayor reported that at least 134 people were
rescued.
   The officer said he sent a rescue team to verify the radio
message but bad weather delayed operations. He did not give the
mayor's name.

   Sources said writer Andrei Sinyavsky returned to
the Soviet Union for the first time in 15 years Tuesday for a
reunion with the widow of Yuli Daniel, with whom he stood trial in
1966 on charges of illegally publishing abroad.
   Sinyavsky and his wife arrived after Irina Uvarova, Daniel's
wife, made an appeal to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze to allow them to come to Moscow, said Western
journalists who met Sinyavsky at the airport.
   Daniel died of a stroke at his home Friday night. He was buried
Monday, but Sinyavsky did not get his visa in time to attend the
funeral.
   The trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel 22 years ago was a worldwide
sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents
during the years of former Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The two were arrested about a year after Brezhnev ousted Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who had given writers somewhat more freedom after the
years of Josef Stalin's repression.
   Daniel received a sentence of five years in prison and labor
camps for publishing his writings abroad. He remained in the Soviet
Union after his release and refrained from any dissident activity.
   Sinyavsky received a seven-year term and emigrated to France
after he was released.
   ``I think they gave me the visas for fear of a big scandal if
they refused,'' the journalists quoted Sinyavsky as saying.
   The journalists, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
quoted Sinyavsky as saying he was pleased with improvements in the
Soviet press and in cultural life, but that they were not yet
irreversible.

   The Sandinista government will not
reply to peace proposals advanced by rebel leaders until after
President-elect George Bush is inaugurated, Vice President Sergio
Ramirez said Tuesday.
   ``We will wait until he (Bush) decides what to do with the
Contras,'' Ramirez said, reiterating the leftist government's
longstanding position that the rebels are ``a creature of the United
States.''
   Ramirez commented after four resistance leaders sent a letter to
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica asking for his help in reopening
peace talks with the Sandinistas.
   Arias is the author of a 1987 peace plan for Central America that
calls, in part, for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, said last
week they would submit negotiation proposals to Central American
presidents, due to meet in San Salvador on Jan. 15 in a bid to
revive the stalled Central American peace process.
   In the letter to Arias, Contra leaders Adolfo Calero, Enrique
Bermudez, Roberto Ferrey and Wilfredo Montalvan proposed that talks
begin in Washington on Jan. 25.
   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday denounced rebel statements
and said he would not negotiate with the Contras. He has called on
the rebels to lay down arms and accept a government amnesty. Ortega
was in Cuba on Tuesday celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Cuban
revolution.
   Ramirez said his government is ready to negotiate with the United
States and to continue the peace process.
   The Sandinistas came to power through a revolution in 1979. They
have been challenged by the rebels in a civil war that has gone on
for more than seven years and taken more than 50,000 lives.
   Most of the fighting stopped when a cease-fire was declared in
March 1988, but further talks to settle the conflict broke down in
September.

<HEAD>Polish Minister Foresees Cuts in Military Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland will cut tens of thousands of people
from its military and reduce the percentage of national income spent
on defense because of decreasing East-West tensions, the defense
minister was quoted as saying Tuesday.
   Gen. Florian Siwicki forecast such money-saving steps as
consolidating military academies and officers' schools, cutting the
number of reservists called up for active duty, and increasing the
number of units whose personnel are reduced in peacetime, according
to the state news agency PAP.
   ``We assume that these changes will bring considerable benefits,
running into tens of thousands of full-time jobs, as well as big
material and financial savings,'' PAP quoted him as saying.
   Poland has the second-largest army in the Warsaw Pact military
alliance after the Soviet Union. The London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies in 1987 estimated Poland's army as
having 394,000 active troops and 491,000 reservists.
   Siwicki said Poland had reduced the size of its military by
15,000 troops in the past two years, liquidated two mechanized
divisions and retired many older planes, tanks and artillery pieces,
the news agency reported.
   The planned $1.9 billion military budget for 1989 represents 3.6
percent of the total national income, compared to 3.8 percent of
national income spent on defense in 1988, Siwicki was quoted as
saying.
   Siwicki did not specify the size of the 1988 military budget but
said the 1989 budget represented a reduction in real terms from 1988
of 4 percent. That would indicate a 1988 military budget of around
$1.98 billion.
   The minister said Poland generally has spent about 4 percent of
its national income on the military but now intends to lower that
ratio.
   ``If peace trends are lasting, they will make it possible for us
to ensure national security at a correspondingly lower cost,''
Siwicki was quoted as saying. ``A process of reducing the defense
budget is a logical consequence of this.''

<HEAD>FEMA Begins Assessment For Possible Disaster Declaration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teams of federal, state and local
inspectors toured a flood-ravaged area Tuesday to assess damage from
a dike break that damaged more than 150 homes, an official said.
   There were no injuries from the dike break, but four bridges were
washed out and a number of livestock were killed. By Tuesday, about
80 people, mostly tenants at damaged apartment buildings, still were
displaced, said Jerry Lewis, chairman of the Washington County
Commission.
   Four teams, including one from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, were surveying damage to homes, businesses, farms, roads,
bridges and sanitation plants, said David Grier of the FEMA regional
office in Denver.
   ``It'll be a few days before final figures are in, and the
figures will be influenced by flood insurance and other
considerations, including whether people have found place to live or
whether they have other unmet needs,'' he said.
   If FEMA issues a disaster declaration, the federal government
could reimburse residents for up to 75 percent of their losses, with
the remainder covered by state and local governments.
   As the teams investigated the damage, many residents complained
they were warned either too early or too late of the flood early
Sunday. Some 1,500 people were evacuated from along the Virgin River
before a wall of water rushed from a 200-foot-wide gap in the dike
at Quail Creek Reservoir.
   ``We could have gotten a lot of stuff out if we had been given a
more realistic time,'' said Myron Nelson, a resident of the
Riverside Apartments complex south of St. George. ``We got the TV
and the sewing machine out but there was a lot more we probably
could have taken with us had we known.''
   Ruth Ann Basile said the flood swept away her horses, chickens,
dogs and 20 cows and demolished fences, chicken coops and alfalfa
fields.
   ``They should have alerted people sooner than they did,'' she
said. ``If we had just had notice, we could have moved our livestock
to higher ground and saved them.''
   The flow from the broken dike was down to a trickle by Monday,
power was restored and residents in St. George and its suburbs were
cleaning up. Bulldozers were being used Tuesday to build a
cofferdam, a small temporary water-tight barrier.
   Lewis said engineers have begun evaluating the cause of the
break. The dike has seeped off and on since 1985, when the reservoir
was filled.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter has declared the county an emergency disaster
area, but he underwent knee surgery Tuesday and had not signed the
necessary documents, said press secretary Francine Giani.
   She said the governor was expected to formalize the declaration
upon his return to duty, possibly Wednesday. Bangerter has vowed to
rebuild the 2,000-foot-long, 50-foot-high dike, which would take an
estimated six months.

<HEAD>Torture Murderer in Serious Condition After Apparent Suicide Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for torture-murderer Gary Heidnik
criticized prison officials Tuesday for not supervising him more
closely before his drug overdose, and a prosecutor said he doubted
Heidnik wanted to kill himself.
   Heidnik was ``semi-comatose'' and in serious condition Tuesday at
West Penn Hospital, where he was taken from the State Correctional
Institution after being found unconscious Sunday in his death row
cell, prison officials said.
   A prison statement Tuesday said Heidnik ``is believed to have
stored medications that were prescribed for him by pretending to
take them at the designated times.''
   A psychiatrist who interviewed Heidnik before his trial said
hospital officials told him the medicine was an anti-psychosis drug,
Thorazine. Prison spokesman Tom Seiverling refused to identify the
drug.
   Heidnik faces the death sentence for the slayings of two of six
women he kept chained in the basement of his Philadelphia row house.
   His attorney, A. Charles Peruto Jr., said his client should have
been under a 24-hour watch because of past suicide attempts.
   ``They obviously did not check his mouth to make sure he was
taking his medication,'' Peruto said. ``He was never off suicide
watch in Philadelphia.''
   Peruto said Heidnik had a history of trying to commit suicide
with stockpiled Thorazine. were unsure how many tablets Heidnik had
swallowed, he said, but his client had been getting one tablet daily.
   ``The ironic thing is now they're going to work on him around the
clock so he can regain consciousness so we can execute him,'' Peruto
said.
   Assistant District Attorney Charles Gallagher, who prosecuted
Heidnik, said Tuesday he understood from prison officials that
Heidnik's condition was not life-threatening. He said Heidnik had
feigned suicide attempts in the past.
   He said Heidnik has used claims of suicide attempts and failures
to get better prison conditions. The attempts have succeeded in the
past in getting him into hospital settings, instead of the general
prison population, he said.
   Dr. Clancy D. McKenzie, a Philadelphia psychiatrist who spent 110
hours interviewing Heidnik, said West Penn doctors told him Heidnik
took an overdose of Thorazine, which he probably had been
stockpiling for three months.
   The 45-year-old self-proclaimed minister was convicted July 1 of
murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in a
basement torture chamber in his north Philadelphia home. A jury
sentenced him to death a day later, and his formal sentencing is
scheduled for Feb. 9.
   Next week, a federal bankruptcy judge is to distribute more than
$500,000 in stocks and bonds found in Heidnik's house after he was
arrested.

   College students from 19 nations have
arrived at Princeton University to match wits in a war of words.
   The students will begin competing Wednesday in the ninth annual
World Universities Debating Championship, a most argumentative forum
that pits nearly 250 top speech-makers in what is considered the
``world cup'' of debating.
   ``This is the largest and most diverse debate tournament ever
held,'' said Drew Graham, a Princeton University student who is
organizing the event. ``For the first time, we've even got students
from Eastern bloc countries. A Polish delegation will participate
and the Soviet Union is sending a delegation to observe. We're very
excited about it.''
   The tournament, sponsored by Princeton University's
Whig-Cliosphic Society, North America's oldest debate organization,
will conclude with a championship round on Monday.
   Some 120 teams are represented, including 33 from the United
States. A team from Oxford University in Great Britain won last
year's championship.
   The debaters will duel under rules made famous by Great Britain's
parliament under a style where ``delivery and wit have a lot of
emphasis,'' Graham said. ``They'll debate topics such as whether
education is a right or privilege.''
   ``You've got to have a convincing style and a persuasive
manner,'' said Graham, who is one of 60 judges in the tournament.
``There's no prepared research.''
   To some participants, a quick-thinking mind and a lively tongue
are key ingredients to a successful debate.
   ``The concept of `winging it' when you don't know much about the
topic is one of the most oft-used expressions,'' said Australian
Julian McMahon, 25, of Melbourne University. ``When we need to wing
it, we emulate the politician by getting as few ideas as possible to
the gallon.''
   Present day politicians, however, are not held in as high esteem
by the Australians.
   ``We'd be happy to debate Dan Quayle any time,'' laughed McMahon.
   Some nations, such as New Guinea, have sent participants for the
first time.
   Wialo Sakatao, 19, of Papua, New Guinea, said his challenge will
be debating in English, which is his second language.
   ``In New Guinea, debating is popular in the schools,'' said
Sakatao. ``But culturally, there are a lot of tribal arguments over
many things, including politics.''
   Suzanne Hagedorn, a spokeswoman for the 300-member
Whig-Cliosophic Society at Princeton, said debating in the United
States was once viewed ``as college sports are today.''
   In Scotland, which will hold next year's championship, debating
``is part of our fabric,'' said David Rennie, 22, a debater from
Glasgow University, the only team that has won two championships.
   ``It's interesting to see how the different countries approach
the debates,'' said Rennie. ``The Americans tend to be more
analytical, while the Scots are more direct and to the point. The
Irish, they're a wee bit more philosophical.''
   Staving off defeat can require some fancy brainwork, especially
if the debater stumbles, Rennie said.
   ``You've got to turn it to your advantage if you stumble,''
Rennie said. ``You've got to keep it going. The one thing you can't
do is to say, `I'm sorry, I've got nothing left to say.'''
   U.S. teams participating are: Augsberg College, Bates College,
Bucknell University, Columbia University, Cornell University,
Emerson College, Fordham University, Furman University, Harvard
University, Case Western, Johns Hopkins University, Marist
University, Mount Holyoke College, New York University, Oberlin
College, Regis High School and Rice University.
   Also, Sacred Heart University, St. Lawrence University, St. Louis
University, Smith College, Stanford University, Swarthmore
University, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, University of
California at Berkeley, University of California at Los Angeles,
University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, University of
Richmond, Vassar College, Wesleyan University, Williams College,

   An air and sea search continued for
a fourth day Tuesday for five Canadians and a St. Vincent boat
captain reported missing in rough seas off the Caribbean island.
   The six were reported missing Friday after their 30-foot
motorboat failed to return to St. Vincent from a day cruise of the
Grenadines island chain nearby, officials said.
   The boat was last seen in Mayreau, a 1-square-mile island 35
miles south of St. Vincent, and was returning to St. Vincent when it
apparently ran into rough weather. High winds and rain halted
landings Friday afternoon at the island's small airport.
   A Mayeau resident who saw the boat leaving said all six people
aboard were wearing orange life jackets.
   Officials identified the six as teacher Frances Eger, 46, her
son, Acron, 18, and daughter, Vija, 19, and real-estate agent Bill
O'Brien, said to be in his 40s, all of Vancouver; Jonathan Deitcher,
20, of Toronto; and boat captain Danny Sorren, about 30, a St.
Vincent native and naturalized U.S. citizen.
   The Canadians were guests of O'Brien's brother, Michael, a
Canadian who manages the Caribbean Sailing Yachts Hotel and Charter
Service in Kingstown.
   The U.S. Coast Guard began a search for the missing boat on
Saturday, aided by the coast guards of St. Vincent, Grenada and
Trinidad, and five privately owned aircraft.

   The City Council voted Tuesday to require all

   Councilman Dozier Smith, who sponsored the drug-testing

   Mayor Andrew Young is expected to approve the proposal when he

   The proposal is expected to go into effect Tuesday. Any
prospective employee who tests positive would be given a second
test, and any who failed both tests would not be hired.
   On a voice vote after five minutes of discussion, the council

   A judge on Tuesday took a weeping
12-year-old girl away from the woman who raised her and gave her to
the mother of her biological parents, who ``disappeared'' during the
former military regime.
   A federal appeals court ruled that Susana Siciliano must give up
the child. Police took Ms. Siciliano and the girl she adopted,
Ximena Vicario, to court Tuesday, where Federal Judge Juan Fegoli
gave her to her grandmother after talks lasting more than seven
hours with both sides and with psychologists.
   The girl sobbed ``Let me stay with my mommy, please!'' as she was
placed with her grandmother, Darwinia Rosa Monaco de Gallichio.
   
   The incident stemmed from the 1976-83 military dictatorship, when
at least 8,960 Argentines were arrested and presumed killed as part
of the military's ``dirty war'' against leftist subversion.
   Ximena's parents _ Juan Carlos Vicario and Stella Maris Gallichio
de Vicario _ were arrested in February 1977 and were never seen
again.
   They ``disappeared,'' as Argentines put it.
   Ximena, then about eight months old, was given to a state
orphanage where Ms. Siciliano worked. She took the baby home,
renamed her Romina Paola and in 1981, legally adopted her.
   In 1984, the grandmother finally traced down the girl and began
legal proceedings to get her back, supported by the human rights
group Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo.
   Ms. Siciliano wept as she walked from the court Tuesday.
   Ximena told reporters, ``I'm content to have another
grandmother,'' but says she wants her grandmother to visit her at
Ms. Siciliano's home.
   Ms. Siciliano knew Ximena's background from the start, and hid
those facts when she applied for adoption, court records show. She
faces charges of abduction of a minor and falsification of records.

   The Kremlin troubleshooter for
Afghanistan is expected here Wednesday in his search for political
arrangements that will enable the Soviets to get all their troops
out on schedule in six weeks.
   Foreign Ministry sources said Yuli Vorontsov would spend four
days in Pakistan, meeting with government officials and Afghan
insurgent leaders.
   Vorontsov is both the Soviet Union's first deputy foreign
minister and its ambassador to Afghanistan. He met with guerrilla
chieftains a month ago in Saudi Arabia, and again in Tehran on
Monday and Tuesday.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
replacing one pro-Moscow regime with another.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in the country when the
Kremlin signed a U.N.-mediated agreement April 14 to withdraw them.
Half the troops were out by Aug. 15, according to U.N. reports, and
the rest are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets temporarily suspended their troop pullout in late
1988, complaining that the United States and Pakistan were still
arming the guerrillas, who continued fighting.
   But Islamabad-based Western diplomats said Tuesday the Soviet
pullout has begun from Shindad and Herat in western Afghanistan, and
they quoted Afghan officials as saying the main Soviet military
withdrawal will begin Jan. 15.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an exodus
of Soviet civilian advisers from the Afghan capital is going on.
   At least 5.5 million Afghans have fled their country during a
decade of civil war, most of them to Pakistan. The insurgents use
border cities and refugee camps as bases and supply points for
operations inside Afghanistan.
   A senior Pakistani diplomat told The Associated Press on Tuesday:
``We have been informed that Vorontsov is bringing a message from
the top Soviet leadership for President Ishaq Khan and Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, as Moscow thinks there is too little time
left to settle the Afghan problem.''
   The Foreign Ministry sources said the Soviet envoy would meet
with Ishaq Khan on Thursday and confer with Ms. Bhutto on Saturday.
   Those meetings are considered important, but the centerpiece of
his visit will be sessions Friday with leaders of the seven-party
Afghan guerrilla alliance based in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, new leader of the Peshawar alliance, told
a news conference in the border city Tuesday he would meet with
Vorontsov this week. The alliance chairmanship rotates among
factions every three months, and Mojaddidi took over Jan. 1.
   One Foreign Ministry official said representatives of guerrillas
based in Iran also might join the talks with Vorontsov.
   Voronstov was in Iran on Tuesday for talks with Iranian officials
and the Iran-based Afghan rebels on the future of Aghanistan, Soviet
and Iranian media reported.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Vorontsov met Iranian
President Ali Khamenei and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, and
held a separate session with Afghan opposition leaders headed by
Mohammad Karim Khalili.
   In both meetings, Tass said Vorontsov urged that a peace
conference of all Afghan political parties and groups be formed soon.
   About 2 million of the Afghan refugees are in Iran. The
Iran-based guerrillas, who are Shiite Moslem, occasionally have been
at odds with the Pakistan-based guerrillas, who are Sunni Moslem.
   At the first talks between Vorontsov and the Pakistan-based
insurgents, Dec. 3-5 at Taif, Saudi Arabia, the alliance proposed
selection of a council of about 400 members that in turn would
choose an interim government.
   Guerrilla leaders insisted that the Soviets remove the current
government before the council was established in Kabul and refused
to accept communists in a postwar government.
   Vorontsov took the demands back to Moscow but the Kremlin has not
replied. Pakistani diplomats said Moscow wants the Communist Party
represented in Afghanistan's next government.
   ``This is mainly a face-saving provision,'' one said. ``Such
representation will let the Soviets feel they have not pulled out of
Afghanistan in humiliation or ... dumped Najib.''
   Najib is president in the current government.
   Leaders of the alliance have criticized the Soviets since the
December meetings in Saudi Arabia.
   ``They feel unhappy because Vorontsov met former King Zahir Shah
and offered him an opportunity to return and play a role in the
future government,'' the diplomat said. ``A majority of the
resistence leaders are opposed to Zahir Shah because of his Western
lifestyle while he ruled Afghanistan ... and the fact he did not
partricipate'' in the war civil war.
   Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973 and lives in Italy.

   The 101st Congress opens with the nation's
legislature still firmly in Democratic control but with important
changes in the leadership that will confront such crucial issues as
the federal budget deficit, the environment, health care and ethics.
   New and re-elected members of the House and Senate were being
sworn in today, and then the two chambers were set to carry out
organizational chores for two days. Among them: a joint session on
Wednesday to count the electoral votes for president.
   Congress will then adjourn until Jan. 20 although hearings could
start before then on some of President-elect Bush's nominations. No
bills will be considered until later in the month, but plenty will
be talked about as lawmakers await Bush's legislative proposals.
   Possibly the most controversial decision members will have to
make early in the session is whether to approve a pay raise for
themselves. A presidential commission has recommended a 50 percent
increase, and many lawmakers contend their jobs make it difficult to
live on the $89,500 base salary.

   The Energy Department is proposing an $81
billion, 20-year program to clean up and modernize the nation's
troubled nuclear weapons production complex.
   ``The cost of modernization and environmental restoration will
require a significant increase in funding for the next two
decades,'' said an Energy Department report for delivery to Congress.
   The $81 billion total includes $52 billion to modernize outdated
facilities, some of which are more than 30 years old, while $29
billion would go toward efforts to deal with radioactive and
chemical contamination at many sites throughout the weapons complex.
   The long-range plan would involve building new facilities in
South Carolina and Idaho as well as phasing out weapons production
activities in Washington state, Colorado and Ohio.

   Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters
says U.N. peacemaking successes last year _ ending wars in
Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war and Angola _ are unprecedented in the
annals of the world body.
   These successes and warming U.S.-Soviet relations have made the
United Nations ``a better place for the United States to do
business,'' Walters said in a farewell interview.
   The former deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency said
the U.S. view of the world body, once hostile and disdainful, has
changed to appreciation. ``If properly handled,'' Walters said,
``the U.N. can be advantageous in promoting our goals of peace,
prosperity and freedom.''
   ``If it didn't exist, it would have to be invented.''

   Fidel Castro's revolution has eradicated much U.S.
influence from Cuba, but certain vestiges defy 30 years of Communist
rule.
   Thousands of pre-revolutionary era American cars, for example,
still negotiate the roads. Washington imposed a trade embargo in
1960.
   Cubans hang on to their rundown Fords and Chevies because later
model Russian-made Ladas are only available to a limited number of
Cubans. Castro says widespread use of private cars is a luxury Cuba
cannot afford.
   Thus, antiquated as they are, U.S.-made cars are still prized
possessions. The driver of a beat-up 1948 Chevrolet said he turned
down an offer of about $10,000 for his car. U.S. cars a decade older
routinely go for twice that price, equivalent to about five years
pay for the average worker.

   In making their wedding plans, Rhonda
Hufford and Todd Kellermann chose musicians, pink dresses and gray
tuxedos. And they were tested for AIDS under a year-old law some
officials say isn't worth the cost.
   The nation's only premarital AIDS testing law may not be a law
much longer, primarily because, like the Kellermanns, the
overwhelming majority of those tested have shown no signs of the
AIDS virus.
   Illinois' mandatory testing program took effect Jan. 1, 1988. But
only 23 of the 150,000 people tested in the first 11 months were
found to be infected with the virus, the state Department of Public
Health said.
   That's about one in 6,500 tested.

   Nicaraguan women, many of whom fought
on the battlefield to help bring about the Sandinista revolution,
are back in combat demanding the new society change its macho
attitude toward females.
   In the past year, a growing women's movement has obtained equal
rights in divorce and had a satirical newspaper suspended for
presenting women as sexual objects.
   It's not a battle won easily in Latin America, where women are
expected to remain subservient to males, stay at home and raise
children. This, despite the fact that many women must work outside
the home to survive.
   Women's lives are further burdened by primitive conditions:
shanty homes, lack of potable water or plumbing, wood-burning stoves.
   These day-to-day struggles, coupled with the lack of education
and sexist attitudes, make the job of the women's movement more
difficult. When asked about women's rights, a peasant woman in the
rural south asked, ``What is that?''
   ``We are trying to change the level of consciousness,'' said Lea
Guido, head of the Luisa Amanda Espinoza Association of Nicaraguan
Women.
   Ms. Guido's group is linked to the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front and takes its name from one of the martyrs in the
fight to depose Anastasio Somoza, who was ousted in 1979.
   ``Participation by women in politics is a new phenomenon,'' she
said. ``It started because everyone was against the dictator, and
that caused everyone to fight. It was the first victory for women.''
   During the war, women served as guerrilla fighters or messengers
and ran safe houses, organized demonstrations, set up contacts and
sought the release of prisoners.
   Dora Maria Tellez was a guerrilla commander. She is now the
minister of health. Doris Maria Tijerino was a clandestine member of
the Sandinista Front. She is now the nation's chief of police.
   Rosario Murillo, the nation's first lady, worked secretly with
the guerrillas. Rosa Pasos, a lieutenant colonel in the army and
spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry, acted as a go-between in
clandestine contacts.
   Many women, especially in the capital, wear olive green uniforms
for their administrative jobs with the army and Interior Ministry.
The government even provides maternity uniforms.
   Thousands of civilian women underwent arms training for militia
work, some in the use of Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns. They are
barred from combat but serve behind the lines as cooks and in
administrative jobs.
   ``Women here traditionally were not just housewives. They always
worked,'' Ms. Guido said. ``But they used to be exploited by the men
and not paid fairly.''
   Most women work to add to the family income, and just finding
scarce goods and budgeting with 20,000 percent inflation can be a
full-time job.
   The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada says 70 percent of
the pickers for coffee, the nation's main export crop, are women.
Almost 49 percent of the state's administrative positions are held
by women, but none is among the nine-member directorate that runs
the Sandinista Front.
   ``We're working on it,'' Ms. Guido said. ``In a country so poor,
so backward, it's not easy, but there's a political will.''
   The Sandinista party has vowed to ``abolish the discrimination
that women have suffered with respect to men; it will establish
economic, political and cultural equality between women and men.''
   But old ideas are hard to change.
   ``A woman's job is to take care of the family. What is this about
rights? They have rights,'' said a man at a vegetable market.
Several other men agreed.
   ``Having women in battle creates problems, jealousy, you know
what I mean,'' a young male army lieutenant said.
   Ms. Guido's organization opened a legal affairs office in 1983 to
deal with abuses, separations, and much-needed sex education.
   ``The legal office has had to overcome women's traditional
timidness and fear in publicly discussing problems that have long
been considered exclusively private and better left unexamined,''
said Envio, a magazine published by the Central American Institute,
a Sandinista think tank.
   Ms. Guido points out that education is an important part of the
movement.
   ``Many women in the rural regions are not married. They have too
many children, it's part of the machismo,'' she said.
   ``Before the triumph, we didn't even have day care,'' Guido said.
``It's still insufficient, but it's enormous in comparison.''

<HEAD>Moving Snow: Take it Easy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowy winter scenes may evoke nostalgia for
some folks, but to those in charge of clearing the driveway and
sidewalks snow can loom as a back-wrenching menace.
   Health officials report hundreds of heart attacks every year as
Americans begin wielding shovels in the cold. And strained muscles
and wrenched backs sometimes can reach epidemic proportions.
   For many people, buying a snow-throwing machine is the answer.
These machines can be a big help for people who can afford them and
who are cautious about keeping fingers and feet away from the moving
parts.
   But for most, the traditional snow shovel remains the tool of
choice, or at least of necessity.
   The International Chiropractors Association, whose members treat
many of those strains and sprains that occur in snow shoveling, have
compiled some suggestions to help lessen the potential for injury.
   Lifting a heaping shovel of snow without bending the knees can
subject the spine to severe stress, the chiropractors warn. The snow
may weigh only 10 or 15 pounds, but holding it out from the body
increases the pressure on the back by up to 15 times that amount.
The answer, of course, is to bend from the knees, not the waist,
when lifting.
   That's a lesson learned quickly by people who must lift and carry
loads constantly _ such as warehousemen and mothers _ but people who
only do so in winter need a reminder.
   In addition, other causes of shoveling-related pain and injury
include simply trying to lift and throw too much snow at one time,
twisting at the waist and overexertion.
   This extra work causes severe stress on the heart and lungs, a
burden made worse by working in frigid air.
   People who have serious spinal, lung or heart conditions or who
are out of shape should simply not shovel snow, the chiropractors
stress. Hire a neighborhood youngster to do the work, call a plowing
service or ask friends or relatives for help.
   Folks who do plan to shovel need to begin with some gentle warm
up exercises, rather that just jumping into the effort.
   And dress warmly, wearing long underwear to protect and warm the
back and other muscles.
   Where possible, the chiropractors suggest pushing, rather than
lifting, the snow. And deposit it nearby rather than straining
muscles by trying to throw it over a large area.
   Try to use the arms, legs, feet and thighs in a coordinated
movement in moving snow, and change sides from time to time to avoid
straining the muscles on one side of the body. Rest frequently and
don't shovel in extremely cold weather.
   Snow-throwing machines are becoming a more and more popular
alternative for removal of the white stuff.
   They can save the back, but they chew up a remarkable number of
fingers of careless users, according to the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission. Here are that agency's suggestions for safer
snow-thrower use:
   _Keep hands and feet away from all moving parts.
   _Stop the engine by removing the key, spark plug or power cord
whenever leaving the operator position to make adjustments, remove
debris of whatever.
   _Never put a hand in the discharge chute or near the auger or
collector to remove sticks or other materials _ stop the machine and
use a trowel, long stick or other object to clear blockages.
   _Never leave a running snow thrower unattended.
   _Never fill the fuel tank of gasoline engines indoors or while
the machine is hot or running.
   _Always be aware of the position of the power cord of electric
machines.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's an emotional movement that is picking up
momentum and sometimes turning violent. Animal rights groups are
becoming more militant and scoring some successes. Even the
respected Humane Society of the United States has taken on the very
symbol of consumerism, American Express.

   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ The Humane Society of the United States is
urging people to cut up their American Express cards because the
credit institution mailed a fur coat catalog announcing: ``Fur _
Because winter is long and life is short.''
   ``Follow your heart. Drop your American Express,'' the
Washington-based Humane Society told its 830,000 members.
   That is but one more confrontation in a burgeoning animal rights,
animal welfare and animal liberation movement that has been
gathering strength across the nation.
   It is by no means monolithic or even united: The majority would
not agree with some of the direct action resulting in burned
buildings, theft of records and research animals, and death threats.
   There are large differences about philosophy and tactics. Many,
for example, are unprepared to espouse vegetarianism, while others
go so far as to feed a meatless diet to their dogs and cats to spare
the suffering of a farm animal. It also has closed down some
research projects, caused one company to drop its cosmetics line,
and improved conditions for some research animals.
   Consider the following:
   _More than 2,000 protesters, led by Bob Barker, walked up
Manhattan's Fifth Avenue the day after Thanksgiving _ ``Fur Free
Friday.'' There were smaller demonstrations in 66 other American
cities.
   _A research scientist at New York University's prestigious
Cornell Medical College made research history when she or the
university, or both, yielded to demonstrations and a letter-writing
campaign and returned a $530,000 grant to the National Institute of
Drug Abuse for a study of barbituate withdrawal in cats.
   _In England, a few days before Christmas, the Animal Liberation
Front claimed responsibility for firebomb attacks on five of
Britain's leading department stores, causing millions of dollars of
damage in retaliation for selling fur. Dingles, the largest store in
Plymouth, was gutted.
   _President-elect George Bush drew flack for hunting quail on a
vacation in Texas.
   _Police in Norwalk, Conn., are holding animal rights activist
Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of Queens, N.Y., on $500,000 bail as she
awaits trial on charges of attempted murder and possession of pipe
bombs. Trutt was arrested on Nov. 11 outside the United States
Surgical Corp., a firm that experiments with dogs and has been a
frequent target of demonstrators.
   _In December, ``Bloom County,'' a political comic strip, ran a
week of satire on testing rabbits for cosmetics.
   _And in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island, a tray of vegetarian
dog and cat biscuits, Wow-Bow and Wow-Meow, are baked by an
entrepreneurial activist.
   The radical side of the movement dates back to the
anti-vivisectionism of Victorian England, but interest was rekindled
by a 1978 book, ``Animal Liberation,'' by Australian philosopher
Peter Singer.
   ``At last we're starting to look like a movement, but I think
animal rights is in its early stages,'' says Ingrid Newkirk, chief
strategist and director of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA), the most radical of an estimated 3,000 to 7,000
groups involved in animal welfare.
   A PETA spokeswoman estimates that 10 million Americans are
involved and guesses that the operating budgets of the myriad groups
come to about $50 million. That's not counting the money held in
endowments by the established giants, who tend to be less militant.
   While businessmen and scientists say they are worried, activists
claim they have never hurt a human nor an animal. Alex Pacheco, a
co-founder of PETA, says arson, property destruction, burglary or
theft are ``acceptable crimes when they directly alleviate the pain
and suffering of an animal.'' The same goes for sit-ins, disruptions
at stockholder meetings in attempts to pass resolutions to ban
product testing on animals.
   Animal rights people say the experiments are the real crime and
that 40 percent of all research animals are used for cosmetic and
product testing, often as insurance against a theoretical lawsuit,
not as safety measures.
   ``Do we really need the 48th brand of oven cleaner?'' Newkirk
asks.
   The blitz against wearing fur is the most visible campaign. There
are ads atop taxis, on billboards, in subways and buses. Celebrities
such as Rue McClanahan and Loretta Swit have participated. Even
Princess Di was commended for her refusal to wear fur.
   The fur industry tries to keep the activists off the air.
   Richard Parsons, executive director of the Fur Retailers
Information Council, says furriers have been asked not to give
interviews because they tend to ``shoot themselves in the foot.''
Like the time one told a reporter that all American furs are
farm-raised. Not true.
   ``We can't threaten to pull our ads, because that's how we sell
our furs,'' Parsons says. ``But we're big advertisers and sometimes
we get a pretty good response. Sometimes we can keep them off the
air. We try.
   ``We don't debate them. We don't dignify them. We don't need to
defend the use of fur. It's a matter of personal freedom. This is
still a capitalistic society, and it is supposed to be a tolerant
one.''
   Sales have not been affected, Parsons says, although the industry
is looking to increase the international levy at auction houses to
increase its war chest to combat the anti-fur forces.
   ``The American fur industry has had locks jammed, arson, bomb
threats and windows smashed,'' Parsons says. ``Giving this movement
credibility gives in to more violence.''
   Dan Mathews, a 24-year-old PETA member in charge of the anti-fur
campaign, says, ``The fur industry will be the first domino to fall.
We are not asking you to change your life, just give up cruelty.''
   Besides the furriers, the cosmetic industry, research scientists,
and producers of livestock, eggs, chickens, and milk _ ``factory
farmers'' as the activists call them _ are under attack.
   ``So what if we put a few businesses under,'' Mathews says. ``The
slave traders lost an industry, too.''
   The anti-vivisectionist faction believes that man has evolved to
a point where he can live without any animal products _ meat, milk,
leather, fur, wool, etc. They feel that neither the cosmetic
industry nor medical researchers have the right to experiment on
animals; that zoos, rodeos, race tracks, even the household pet is
an exploitation of the animal kingdom.
   ``We are not saying animals have the same rights as man,'' says
George Cave of Trans-Species Unlimited. ``Sometimes, we have to make
choices.''

   Cave, a former professor of philosophy, exempts American Indians
and Eskimos, whose survival is dependent on the hunting of game.
   The movement is marked by a hyperbolic rhetoric reminiscent of
the '60s. Some activists call themselves freedom fighters for
animals. Newkirk is happy to reiterate a statement some others wish
she had never said in the first place.
   ``I can't even remember it exactly,'' says British-born Newkirk,
``but I stand by it l00 percent. What I said was a pig is a boy is a
dog is a rat in that they are all sentient beings, they are all
capable of suffering. That is indisputable.''
   The various groups are not above squabbling, especially over
funding.
   Cave says the Humane Society of the United States, which has an
annual budget of $9 million, ``has a stranglehold on the funds that
is totally unethical. Its president, John Hoyt, is paid $139,000 a
year. The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has a fortune sitting idle in investments. They could wipe
out the pet overpopulation in one year if they would use some of
that money.''
   The MSPCA, founded in 1839, has an endowment of $42 million and
spent $15 million last year supporting three veterinarian hospitals,
nine shelters and various educational projects.
   The Humane Society doesn't support some of the statements of the
radicals, and deplores the violence.
   ``We like to be taken seriously when we go to the Hill,'' says a
Humane Society spokeswoman. ``We don't like to be seen as frothing
at the mouth.''
   Cave, who lives on a $10,000 salary, part of his group's total
budget of $350,000, led the Cornell campaign. He calls it a landmark
in that the challenge was not about sloppy laboratory conditions,
but the very nature of the research.
   He maintained that barbituate addiction is a complex human
problem and that it was inappropriate to expose cats _ or any animal
_ to the horrors of withdrawal, a self-inflicted condition in humans.
   Cave is now attacking a glue-sniffing experiment using monkeys at
New York University Hospital. In nice weather, Trans-Species has 14
tables out every weekend on New York City streets explaining its
philosophy.
   The biomedical research community has reacted by forming a
Washington-based educational and lobbying group.
   ``We're not talking here about little old ladies in blue hair,''
says Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for Biomedical
Research. ``We have heard of over 50 death threats. The research
community is so unprepared for the animal rights movement. First of
all, they have jobs and they don't have time to hang out at shopping
centers with signs.
   ``It is costing millions in increased security, replacing animals
that were stolen and buildings that were torched. It is no laughing
matter.''
   The research scientist at Cornell, Dr. Michiko Okamoto, refuses
to talk to reporters. Her colleagues say she was shocked by the
developments.
   Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, a cardiovascular surgeon who became a
household name, has emerged as one spokesman for the researchers.
Now 80, but working daily from 4 a.m. till midnight, DeBakey says he
occasionally gets death threats. He sees the animal rights movement
as one with great emotional appeal, but one that is not telling the
whole story.
   ``These people are intimidating a lot of people,'' DeBakey says.
``If you want to become a Jehovah's Witness and refuse blood from
another person, I have no argument. I don't agree with it, but I
respect your right to do it. What I object to here is the attempt to
enforce this view on others.
   ``I have yet to see a patient who refused treatment from research
gained from animals. Do these people plan on turning down such
treatment if they need it?''
   DeBakey says his surgical breakthroughs, which saved thousands of
lives, resulted from experimentation on dogs.
   ``Almost everything in the cardiovascular field was developed
through animal research. You can't use cells or cell cultures or
computers.''
   The surgeon says animal activists ``are not improving the
conditions of animals used in research, They are pricing it out of
the market. Twelve states have now passed laws prohibiting the use
of pound animals. Yet the taxpayer spends $600 million a year caring
for pound animals and putting them to sleep.
   ``The activists have great political strength and slick
organizations. They say alternative methods can be used. They are
wrong.''
   DeBakey worries about the Cornell decision.
   ``It is disturbing to see an institution of higher learning cave
in,'' DeBakey says. ``The integrity of that academic institution is
eroded.''
   Medical scientists point to the great strides made using animal
models. Everything from polio vaccine to treatments for such
diseases as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have benefited from
research on animals.
   The activists insist the same advances could have been made using
different kinds of research.
   Dr. Frederick King, director of the Yerkes Primate Center at
Emory University in Atlanta, also a target of death threats, is
eager to speak out. Researchers at his institution are injecting
chimpanzees with the deadly AIDS virus (So far it has not jumped
their immune barrier, but King says that does not mean it will not
with a longer incubation).
   The animals rights militants say that is not necessary since
there are thousands of dying human victims who would gladly allow
themselves to be experimented upon.
   ``Forget the ethical questions,'' Newkirk says. ``It's bad
science. They are retarding the AIDS research by using animals.''
   King dismisses that argument. He says it's yet another case of
non-scientists throwing in their non-scientific opinion.
   ``My question is where have all the moderates gone?'' King says.
``Even Jane Goodall, who came here about a year ago, has turned to
their side. She's a one-agenda person, fanatically attached to
chimps.
   ``The moderates all seem to have gone into the woodwork.''

   A vegetarian lunch is served every day by
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   PETA, as it is called, likes to describe itself as a grass-roots
organization. It does have access to a large network of people it
can mobilize for a specific cause.
   However, it is also a centralized operation with computers,
direct mail solicitation, an aerobics class at 6 p.m. and a parking
lot filled with ``Meat is Dead'' and ``Liberate Lab Animals'' bumper
stickers.
   It says its average contribution from its 300,000 members is $20
and there are no big angels. It is armed with a 10,000 square-foot
warehouse, bright leadership, 65 employees and a $5 million budget.
   PETA is often the clearinghouse when crimes such as arson or
property theft occur in the battle against abuse of animals. They
get the word from the underground groups _ Animal Liberation Front,
True Friends, Human Bondage, and others.
   ``We know our phones are tapped and we entertain the FBI
frequently,'' says Carol Burnett, 36, the public relations director.
   Is PETA, in fact, the Animal Liberation Front, or does it know
who the ALF members might be?
   ``We would never consider discussing the identity of anyone who
is talking too much,'' says executive director Ingrid Newkirk, who
has been arrested perhaps a dozen times but has yet to spend a night
in jail.
   ``We have one page of company rules, but it's not like you're
joining the army or entering a religious cult. We have a voluntary
ban on smoking and ask employees not to bring in McDonald's burgers.
   ``We ask people not to wear animal products to work, but we don't
run around and inspect people's apparel like the Marines. We hope
eventually people will get rid of it, but a lot of people just
coming to work here still own something made from an animal.''
   There are warnings not to leave anything exposed on your desk
that is not ready for public consumption.
   PETA is compartmentalized into research and investigations,
education, cosmetics, a ``Whistleblower Hotline,'' and under the
Freedom of Information Act, it constantly writes in for reports on
publicly funded projects.
   An educational team of three _ ``Animal Rights 101'' _ flies out
just about every weekend to train local groups in how to picket and
become effective in their community.
   A dozen ``companion animals'' accompany employees to work each
day and all of the dogs are vegetarians. Some wander through the
halls, others are in offices. One is behind a closed door with his
picture and a caption that says ``Make My Day.'' But that's a joke.
It's a friendly dog.
   Posters are everywhere. One shows rabbits being blinded ``not in
the name of science but in the name of a new shampoo.'' There are
pictures of cats with electrodes in their heads, cute young white
foxes in cages waiting to become fur coats. ``If you liked pulling
the wings off flies as a kid,'' one sign says, ``you may be cut out
for a career in animal experimentation.''
   The Foundation for Biomedical Research has recently entered the
poster war. One shows a little girl in a hospital bed surrounded by
stuffed animals. The caption says it's the animals you don't see
that saved her life.
   PETA says it doesn't advocate violence but wouldn't be surprised
if more incidents occur.
   ``If anyone brings on this violence, it's those who commit the
obscenities inside the labs,'' says Alex Pacheco, its founder. ``If
anyone is responsible for bombs going off, it's the National
Institutes of Health. I'm surprised there is not more violence.
   `Activists are trying to get laws enforced. I work mostly with
congressmen and I find it just outrageously frustrating. Here we
have government agencies lying to the U.S. Congress, lying to the
public and the courts are not enforcing the existing laws against
cruelty and nothing substantive has been passed in a decade.''
   PETA publishes lists of companies that use animals in their
research and those that do not.
   ``What we must make people realize is that they, as a consumer,
run the world,'' Newkirk says. ``Good intentions don't mean a thing
if you continue to use the product.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was a sure sign that Cajun culture has gone
global when crawfish etouffee and file gumbo showed up on the menu
at last summer's Moscow summit. Now busloads of foreign tourists,

big, yeah, in London, Holland and Russia,'' he says. ``The rest of
the world just been a 'ti slow in catching up with the good things
in life.''
   Lennis and his brother, Ophe, a virtuoso on the 'ti fer, or
triangle, had just stomped out ``Jambalaya'' for some ``foreign
French'' tourists who arrived on the banks of Bayou Teche in a bus
marked ``un voyage au vrai pays des Acadiens,'' a trip to the real
Cajun country.
   Me oh, my oh, Cajun culture has busted out of the bayou and gone
global. Suddenly last summer, crawfish etouffee and file gumbo were
on the menu at the summit in Moscow. Amsterdam's hottest new
restaurant is Riekje Sluizer's Cajun Louisiana Kitchen, ``geopend
voor lunch.'' London has two Cajun-style restaurants and liberal
doses of sauce piquant are spicing up traditionally bland British
cuisine at such posh nosheries as Wilton's and the Savoy Grill.
   Now busloads of European tourists, led by the French, are
venturing deep into the bayous where before World War II paved roads
seldom penetrated.
   As Ophe conceded, there was a 'ti language problem at first. The
Romero brothers speak quaint French that like the meandering bayou
has been bent out of shape in the last two centuries. But once the
visitors from Paris and Lyons figured out that 'ti was Cajun for
petit and that an alligator was neither un caiman nor un crocodile,
they were able to communicate their desire to sample ``soupe de
cocodrie.''
   In St. Martinville, the spiritual capital of Cajun-land, the tour
group posed for photos around the statue of ``Evangeline,'' the
heroine of Longfellow's epic about the British expulsion of French
settlers from Acadia, or Nova Scotia, in 1755. Then in the old
Indian cemetery, they saw the grave of Emmeline Labiche, whose
real-life separation from her lover inspired the poem.
   Like Americans cramming into the Crazy Horse Saloon in Paris, the
French contingent braved the overflow crowd at Mulate's, the Cajun
nightclub in Breaux Bridge, for a fais do-do, literally ``make go to
sleep,'' the Saturday night dance named for the tiny room where
small children dozed while their parents two-stepped until dawn.
   Cajun music, like Cajun cooking, is echoing around the world.
Bayou artists such as fiddler Michael Doucet and pianist Zachary
Richard have rabid fans in Paris, Montreal, Quebec, Martinique, San
Francisco and New York's Greenwich Village. Don Montoucet's Cajun
combo had the comrades jumping when Chef John Folse from Lafitte's
Landing in Donaldsonville set up a Cajun restaurant at the Moscow
World Trade Center at the summit in June.
   If Paul Prudhomme had shown up that night at Mulate's, he would
have been mobbed like a young Charles Boyer for autographs by both
the locals and the French pilgrims on the trail of what their
culture has brought forth on this continent.
   Prudhomme, the first American chef to be awarded the Merite
Agricole by the French government, is proprietor of K-Paul's
Louisiana Kitchen in New Orleans, a culinary superstar on TV, radio
and videotapes, and the author of cookbooks that have sold more than
600,000 in hardback.
   He is also the author of such insights into Cajun culture as:
   ``An authentic Cajun is one who anticipates the start of the
crawfish season as much as his wedding night.''
   ``Good Cajun cooking doesn't taste country; it tastes grandma.''
   ``If you don't hover between pleasure and pain when you eat it,
chances are you haven't made your sauce piquant hot enough.''
   Prudhomme popularized the ``blackening'' method of sealing in the
flavor of meat and fish with intense heat, as if cooked over an open
fire. Its ubiquitous popularity has produced such menu aberrations
as blackened meatloaf and blackened omeletes and has made the lowly
redfish, once snubbed in haute cuisine, an endangered species in
Texas and Louisiana. Some months ago, undercover agents from the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department mounted a sting operation to
foil a ring of commercial fishermen and food wholesalers dealing in
illegally caught redfish.
   ``Dining out these days you don't know if that blackened menu
special is the chef's favorite or his latest failure,'' laughs Joe
Cahn, who presides over the New Orleans School of Cooking which
daily instructs nearly 100 students and was the finishing school for
Andre Numan, Amsterdam's Cajun chef.
   Cajun cooking has been around since the earliest exiles from Nova
Scotia found love at first bite of alligator tail meat, but its
delights took a while catching on beyond the swamps of the
Atchafalaya.
   When Fannie Merritt Farmer collected America's best recipes for
her Boston Cooking School cookbook in 1896, the word Cajun didn't
make the index.
   Even today, Antoine's in New Orleans, founded in 1840, doesn't
mention the word Cajun in its extensive menu, although ``Creole''
has a half-dozen listings from ``gombo (sic) creole'' to ``poulet a
la creole.'' Bernard Guste, the great-great-grandson of founder
Antoine Alciatore, admits however to being ``a bit more heavy-handed
with the pepper pot to please tourists who expect Louisiana cooking
to be hot, real hot, which was never the creole style.''
   Prudhomme points out that ``as Louisiana food has grown in
popularity throughout the country, the distinction between Cajun and
Creole has almost vanished.''
   In history, the distinction is clearer. Creoles are descended
from aristocratic families who fled the terrors of the French
revolutions, sometimes with their chefs, dressmakers and dancing
masters. They intermarried with Louisiana's Spanish settlers, whose
cooking pots bubbled with spices and condiments from the Aztecs,
Incas and the Caribbean. Black cooks on the plantations added
another dimension, like okra and gumbo, both African words. Creole
culture was cavalier, gallant, refined; its cuisine elegant, subtle,
rich in sauces.
   Cajuns, a corruption of ``archadia,'' the name given to Canada's
maritime provinces by the explorer Verrazano on first sighting their
virgin forests, were victims of one of this continent's worst human
rights atrocities.

<HEAD>ST. MARTINVILLE, La.: rights atrocities.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Originally from Normandy, Brittany and Picardy, they were
deported from Nova Scotia, which France lost to England in the War
of Spanish Succession. The year of Le Grand Derangement was l755,
and D-day was Sept. 5, when entire villages were summoned to their
churches to hear King George II's proclamation confiscating their
land, homes and cattle and exiling them along the Atlantic seaboard.
Soldiers hurried them down to the waiting boats, sometimes
separating husbands from wives, parents from children and parting
lovers as in the tale Hawthorne told to Longfellow.
   Their tragedy fell just short of genocide. The British commander,
Lord Jeffrey Amherst, who got a liberal arts college named for him,
was all for it. In a letter to a Col. Bouquet, he urged: ``You will
do well to try to spread smallpox by means of blankets and by every
other means which might help exterminate that abominable race.''
   Mostly trappers, fishermen and farmers, the exiles settled into
Louisiana's swamplands where their hardy, food-loving descendants
seldom ventured beyond the range of their pirogues and pickup trucks
until 1947 when the first oil rigs loomed over the marshes. Their
cuisine, culled from the woods, bayous, tiny gardens and barnyard
animals too old to produce, called for slow cooking and high octane
sauces to tenderize briskets of squirrel, wild rabbit, alligator and
senile sows.
   Even down to this generation, as both Prudhomme and Cahn recall,
Cajuns seldom went to the store, even more rarely to a restaurant.
   ``We grew virtually everything we ate,'' says Prudhomme, who grew
up the youngest of 13 children on a farm near Opelousas. ``If a
chicken didn't lay or a rooster couldn't fertilize eggs or a mother
pig was too old to have babies, we killed them for food for the
family.''
   Cahn points out that ``sauce piquant was a necessary camouflage
when gourmandizing on 'possum, muskrat and nutria.''
   It is doubtful whether many yuppies hovering over their
Cuisinarts in quest of authentic Cajun fare could bring themselves
to ``trim away any and all hair'' in preparing a 12-pound hog's head
for ``fromage de tete de cochon'' _head cheese _ or remove ``the
glands located on each shoulder and behind the knees'' of squirrel
and game rabbit as prescribed in the Prudhomme Family Cookbook.
   As for real back-bayou cooking, Prudhomme regrets ``there are
almost no sources for purchasing fresh pig's blood'' to make red
boudin, Cajun sausage, and admits he ``couldn't sell food cooked in
pork lard in my restaurant.''
   The five flags fluttering from the columned porch of the
Presbytere, or priests' house, in St. Martinville chronicle the
course of Cajun culture, from the rule of French Bourbon kings in
1756, to the Spanish in 1762, Napoleon's First Republic in 1800,
Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana States in 1803 and a Confederate
government during the Civil War.
   Just down the road a piece bubble the vats of two of the most
prodigious purveyors of the Cajun napalm known as hot pepper sauce.
   The peppers called tabasco _ from the Spanish word for damp earth
_ have been grown in Louisiana since an unknown soldier back from
the Mexican War gave some dried peppers to Edmund McIlhenny, who
planted the seeds in his wife's garden on Avery Island. One war
later, trying to salvage his plantation ravished by Union troops, he
bottled and brought to market a batch of hot sauce.
   Now the family owned McIlhenny Company, with annual sales of
nearly $12 million, exports the incendiary elements of the Bloody
Mary to 100 countries and goes beyond Avery Island's still thriving
tabasco patch to pick peppers from Mexico, Honduras, Venezuela,
Colombia and the Dominican Republic.
   In nearby New Iberia, B.F. Trappey's Sons have been marketing a
variety of hot sauces, pickled okra, candied yams, redbeans and
other Cajun staples for 90 years.
   ``The Arab countries are our best overseas market for pepper
sauce,'' says Jack Blenderman from behind the president's desk at
the Trappey plant. ``At lunch, they'll empty a three-ounce bottle on
a bit of bread and cheese. The Japanese are also big importers of
our 55-gallon drums.''
   Like bringing red hot coals to Newcastle, Trappey's now ships its
smoldering sauces to Nova Scotia, where natives deprived of the
Louisiana experience have perpetrated a bland diet.
   In the pepper sauce business, hotness is measured by the Scoville
Heat Index, a sort of intestinal Btu scale that ranks the relatively
hot tabasco, jalapeno and cayenne peppers in the 30,000 range, far
behind the tiny Chinese pepper, which festers above the 100,000
mark. To handle the heat on Trappey's pepper picking assembly line,
workers wear special gloves and are warned not to rub their eyes.
   The craze for Cajun culture has seemingly endless manifestations.
Cajun humorist Justin Wilson's cooking show is now aired in bizarre
bayou-busted English on 284 public TV stations. ``Belizaire the
Cajun'' is emblazoned on movie marquees, and for mystery fans author
Daniel Woodrell chronicles the cases of Cajun cop Rene Slade.
   Cajun gumbo mixes, crab boils and other delicacies are available
by mail order from Boudin King, Chef Chauvin, Frey of Louisiana,
Tony Chachere, Cajun Magic, which is a Paul Prudhomme enterprise,
and an ever-growing list of dealers.
   Now there is a Cajun beer, Cajun cola, Cajun potato chips, Cajun
popcorn, ``Cajun Mary'' cocktail mix, Cajun pickles (with the label
upside down in keeping with Justin Wilson's self-deprecating brand
of Cajun humor), ``Cajun Sweet Smoke Pecan Shells,'' even a Cajun
Kosher Cookbook. Aggressive marketing has brought the ``Four Foot
Shelf'' of Cajun spices to many supermarkets across the country.
   To preserve the language, Msgr. Jules Daigle, an 88-year-old
retired priest in Welsh, La. compiled a 600-page Cajun Dictionary
that was accepted by the French Academy as a scholarly work. It was
the monsignor's thesis that, although deeply rooted in French, Cajun
evolved into a separate language over the span of two centuries. At
the time of his dictionary's publication, he cited the example of
``a French priest who came to St. Martinville some years ago and
announced from the pulpit that a `foire,' the French word for
bazaar, would be held in the parish next week. The congregation fell
apart laughing. In Cajun, `foire' had come to mean diarrhea.''
   Chef Cahn credits food writers and restaurant critics with
helping heat up the Cajun craze. ``They're like fashion writers in
setting new trends. When I was working in Los Angeles, one
restaurant went from nouvelle cuisine to Mexican to sushi to Cajun
in a four-year period. Same chef. Same owner. Same location. When
you're hot, you're hot, and right now Cajun is hot every which way.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ What do the people in southern Louisiana have in
common with the people in northern Louisiana? Very little, beyond
the same color license plates. But two women from opposite ends of
the state recently set out to try to bridge a cultural gap between
the heavily protestant North and the Cajun Catholic South through a
youth exchange program.

   Rachel Thompson had never tasted shrimp in
her native Louisiana, which is famous for its seafood, and Ronnie
Emonet had never heard the wind moan through the piney hills of his
own state.
   Both are 16 and represent the best hope for dismantling a wall of
mistrust built generations ago by two clashing cultures, says Carole
Andrepont of Opelousas, who turned a joke into a serious experiment
that worked.
   Andrepont, a member of the Louisiana Tourism Board who has been
active in international youth exchange programs for years, jokingly
told a friend one day, ``If you want to have a real cultural
exchange, have folks from north Louisiana come to south Louisiana.
It's like two different countries.''
   An almost visible line across the center of Louisiana separates
the staid upstate Protestants from the Catholic Cajuns, who make
time for work around a busy schedule of consuming the full cup of
life.
   The descendants of the exiles from Nova Scotia make up a third of
the state's population and those of different ancestry living in
south Louisiana have absorbed the laid-back lifestyle of the Cajuns.
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, the first French-speaking Catholic
elected to the state's highest office this century, says the
division is more a perception than anything else, but ``a perception
can be real.''
   ``The barrier exists in the minds of those who have not had the
opportunity to visit one end of the state or the other,'' he says.
``But, invariably when they do, they come away with an amazement of
how much in common they have.''
   ``The barrier is exaggerated but it's there,'' adds Gov. Buddy
Roemer, whose family plantation is not far from the Arkansas border
in north Louisiana.
   ``A real factor has been a lack of quality transportation. It's
hard to get from upstate Shreveport to New Orleans. In fact, it's
easier to get from Shreveport to Dallas.''
   Edwards and Roemer agree that an exchange program aimed at youths
can eventually erase the perception.
   The idea for the exchange program gnawed at Andrepont and finally
she talked with Linda Graham, her Ruston counterpart at a tourism
meeting in Baton Rouge.
   ``I told her I had an idea about two cities having an exchange
program and the more we looked at it, the more we liked it,'' she
says. ``We talked to our mayors, school officials and civic leaders.
Now, we've done it.''
   In a recently ended two-week program, about 20 Ruston high school
students spent a week in Opelousas and an equal number of the south
Louisiana students stayed in Ruston.
   Host families provided homes and meals, treating their guests
like their own kids, Andrepont says.
   The mayors and civic leaders visited each other's municipalities
and, like the kids, discovered that even with the cultural
differences, people are just folks and get different views of what
they see, depending on personalities.
   ``The people are more free, more open down here,'' says Rachel,
who attends Ruston High School. ``Up north, we're very polite, but
down here...
   ``I called my mom and said I was staying here another two weeks.
She just laughed.''
   ``I like Ruston better than here,'' says Telameckus Anderson, a
16-year-old junior at Opelousas High School. ``They're so nice. The
hills are beautiful.''
   ``The family I stayed with made me feel like we were related,''
says Emonet, a junior at Opelousas Catholic.
   Asked if they laughed at his Cajun accent, Emonet said, ``The
girls thought it was cute. I laughed at their drawls. We laughed
with each other.''
   Graham says she learned something important from her visit to
south Louisiana:
   ``I need to go home and loosen up a bit. We're more conservative
in Ruston and we are organized. I find myself regimented to the
point where I get a little bit irritated when everything doesn't go
just like clockwork.
   ``I learned to relax. I need to come down here about once a
month.''
   Andrepont, meanwhile, says Cajuns can learn from the other
lifestyles, maybe find a middle ground.
   ``Everything we do is almost overdone,'' she says. ``When we eat,
it's a lot and the best. If it's seasoned, it's highly seasoned.
People who drink, they drink.''
   Graham and Andrepont say the two cities are going to conduct such
programs each year and encourage other communities to do the same
thing.
   ``I think this is going to be a state program,'' Andrepont says.
``We've got Church Point interested in finding a north Louisiana
city for an exchange program. The governor is interested. We need to
end the division in this state. The 40 youngsters in this program
don't have the old attitude anymore. It works.''
   Roemer, the governor, says, ``This is the first of several such
programs that will happen over the next year. One of the issues in
my campaign was the need for all of the state to pull together.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Whether the Khmer Rouge communist guerrillas have
changed their murderous ways has become a critical issue with the
emerging possibility of a negotiated settlement of the decade-old
Cambodian war. Here's a report from an AP reporter who traveled the
Thai-Cambodian border, interviewing government officials and
fugitives from refugee camps run by the Khmer Rouge.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
  Khmer Rouge communist guerrillas are
holding tens of thousands of Cambodian refugees virtual prisoners in
camps in Thailand to serve a war machine bent on reseizing Cambodia,
international aid officials say.
   Some refugees have escaped to tell the story, people like Mom
Sokhon, a teen-age girl.
   Mom Sokhon survived four years under a Khmer Rouge regime that
slaughtered six of her relatives and hundreds of thousands of other
people in Cambodia. After invading Vietnamese forces ousted the
regime, she headed to refugee camps in Thailand seeking haven from
the war.
   But Mom Sokhon wound up in the Khmer Rouge-controlled camp of
Huay Chan, and there, she said, the horror began again.
   The guerrillas forced the 15-year-old girl to toil all day making
punji, bamboo spears for impaling enemy soldiers. Hauling punishing
loads of punji, rice and B-67 anti-tank rounds, she had to make
regular treks through heavily mined mountain passes from the camp to
guerrilla bases inside Cambodia.
   Often on the journey, at times a month long, two or three women
had their legs blown off by mines or were shot dead in firefights
with the Vietnamese, she says.
   ``If anyone refused to join the transport team, she would be
punished with no food and sent to an underground prison,'' she says.
   After five years at Huay Chan, Mom Sokhon fled in November to
this refugee camp in eastern Surin province controlled by the
non-communist guerrillas of Prince Nodorom Sihanouk. She fears the
Khmer Rouge will hunt her down.
   Other Cambodian guerrilla groups and Thai security personnel also
have frequently abused refugees in the camps along the Cambodian
frontier, but the Khmer Rouge is different.
   A senior official experienced with rebel movements in Africa and
the Middle East says that even in the ruthless world of guerrilla
warfare ``it's an unusual feature'' to use children as military
porters.
   ``The disregard for the sick and the disabled is extreme,'' he
says. ``There's a kind of totalitarianism I don't see elsewhere.''
   Aid officials say hundreds, perhaps thousands, of refugees have
died of malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases because the Khmer
Rouge refused to treat them properly or would not allow them to see
foreign doctors because they would be ``polluted'' by them.
   Another official, also speaking anonymously, said the people
being held in the Khmer Rouge camps ``hardly smile at you, never
greet you. They are afraid. In the other camps, the children run up
and talk to you. This never happens in a Khmer Rouge camp. I think
they are systematically educating the parents to tell the children
not to talk to foreigners.''
   Concern over Khmer Rouge abuses has sharpened with the
guerrillas' recent relocation of thousands of refugees out of two
United Nations-assisted camps.
   Some 7,000 refugees were moved from Ta Luan camp to a border area
where they came under heavy shelling in November. Many refugees were
believed hurt but the guerrillas have refused to allow aid officials
access to them.
   The Khmer Rouge has denied all charges of abuse. Or Hy, an
administrator at its showcase camp of Site B, said the people were
moving and portering voluntarily and added that ``all Khmer
(Cambodians) should fight back the Vietnamese.''
   When the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in 1975-78, they attempted to
create a new agrarian society with purges, torture, and mass
relocations of people from the cities to rural slave labor camps. It
destroyed religion, culture and history to bring Cambodia back to
``year zero'' and held the people under the fearful grip of
``angka'' _ the organization.
   Vietnam's invasion in late 1978 drove the Chinese-armed Khmer
Rouge to the Thai-Cambodian border, where it set up base camps. Tens
of thousands of civilians under Khmer Rouge control were driven into
Thailand by the devastating Vietnamese offensive of 1985.
   In the few camps where aid workers have access, the Khmer Rouge
seems to have abandoned the mass killings. But it maintains its
militaristic and xenphobic control over virtually every aspect of
people's lives. Marriage must be approved by camp authorities.
Religious practice is banned. Most men wear Chinese military
uniforms. In some camps, people cannot walk outside their own
section.

   Western officials say the same brutal, shadowy leaders of 1975-78
now run the refugee camps _ Pol Pot, Ta Mok, Son Sen, Ieng Sary and
others.
   Refugees who escape rarely report having seen killings in the
camps. Officials say little physical force is needed because the
guerrillas control through their fearsome reputation and by denying
the refugees all contact with the outside world.
   But one official cautioned that unknown atrocities may be
committed in the military-run camps where foreigners are barred.
These camps, including satellite villages around the United
Nations-aided camps, hold thousands of civilians and are supplied by
China and overseen by Task Force 838, the Thai military secret
service aiding the Khmer Rouge.
   One official who has interviewed dozens of escapees said,
``People disappear in the middle of the night, sometimes with their
families, and that's all. Some come back; some don't.''
   The Khmer Rouge last year boldly executed two soldiers inside
Site B, where it has allowed a Buddhist temple, free markets and
elections to show the world it has embraced capitalism and
democracy. It is the only Khmer Rouge camp news reporters can visit.
   One victim, Moeun Noeun, 30, left his unit without permission and
went to Site B in April to celebrate the Cambodian New Year with his
family.
   His widow, Rom Yon, said they were sleeping in their bamboo hut
when the guerrillas shouted in the darkness.
   ``They asked if my husband was inside or not, and they came in
and shot him,'' she said. ``They shot him here, took him outside and
shot him again.''
   The Khmer Rouge has allowed the U.N. Border Relief Operation to
provide food and other assistance to 60,000 refugees at four camps
that are supposed to house only civilians: Site B, Borai, Ta Luan,
and O'Trao.
   In May, the U.N. agency ended aid to Huay Chan because
authorities there defied all attempts to monitor its use. There and
elsewhere, some of the food appears to have been siphoned off for
the guerrillas' use.
   One official heard lots of shooting when he visited O'Trao, in
Sisaket province, a few months ago. He saw a huge Chinese military
truck loaded with anti-tank mines, topped with U.N.-donated canned
fish. Fifteen heavily armed men and four women with backpacks jogged
past, saying they were ``going to fight the Vietnamese.''
   Even in the U.N.-aided camps, few refugees have been allowed
outside the camps for emergency medical treatment and many of those
have been children already too sick to be saved. Wounded soldiers
are never evacuated for fear they will defect, aid officials say.
   Refugees must get permission from camp authorities even to go to
foreign-run clinics inside the U.N.-aided camps. Only a limited
number are granted permission and many of them have no apparent
illnesses, said one doctor who called the camps ``Potemkin villages:
You never see the people whom you should see. You see an outer
village and you think you are there but you are not really there.''
   Near O'Trao, aid officials in June stumbled upon a village of
several hundred handicapped people who were believed to have been
separated from the others because they were no longer of any use to
the Khmer Rouge.
   Refugees say the camps are governed by a strict vertical
hierarchy with many amenities of life depending on one's personal
relationship with the privileged top cadres. The cadres hold regular
indoctrination sessions and send errant refugees to the military
camps for re-education or punishment.
   Chea Cha, 52, says he and his family spent their time at a camp
near Ta Luan portering or attending day-long classes on ``how to
fight the Vietnamese or carry weapons, nothing else.'' Those who
refused were jailed with their ankles chained together, he says, and
many came out emaciated or injured.
   Chea Cha recently fled to the Sok Sann camp run by the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   Officials say most refugees would leave the Khmer Rouge camps if
they could. In the first 10 months of 1988, 415 people fled to Site
B and Sok Sann.
   Niem Chouleng, the Sok Sann administrator, said a Khmer Rouge
official in a military uniform has twice visited him and asked that
the refugees be returned.
   ``It seemed to be a kind of warning,'' Chouleng said, adding that
he has not complied.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a small coastal town in rural southeast
Georgia, you used to get the impression that anything destined to
happen there happened long ago. That was before the Navy started
building a $1.7 billion base for 10 Trident submarines, which begin
arriving this month with their nuclear arsenals. St. Marys is
unlikely ever to be the same again.

   Just across the tracks from the antebellum
charm of historic St. Marys, where old oaks drip Spanish moss, a new
nuclear submarine base is changing the face of the countryside with
shopping malls and low-cost housing.
   The Kings Bay Submarine Base, to be home to the Trident subs,
means stability, money and lots of jobs in this area on the
southeastern tip of Georgia, just north of Jacksonville, Fla. But
the boom also is bringing urban-style headaches to rural Camden
County.
   The base, under construction for a decade, will add more than
22,000 people to the population of Camden County, which had only
about 13,000 in 1980.
   Planners are worried about schools, crime, water and sewer
systems, libraries, fire protection and recreational facilities.
   The county had no movie theater until recently. Now a six-theater
cinema complex has opened in a shopping center and another is
probable for a center being built down the road.
   The county's landfill, projected to last up to 40 years, was used
up in 10 because of the base-related boom.
   From 1980 to 1988, school enrollment in the area increased 54
percent. Projections show that in 1995, enrollment will be 173
percent above the 1980 level.
   Backers of the base say the Navy is trying hard to be a good
neighbor.
   Even so, says Roger Alderman of the Kings Bay Impact Coordinating
Committee, ``The degree that it affects a small area, especially one
such as Camden County, is unimaginable.''
   The first Trident submarine was to arrive at the $1.7 billion
base on Jan. 14, welcomed in an invitation-only ceremony.
   Eventually the base will house 10 Trident subs, each carrying 24
missiles packing eight nuclear warheads per missile. Each warhead is
35 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1945.
   Each submarine will have more atomic destructive capacity than
most nuclear powers, but if the people of St. Marys are nervous
about that, it is subdued. The few protests held at the base have
not been locally organized.
   Over the centuries _ up to now _ residents of St. Marys have
preserved its charm with a minimum of tackiness.
   The Spanish settled the community in 1566 and stayed 120 years.
Aaron Burr came to town in 1804 after killing Alexander Hamilton in
a duel. In the 1930s, cartoonist Roy Crane visited and was so taken
by the town streetcar that he used it as a model for his
``Toonerville Trolly.''
   Visitors to St. Marys once got the impression that anything
destined to happen here happened long ago. The nearness of the base
is changing that.
   Crime is up, although local officials blame transient
construction workers, not the military, for most of it.
   Low-cost housing developments are popping up everywhere. Only
about 600 Navy personnel, mostly in the lower ranks, will be housed
on the base.
   Fields and pine woods have given way to shopping malls, and the
mushrooming strip of development along Highway 40 is cheek by jowl
with the city limits.
   Tom Sterling, 80, runs the grocery store his father founded more
than 100 years ago in St. Marys.
   ``We used to sell everything here, from horse collars on up, or
maybe I should say on down,'' he says.
   Old friends stop by to pass the time and remember when.
   But the shelves are thinly stocked these days and customers are
few. Malls and shopping centers built for the base trade, Sterling
says, are drawing shoppers from St. Marys' few businesses as well.
   In the basement of Orange Hall, a Greek Revival splendor from the
1820s, Elvira Wildes tends a small information center.
   The Navy, she says, has gone out of its way to put the base in a
positive light, especially to St. Marys' older residents.
   `They come to tell us the facts,'' she says. ``They told us it is
the only Navy base being started from scratch. They give us tours on
the ships, and we eat in the mess hall sometimes.
   ``If there is dirt and trash going on, and if there are people
acting like they shouldn't, well I don't go to those places so I
don't know about those things.''
   There is no entertainment in St. Marys, she observes correctly.
``So why would they bother us?''
   ``It is not an adversarial relationship,'' agrees Kenneth Kent, a
financial analyst with the Coordinating Committee, which is trying
to soften the impact of the base on the area. ``The Navy is trying
to be a good neighbor.''
   Alderman says the federally funded committee, made up of local
government leaders, ``is to lay out the realities of a high-growth
area and foresee problems down the road.''
   The area has received some $37.5 million in federal impact
payments since 1984. Alderman says Washington wanted to make 1989
the last year for impact funding.
   ``We estimate we would need $8.7 million in 1991 and $5.3 million
in 1992,'' he says. ``The Navy isn't even thinking in terms of 1991
or 1992.''
   Kent says a residential tax base generally is not sufficient to
support residential services.
   ``There is virtually no industrial tax base here and only a
nominal commercial base,'' he says.
   Much of the county is in timber, which is taxed at a low rate and
thus provides little county income, he says.
   The county school tax already is 9 percent above that of other
counties in the region, he says, and Camden County cannot absorb
even the matching portions of the increased cost.
   ``The current tax situation allows counties to keep up existing
schools but not to build new ones required by the increase in
population,'' Kent says.
   ``A high percentage of the jobs on the base were to go to the
local people but this has not happened the way it was expected to,''
Alderman says.
   Because special skills are needed for many jobs, he says, Camden
County area residents generally have gotten lower-paying jobs toward
the service end of the scale.
   ``Both the Navy and the region realize the need for a
job-training program,'' he says.
   Alderman says Navy officials at St. Marys are aware of the
problems and are trying to get Washington to do more.
   ``The critical point is at hand,'' Alderman says. ``We have found
out now what has to be done.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a small automated plant in the middle of a
scenic forest in upstate New York, men in green jump suits are
testing a way to safely deal with radioactive waste and render it
harmless. Advocates of nuclear power are optimistic,
environmentalists are skeptical, while the local folk swap
glow-in-the-dark jokes.

<DATELINE>WEST VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All is not as it seems in this wooded,
idyllic slice of the Allegheny Mountains known as the Enchanted
Hills.
   True, the Cattaraugus Creek still snakes through sylvan glades of
the Zoar Valley as it has for centuries, cutting a 200-foot gorge
that enthralls the trout fisherman and thrills the whitewater rafter.
   But less than a mile away, a cluster of white buildings
surrounded by barbed wire marks the site of some of the most highly
concentrated radioactive waste in the world, stored in a massive
underground tank.
   If released into the environment, the resulting radiation from
the corrosive, near-boiling liquid would make the scenic area
uninhabitable for almost as long as it took to make the gorge. It is
the legacy of a former nuclear fuel reprocessing operation.
   That ominous distinction has made West Valley, 35 miles south of
Buffalo, the scene of the nation's first large-scale attempt to try
out radioactive waste treatment technology.
   The principles tested here are expected to be used in stabilizing
similar wastes at federal installations in Savannah River, Ga. and
Hanford, Wash., both of which have significantly greater amounts of
radioactive wastes.
   ``We're proving that the nation can deal with nuclear wastes
safely and effectively,'' says Willis Bixby, the Department of
Energy's project director.
   Many environmentalists disagree, however, pointing out that
modern science does not yet know how to render radioactive waste
harmless.
   The goal of the $700 million project is to get the liquid wastes
out of the aging tank and into a more stable form.
   Although other countries, such as France, which relies on nuclear
power for 70 percent of its energy needs, have been using the
technology for 20 years, the United States has simply stockpiled its
nuclear wastes until now.
   West Valley was the nation's only commercial reprocessing
facility. During the late '60s and early '70s, it took in spent fuel
from nuclear power plants around the country and extracted usable
uranium and plutonium. The byproduct of the process was some 600,000
gallons of waste.
   When it was built in the mid-1960s, New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller saw the facility as an opportunity for the state to get
in on the development of a technology that promised to solve the
nation's energy needs. He envisioned a massive nuclear complex that
would include reactors and research facilities.
   But that promise all but disappeared a few years later as
declining markets, tougher federal regulations and the radiation
hazards to workers forced the facility, run by Getty Oil Co., to
close.
   It was inoperative from 1972 until 1982 when the federal
Department of Energy began the West Valley Demonstration Project, a
multimillion-dollar cleanup effort.
   The first step in a complicated process that has taken years to
set up is to filter the liquid waste through columns filled with
zeolite, a sandy clay. The filtering reduces the radioactivity of
the liquid by 99 percent. The liquid is then blended with cement and
poured into 71-gallon steel drums. Officials expect to produce some
15,000 of the drums, each weighing 1,000 pounds, by 1994.
   The remaining, concentrated zeolite wastes are to be transformed
into 300 glass logs. The 10-foot logs will eventually be shipped to
a federal repository for high-level wastes scheduled to be opened in
Nevada in the year 2003. Until then, the glass logs are being kept
on the site.
   West Valley Nuclear Services Co., a Westinghouse Electric Co.
subsidiary handling the project, activated the treatment systems
last spring with some 500 people involved in operations. Inside the
white buildings, technicians in green jump suits with meters
attached to their collars to measure their exposure to radiation use
remote controls to pump the wastes through filters and
solidification processes.
   Except for an incident in 1986, when 11 construction workers were
contaminated after passing around a contaminated tool, there have
been no major problems at the facility. All but one of the workers
were back on the job several hours later.
   Project director Bixby thinks the safety record will contribute
to greater public acceptance of the nuclear power industry.
   ``We can't make up for the negative publicity of Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl,'' he says. ``But we can be a positive factor
when people consider the risks of energy sources and begin to
re-evaluate nuclear energy.''
   Increasing attention to the wastes produced by combustible fuels
and the so-called greenhouse effect and acid rain will lead people
to reconsider nuclear power, he said.
   Local environmental activists, however, say the project will
prove otherwise.
   ``It's impressive what they are doing, but it's no solution,''
says Carol Mongerson, a member of the Coalition on West Valley
Nuclear Waste. ``All we've really done is change it from one form to
another.''
   Mongerson says solidified radioactive waste remains harmful for
thousands of years. A single glass log will give off some 8,500
rems, enough radiation to kill a person exposed only for a few
minutes.
   The coalition sued the state and federal governments to force
Westinghouse to conduct an environmental impact study of its plans
to hold cement drums in a vault at the site. A federal judge ruled
that until the study is completed, the company must store the drums
in a temporary facility.
   Mongerson says West Valley officials are engaging in a lot of
``wishful thinking'' about the future of the nuclear industry.
   ``There really isn't any feasible way of dealing with the
byproducts,'' she says.
   Meanwhile, life in the nearby farming community life proceeds
undaunted, with residents scoffing at suggestions of a catastrophic
accident at the site.
   ``Heck, we're the ones who make up those glow-in-dark jokes,''
says Bernard ``Bud'' Williams, supervisor of the town of 2,000
people.

   Kim Delaney had to read some history to get
ready for her new roll in the series ``Tour of Duty,'' which is set
in a war she is too young to remember.
   Delaney joined the CBS series as it returned to the air this
month for its second season, this time with more emphasis on women
in the war. She plays Alex Devlin, a combat correspondent for a wire
service called American News International.
   ``I had no real awareness of the war,'' Delaney says. ``The
show's set in 1968 and I was only 7 years old. I didn't have much
time to study before I got the job. But I've spent a lot of time
since then reading and looking at documentaries, trying to get a
feeling of the passion people felt then. It's particularly hard to
find something written by a woman.''
   In its first season last year, ``Tour of Duty'' focused on an
Army platoon assigned to combat duty in the late 1960s. This season,
the time frame moves ahead slightly to 1968 and the platoon is
reassigned to Tan Son Nhut Air Force Base in Saigon.
   Besides Delaney, Betsy Brantley and Dan Gauthier have also joined
the cast. Brantley plays a civilian psychologist working for the
government and Gauthier is a young helicopter pilot. The show's
returning stars are Terence Knox, Stephen Caffrey, Tony Becker, Stan
Foster, Ramon Franco and Miguel A. Nunez Jr.
   The changes in ``Tour of Duty,'' heretofore an all-male show that
revolved around combat situations, undoubtedly reflect the success
of ABC's ``China Beach.'' That show, set at a hospital and rest and
recreation area, puts its emphasis on the women in Vietnam.
   Delaney says she is sometimes confused with Dana Delany, who
stars as a nurse in ``China Beach.''
   ``My character has an office in Saigon but she spends a lot of
time in the field,'' she says. ``It's a good role because I'm not
with just one person. I'm involved with all the people. Alex is
innocent when she arrives. She hasn't been corrupted by the world.
She wants to get to the truth of each story, whatever it is, at any
cost.''
   Alex Devlin also develops a love interest with Lt. Myron Goldman,
the platoon leader played by Stephen Caffrey. She's also attracted
to Lt. Johnny McKay, the helicopter pilot played by Gauthier. Her
role as a correspondent requires her to take frequent trips to
combat zones in a helicopter.
   Delaney made her professional debut in the ABC soap opera ``All
My Children'' in New York. She had a recurring role in NBC's ``L.A.
Law'' and earlier this year was in the NBC miniseries ``Something Is
Out There.''
   In the miniseries, she played the girlfriend of Joe Cortese, who
is her boyfriend in real life.
   ``I grew up in Philadelphia and went to all-girls Catholic
schools,'' she says. ``I didn't act in high school because I was
very shy. I had four brothers and I probably spent more time at
their school than mine. Actually, I didn't know what I wanted to do.
   ``My father came home from work one day and said how about court
reporter? He wanted me to go to college, but he knew I was rebelling
against more schooling. I studied court reporting some. I can't
imagine doing that today.''
   After high school she moved to New York and began a modeling
career. ``I got an agent and he gave me the name of some acting
coaches,'' she says. ``I studied for two years. That's when I knew I
couldn't imagine doing anything else. My second year of studying I
got `All My Children.'
   ``I wasn't sure I should take it. I made sure I was out of the
studio in time for my classes. The other actors thought I was crazy.
I was just starting out. I didn't know what blocking meant. I didn't
know how to make my mark. Some of the show's crew stayed after hours
to show me how to move.''
   Her character on the soap opera, Jenny Gardener, ``took off like
a shot,'' she says. ``She was a very sweet ingenue, a victim, a girl
from the wrong side of the tracks trying to make good.''
   Delaney stayed with the show three years.
   Her first movie was ``That Was Then, This Is Now,'' which took
her to Minnesota. Since then, she's been in ``The Drifter,'' ``Delta
Force,'' ``Campus Man'' and ``Hunter's Blood.'' Her TV films include
``Take My Daughters, Please,'' ``Christmas Comes To Willow Creek,''
``Cracked Up,'' ``First Affair'' and ``Perry Mason: The Case of the
Sinister Spirit.''

   Ruth Brown is getting ahead by going backward.
   She became a recording star singing rhythm 'n' blues in the
1950s. Now she's on Broadway singing jazz and blues dating fro the
three decades before that.
   And it works. She's teamed with Linda Hopkins and Carrie Smith in
the revue ``Black and Blue,'' a celebration of songs from the '20s,
'30s and '40s. It opens on Broadway tonight (Jan. 15) at the
Minskoff Theater, not just the three singers, but tap dancers and
well-known jazz musicians in the band.
   When ``Black and Blue'' opened in Paris in 1985, it ran for eight
months and Vogue magazine called it, ``The coolest thing in Paris
... a red-hot revival of black American music.''
   In the 1950s, Miss Brown was Atlantic Records' most-recorded
performer. She pumped out some 87 rhythm 'n' blues releases and some
called Atlantic ``the House that Ruth Built.''
   She admits that, at her ``Black and Blue'' audition, ``I was a
little hesitant, to tell the truth. I'd been singing rhythm 'n'
blues. I had not experienced that whole Cotton Club scene; that's
what the general idea was based on.
   ``We went to Paris shortly after the movie `The Cotton Club' had
been a good hit in Paris.''
   But now, harkening back to some of the fine old hits of an
earlier golden age of cabarets and Broadway revues, she is not only
comfortable, she promises new success.
   If ``Black and Blue's'' three singers are patterned after
anybody, she says, it is the Peters Sisters, a trio of American
sisters who became a hit in Europe. ``The last one, Virginia Peters,
is living in Paris. She saw the show and said she was pleased. It
was reminiscent of her good times.''
   Miss Brown had three solos in Paris and she still does, but
``Mood Indigo'' has been replaced by ``Body and Soul.'' Singing
those songs she says, ``was really like going back to my beginning.''
   She was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va.,
the oldest of seven children whose father was a Methodist choir
director.
   At 16, she joined Lucky Millinder's band.
   Traveling with Millinder, she says, ``I was keeping company with
one of the fellows in the band. Unless I wanted to be buried when I
got home, I thought I better get married. That's how I got Brown.''
   By the time she got to Washington, she and trumpeter Jimmy Brown
were separated and Millinder fired her for fetching drinks for the
musicians.
   She had left home against her father's wishes and found herself
without the price of a bus ticket home, ``standing on a street
corner by the Howard Theater with my suitcase in my hand, 225 miles
from home.
   ``A young man walked up I recognized; he was a singer with Horace
Heidt. He took me to the Crystal Caverns and introduced me to
Blanche Calloway. She gave me a chance to sing for her audience.
They received me in such a way she said she'd put me to work for a
week.
   ``Blanche was Cab Calloway's sister. She was one of the first
female band leaders and one of the most gorgeous women ever to grace
the stage. This show would have been her cup of tea.''
   Blanche Calloway became her manager. Miss Brown says, ``She
called the son of the Turkish ambassador who was starting a record
company and suggested he get down and listen to this girl.'' Ahmet
Ertegun listened and Ruth Brown was signed to the fledgling Atlantic
Records in 1949.
   Miss Brown's first recording at Atlantic Records was a ballad,
``So Long.'' Then staff writer Rudy Toombs brought in a fast song,
``Teardrops from My Eyes,'' which she also recorded for Atlantic.
   ``It took,'' she says. ``It was the first thing I'd done with a
back beat. It was really danceable. It went into the charts at 3 or
4, moved into No. 1 and stayed about 27 weeks.''
   She says that the song of hers people remember best is ``Mama, He
Treats Your Daughter Mean.''
   ``No matter where I go, 35 years later they ask for that song.''
   Other big records were ``5-10-15 Hours (of Your Love),'' ``Oh
What a Dream,'' ``Mambo Baby'' and ``Lucky Lips,'' which moved from
the rhythm 'n' blues best-selling charts to the pop charts, unusual
in those days.
   It wasn't always sunshine. She has had to get 9-to-5 jobs from
time to time and dropped out of show business to raise her children.
   Record royalties stopped until, in 1985, attorney Howell Begle, a
rhythm 'n' blues fan, began to look into her case, and others.
   Now she gets monthly statements and has received one lump sum
payment going back to 1970. ``I'm satisfied,'' she says. ``A lot of
people have been helped, even at this late stage of the game. Ahmet
made the decision to let us go ahead amicably. He could have caused
us to stay in court a long time and most of us didn't have the money
to do that.''
   Last season Miss Brown was off-Broadway in the musical,
``Staggerlee.'' A casting director saw that and invited her to read
for Motormouth Mabel in the film ``Hairspray.'' She got the part. In
December she was featured in a PBS documentary, ``That Rhythm, Those
Blues.''
   She has been married four times. ``I have two fine sons. They're
actors in California, waiting for the big moment they're going to
get their star on the sidewalk.'' Her grandson recently appeared in
a McDonald's commercial as a future Olympics long-distance runner.
   ``I've been more active in the last year and a half than ever,''
she says. ``I've been back doing nightclubs and I went to a jazz
festival in Japan. I've really got the bug for acting. Fantasy
Records put out `Have a Good Time,' cut live in Los Angeles. I've
got the feeling, as the old folks say, I'm on a roll.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Working Girl''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   What Melanie Griffith does in ``Working Girl'' to get ahead in
the business world would get her fired from any financial house in
New York. So why do audiences cheer for her masterful connivings?
   Because Griffith's Tess McGill is quite the most endearing movie
character in years. With her wide innocent eyes and shy, lispy
voice, she conceals a quicksilver mind that outraces the executives
who treat her like a servant with a note pad.
   Tess is a three-time loser, as she is reminded by her employment
counselor (Olympia Dukakis in a pre-Oscar bit). But Tess manages to
land another job, joining a bullpen of anonymous secretaries. Her
boss is the smarmy Katharine Parker (Siguorney Weaver), who
professes to be democratic but steals Tess' ideas and demeans her as
much as the male superiors.
   By careful reading of the gossip and financial columns, Tess
divines that a money-rich conglomerate might be ripe to buy a radio
chain. Her boss dismisses the notion, then goes off on a ski
vacation and breaks her leg. Tess usurps the boss' office and
wardrobe and sets her plan in motion, enlisting the help of an
ambitious broker, Harrison Ford.
   Kevin Wade has fashioned a screenplay filled with crisp dialogue,
witty observation and delightful surprises. So what if all of Tess'
plans, as well as her personal life, turn out beautifully? ``Working
Girl'' is a story that demands a happy ending.
   The proceedings are given a sophisticated polish by Mike Nichols,
at the top of his directorial skill. Adding to the happy blend is a
lilting score by Carly Simon, who employs a handful of old standards.
   Melanie Griffith occupies the screen almost throughout, and the
fascination never fades. She emerges as a major star. Harrison Ford,
a.k.a. Han Solo and Indiana Jones, handsomely fits his Brooks
Brothers clothes; he is the ideal Prince Charming for Griffith's
Cinderella. Courageously abandoning her usual star turn, Sigourney
Weaver plays the heartless boss with great flair.
   Another star of ``Working Girl'' is the Manhattan cityscape. It
has never looked more stunning than through Michael Ballhaus' camera.
   Douglas Wick produced the 20th Century Fox release. The R rating
seems harsh in view of the limited nudity and few sex scenes.
Running time: 113 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Young Guns,'' ``Five Corners,''
``Midnight Crossing.''
   
   ``Young Guns'' (Vestron Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   As almost everyone knows, William Bonney probably was as twisted
a psychopathic little geek as ever crawled out from under a rock.
   Adenoidal, visibly retarded, stumpy-legged and physically dirty,
Billy the Kid was glorified by the penny press of his day as a
clean-limbed, resolute pistol fighter who killed by the Code of the
West. My, how we've changed.
   ``Young Guns'' casts a twitchy Emilio Estevez as Billy, with
nattering sidekicks Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Casey
Siemasko, Lou Diamond Phillips and Dermot Mulroney. Terence Stamp
phones in his part as a smarmy British rancher and Jack Palance
plays Jack Palance, his bad-guy antagonist in New Mexico's Lincoln
County war of 1878.
   Guns roar. Ricochets whine. Sutherland murmurs. Estevez whines.
Palance smirks, having picked up another payday. Suffocatingly
directed by Christopher Cain, written by John Fusco, it makes you
want to run out and rent ``The Wild Bunch.''
   The movie's greatest moment is Brian Keith's cameo as a tough,
coarse, filthy bounty hunter who comes within an ace of blowing our
boy heroes off the planet. For a second the movie opens up and shows
signs of life.
   False alarm.

   ``Five Corners'' (Cannon Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Writer John Patrick Shanley, who took viewers to the sweet
streets of Brooklyn in ``Moonstruck,'' moves to the mean streets of
the Bronx in 1964 with ``Five Corners.''
   Unlike ``Moonstruck,'' this 1988 movie was no hit.
   But both Shanley products have an appealing fairy-tale feel with
their roots squarely planted in the mundane.
   Jodie Foster is lovely as Linda, a tough young woman frightened
at the release of a man sent to prison for trying to rape her. John
Turturro is truly terrifying as Heinz, still obsessed with Linda.
Tim Robbins (``Bull Durham'') plays Harry, Linda's savior, who after
his policeman father is killed becomes profoundly affected by the
work and words of Martin Luther King Jr.
   The characters' paths cross in a neighborhood of violence and
poverty. Some escape into a private fantasy world, others by
leaving, like Harry who plans to go South to register black voters.
Heinz cannot escape, and Turturro makes you feel how penned in his
character feels.
   There are drugs and pointless vandalism, penguins in a fountain,
a St. Bernard named The Buddah, dark humor and, mostly, people just
trying to get by in a world that shouldn't be so tough.
   ``Five Corners'' is eccentric and engaging, and above all worth
watching. But the end is less than satisfying, as a world lacking in
peace and order is tied up a little too neatly by the credits.

   ``Midnight Crossing'' (MCA Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated R)
   
   Flashback: Castro is coming out of the Cuban highlands and
Batista's casino operators are moving their cash out of the country.
Somehow a bunch of U.S. Navy men get hold of $2 million of it and
stash it on this island, see?
   Cut to the present: Daniel J. Travanti was one of the sailors.
The other one who knew where the treasure is has died, so Travanti
wants to go back and get it. (Why did they wait 20 years? Good
question.)
   Travanti's wife, played by Faye Dunaway, is blind, sort of. (``I
specialized in eye diseases. So how did I get glaucoma?'' Good
question.)
   He charters the yacht of his suspiciously deceased shipmate's son
(John Laughlin), whose perky, pouty wife (Kim Cattrall) works in
Capt. Frank Furillo's insurance agency. (Why? Good question.)
   By this point you've sunk 45 minutes in this sucker and nothing's
happening.
   Wait a second! ... Hey, isn't this the perfect bunch to erupt in
jealousy, lust, murderous intrigue and pistols and spearguns and all
kinds of neat-o, bloodiness played out beneath a cruel, cruel
Caribbean sun? Good question!
   Travanti sleepwalks through his role. Dunaway is at her most
brittle, shrewish and shrill. The juve leads are bland as custard.
Phony tension, childish intrigue, unbelievably stupid plot tricks.
Worse, the venerable Ned Beatty is written into the plot _ and just
as quickly written out.
   How did all these clever, handsome people make this bad movie?
Good question.

   ``When in Rome'' (Virgin) _ When in Rome
   
   This self-titled debut record from a trio of Englishmen sounds
like a lot of today's pop music: synthesizer-based, danceable and
rather empty-headed.
   When in Rome is the nom de guerre of vocalist Andrew Mann,
bassist-vocalist Clive Farrington and keyboardist Michael Floreale.
On their album, the three are joined by a host of session musicians
who chime in on percussion, guitars, keyboards and horns.
   The songs center around Floreale's multi-faceted keyboards and
the dual vocals of Farrington and Mann. The two singers harmonize
perfectly, singing lead vocals together on nearly every tune.
   The music is generally bright and perky, sort of what the Pet
Shop Boys probably sound like when they've had too much coffee. In
fact, the bubbly, bongo-based percussion often reminds the listener
of one of those percolating coffee pots.
   ``The Promise,'' a hit in Great Britain, is typical. Starting
with a piano that picks out the melody, the song throbs along
electronically with the clear harmonies of Mann and Farrington
piercing through the catchy melody.
   Most of the record thumps along in this vein, although on Side 2
there is a greater reliance on real instruments (as opposed to their
synthesizer-produced imitations) that makes things more interesting.
   ``Child's Play'' sports a clean trumpet solo over the vocal duet,
while ``Total Devotion'' is a fast-paced rave-up with a real rock
'n' roll piano solo and some full-throated sax licks.
   All in all, ``When in Rome'' makes hip-sounding dance music that
probably will blast out of speakers at college parties around the
country. The group, however, has little to say _ lyrically or
musically _ and their debut album just glides along the mainstream
like driftwood.

   ``Greatest Hits Live'' (Arista) _ Carly Simon
   
   Last year Barbra Streisand released a recording of a rare live
performance she gave before a small audience. Now Carly Simon,
another pop singer who seldom gives concerts, has copied the
strategy.
   But Miss Simon does it better. Miss Streisand's ``One Voice'' had
problems with pacing and song selection. But ``Greatest Hits Live''
is a nice mixture of well-known and unfamiliar material _ the album
title notwithstanding _ and the emphasis throughout is on the singer
and the songs.
   In her first performance before a live audience in eight years,
Miss Simon makes such hits from the early 1970s as ``Anticipation''
and ``The Right Thing To Do'' sound fresh. And the record climaxes
with the ambitious ``Coming Around Again,'' which includes the
nursery rhyme ``Itsy Bitsy Spider'' as a descant.
   A crack band and intelligent, varied arrangements complete the
package. Miss Simon has been accused in the past of singing flat,
but this set is sharp all the way around.

<HEAD>Star Watch: John Malkovich as Decadent Aristo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You might expect an intensely serious actor
such as John Malkovich to delve into 18th century French history in
order to play a decadent aristocrat in ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' Wrong.
   ``Mostly you just play the part as written,'' he admits.
``People's behavior and the way they view the world and their very
actions are just in the writing. Study the character's motivations
and history? Not for me. Afraid not.''
   ``Dangerous Liaisons'' is based on Chonderlos De Laclos'
scandalous 1782 novel and Christopher Hampton's modern play ``Les
Liaisons Dangereuses.'' Malkovich as the unscrupulous Valmont
connives with Glenn Close, another sex-obsessed aristocrat, in
bedroom games that ruin the lives of several people.
   ``I wouldn't really describe Valmont as evil,'' the actor mused.
``He has a lot of suspiciousness to him, and he does a lot of things
that are really mean. But I don't think in the end that he is really
evil.
   ``One of the things the picture is about is that he is unaware
that he is capable of love, unaware that he is capable of feeling,
unaware that he is capable of provoking that emotion in someone
else. Once he discovers that he can do that, it goes against
everything he has ever believed about himself. Finally it destroys
him.''
   Malkovich seemed a reluctant recruit to Warner Bros.' hoopla for
``Dangerous Liaisons.'' Although highly visible on the screen since
his 1984 debut as the combat photographer in ``The Killing Fields,''
he has maintained a low profile in the media. But he considered the
selling of ``Dangerous Liasions'' to be part of his job.
   A soft-spoken man, he carefully chooses his words, as if wary of
being misinterpreted. He bristled somewhat at the intimation that he
was not exactly type-cast as the dashing, amorous Valmont.
   ``Any character I play is not like me, so it doesn't really
matter what the differences are,'' he said. ``If you're intimating
that I'm not sex-charged or romantic, you may be completely correct.
I'm also not a psychopath or a robot or blind or anything else I
play.''
   The stars of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' _ Malkovich, Close, Michelle
Pfeiffer _ are American, and their speech is Americanized. This is
part of the plan by the original producer, Lorimar Telepictures.
   ``Although the original novel was French and the play on which
the movie was based was written by an Englishman, Christopher
Hampton, and the director (Stephen Frears) is English, they
(Lorimar) very much wanted American actors,'' said Malkovich. ``We
tried to make a more or less concerted effort to sound not too
American. Also we didn't want to sound English at all.''
   No chance of John Malkovich sounding English. He was born in the
American heartland, in the small town of Benton, Ill. His life
changed in 1973 when he happened into a drama class at Eastern
Illinois University.
   ``I had a girlfriend who was an actress, and I knew absolutely
nothing about theater or films,'' he said. ``We didn't have theater
within hundreds of miles of my hometown.
   ``So she was an actress, and I started following her around,
watching rehearsals. Eventually, I started doing it myself. I kept
doing it the last two years in school, then I met the people who
started the Steppenwolf theater in Chicago. In '76 when we all left
school, I went with them.''
   Malkovich became one of the pillars of Steppenwolf, with which he
is still associated. He attracted rave reviews when the company
played in New York, and he won an Obie in Sam Shepard's ``True
West.'' His second film, ``Places in the Heart,'' won him an Academy
Award nomination as supporting actor, and he has followed with
``Eleni,'' ``Making Mr. Right,'' ``The Glass Menagerie'' and
``Empire of the Sun.''
   He played Biff to Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in ``Death of a
Salesman'' on Broadway and won an Emmy for the television version.
   Were movies an early ambition?
   ``No, it's not something I gave a lot of thought to.''
   Did it happen by accident?
   ``I think we could say that. I did some plays and people asked me
to do this film and that film and it sort of mushroomed and spiraled
out of control.''
   Is film work as fulfilling as the theater?
   ``Rarely. This particular one, yes, because it was a particularly
good part. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and I really cared
about the story. Plus I worked a lot. Usually on films that doesn't
happen. That's the thing that usually drives me nuts: There's so
much waiting around. It's too long between times of working.''

   The famous mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne pauses in
detailing her busy life to ruminate about one difference between
actors and singers.
   Actors, she said, don't always get to do the works of the
greatest writers and playwrights. But in classical music, ``we're
dealing with the masters all the time.''
   The good things she's singing range from the most obscure, which
she relishes introducing, to the very familiar, such as Bizet's
``Carmen.''
   ``I keeping saying I'm going to pull up a bit on opera and do
less,'' she said. ``I keep doing more. It seems like there are so
many offers coming up all the time. It's crazy.''
   In September and October, Miss Horne sang seven performances of
``Maometto II'' _ an 1820 Rossini opera having its American premiere
_ at the San Francisco Opera. In November, she sang Dame Quickly
eight times in ``Falstaff,'' a Verdi masterpiece, at the Lyric Opera
of Chicago. In December she was at the Metropolitan Opera six times
as Carmen. In January and February, the concentration is on
Rossini's ``Tancredi,'' first in Chicago, then Los Angeles.
   After that comes a recital tour and more ``Tancredi'' in
Barcelona followed by ``Rinaldo'' in Venice and Rossini's comic
``The Italian Girl in Algiers'' in London.
   Miss Horne, who has a coloratura facility rare in voices lower
than soprano, is especially acclaimed for singing Rossini, who
expected coloratura singing even from men.
   ```Maometto II' is a really fabulous Rossini work that he
rewrote,'' she said. ``He wrote it in his Naples period, and when he
went to Paris he rewrote it as `The Siege of Corinth' _ that I sang
at La Scala in 1969. The versions are quite different.''
   The San Francisco Opera and Miss Horne decided on ``Maometto''
instead of ``Siege'' because ``Maometto'' had never been presented
in the United States.
   ``It was an enormous success _ much beyond our expectations,''
she said. ``The Rossini seria operas are still something that people
are not too familiar with. I think they're bowled over by the
music.''
   In opera seria, which came before grand opera, each scene had a
recitative to relate a plot event, followed by an aria that
commented on the event. The arias often were written to show off
particular singers. These operas were slim on acting but the good
ones were stuffed with beautiful music.
   Next season Miss Horne will sing in ``Falstaff'' and Vivaldi's
``Orlando furioso'' in San Francisco.
   ``It's a staggeringly beautiful opera which, whenever we've done
it, has never been less than a screaming, stomping success,'' she
said.
   ``My dream is to talk the Met into it. So far they're not
interested. I'm hoping they'll come and see this and say, `We have
to have this.' I would love to be the first person to bring a
Vivaldi opera to the Met _ as I did with Handel.''
   In May, she'll sing concerts with the Detroit and Indiana
symphonies.
   ``I've always felt a balance between opera and concerts is good
for me vocally. I think it's good for the longevity of the voice.
One is so outgoing and one is so intimate. You can get too much one
or the other. You can get yourself into a little bit of trouble
vocally.
   ``Sometimes a singer needs to have a real good sing. You need to
get out there and belt it out. And sometimes you need to use the
utmost of control with your voice.''
   Instead of dieting these days, Miss Horne says she does aerobics
and calisthenics an hour a day, six days a week.
   ``I have a trainer who comes and puts me through my paces. If I
have to walk 20 or 30 blocks, I just walk out the door and do it.
I'm really pleased because I feel so good.''
   Miss Horne has been singing in public since 1954, when she dubbed
the voice of Dorothy Dandridge in the movie ``Carmen Jones.''
   ``I'm on maintenance for my voice now, too. I'm trying to
maintain what I've got.''
   Angela, the daughter of Miss Horne and her former husband,
conductor Henry Lewis, recently moved to Los Angeles, where she has
a job assisting a director on a film.
   Lewis will conduct ``Tancredi'' in Los Angeles and Barcelona.
``We occasionally do concerts together, too,'' Miss Horne said.
``We've always remained really close friends and conferred on
anything serious that had to do with Angela all the time she was
growing up.
   ``Angela loves `Carmen' and `Norma.' She saw her first `Norma'
when she was 5 at Covent Garden. Joan (Sutherland) and I did it
there.''
   But Angela soon spoke of ``my music'' _ rock _ and ``your music''
_ classical, her mother recalled. ``Then I phoned her a couple of
years ago and heard what I thought was singing in the background.
She said, `I'm taping some of your records to play in the car.' I
thought, `That's it. We've finally done it.'''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Thank You, Moonie Krupka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don and David Was, authors of the hit single,
``Spy in the House of Love,'' would like to thank many people for
the success of Was (Not Was): Moonie Krupka, jazz critic David
Weiss, funk king George Clinton, music executive Michael Zilkha,
and, of course, Don's 2-year-old son.
   Get the picture? Well, there's more.
   The Was would also like to extend their appreciation to singers
Sweet Pea Atkinson and Harry Bowen, rocker Elvis Costello and Frank
Sinatra Jr., all contributors to the group's third album, ``What Up,
Dog?''
   Still confused? Then go back about 20 years when two young smart
alecks named Donald Fagenson and David Weiss were growing up in the
suburbs of Detroit. The story begins with our heroes in eighth grade
gym class.
   This is where Moonie Krupka comes in.
   ``Some of the students were using tumbling equipment without
supervision,'' Weiss recalled in an interview at the Manhattan
offices of Chrysalis Records. ``When the teacher found out he asked
who had done it. Don and I decided to withhold information, but a
guy named Moonie Krupka ratted on us. We met outside the teacher's
office.''
   And so the friendship was born _ Weiss, the poet who could not
remember lyrics to the Motown hits sung in the school bathrooms, and
Fagenson, the natural musician experimenting with multi-track
recordings at age 14.
   They each attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, but
eventually went their separate ways. Weiss headed west and became a
jazz critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
   ``I fancied myself a writer,'' Weiss said. ``I was really just a
big jazz fan.''
   Fagenson, meanwhile, took to the ``trenches'' in Detroit, doing
studio work and performing Gilbert O'Sullivan songs (``Alone Again,
Naturally,'' ``Get Down'') in local bars.
   ``I was at wits end,'' Fagenson recalled. ``You can only do so
much hackwork. It'll drive you nuts, especially if you have a
statement you've got to make. I felt the moment slipping away. I
called David and said, `Let's go down in glory.'''
   So in 1980, Was (Not Was) was formed. The name being inspired by
none other than Don's little boy, who had invented phrases such as
``Blue (Not Blue)'' and ``Hot (Not Hot).''
   The Was write most of the group's material and also play a number
of instruments, including keyboards, flute, harmonica and mandolin.
For singers, they recruited Atkinson and Bowen, who had been
performing backing vocals at the Sound Suite.
   Clinton, mastermind of Parliament-Funkadelic, enters the story
because his music and satirical style of writing are powerful
influences on Was (Not Was).
   ``George Clinton played at our high school dance when his group
was still called the Parliaments,'' Weiss said. ``They came and
lip-synced `I Just Wanna Testify' at our dance. He was obviously the
first black hippie anybody had ever seen so he really made quite an
impact.''
   With the help of a friendly jazz critic, Was (Not Was) managed to
get signed to Ze Records, an independent label, in 1980.
   ``I violated journalistic ethics by sending the demo to Ze
Records with a cover letter record from myself as a critic saying
you must listen to these guys,'' Weiss confessed.
   The ploy worked. Zilkha, the president of Ze, liked Was (Not Was)
and the group's self-titled debut album came out in 1981.
   The record sold poorly, however, and Was (Not Was) tried its luck
the following year with Geffen Records, formed by David Geffen, who
had helped discover the Eagles and Jackson Browne among many others.
It was, in Weiss' words, ``The beginning of the end of the
beginning.''
   ``We came in as this pan-ethnic dance act, this heterosexual
`Village People,''' Weiss said. ``Geffen's people thought in terms
of hit records. `Get rid of the black guys (Atkinson and Bowen),'
they told us. `You're blue-eyed soul. You need a Paul Young or Daryl
Hall to front the group.'''
   Out of this promising relationship came the group's sole album
for Geffen, ``Born to Laugh at Tornadoes,'' released in 1983. The
record bombed and Was (Not Was) spent the next two years trying to
get out of its contract.
   ``We were pariahs at our own record companies,'' Weiss said.
   Was (Not Was) did manage to have a couple of hits in Europe and
is now happily signed with Chrysalis records. ``What Up, Dog?'' is a
mix of funky tracks such as ``Spy'' and ``Anytime Lisa,'' the
off-the-wall ``Earth to Doris'' (featuring Weiss' anguished vocals)
and the heartfelt ``Love Can be Bad Luck.''
   Sinatra can be heard crooning ``Wedding Vows in Las Vegas,'' a
less-than-romantic look at life in the gambling mecca.
   ``It was a case of him seeing the song and being glad he had an
original piece of music that he could relate to,'' said Fagenson,
inspired to use the singer after seeing his name on a marquee.
``There was a great deal of pathos in that lyric. It's a sad place
and I thought he captured it.''
   Now that they are commercial successes, fans will no doubt want
to know Weiss and Fagenson's secret to writing hit singles.
   Explained Weiss: ``We're the first audience for each other. I
think our relationship is like a great author's relationship with
his publisher where you really need that third eye on things. If we
can prove this to each other, we can prove it to the audience at
large because we're so tough on each other.''
   Added Fagenson: ``He's just a lazy guy; he won't compose until he
has words.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Novelist Tells Story of Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of child abuse that Sylvia Fraser tells
in ``My Father's House'' would be chilling on any terms.
   But, even more so, the story is the writer's own.
   Fraser created a separate identity, another self, to exist when
her father sexually abused her during childhood. The other self
remained hidden and unknown to her for 40 years until she realized
she had been an abused child and summoned back the memories.
   In an interview in her nearly all-white living room, the author
said she started to write a novel about what had happened but was
``offended'' by the idea that she was putting into fiction something
that was fact. She decided to go ahead with the book despite the
self-exposure needed.
   The response has been positive, she said, including many letters
from people who tell her, ``You've written my story.''
   ``My Father's House'' was first published last year by Doubleday
Canada and, now in paperback, has been high on the Canadian
best-seller lists. It recently was published in hardcover in the
United States.
   ``Without being distracted by the `freak' element, one can relax
and enjoy Ms. Fraser's writing, which is rich yet superbly honed,''
Jill Johnston wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
   While the story has been told before in such books as ``Sybil,''
this is the first book by a professional writer about her own abuse
and multiple personality.
   Unlike Sybil, whose case has been documented by psychologists,
Fraser did not seek psychiatric help. She completely blocked out all
conscious memory of her abuse and maintained that the child victim
was a completely separate personality. Through personal awareness
and woman consciousness-raising sessions in the 1970s, she slowly
came to terms with who she was. The actual memory came spontaneously
while she was socializing one day with friends.
   Fraser was a journalist before her first novel, ``Pandora,'' was
published in 1972. She has written four novels since, all of them
including themes or incidents of sexual violence.
   ``Of course, now I understand that it was my other self,'' she
said. ``My whole writing impulse had really come from my abused
self.''
   ``My Father's House'' is a sort of detective story in which
Fraser searches for the unknown portions of her own past. Yet it
also is a remarkably vivid memoir of growing up in Hamilton, a city
about an hour's drive southwest of Toronto, in the 1940s and '50s.
   ``We were all stereotyped and terribly repressed,'' Fraser said,
proceeding with the interview despite having a ``beastly cold.''
   ``I think it was a very nasty time to grow up. It wasn't an age
of innocence, it was an age of repression.''
   Fraser believes her father's secret may have been known or
suspected among their relatives or neighbors but was simply too
horrendous to be considered in that era when even divorce was
thought of as a dirty word.
   ``The times were such that it was better not to remember,'' she
said.
   While she blocked the memories of the experiences lived by her
other self, she had nearly total recall of everything else.
   ``We're now talking about memories that are 40 years old,'' the
author said.
   Fraser attributes the crucial decisions made in her life, from
walking out on a good marriage to an affair with the father of a
childhood friend, to the confusion underlying an always outwardly
strong front.
   ``The whole emotional drive of my life was to reunite my two
selves,'' she said. ``I spent a lifetime with this mystery at my
core.''
   Fraser, who started her career as a feature writer for the
Toronto Star's weekly, said the dual personality she developed
during her childhood was an extension of the device most people use
to show different aspects at different times.
   The difference in her case, she said, was the blocking off so
that one self was not aware of the other. Perhaps in response to
puzzled looks, she said, ``It's not something to intellectualize too
much. You feel it _ or if you don't, you don't.''
   Her memory of the other self came back in December 1983.
   ``This I do know: My father was not a monster. His life was a bud
that never opened, blighted by the first frost. His crime became his
prison, his guilt his bars,'' she writes in ``My Father's House.''
   ``The force with which I came to hate my father was a measure of
the love I and my other self once bore him. I know that now.''
   Fraser said she no longer is angry.
   ``I was a very angry child and a very angry adult,'' she said.
``I'd worn that out; I'd used up all my anger. ... Basically I don't
care anymore. It really is behind me.''
   Her next book, whether a novel or non-fiction, probably will be
``fantastical, imaginative, much airier'' in contrast to her
previous works.
   ``I'm just not interested in sex and violence,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Mail-Order Musicians Flourish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold ``Happy'' Traum can help you learn
to play a musical instrument without being lectured about
practicing. And you don't even have to leave home.
   Traum and his wife run a mail-order business known as Homespun
Tapes. They produce audio and video tapes of instructional music
lessons featuring top musicians as instructors.
   In 20 years of business, they've sold hundreds of thousands of
such tapes to aspiring musicians around the world.
   ``We've sent tapes to just about any country you can name:
Malaysia, lots of African countries, Japan. And we get letters from
people in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union who say they
can't send money. They send us items in exchange like a crystal
vase,'' Traum said.
   Each of the 60- and 90-minute tapes feature one of the 50
musicians who are teachers.
   The Who's John Entwistle teaches electric bass. Chet Atkins
teaches country guitar. Livingston Taylor teaches acoustic guitar
and Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown teaches blues guitar. For blues
harmonica, the teacher is John Sebastian, formerly of the Lovin'
Spoonful.
   Other lessons teach fiddle, banjo, mandolin, autoharp, dulcimer,
flute, keyboards and synthesizer. Altogether, more than 400 tapes
have been done.
   Tapes are categorized according to level: beginning, easy
intermediate, intermediate and advanced intermediate. Most audio
tapes are $12.95, or $65 for a series of six. Video tapes, added
about seven years ago, cost $49.95 and $59.95.
   There's just about every kind of music imaginable, with one
exception.
   ``We're not interested in heavy metal,'' the 50-year-old Traum
said during a visit to Nashville for a taping session. The Traums
live in Woodstock, N.Y.
   Traum, who teaches guitar and banjo himself on the tapes, says
learning to play this way has several benefits.
   ``You can't get (personal) lessons from these people: They are
the best in the world,'' he said. ``You can rewind and play as much
as you want. They don't get mad at you if you don't practice.
   ``Lots of adults don't like to go to a teacher because of a bad
childhood experience or maybe their schedule doesn't permit it. This
way, you can come home from work or get up in the morning and put a
tape on.
   ``It does not have the personal contact that a human teacher has,
so I would say that people should take lessons from a real teacher
as well if they can. But these tapes are the closest you can get to
that. We try hard to make these personal. Our name suggests that.''
   He says the tapes also are a bargain because one hour of personal
music instruction could range anywhere from $15 to $50.
   ``Any one-hour video gives the average student five or six
lessons and several weeks or even months of practicing,'' Traum says.
   He says the results depend on the individual.
   ``I can't make a talented person out of an untalented one. But if
you have the dedication, there's no limit, especially if you
supplement it by going to listen to a professional or forming a
band. You don't get better in a vacuum.''
   Traum got started in the mail order business after making tapes
for his guitar students.
   ``It was a kitchen table operation for two years,'' he recalled.
``When dinner time came, we cleared the tapes off and set the table
for the kids.''
   Today, his business has a staff of eight and a mailing list of
about 30,000. Sales of audio tapes outnumber the videos by 2-to-1,
but he figures it will be even soon.
   ``We're geared to the teens on up,'' he said. ``We have a lot of
senior citizens with time on their hands. They have a fiddle
collecting dust in the attic and they want to put it to use.
   ``Some people have been buying the tapes as long as we've been in
business. We know their names by heart. Every few months, we hear
from them so we know people do progress.
   ``We send questionnaires to all those on the mailing list,'' he
said. ``We hear how the lessons have changed their lives and how
they've gotten in a band and so forth. It makes us feel like we're
doing something right.''

   The nation's economy closed 1988 on a vigorous
note, as December increases in the rates of production and new
orders were the highest since July, according to a survey of
corporate purchasing executives.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management's Business
Survey Committee said in a report for release today that its
Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 58.1 percent in December,
compared with 56.6 percent in November. The December figure was the
highest since July's 59 percent.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates that the economy is
generally expanding; below 50, that it is generally declining.

   Federal regulators rescued a post-Depression
record 217 savings institutions in 1988, leaving Congress and
President-elect Bush to figure out the best way to pay the $38
billion bill.
   Theoretically, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
the S&amp;L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $45
billion to $50 billion _ to cover the cost.
   But analysts and many members of Congress say regulators have run
up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall announced a number of

<HEAD>Researcher Says Job Frustration is Attitude Problem for Many</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor attitudes, not poor working
conditions, are the reasons many frustrated employees consider a job
change, a Central Michigan University researcher said.
   The findings, released on Monday, stem from a two-year study of
workers at five Michigan companies, said Terry Beehr, a psychology
professor at the university.
   Small changes in the workplace probably won't satisfy employees
who carry their old restlessness to a new job, Beehr said.
   ``People who see one job as stressful are prone to seeing all
jobs as stressful,'' he said. ``Even when jobs are substantially
different, people tend to hold the same kinds of attitudes about
them. Some people are more prone to complaining than others and will
complain regardless of objective reality.''
   The study, funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, also found
that workers who stay on the job despite their frustrations report
better experiences than those who leave for other positions.
   Beehr and two University of Arkansas psychologists, Nina Gupta
and Douglas Jenkins, studied a mixed sample of 211 blue-collar and
white-collar Michigan workers at two automotive supply companies, a
research and development company, a printing business and the
service departments of a large hospital.
   Most workers experienced an initial satisfaction with their new
jobs, but in many cases, the happiness quickly faded, Beehr said.
   ``By the time we did our follow-up interviews about a year and a
half later, the honeymoon was over,'' he said. ``Their encounter
with reality drives down those heightened expectations, and the
emptiness of unmet expectations takes over. People begin to feel
negative about their new jobs.''
   Those who remained happy with their job changes had taken new
positions with tangible benefits such as a higher salary or a better
chance for promotion, he said.
   The study suggests that disgruntled workers should examine their
reasons for leaving before they resign and avoid unrealistic
expectations about new jobs, Beehr said.
   ``I would just caution them to make sure the job isn't any worse
in any way, including non-work factors such as location,'' he said.
``If every factor looks at least as good as your current job, go
ahead. But don't expect you'll be elated by the new job. It probably
won't happen. If it does, it won't last long.''

   Stock prices began the year on a down note today
as Wall Street focused on the continuing specter of higher interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.43 to 2,162.14
as of 10 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
5-to-4, with 415 stocks up, 533 down and 556 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume totaled 17.82 million shares after the first
half-hour of trading.
   Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said today's early decline was due in part to an ``overextension of
the blue chips.''
   However, he said, the main problem on Wall Street was traders'
continuing concerns about interest rates. Those concerns were fueled
in part by a survey by the National Association of Purchasing
Management that indicated the economy remains robust, Wachtel said.
   With the economy running at a strong clip, the financial markets
expect the Federal Reserve to raise its discount rate.
   ``There's no sign of a rate peak,'' Wachtel said.
   Traders were looking toward Friday's release of employment data
for December for further clues about the Fed's intentions, he said.
   Declines in the dollar and Treasury bond prices today also
contributed to the decline on Wall Street, analysts said.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Philips Petroleum,
up [ at 19|.
   IBM was up \ at 122[, General Electric was off \ at 44{ and Ford
Motor was down [ at 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was off 0.54
at 155.72. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was unchanged at 306.01. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average
lost 14.11 points to close at 2,168.57. That left the market's
best-known barometer with a decline of 0.36 for the week, but a gain
of 229.74 points, or 11.85 percent, for the year.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
945 up, 594 down and 466 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127.21 million
shares, down from 131.29 million in Thursday's session.

   To the associate who turned him in, Kevin
David Mitnick is a ``big, fat slob'' obsessed with fast food and
breaking into computer systems.
   To the authorities holding him without bail, the 25-year-old Los
Angeles man is an expert hacker who calls himself Condor and is so
dangerous he must never be allowed to use even a telephone without
supervision.
   ``He is truly a threat to society, someone who uses computers to
act out personal vendettas against people,'' said Jim Black, a
computer crime specialist with the Police Department.
   ``The bottom line with Kevin is that if you have a job, pay a gas
bill, use a phone or drive a car he can find you and ruin you
electronically,'' Black said in a telephone interview. ``If he
wasn't in jail, he could be listening to us right this minute.'
   Mitnick was being held today in a maximum-security cell at the
federal Metropolitan Detention Center.
   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraud
charges, accusing him of using unauthorized MCI long-distance codes
to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and the
University of Southern California and causing $4 million damage to a
Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Mitnick will plead innocent, said his attorney, Alan Rubin.
   ``We will also try to get bail set,'' Rubin said. ``I am shocked
and astonished that my client is being held without bail and in
solitary confinement. This thing has been blown completely out of
proportion.''
   Longtime associate Leonard DiCicco, 23, of Calabasas, said he
reported Mitnick's activities to authorities because Mitnick had
been threatening him.
   ``He was using DEC computers where I work and threatening that we
would both go down if I said anything,'' said DiCicco, who faces no
charges in the inquiry.
   ``He has no sense of right or wrong and no respect for anyone
else's privacy,'' DiCicco said. ``I was beside him through all this
hacking and it's scary to think of the things he is capable of.''
   ``He could pick apart almost any computer system in the United
States,'' Black said. ``There are probably only a handful of
computer specialists with his capabilities.''
   In his electronic activities, the 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick
referred to himself as Condor, Black said. DiCicco said Mitnick
named himself for Robert Redford's character's code name in the spy
movie ``Three Days of the Condor.''
   ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees and work on
computers,'' DiCicco said. ``He was a big, fat slob of a guy who
couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computer
somewhere.''
   Mitnick began his hacking career using telephones, authorities
said. By age 13, he was under investigation by the police
department, Pacific Bell telephone company and the Federal
Communications Commission, the Los Angeles Daily News said Monday.
   ``Mitnick was a legend to the computer world by 1981,'' said John
Christ, his high school computer teacher.
   In 1982, DiCicco said, he and Mitnick used USC's 24-hour student
computer lab to get into many computers, including classified
systems.
   ``Our favorite was the National Security Agency computer because
it was supposed to be so confidential,'' DiCicco said. ``It was like
a big playground once you got into it.''

   Stock prices moved lower today as Wall Street
began the new year weighed down by interest rate concerns.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 14.11 to 2,154.46
as of 11 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
7-to-5, with 481 stocks up, 741 down and 522 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume totaled 41.57 million shares after the first 90
minutes of trading.
   Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
traders were selling amid fears that interest rates would continue
to rise.
   Those fears were fueled by soaring yields in the credit markets.
The interest rate on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue surged
to 9.09 percent today from 8.98 percent late Friday.
   The dollar was down on foreign exchange markets, adding to the
concerns on Wall Street, Metz said. Traders feared the Federal
Reserve would step in to support the U.S. currency by raising
interest rates, he said.
   Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the interest rate worries were also heightened by a survey by
the National Association of Purchasing Management that indicated the
economy remains robust.
   With the economy running at a strong clip, the financial markets
expect the Fed to raise its discount rate.
   ``There's no sign of a rate peak,'' Wachtel said.
   Traders were looking toard Friday's release of employment data
for December for further clues about the Fed's intentions, he said.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Exxon, down { to
43{.
   IBM was unchanged at 121~, General Electric was off ] at 44] and
Procter &amp; Gamble was down 1[ to 85~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was off 0.81
at 155.45. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was down 0.37 at 305.64.

<HEAD>President-Elect Attributes Debt Moratorium to `Exhausted' Reserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President elect Carlos Andres Perez
said Venezuela declared a moratorium on its foreign bank debt
because the country has nearly run out of foreign reserves,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
   ``The reality is clear, our operative international reserves are
exhausted and given this situation the government cannot fulfill its
debt commitments,'' said Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2.
   He did not estimate the level of foreign reserves, nor has the
government or Central Bank released any official figures in recent
months.
   But according to private estimates published Tuesday, foreign
reserves in the Central Bank fell to around $6 billion dollars at
the end of 1988, including just $54 million dollars in cash.
   Perez left Tuesday for talks this week with the presidents of
Mexico and Brazil about ``regional concerns'' which include the
Latin American debt problem.
   One of Perez' main goals is to get Latin debtors to join forces
in pressuring creditors for debt relief. Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela are three of the biggest debtors.
   Perez said he would be meeting with International Monetary Fund
Director Michel Camdessus during a financial conference in Davos,
Switzerland starting Jan. 28.
   ``This will be important for saying definitive things about the
foreign debt,'' Perez said.
   Outgoing president Jaime Lusinchi announced the debt moratorium,
effective Jan. 17, and the startup of new debt refinancing talks in
his annual New Year's address.
   A financial team is scheduled to visit New York on Jan. 12 to
initiate contacts with the nation's Bank Advisory Committee,
according to Finance Vice-Minister Eglee Iturbe de Blanco.
   The team will discuss a refinancing plan for around $21 billion
of foreign commercial bank debt, which includes the unpaid portion
of a $20.34 billion refinancing pact signed in 1987 and around $2
billion of debt not included in that pact.
   Venezuela's total foreign debt is about $33 billion.

   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission panel has
conditionally approved the New Hampshire portion of the emergency
plan for the Seabrook nuclear power plant, saying it does not
believe area teachers' claims they would abandon their pupils in an
atomic emergency.
   In a 290-page decision dated Friday and released today, a panel
of three administrative law judges said there is ``reasonable
assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken
within the New Hampshire portion'' of a 10-mile evacuation zone
around the plant.
   Part of the zone lies in Massachusetts, which has refused to
cooperate in the planning for an evacuation.
   The plant's operator, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, has
submitted a plan for Massachusetts communities. But the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board panel of law judges has yet to hold a
hearing on it.
   A recent order from President Reagan gave the Federal Emergency
Management Agency authority to draw up a plan and operate it if a
state refuses to take part.
   Today's approval was conditioned on several paperwork tasks and
resolving a traffic issue the board said had not been considered _
workers in the area going home before they begin evacuating the area.
   The board said it would seek advice from various groups on how to
deal with that issue but added that ``the omission of the commuter
trips to home will not have a large effect'' on the plan.
   Several local officials, including teachers, had testified at
board hearings they would abandon their jobs or pupils in favor of
taking care of their own families rather than carry out duties
assigned to them in the evacuation plan.
   ``The board does not accept the implied conclusion of the
teachers' testimony that virtually all of the teachers in the
(10-mile zone) will abruptly abandon their pupils without even
pausing to account for them and seeing them to a school bus...,''
the law judges said.
   ``While we would not expect heroic behavior from all of the
teachers, neither would we accept panic from all of them,'' the
licensing board said.
   The law judges found the teachers' testimony ``perplexing'' and
said it ``does not represent traditional American values and
history.''
   ``Where those relied upon to respond in an emergency know that
they have a role, and are trained to that role, as a group they will
not fail their communities,'' the board opined.
   The $5.7 billion Seabrook plant was completed two years ago but
has been idle because of the dispute over the evacuation plan.
   The commission has said it will grant a low-power testing license
as soon as Public Service Co. can present evidence that it would be
able to pay for closing and decommissioning he plant once its
components become radioactive.
   The company, which is operating under the protection of
bankruptcy courts, has said it expects to satisfy that requirement
in a few weeks.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by bullish weather
developments and the government's offer to subsidize more wheat
sales to China.
   The Agriculture Department announced Friday that it had targeted
China for additional sales of 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices under the Export Enhancement Program.
   Late last week, the National Weather Service issued a 90-day
outlook predicting drier-than-normal conditions in the major U.S.
winter wheat region through March, another positive factor for wheat
prices, analysts said.
   Hot, dry conditions in the South American soybean belt _
particularly in Argentina _ gave the soybean market an early boost,
said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Over the weekend, Brazil had some spotty rains _ nothing of
significance _ and Argentina was pretty much dry the entire weekend,
and hot,'' he said.
   Corn prices rose in sympathy with the other markets, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3\ cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.43{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $2.85\ a bushel; oats were
3 cents to 7\ cents higher with March at $2.48{ a bushel; soybeans
were 3{ cents lower to 3} cents higher with January at $8.08 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent lower with February at
73.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent to .45 cent lower
with January at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent to .40
cent lower with February at 46.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .65 cent to .95 cent lower with February at 42.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled narrowly mixed on Friday.

   The Sun-Times Co., publisher of the Chicago
Sun-Times, announced today it has signed a definitive agreement to
acquire Pioneer Press from Field Corp.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   Pioneer publishes 38 weekly newspapers, including the Evanston

communities. It has a combined weekly paid circulation in excess of
170,000.
   ``This is a significant step in the Sun-Times' commitment to

Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin.
   ``We are building for the future,'' said acting publisher Charles
T. Price, ``and the acquisition of Pioneer Newspapers is one more
sign of this strong commitment.''
   He said the move gives Sun-Times-owned newspapers access to more
than 32 percent of the metropolitan area's households.
   ``In the affluent northern section of the metropolitan area,
Pioneer has a household penetration in excess of 65 percent,'' said
Price.
   The Sun-Times also recently bought the Star Publications, 18
twice-weekly suburban newspapers covering 49 communities in the
southwestern suburbs.
   The Sun-Times, with a daily circulation of more than 2 million,
is owned by an investor group led by the New York investment firm of

   The new year began on a sour note on Wall Street
today as the prospect of higher interest rates brought stock prices
lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 20.53 to 2,148.04

<TEXT>
   MCorp continues to get close looks from potential
bidders and newspaper reports say that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
is the latest to begin reviewing the Dallas firm's records.
   MCorp senior vice president for corporate affairs, George A.
McCane, today told The Associated Press the company is obligated
after seeking FDIC assistance to allow potential bidders to review
the troubled bank holding company's records. But he said the company
has no intention of revealing who those interested parties are.
   ``I'm not going to go into any detail about who might have been
in or who might be coming in,'' McCane said.
   The teams of outsiders combing through the company's financial
records to establish what kind of bid, if any, their company should
make have not been particularly distracting although MCorp hopes to
convince federal regulators that it can bring itself out of
financial difficulty with a little help, McCane said.
   ``The thing people are focusing on within the company is taking
care of their customers,'' McCane said. ``Addressing the needs and
concerns of customers _ that keeps people busy.''
   Newspaper reports say a team of analysts from Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. moved in last week to begin reviewing MCorp's records.
The New York-based firm won a bidding war for RJR Nabisco Inc. about
a month ago.
   The Wall Street Journal, citing undisclosed sources, reported
Tuesday that KKR has assembled a war chest of $5 million to $6
million and will use part of it to gain a major stake in the
financial industry.
   Another potential bidder, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., recently moved a
50-member team out of the building.
   Besides Wells Fargo, several other large banks are thought to be
eyeing MCorp, including Citicorp. of New York, the Journal said.
   But MCorp, which has $20.1 billion in assets to stand as the
second-largest bank holding company in Texas, remains confident that
it can convince federal regulators that it can bail itself out of
trouble with a little help from the government and a few outside
investors.
   ``We feel good about the proposal we are putting together,''
McCane said.

   A federal judge has barred Toyota Motor Corp.
from using the Lexus name for its new line of luxury cars on grounds
that the name could infringe on the Lexis trademark used by Mead
Data Central Inc. for its computerized data-retrieval service.
   The ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein came
in a lawsuit filed by Mead against the Japanese carmaker and its
U.S. affiliate, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., Mead said in a
statement today.
   On Monday, Toyota obtained a temporary, emergency stay of
Edelstein's injunction, Mead said. On Thursday, a panel of the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to hear arguments on
whether the stay should be extended, said Mead, which is based in
Dayton, Ohio.
   If the stay is not extended, Toyota will be prohibited from using
the Lexus name when exhibiting its new car line at the Detroit and
Los Angeles automobile shows, which open Saturday, Mead said.
   Edelstein's ruling came under a New York law that entitles a
trademark owner to relief if it can demonstrate that the quality of
its trademark is likely to be diluted by another company's use of
the same or similar trademark.
   Edelstein gave Toyota five days to accept an alternate order that
would permit it to use the Lexus name provided it meets certain
conditions, including making payments to Mead to enable the company
to preserve the distinctiveness of its Lexis trademark and clearly
indicating in ads that the car line is not connected with Mead or
its Lexis data-retrieval product.
   Toyota Motor Sales spokesman Jim Olson said today that he could
not comment on whether the company would accept the alternate order.
But the official launch of the car line, scheduled for Thursday in
Detroit, would go ahead as planned despite the lawsuit, he added in
an interview from the company's Torrance, Calif., headquarters.
   Toyota unveiled the Lexus line last month, and said it planned to
have the Japanese cars in U.S. showrooms in September. The cars
represent a move to the high end of the car market for Toyota, which
established its reputation as a maker of high-quality, moderately
priced vehicles.
   Toyota said the Lexus line, which consists of two models, is
intended to compete with Mercedes-Benz and other luxury cars. The
move mirrors that by other Japanese carmakers, which also are
entering the luxury car market.
   The Lexus models will cost $20,000 to $35,000, and will be sold
through a separate dealer network, the company said.

   Share prices closed near their intra-day lows
Tuesday as a drop on Wall Street and a weaker dollar cast a shadow
over the London market's first trading session of 1989.
   Traders expressed disappointment about the generally thin trading
volumes, since many participants had hoped for renewed institutional
interest in the market as the Christmas and New Year holiday season
came to an end.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index closed down 10.3
points at 1,782.8, near the day's low of 1,782.4, off 10.7, which
came soon after the official 9 a.m. market opening.
   The market was briefly enlivened in the afternoon by news that
British Petroleum Co. plans to buy back a large slice of the 22
percent BP stake owned by the Kuwait Investment Office, the
London-based investment arm of the Kuwait government.
   The announcement was made at the same time that British Petroleum
and RTZ Corp. announced a price tag of $4.32 billion for the
minerals assets that BP is selling to RTZ in the largest private
deal ever concluded between two British firms.
   The news provoked rises in BP and RTZ share prices and generated
better than average trading volumes in the two stocks.
   The market managed a brief rally around midday, reaching an
intra-day peak of 1,790.7, off 2.4 points, before plunging lower
again during the afternoon.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed 7.5 points
lower at 1,447.8. Volume was a modest 323.8 million shares, down
from 377.3 million shares on Thursday, the last full-day trading
session.

<TEXT>
   Everything you've heard and read about the
linkage between the budget deficit and the trade deficit is wrong.
   Federal budget deficits are not responsible for pushing up the
trade deficit. Raising taxes or cutting spending will not do
anything to cure America's trade problems.
   This, at least, is the contention of Peter L. Bernstein, an
economist and forecaster who admits he is in a minority. A rather
small minority, in fact.
   ``I agree with very few people,'' Bernstein, who runs a New
York-based consulting firm, said in an interview this week.
   ``Frankly, I think his ideas are nonsense,'' agreed David Wyss, a
mainstream financial economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass.
   Bernstein may indeed be wrong, but he is worth listening to
because he is raising the right questions. He is certainly right
that cutting the budget deficit is no cure-all.
   ``It leads to belief in a quick fix _ if we raise taxes a little
bit and cut spending a little bit, the terrible hemorrhage (in
trade) will take care of itself,'' Bernstein said.
   Conventional wisdom says budget deficits create a shortage of
national savings and push up interest rates. High interest rates
attract foreign investors, who compete to invest in dollars. The
foreign demand for dollars pushes up the exchange rate, so American
products are expensive overseas and foreign products are cheap in
the United States.
   The result: shrinking exports, growing imports and a trade
deficit.
   It's indisputable that a savings shortfall and a trade deficit
occur simultaneously. That's necessarily true by accounting rules.
But Bernstein questions whether the one causes the other.
   In fact, he suggests, it may be that the trade deficit is causing
the budget deficit and the overall savings shortfall. The idea is
that the trade deficit depresses the national income, holding down
the government's tax revenue and resulting in a budget deficit.
   Bernstein makes one telling point: In the mid-1980s, economists
were saying the dollar was high because the budget deficit was so
big. Now they say the dollar is low because the budget deficit is so
big.
   Any piece of conventional wisdom that purports to explain
diametrically opposite results deserves closer scrutiny than it
usually gets.
   Bernstein produces charts showing no statistically significant
correlation between countries that have big budget deficits and
countries that have big trade deficits. Britain, for example, is
running budget surpluses and trade deficits. Canada has a big budget
deficit and often runs trade surpluses.
   Conventional economists respond that Bernstein is ignoring the
role of private savings.
   Countries like Japan and West Germany can afford to run federal
budget deficits because they have big pools of private savings to
borrow from, Wyss said. In contrast, the United States needs to
exercise budgetary restraint because the pool of private savings is
small.
   Americans aren't likely to start saving more, Wyss said, so to
balance its trade account the United States must either cut its
budget deficit or _ which is worse _ decrease investment.
   Even people who believe the budget deficit must be cut can agree
with Bernstein that fiscal measures are not the final answer to
America's persistent trade difficulties.
   ``Ultimately,'' Bernstein said in a recent paper, ``America's
ailments all derive from the real economy and are only incidentally
financial in origin.''
   The United States needs to improve its productivity so that it
can export products that the rest of the world wants _ and still
afford to buy the imports that the rest of the world has to offer.
   ``Higher productivity does not come in neat packages, however,''
he said. ``It comes in thousands of different bits and pieces of
education, motivation and innovation.''

   Poultry producer Holly Farms Corp. said
today it would fight a court ruling won by hostile suitor Tyson
Foods Inc. that blocks Holly Farms from a friendly merger with
ConAgra Corp.
   Holly Farms officers said in a statement that despite the ruling
they would proceed as if the friendly merger will take place.
Shareholders of both Holly Farms, a 100-year-old Memphis company,
and ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., are scheduled to meet in separate
sessions the first week of February to vote on the merger.
   Delaware Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett, ruling against the
proposed deal on Friday in Wilmington, Del., reopened the door for
Tyson Foods's hostile takeover attempt of Holly Farms.
   Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., is the nation's largest poultry
processor and has been attempting to buy rival Holly Farms since
Oct. 11.
   Tyson's lawsuit to halt the Holly Farms-ConAgra merger was heard
in Delaware because both Holly Farms and Tyson are incorporated
there.
   Hartnett ruled that provisions of the merger agreement did not
serve the best interest of Holly Farms stockholders because it did
not give them an opportunity to consider Tyson's offer. He enjoined
Holly Farms and ConAgra from acting on a merger agreement they
reached Nov. 17.
   ``The court's decision does not in any way affect our resolve to
complete the transaction with ConAgra,'' Holly Farms president and
chief executive officer R. Lee Taylor II said in the statement
released Monday.
   ``Despite the court's findings, the board believes it acted
properly ... in order to secure what was and continues to be the
best available alternative for Holly Farms and its stockholders. We
intend to pursue our proposed merger with ConAgra vigorously.''
   Jim Blair, a lawyer for Tyson Foods, said he had hoped Holly
Farms would open the bidding to Tyson as well as ConAgra following
the court ruling in Delaware.
   ``A Holly Farms manager, in view of what the court now has said,
ought to say since we're liberated from our obligations to ConAgra
we would like to negotiate with both parties and get the best price
we can get for our shareholders,'' Blair said. ``I don't understand
why they're not doing that.''
   Tyson Foods announced today it has extended its $54-a-share cash
tender offer for all outstanding share of Holly Farms until 5 p.m.
EST on Friday.
   Blair said Tyson officials will meet this week to see if that bid
should be raised.
   Tyson's attempt to buy Holly Farms began with a friendly offer
for about $900 million in cash or stock. When the Holly Farms board
of directors rejected that offer, Tyson launched its hostile
takeover attempt, going directly to Holly Farms shareholders with a
$52-a-share offer.
   Holly Farms turned to a white knight, opting to sell the company
to ConAgra in a stock swap valued at $1 billion.
   Tyson responded by offering shareholders $54 a share in cash for
their Holly Farms stock, making the deal worth about $977 million.
   The financial markets were closed Monday because of the New
Year's holiday. On Friday, Holly Farms shares closed at $55.625, up
50 cents, and ConAgra shares closed at $29, down 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Tyson shares closed at $17.125, up 25 cents, in over-the-counter
trading.

   The new year began on a sour note on Wall Street
today as higher interest rates brought stock prices lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 34.46 to 2,134.11
as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
2-to-1, with 493 stocks up, 1,008 down and 423 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume totaled 96.46 million shares at 2 p.m. EST.
   Analysts said interest rate worries and program selling combined
to bring the market down.
   The interest rate concerns were fueled by soaring yields in the
credit markets. The rate on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue
surged to 9.09 percent today from 8.98 percent late Friday.
   The dollar was down on foreign exchange markets, adding to the
concerns of Wall Street players, said Michael Metz, a market analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Traders feared the Federal Reserve would step in to support the
U.S. currency by raising interest rates, he said.
   Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the interest rate worries were also heightened by a survey by
the National Association of Purchasing Management that indicated the
economy remains robust.
   With the economy running at a strong clip, financial markets
expected the Fed to raise its discount rate, the interest it charges
its member banks.
   ``There's no sign of a rate peak,'' Wachtel said.
   Analysts said traders were looking toward Friday's release of
employment data for December for further clues about the Fed's
intentions.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE today was AT&amp;T, down \
to 28{.
   Among other most-active stocks, IBM was down 1 at 120~, General
Electric was off 1[ at 43| and Exxon was down } to 43\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was off 1.83

   The U.S. dollar was lower against the major
currencies in European markets on Tuesday after a day of mainly
trendless trading.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said it was a quiet start to the year
and they expected the dollar could go lower under the influence of
the expanding U.S. budget deficit.
   In London, where bank base lending rates are at a high 13
percent, a government assurance that the rate would be kept high to
combat inflation drove the British pound up more than two cents.
   One pound cost $1.8270 in London late Tuesday from Friday's late
$1.8062, the last trading day before the New Year holiday.
   Other late rates compared with Friday's late rates, included:
1.7620 West German marks, down from 1.7725; 1.4912 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5025; 6.0125 French francs, down from 6.0600; 1.9870
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0020; 1,295.75 Italian lire, down from

late in the day at 123.50 yen.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC agreed Tuesday to sell
off most of its mineral operations for $4.32 billion and, in a
separate transaction, pay $3.57 billion to buy back more than half
the 1.32 billion BP shares held by the government of Kuwait.
   RTZ Corp. PLC, a mining company with global interests, said it
agreed to buy the mineral operations, which includes operations in
the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Zimbabwe, South Africa,
Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, for 2.4 billion pounds,
or $4.32 billion.
   The sale includes BP's biggest U.S. asset, Bingham Canyon in
Utah, one of the world's largest open pit gold and copper mines,
Frank Fisher, BP's director of external affairs in Salt Lake City
confirmed Tuesday. However, it does not include most of BP's
Canadian mineral assets.
   The stock buy-back follows a British government order to the
Kuwaitis last month to reduce their BP holdings from 21.68 percent
to under 10 percent within three years.
   BP said it was buying 790 million shares from the Kuwait
Investment Office, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti
government, for 1.95 billion pounds, the equivalent of $3.57
billion. The transaction is subject to approval by BP shareholders,
the company said.
   The British government's order to the Kuwaitis came after a
ruling in October by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the
big Kuwaiti holding could ``operate against the public interest''
because of Kuwait's membership of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   BP chairman Sir Peter Walters said Tuesday that allowing such a
large stake in BP shares to remain in limbo ``for a period of up to
three years isn't in the interests of the company or its
shareholders.''
   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its holding by buying
partly paid BP stock in the months following the government's 7.2
billion pound, or $13.2 billion, public offering of BP shares in
October 1987.
   The major sale by the Conservative government under its policy of
privatization coincided with the stock market crash. The offering,
which included the government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP,
was seriously undersubscribed.
   BP will pay the Kuwaitis 305 pence each for their shares,
compared with a purchase price of 287 pence.
   However, BP will effectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax
credits. BP shares rose as high as 259 pence on Tuesday's
announcements, and its partly paid shares gained 10 pence to 157.5
pence on the London Stock Exchange.
   Meanwhile, RTZ shares rose 7 pence to 424 pence.
   Walters said BP began negotiating the mineral sales in mid-1988,
and said they were not undertaken to finance the share buy-back.
   The minerals transaction also covers the Canadian-based QIT, the
world's leading producer of titanium dioxide; a 49 percent stake in
Australia's Olympic Dam copper, uranium, gold and silver mines, and
South Africa's Richards Bay Minerals, a top producer of titanium
minerals, iron and zircon from beach sands.
   The BP assets involved had sales of $885.72 million and an
operating profit of $329.4 million for the nine months ended Sept.
30.

<HEAD>CBS Buys Tree For Reported $45 to $50 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tree International Publishing said
Tuesday CBS Records met all of its conditions when it agreed this
week to buy the world's largest country music publisher.
   New York-based CBS Records, the world's largest record company,
is buying Tree for a reported $45 million to $50 million.
   ``If offers us many, many opportunities simply because CBS has
the ability to commit so much money,'' longtime Tree owner Buddy
Killen said Tuesday. ``Nothing changes but the cash flow.''
   Killen would not disclose Monday's sale price.
   ``Tree belongs to Nashville, and I didn't want to let that
change,'' Killen said. ``I wasn't going to settle until they agreed
to all my prerequisites. That is, we had to stay in Nashville. We
had to keep the name Tree International. We had to keep all our
employees. And the headquarters had to be here.''
   The sale is believed to be the largest financial transaction in
the history of Nashville's Music Row.
   Killen, 52, will retain his title as president at the company and
will become a CBS executive. Tree vice president Donna Hilley will
be chief operating officer.
   CBS Records President Tommy Mottola called the sale ``a marriage
of two highly compatible partners.''
   ``It's fitting that country music's leading publisher be united
under the same roof with the leading record company in the world,''
he said.
   ``The purchase of Tree International is CBS Records' first
acquisition since becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony
Corporation,'' Mottola said. ``It will provide us with a solid base
upon which to build a significant music publishing entity.''
   Tree has more than 22 employees, 40 exclusive songwriters and its
own multi-story office building. The company has ranked as Billboard
Magazine's No. 1 country music publisher for 16 consecutive years.
   Its catalog of music copyrights includes more than 35,000 songs,
including the standards of Willie Nelson, Buck Owens, Merle Haggard,
Harlan Howard and Roger Miller.
   The deal marks the end of an era for the Nashville music
business. Song publishing was the area of the industry that had
remained locally controlled.
   In the 1980s, such publishing companies as Acuff-Rose, Cedarwood,
House of Gold and Combine Music went to out-of-town conglomerates.
Tree was the last major publishing property that had not been
acquired.
   CBS was purchased by Sony for a reported $2 billion in late 1987.
But CBS's old song publishing division was purchased by SBK
Entertainment World at that time. With the Tree purchase, Sony-CBS
is re-entering the publishing field.
   CBS Records boasts such stars as Michael Jackson, Bruce
Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and Willie Nelson.
   ``We want to be the biggest company around,'' Killen said. ``With
CBS, now we can aggressively go after more acquisitions, more
artists and more writers.''

<HEAD>EEC Devises Counter-Proposal to U.S. Retaliation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European officials on Tuesday put
finishing touches on a proposal to strike back at the United States
in a trade dispute incited by a ban on American meat treated with
growth hormones.
   Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the European Economic Community,
said that by Thursday he expected representatives of the 12-nation
trading bloc would be given a proposal for imposing higher duties on
certain U.S. products.
   The plan would be offered to counter measures the United States
put into effect Sunday to retaliate against the European meat ban.
   Approval of such a proposal would escalate a dispute that already
threatens to become a serious trans-Atlantic commercial war, hurting
a market in which two-way trade totaled an estimated $166 billion
last year.
   The community's executive body, the European Commission, earlier
vowed to slap higher duties on such U.S. imports as walnuts, honey,
dried fruit and canned corn.
   Wegter said, ``The principle of retaliation on our part is
already confirmed. It's already there. The only question is how we
put that into practical terms.''
   The final details and enforcement date of any such action would
have to be approved by the member governments.
   American officials have raised the prospect of taking additional
steps against any counter-measures imposed by the Europeans. Alfred
Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the EEC, said last week, ``I think it's
fair to say that you can anticipate further action on our side.''
   The friction was touched off by the enforcement on Sunday of an
EEC ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.
The trading bloc, also known as the Common Market, wants to prohibit
for health reasons all meat from such animals.
   ``Officially, there is no possibility of accepting meat coming
from the United States that has been treated with hormones,'' Wegter
told reporters.
   The ban is expected to block the importation of about $100
million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States,
some of which are used in making pates and sausages. The measure
exempts imports used to make pet food.
   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten
cattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose a
health risk.
   The prohibition was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the
trading bloc agreed to a one-year delay. It has since refused U.S.
appeals for another postponement.
   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States applied on
Sunday trade sanctions worth about $100 million against European
goods.
   The measures impose 100 percent duties on boneless beef, hams and
pork shoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee,
fermented alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol
by volume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food made
from grains.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said last week that the
EEC's ban on U.S. meat was an unfair trade practice and therefore
justified the American retaliation.
   The additional tariffs are to remain in effect for the duration
of the meat ban.
   But Wegter contended the U.S. retaliatory duties were not
justified.
   ``We are entitled to have our own standards for the quality of
our foodstuff,'' he said.
   ``If the Americans would like to breed with hormones, it's
completely their affair,'' he said. ``The only thing we are asking
is that to the extent they are exporting to us, they should certify
that there is no breeding with hormones.''
   EEC members could adopt the counter-measures against the United
States later this week, Wegter said. But he added they also could
refer the matter to key ministers scheduled to gather later in the
month. Agriculture ministers from the 12 nations will meet Jan. 16
and foreign ministers on Jan. 23.
   Wegter said, ``We do not like the idea of having a trade war. ...
The more things can be kept under control and kept in its own
proportion the better it is.''
   Wegter said that last fall, the EEC proposed settling the dispute
by boosting imports of high-quality U.S. beef in return for American
acceptance of the hormone ban. The offer, he said, was not accepted.
   EEC members are: France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain
and the United Kingdom.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a session that started on a
high note, then faded on late profit-taking.
   ``We got a pullback today in a profit-taking reaction after the
recent gains,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Analysts linked the strong opening across the board to a
continuation of Friday's late rally and to bullish developments on
the weather and export fronts.
   The Agriculture Department targeted China on Friday for 1 million
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, and rumors
circulated Tuesday of new soybean meal sales to the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, the National Weather Service has predicted
drier-than-normal conditions through March in the U.S. winter wheat
region, and 100-plus-degree temperatures blistered the newly planted
Argentine soybean crop during the weekend.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with

<HEAD>Reagan Decides Against Oil Import Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday he has decided
against any oil import fee or other action to curb oil imports but
conceded that ``the free world will become increasingly dependent on
oil supplies from potentially insecure sources.''
   The president said he acted on the recommendation of Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity who reported that import restrictions
``would not be cost effective and, in the long run, would impair
rather than enhance national security.''
   Verity's report was the outcome of an investigation requested in
December, 1987, by the National Energy Security Committee, the
president said.
   He said Verity concluded that ``there has been a substantial
improvement in U.S. energy security'' since the last similar
investigation in 1979.
   In a message to Congress that accompanied his statement, the
president urged lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices, permit
expanded oil exploration in Alaska and the outer Continental Shelf
and liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers.
   Reagan said that declining domestic oil production, rising oil
imports and growing free world dependence on potentially insecure
sources of supply raise a number of concerns, including
vulnerability to a major supply disruption.
   ``The investigation found that the maintenance of U.S. access to
sufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economic
security, foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness,'' he
said. ``Given these factors, the secretary of commerce found that
petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''
   He said that, in deciding not to recommend any import
restrictions, Verity took into account the administration's program
to improve energy security.
   In particular, Reagan cited decontrol of oil prices and
elimination of allocation controls as actions his administration has
taken to strengthen the domestic oil industry.
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains over 555 million
barrels, compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago,'' he said.
   ``Today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supply
disruption than in 1973 or 1979.''
   Despite these improvements, important energy security concerns
remain, the president said, citing rising oil consumption, declining
U.S. crude production and rising oil imports.
   ``In addition, projections show that the free world will become
increasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure
sources.'' he said.
   The president also called on Congress to streamline nuclear power
licensing procedures and sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves at Elk
Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo.

<TEXT>
   Transwestern Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of
Houston-based Enron Corp., said Tuesday it has asked federal
regulators for authority to reduce its rates for natural gas sales
and transportation services by $9.9 million annually.
   The request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission calls for
the rate reduction to take effect Feb. 1.
   ``With this rate reduction, Transwestern will continue to
maintain its competitive position,'' said Terence H. Thorn,
president of Transwestern.
   The Tuesday general rate case filing deals with the non-gas
portion of Transwestern's sales and transportation rates, the
company said. The gas portion of the company's sales rate is set
monthly through an adjustment proceeding.
   Transwestern operates a 4,439-mile natural gas pipeline beginning
in West Texas and southern Oklahoma and extending to the California
border.
   Enron Corp., with $9 billion in assets, operates the nation's
largest natural gas transmission system, markets natural gas and gas
liquids worldwide, operates a natural gas production company and is
involved in cogeneration and independent power production.

   Stock prices fell in modest trading today on Wall
Street as higher interest rates and a weaker dollar combined to get
the new year off to a bad start.
   Interest rates jumped because of fears of inflation that were
triggered by a report by the National Association of Purchasing
Management, which said the nation's economy grew in December at its
briskest rate in five months.
   The rate on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue surged to
9.08 percent today from 8.98 percent late Friday.
   The dollar was down on foreign exchange markets, adding to the
concerns of Wall Street players, said Michael Metz, a market analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Traders feared the Federal Reserve would step in to support the
U.S. currency by raising interest rates, he said.
   Analysts said traders were looking toward Friday's release of
employment data for December for further clues about the Fed's
intentions.

   The Ambassador Hotel, where Charlie Chaplin
lived, Robert F. Kennedy died, Marion Davies rode a horse through
the lobby, and generations of stars entertained at the Cocoanut
Grove lounge, closed its doors Tuesday.
   The last guests bid farewell to the 68-year-old Wilshire
Boulevard landmark, an imposing building on 23 lush acres now in
disrepair.
   It was one of the city's first luxury hotels, its palm-lined
property exemplifying the California lifestyle. Pictures of happier
days line the corridors of the 350-room main building, but
detracting from its elegant history now are peeling paint, worn rugs
and stained wallpaper.
   The Ambassador was host to top personalities in its heyday,
including Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and entertainers Elvis
Presley, Elizabeth Taylor, Lena Horne, Harry Belafonte, Bing Crosby
and Ray Charles.
   Miss Davies rode through the hotel lobby on horseback to amuse
her lover, multimillionaire publisher William Randolph Hearst. The
playground for yesteryear's elite abounds with such tales.
   Jack Benny proposed to Mary Livingston at the hotel, built on the
site of Gottfried Schmidts' dairy farm. Marilyn Monroe modeled
clothing during fashion shows, and for a half-century newspaper
columnist Walter Winchell called the Ambassador home for much of the
year.
   ``It's going to be a landmark I will always remember. There will
nver be anything like it,'' said Roy Gardner, 72, a retired
Inglewood plumbing contractor who roamed the lobby on its last day.
   Distance was calculated using the Ambassador, said Gardner. ``We
would say a place or somebody's house was five miles from the
Ambassador, like that,'' he said.
   But the glitz wore off the venerable hotel in the last few
decades, as newer, more fashionable hotels opened downtown and on
the city's Westside. The Ambassador, in the mid-Wilshire district
between those areas, made few physical improvements, began losing
money, and had been up for sale for three years.
   In May, the owners, the J. Myer Schine family, closed about
three-quarters of the 500 rooms because they failed to meet fire
standards, and more than $1 million was needed for earthquake-safety
improvements.
   Maid Elvira Bell changed the sheets for the famous as well as the
ordinary for 31 years. It was a party by ``Tiny Bubbles''
entertainer Don Ho, resulting in a hallway splashed with pineapple
juice, that she remembers vividly.
   ``In those days, the music was so loud that it began to run you
crazy,'' the 60-year-old woman said. ``Now I miss it. I have dropped
tears when I see those singers on TV.
   ``They're getting so old and I wonder, `How about me?'''
   The hotel had been a well-known landmark for years before, thanks
in part to its famous Cocoanut Grove nightclub, where such stars as
Sammy Davis Jr., Nat ``King'' Cole and Bob Hope performed.
   The Ambassador dramatically came into the national limelight when
New York Sen. Robert Kennedy was assassinated in the hotel pantry on
June 6, 1968. He was shot to death by Sirhan Sirhan moments after
declaring victory in California's Democratic presidential primary.
   The site's future is uncertain, with two companies negotiating to
buy it, said hotel spokeswoman Margaret Burk. The estimated sale
price has risen above $100 million, with preservation of some or all
of the building possibly at issue.
   Burk's anecdotes include the time John Wayne was a guest. ``When
John Wayne came, they said don't let any press in until he got to
his room and put his toupee on,'' Ms. Burk said.
   Fearing developers would carve up the property and sell it off
for commercial and residential ventures, the City Council voted in
August 1987 to declare the Ambassador a historic monument. But the
declaration expired after a year without a buyer being found.
   Despite its colorful history, there was no fanfare to mark its
closing. Management decided against a party because people have
known for two years that the hotel would be closing, Ms. Burk said.
   One visitor, Betty Szeden, who first set foot in the Ambassador
30 years ago as a model in a fashion show, came back Monday with her
husband.
   ``It was sad and quiet last night,'' she said. ``But I'm glad to
see it again.''

   The dollar began the year Tuesday by skidding
lower, largely because of pessimism about the U.S. trade deficit.
   A variety of factors were behind the dollar's decline, but most
pointed to concerns about trade, analysts said.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the dollar was
affected by comments by West German officials that the U.S. currency
had reached its peak against the mark.
   Barbanel said the remarks led traders to believe ``the dollar was
getting too strong too fast,'' and therefore set off selling.
   He said financial markets _ including foreign exchange traders _
also wanted to send a message to the incoming Bush administration
that the problems of the U.S. budget and trade deficits must be
dealt with.
   Jim McGroarty, a vice president with Discount Corp., said news of
an increase in the West German trade surplus also fueled the
dollar's decline.
   The U.S. government has seen a lower dollar as a means of
reducing the U.S. trade deficit, so increases in the trade surpluses
of other countries are taken by the markets as portending a drop in
the dollar.
   The dollar also fell now that traders have completed their
yearend position squaring, Barbanel said.
   The U.S. currency started its day on a down note overseas, and
continued to fall in New York before regaining some ground. Barbanel
attributed the late buying to technical market factors.
   In London, where bank base lending rates are at a high 13
percent, a government assurance that the rate would be kept high to
combat inflation drove the British pound up more than 2 cents.
   One pound cost $1.8270 in London late Tuesday, up from Friday's
late $1.8062, the last trading day before the New Year holiday. In
New York, the pound rose to $1.8225 from late Friday's $1.8115.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7670 West German marks, down from 1.7700;
1.49075 Swiss francs, down from 1.4995; 6.0340 French francs, down
from 6.0480; 1,300.50 Italian lire, down from 1,306.00; and 1.19165
Canadian dollars, down from 1.19245.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.7620 West German marks, down from 1.7725; 1.4912
Swiss francs, down from 1.5025; 6.0125 French francs, down from
6.0600; 1.9870 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0020; 1,295.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,305.25; 1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927.
   Tokyo markets were closed for an extended New Year holiday. The
dollar traded early in London at 123.80 Japanese yen and was lower
late in the day at 123.50 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to
123.825 yen from late friday's 124.95.
   Gold prices were marginally higher.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $411 for
a troy ounce of gold, up from $410 late Friday. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold rose to $410.80 from $410
on Friday.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $411.75 a troy ounce, up from
$410.05, and in Zurich at $411.25, up from $411.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $414.11, up from $413.41 Saturday.
   Silver prices were mixed, slipping in New York after rising in
London. Silver closed at $6.023 on the Commodity Exchange, down from
$6.038 on Friday. In earlier London trading, the metal was quoted at
a bid $6.07 a troy ounce, up from late Friday's $6.04.

<HEAD>Leveraged Buyout Firm Won't Confirm Possible Takeover Target</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. would not confirm or
deny reports Tuesday that it has been studying MCorp's books in a
possible bid to buy Texas' second-largest bank holding company, but
one source says the presence of the leveraged buyout firm is no
secret.
   ``I've talked to people from within the bank that substantiate
that they're doing due diligence,'' said Frank Anderson, an analyst
for Stephens &amp; Co. ``They're looking over the books. We were all
surprised when we found out KKR is involved.''
   Several firms reportedly are interested in the Dallas-based firm.
   A report in Tuesday's editions of the Wall Street Journal said
that a KKR team had quietly moved into MCorp's office tower in
downtown Dallas last week. The newspaper said the team had moved in
just as a 50-person team from Wells Fargo &amp; Co. of San Francisco
departed.
   ``We're declining comment on that story altogether,'' said a
spokesman for KKR, Ruth Packman of Keks &amp; Co. She said the company
typically chooses to divulge no information until it makes a
decision whether to try to acquire a company.
   George A. McCane, vice president of corporate affairs for MCorp.
also said he could not say anything other than that the bank holding
company is obligated by the FDIC to allow potential bidders to
review its books.
   ``I'm not going to go into any detail about who might have been
in or who might be coming in,'' McCane said.
   Ray Escamilla, a security officer at MCorp, said anyone reviewing
records at the Dallas firm would be working in an area accessible
only by magnetic cards and could not be reached for comment.
   An unidentified MCorp. employee who provides public information
in the tower's lobby, said she was not even familiar with KKR.
   But Anderson said word that a KKR team had descended on the bank
had spread rapidly and aroused much curiousity among other investors.
   ``Neither party is disclosing what they are up to,'' Anderson
said. ``Are they looking at buying the institution themselves, or as
part of a group, or possibly at strengthening management's bid by
being an outsider investor?''
   MCorp, which has $20.1 billion in assets, has said it intends to
submit its own proposal for recapitalization of its troubled banks.
   ``We would expect it to be completed and presented at the same
time other proposals are completed and presented,'' McCane said.
   When that period will be is not being disclosed by FDIC officials.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Tuesday he could not say
anything about the MCorp situation.
   ``All I can tell you is that the FDIC is addressing the MCorp
situation,'' he said.
   Anderson said the investment community is watching the MCorp
situation closely. He said other investors would probably follow a
KKR lead if the New York firm steps into the banking industry.
   ``The investment community historically has had sort of a herd
instinct,'' he said.
   Anderson said it would seem like an advantageous time for KKR to
branch into the financial services industry if it desired. KKR just
won a bidding war for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   ``It's probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in,
especially in the Southwest, where you can have the government as
your partner,'' Anderson said. ``It's a real opportunity, if you can
structure the deal so that it cushions your downside. I doubt this
opportunity will ever present itself again.''
   Anderson said that just the chance to browse through the MCorp
records also provides an unprecedented opportunity.
   ``If you wanted to get a good idea of what the Southwest really
looked like, what better medium could you use,'' he said, noting
that MCorp has banks in all of Texas' major markets.
   Undisclosed sources told The Wall Street Journal that KKR has
assembled a war chest of $5 billion to $6 billion and will use part
of it to gain a major stake in the financial industry.
   Besides Wells Fargo, several other large banks are thought to be
eyeing MCorp, including Citicorp. of New York, the Journal said.

<HEAD>Coffee Soars In Tight Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coffee and cocoa futures prices rose sharply Tuesday while prices
for cotton, sugar and orange juice futures plunged.
   On other markets, energy futures advanced, precious metals,
grain, soybean, livestock and meat futures were mixed and
stock-index futures retreated.
   On New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, coffee settled 2.5
cents to 6.56 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March
at $1.659 a pound, the highest coffee futures price since Nov. 13,
1986.
   Prices rose despite weekend showers in the major coffee-growing
region of Brazil, the world's largest producer.
   The rain came too late to reverse drought damage to the Brazilian
crop, said analyst Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York.
   He said strong demand was the driving force behind Tuesday's
sharp gains. The winter months in the Northern Hemisphere mark the
annual peak in world coffee consumption, and coffee-producing
countries typically undership their International Coffee
Organization quotas to exploit the surge in demand.
   ``It happens every year at this time,'' Badenhop said. ``Then in
May, June, you'll see exports start to accelerate as they try to
meet their quotas.''
   World sugar futures prices plunged the permitted daily limit of
.50 cent a pound with the limitless contracts for March and May
deliveries dropping .78 cent and .76 cent, respectively. March sugar
settled at 10.37 cents a pound.
   The sell-off was mostly technically inspired, with no fresh
supply-demand news in the market, analysts said.
   But Judith Ganes, of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York,
said lower prices could bring some of the physical buying that many
players have been expecting.
   ``Everyone's waiting for the Soviet Union and China to buy to
bridge their domestic shortfalls,'' she said. ``After this drop in
price, it might become attractive to them to enter the market.''
   Cocoa rose $29 to $39 with March at $1,539 a metric ton on
confirmation that the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, had
sold 400,000 metric tons of cocoa to a French trade house,
apparently putting into motion a complicated plan for withholding
Ivorian cocoa from world markets.
   Cotton fell 1.15 cents to 1.82 cents on the New York Cotton
Exchange with March settling at 56.67 cents a pound.
   The sell-off was sparked by weakening chart signals and rumors
that U.S. cotton producers meeting in Nashville, Tenn., planned to
ask the Agriculture Department to take action to reduce the price of
U.S. cotton on the world market, said Ernest Simon of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Futures prices for frozen orange-juice concentrate tumbled 3.45
cents to 4.20 cents on the Cotton Exchange with January settling at
$1.555 a pound.
   Mrs. Ganes of Shearson Lehman attributed the decline to the
extremely mild weather in the Florida orange country during this,
the critical freeze period.
   She said other fundamental factors governing orange-juice prices
were very bearish and demand was so slow that processors were widely
expected to drop their prices.
   Energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, boosted
by heavy buying of heating-oil futures ahead of an expected cold
spell in the Northeast, said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 33 cents
higher with February at $17.36 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent to
.94 cent higher with February at 53.23 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .14 cent to .27 cent higher with February at 47.27
cents a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.10 to $2.30
higher with February at $413.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents
to 1.5 cents lower with March at $6.115 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade in a session that started on a high note, then faded on late
profit-taking.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with March at
$4.39\ a bushel; corn was 3} cents lower to \ cent higher with March
at $2.80} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with March
at $2.45 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 10 cents lower with
January at $8.01} a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled unchanged
to .45 cent higher with February at 74.17 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with January at 84.32 cents
a pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .50 cent lower with February at
46.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .63 cent
lower with February at 42.42 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract for March delivery of the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index settled 2.75 points lower at 277.65. Each point is worth
$500.

   The federal milk price support will continue at
$10.60 per 100 pounds through March 31, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Tuesday.
   The Agriculture Department buys surplus butter, cheese and
non-fat dry milk at prices high enough to keep milk prices paid to
farmers by dealers from dropping significantly below the support
level.
   Under drought aid legislation passed last year, the department
would have been required to boost milk supports 50 cents per
hundredweight as of Jan. 1 if Lyng had estimated dairy purchases in
calendar 1989 would be less than 2.5 billion pounds of milk
equivalent.
   But Lyng said the department estimated net purchases by the
Commodity Credit Corp. will be 6.5 billion pounds, thus overruling
any increase in supports.
   In a separate announcement, the CCC said its price support crop
loans to farmers will carry an 8~ percent rate for loans made in
January, up from the December rate of 8\ percent. Officials said the
increase reflects the rate charged CCC by the U.S. Treasury.

<HEAD>Transportation Department Awards Route To Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Transportation agreed Tuesday
to award the lucrative Seattle-Tokyo air route to Continental
Airlines and will allow the Houston-based carrier to start service
as early as March.
   The department earlier had awarded the route to United Airlines.
But two weeks ago, the .S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.,
ordered the department to give the route to Continental and the
department said Tuesday it would not appeal that decision.
   ``We are doing what they ordered,'' said Hal Paris, a department
spokesman. ``We feel the court has spoken and we will have to live
with that decision.''
   The route, which generates more than $100 million in revenue
annually, has been the focus of an intense two-year battle between
three of the nation's largest airlines _ Continental, United and
American.
   At various times over the past two years, administrative law
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to all
three airlines.
   Most recently, the department had awarded the route to United.
But Continental immediately asked the appeals court to overturn that
decision, which the court agreed to do.
   Rob Doughty, a United spokesman in Chicago, said his airline
would have ``no comment'' on the department's decision Tuesday to
give the route to Continntal.
   Doughty had said earlier that United was considering appealing
the appeals court decision granting the route to Continental.
   U.S. Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who urged United be given the
route, expressed his disappointment in a statement released by his
Washington, D.C., office.
   ``This was a tough fight from the beginning and we did everything
we could to see United succeed,'' said Adams, who was President
Carter's secretary of transportation.
   ``While I think the decision was wrong, I will do what I can to
help keep the commercial airline industry stable inthe Northwest and
to help those working men and women affected by this decision,'' he
said.
   United has been flying the non-stop Seattle-to-Tokyo run since
1983.
   But when United bought Pan American World Airway's Pacific
Division in 1986 the Transportation Department said it wanted to
take another look at whether United would be allowed to continue
flying the route.
   Both Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines also fly non-stop
between Seattle and Tokyo.
   Continental has previously said that it would offer one-way fares
between Seattle and Tokyo as low as $299.
   American had said if it received the route it would construct a
new $100 million to $150 million hub at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   United put a $20 million expansion of its facilities at Sea-Tac
on hold pending a decision in the case, and warned it might drop its
Seattle-Hong Kong run if it wasn't allowed to continue to fly the
Seattle-Tokyo route.
   United had also warned it would be forced to lay off some of its
workers at Sea-Tac if it didn't receive the Seattle-Tokyo route.
   United had strong support from the Washington state congressional
delegation and local community leaders.

   Coniston Partners said Tuesday it was easing the

the New York-based food service company.
   Coniston said it would no longer insist on getting approval from
TW Services' board of directors before proceeding with its offer, as
long as TW Services dropped its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense, either voluntarily or by court order.
   TW Services owns 1,200 Denny's restaurants and 400 Hardee's
restaurants, among other properties. Coniston is a New York-based
investment firm.
   Coniston had wanted TW Services' board to endorse the takeover
offer to shareholders because doing the deal on hostile terms would
be more expensive.
   Coniston is offering $29 a share in cash for the 81 percent of TW
Services it does not already own.
   TW Services officials could not be reached at their offices for

Tuesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget Rent a Car Corp. says it has settled a
dispute with the Federal Trade Commission over compliance with
automobile recalls.
   The FTC charged Dec. 28 that Budget had rented cars subject to
recall notices without having them inspected or repaired.
   Budget said Friday that it had reached a consent agreement with
the FTC, basically agreeing to continue the recall practices it has
followed since 1984.
   The company said there was no merit to the FTC charges. Budget
said the charges stemmed from the company's inability to provide the
government with sufficient proof that some cars had been inspected
and the repairs made.
   The FTC action arose from an industry-wide investigation in 1981
in which car-rental companies were required to document their
compliance with recall notices.

<TEXT>
   Anita L. Peyton, publisher and general manager
of the Carmi Times newspaper in Southern Illinois, has died of an
apparent heart attack. She was 52.
   Mrs. Peyton had not been feeling well over the weekend, and had
complained of being tired, said White County Coroner Carl McVey. She
died Monday about 7:10 a.m. at Carmi Township Hospital, he said.
   ``It was quite a shock and totally unexpected,'' said Barry
Cleveland, managing editor of the Carmi Times, a daily newspaper.
``She was always so very active.''
   Mrs. Peyton helped start the Christmas-time collection and
distribution of toys, clothing, food and money through the newspaper
to the needy of White County.
   ``Her office looked like a jungle around Christmas because that
was where the collection was stored,'' Cleveland said. Mrs. Peyton
formerly worked at the Harrisburg Daily Register.
   She is survived by her husband, the Rev. Harrison L. Peyton; a
daughter, Jane, and two sons, Buddy and William. Funeral
arrangements are pending.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Auto Rates Highest in Nation: New Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts drivers paid the highest auto
insurance premiums in the nation in 1987, an average of $655,
according to a report Tuesday by the A.M. Best Co.
   The national average was $487, the Oldwick, N.J., company said in
its annual survey of auto insurance prices. Iowa had the lowest
rates, an average of $256 per year.
   Massachusetts rates have outstripped New Jersey, which topped the
list in 1986, the company found. New Jersey drivers paid an average
of $635 to insure their cars in 1987, up from $604 in 1986.
Massachusetts rates jumped an average of $100 in 1987, an 18 percent
increase over 1986, the report found.
   The report did not take into account the recently enacted
Massachusetts auto insurance reform law, which is estimated to save
consumers up to $400 million. Insurance Comissioner Roger Singer has
said the law, which took effect Jan. 1, 1989, will likely reduce
Massachusetts insurance rates to the rank of fourth highest in the
nation.
   After Massachusetts and New Jersey, the most expensive states in
which to insure a car were California ($623), Arizona ($602), Nevada
($600), Maryland ($597) and Alaska ($588), the Best report found.
New York ranked eighth at $583.
   The cheapest states after Iowa were South Dakota ($295), Alabama
($307), North Dakota ($328) and Tennessee ($328).
   Nationwide, auto insurance premiums jumped an average of 10
percent. Nonetheless, the U.S. property and casualty insurance
industry suffered a $4.3 billion underwriting loss which was not
compensated by $4 billion in investment earnings, Best said. In
1986, the industry also had a net operating loss of $200 million.
   Best arrives at its rankings by combining insurance data with the
number of registered passenger cars. The company warned its results
could be skewed by several factors, including differences in
insurance coverages that are mandated by states.

<HEAD>Salinas Says It's Time For Creditors `To Do Their Part' on Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said his
administration's No. 1 priority is to resume economic growth and
Mexico's creditors ``should now do their part'' to help the nation
reduce payments on its $106 billion foreign debt.
   ``We are serious and will continue to be serious'' about making
payments on the debt, Salinas said in a New Year's speech to armed
forces chiefs delivered Monday.
   ``We prefer firm negotiation to confrontation. But let me
emphasize that for me, the interests of Mexico are more important
than the interests of the creditors,'' Salinas said.
   He said Mexico has made ``an enormous sacrifice to correct our
deficiencies, and now it's up to them (creditors) to do their part.''
   Since he took power on Dec. 1, Salinas has maintained that ``the
priority is no longer to keep paying, but to start growing again.''
   Mexico last year paid $9 million in interest and $5 million in
principle to service its debt; it faces total payments this year of
about $16 billion. Salinas maintains that Mexico cannot continue to
make such high payments if it wants to grow, because it needs the
money to invest.
   Venezuelan President-elect Carlos Andres Perez, who will be
inaugurated Feb. 2, is due to arrive Tuesday for a one-day visit.
His meeting with Salinas comes in the wake of Venezuelan president
Jaime Lusinchi's decision to suspend debt principal payments.
   Salinas said 1989 will be a year of economic transition,
``between a period of unstable inflation and one of low inflation,
transition between stagnation and sustained recovery, transition
towards a better standard of living for all Mexicans.''
   ``The rhythm of transition will depend on the conditions of debt
renegotiation. We have to take excessive debt service charges off
the backs of Mexicans,'' Salinas said.

<HEAD>Tyson May Raise Offer For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. is considering an increase
in its $54-a-share offer for Holly Farms Corp., a rival poultry
processor headquartered in Memphis, a Tyson spokesman said Tuesday.
   Holly Farms, in an effort to fend off the Tyson offer, is trying
to be absorbed by ConAgra Inc., a processor of food and agricultural
products headquartered in Omaha, Neb.
   But a ConAgra spokesman declined to say Tuesday if that company
still is pressing for the merger, which has been temporarily blocked
by a Delaware court.
   ``We are reviewing our options and we really don't have anything
more to say right now,'' Walt Casey, ConAgra's vice president for
corporate communications, said from his office in Omaha.
   Jim Blair, general counsel for Tyson, said company officers were
planning to gather at their headquarters in Springdale, Ark., this
week to discuss the Holly Farms project.
   ``We're going to try to find a way to make the Holly Farms board
and Holly shareholders a fair and generous offer that they can't in
good conscience turn down,'' Blair said.
   Asked if that meant an increase in the $54 bid, Blair said, ``I
think it's a possibility.''
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, has been trying
since Oct. 11 to take over Holly Farms, but Holly's board of
directors has resisted those attempts. Tyson's latest offer is worth
about $970 million.
   Holly Farms, a diversified food company heavily involved in
poultry processing, announced plans in November to head off Tyson's
takeover by merging with ConAgra in a stock swap valued at $1
billion.
   Tyson went to court in Delaware, where Tyson and Holly Farms are
incorporated, and a chancellor issued a ruling Friday temporarily
blocking the Holly Farms-ConAgra deal. Tyson argued that Holly Farms
owed it to its stockholders to consider all buyout offers.
   Holly Farms issued a statement Monday saying the ruling would be
appealed and that shareholders of Holly Farms and ConAgra would be
asked at separate meetings next month to vote on the proposed merger.
   ``The court's decision does not in any way affect our resolve to
complete the transaction with ConAgra,'' Holly Farms president R.
Lee Taylor II said in the statement.
   Blair said he was surprised that Holly Farms was so eager to
appeal the chancellor's ruling.
   ``A Holly Farms manager, in view of what the court has said,
ought to say, `Since we're liberated from our obligation to ConAgra
we would like to negotiate with both parties and get the best price
we can for our shareholders.' I don't understand why they're not
doing that,'' Blair said.
   Holly Farms, which has more than 15,000 employees in 20 states,
had net income of $36.2 million in 1987 on sales of $1.6 billion.
   ConAgra had $9.5 billion in sales last year, making it the
fourth-largest food company in the nation, according to Fortune
magazine.
   Tyson, which processes some 14 million pounds of chicken a week,
had total sales last year of just under $2 billion, Blair said.
   Tyson's attempt to buy Holly Farms began with a friendly offer
worth about $900 million in cash or stock. When the Holly Farms
board rejected that advance, Tyson launched its hostile offer,
presenting its bid directly to Holly Farms stockholders.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Holly Farms closed at
$56.75, up from $55.62 on Friday. The financial markets were closed
Monday because of the New Year's holiday.

   Wall Street opened for business in 1989 with a
markdown on Tuesday as a jump in interest rates and a weaker dollar
combined to send stock prices lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 23.93 points to
2,144.64, a drop of just over 1 percent. Broader measures of the
market posted smaller declines.
   Good news was indirectly responsible for the stock market's drop.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that the
economy grew in December at its briskest rate in five months. The
report raised fears that inflation would heat up, and bond prices
fell, triggering a sympathetic reaction in the stock market.
   ``The real problem today was the drop in the bond market and the
drop in the dollar. This raised concern about the possibility that
the Fed (Federal Reserve) would have to tighten further to protect
the dollar from further declines,'' said Michael Metz, a market
analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Computerized program selling added to the pressure on blue-chip
stocks. Stocks that were not involved in the programs fared better,
although most of them also fell.
   Robert Murphy, a senior market specialist for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said the first day of trading does not necessarily set a trend
for the month or the year. ``This might be a sucker punch day,'' he
said.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3-to-2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
619 up, 942 down and 424 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board remained modest at 128.50
million shares, up from 127.21 million on Friday. The market was
closed on Monday for the New Year's holiday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 155.42 million shares.
   Among blue-chip issues, General Motors declined 1\ to 82\, Du
Pont sank 1~ to 86], McDonald's lost 1] to 46}, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph fell [ to 28|, and International Business Machines was
unchanged at 121~.
   Among the volume leaders, RJR Nabisco fell 1 to 90[ and Exxon was
off } at 43\.
   Public Service of New Hampshire jumped almost 24 percent,
climbing 1[ to 5~. A Nuclear Regulatory Commission panel
conditionally approved the New Hampshire portion of the emergency
plan for the Seabrook nuclear power plant, in which the company
holds a major stake.
   Holly Farms rose 1[ to 56}. The poultry producer said it would
fight a court ruling won by hostile suitor Tyson Foods that blocks
Holly Farms from a friendly merger with ConAgra Corp.
   General Cinema was a big loser, falling 1{ to 24. Pepsico's $1.5
billion purchase of General Cinema's soft-drink bottling business
has fallen through, delayed beyond a 1988 deadline for completion by
a government request for antitrust information about the proposed
deal, the companies said.
   Commodore International, the personal computer maker, fell } to
13\. The company said the Internal Revenue Service said it owed $74
million in back taxes.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the overall market declined $19.83 billion,
or 0.72 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.28 to 154.98.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.60 to 318.66, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell 2.41 to 275.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.82 to 378.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 305.24, a decline of 0.77.

<TEXT>
   The world's largest bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Ltd., said Tuesday it is selling its Chicago retail operations to
First American Bank Corp., a suburban bank holding company, so it
can focus entirely on business banking.
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The deal includes
assets of $35 million, including about 6,000 checking, savings and
other accounts, and a retail loan portfolio of less than $5 million,
the companies said in a joint statement.
   Dai-Ichi said the Chicago office was its only U.S. branch with
retail operations. But Yoshiro Aoki, joint general manager of the
Chicago branch, said a Dai-Ichi subsidiary in Los Angeles, the
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of California, also offers retail banking.
   Dai-Ichi also operates branches in Los Angeles, New York and
Atlanta and has offices, but not full branches, in Houston and San
Francisco.
   Tokyo-based Dai-Ichi, with more than $375 billion in assets
worldwide, said it plans to relocate and expand its downtown Chicago
branch to accomodate the rapid growth of its business banking
activities.
   First American, based in Elk Grove Village, has $500 million in
assets and 18 banking locations in the Chicago area. The firm said
it would retain Dai-Ichi's Chicago retail staff.
   The deal marked a ``milestone'' for First American by giving the
company its first downtown location, said Chairman Thomas E. Wells
IV.
   ``It fulfills a critical goal in our strategy of geographical
expansion,'' Wells said.
   But for Dai-Ichi, with assets of about $3 billion at its Chicago
branch alone, ``this is insignificant, with a capital `I,''' said
Frederick Wightman, a banking analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in
Chicago.
   Wightman said Japanese banks with U.S. branches generally are
more interested in large-scale commercial business than in consumer
checking, savings and loans.
   ``Retail banking is tied closely to deposit-gathering and with
the high savings rate in Japan, attracting retail deposits
(overseas) is not a big concern for Japanese banks,'' Wightman said.
``The deposits are available in more than adequate quantities back
in Japan.''
   Dai-Ichi's Chicago branch, established by the company in 1972 as
the First Pacific Bank of Chicago and converted to branch status
late in 1981, counts among its customers such well-known Midwestern
corporations as Brunswick Corp.; Ford Motor Co.; Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co.; McDonald's Corp.; and Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   Fumiyasu Konno, general manager of the Chicago branch, said
specialization was synonomous with survival in the banking business.
   ``Banks must focus resources and expertise in the markets that
offer them the greatest opportunities,'' he said in a statement.
   The sale is expected to be completed in the spring after
regulatory approval.

   Anchor Glass Container Corp. announced Tuesday
it is raising prices on some glassware items to offset rising costs.
   Prices for consumer glassware, such as mason jars and drinking
tumblers, will increase an average of 5 percent, and prices for
returnable beverage bottles will increase 6 percent, said James H.
Smith, vice president and chief financial officer.
   ``The changes, which take effect immediately, apply to only a few
percent'' of sales, Smith said.
   The company raised the prices to cover increased costs for raw
materials and packing materials, Smith said.
   Anchor Glass said it is the second largest domestic manufacturer
of glass containers for the brewing, food, soft drink, distilled
spirits and wine industries.
   The company lost $2.4 million in its third quarter for 1988,
blaming price discounting in the glass container industry.
   It said it expects to post a loss for both the fourth quarter and
all of 1988. The company earned $20.0 million in 1987 on sales of
$766 million.

   The Sun-Times Co., publisher of the Chicago
Sun-Times, said Tuesday it would purchase the 38 Pioneer Newspapers
Group weeklies from the Field Corp.
   Pioneer's newspapers, which include the Evanston Review and Oak
Leaves of Oak Park, cover more than 79 communities. They have a
combined weekly paid circulation in excess of 170,000.
   ``We are building for the future,'' said acting publisher Charles
T. Price, ``and the acquisition of Pioneer Newspapers is one more
sign of this strong commitment.''
   The Sun-Times also recently bought the Star Publications, 18
twice-weekly suburban newspapers covering 49 communities southwest
of Chicago.
   Lee Mitchell, Field president and chief executive officer, said
the transaction will be completed in the next few weeks, but he
declined to disclose the terms of the purchase agreement.
   ``We are accepting an unsolicited offer from the Sun-Times
because it provides an attractive return on the investment we made
in Pioneer in 1984,'' Mitchell said.
   Pioneer Press was purchased by an affiliate of The Field Corp.
from Time Inc. in 1984.
   The Field Corp. is a Chicago-based holding company that manages
several operating companies, including Field Publications, publisher
of the children's newspaper ``Weekly Reader.''
