   Curbing future use of chemical weapons, not judging
events in the past, is the purpose of a meeting of more than 140
countries beginning this weekend, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said
Wednesday.
   But the United States is widely expected to make an issue of its
allegations that Libya has built a large chemical weapons plant.
   The conference, opening Saturday, follows the downing of two
Libyan jet fighters by U.S. Navy planes on Wednesday.
   The conference also may become a forum for disputes between Iran
and Iraq, following Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the eight-year
Persian Gulf war. Iraq said it used chemical weapons after Iran did,
but Iran has denied using them.
   Speaking at a news conference, Dumas said France hopes the
five-day conference ``will not deviate from its agenda'' after the
incident. He also said the meeting should avoid reviewing past
chemical weapons deployment.
   ``The Paris conference must not judge past acts,'' Dumas said.
   The aim of the conference is to reaffirm the 1925 Geneva Protocol
banning the use of chemical weapons and give impetus to negotiations
in Geneva on a universal ban on use and production of chemical arms.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, will attend
the conference, U.N. officials said.
   William Burns, the U.S. arms control director, told reporters in
Washington on Wednesday that the American delegation will focus on
trying to strengthen the secretary-general's authority to
investigate allegations of chemical weapons use and authorize the
U.N. General Assembly or Security Council to impose sanctions.
   But Burns said this could be difficult since all actions at the
conference will be taken by consensus. This means a single
participant, such as Libya, could hold off an overwhelming majority.
   The U.S. government accuses Libya of having built a chemical
weapons plant in the desert town of Rabta, 35 miles south of its
capital, Tripoli. President Reagan last month said a military strike
on the plant was under consideration.
   Libya says the plant in question produces pharmaceuticals.
   West German radio quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the West
German ambassador in Tripoli met Wednesday with Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi to discuss ways for an international commission to
inspect the Rabta plant.
   U.S. officials have said they suspect that a West German company
helped build the chemical plant.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's foreign minister, told
reporters in Bonn before the attack that his government was
investigating the firm Imhausen-Chemie, but that it had no
independent verification of the U.S. claims that it supplied Libya
with materials for the plant.
   Britain's Foreign Office said Wednesday night it had independent
information confirming the plant was built to produce chemical
weapons. It was Britain's first comment on the U.S. allegations.
   On Wednesday, two American F-14s shot down two Libyan jet
fighters. U.S. government officials said the Navy jets were
conducting routine operations and had been threatened.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci denied the action was
related to the earlier accusation concerning the chemical weapons
plant.
   Dumas said it was too soon for all the facts on the air skirmish
to be known and that France awaited the ``Libyan version'' of the
events.
   Dumas said France did not have enough information to decide
whether the Libyan plant was capable of producing chemical weapons.
   The conference was formally proposed by President Reagan during
his September address to the U.N. General Assembly.

   A mine overhead collapsed Wednesday,
trapping and killing three coal miners, according to searchers who
recovered their bodies, state officials said.
   The miners were about 2,400 feet inside the Cumberland Valley
Contractors Inc. No. 2 mine, removing coal pillars when the roof
fell about 3:20 p.m., said Willard Stanley, commissioner of the
state Department of Mines and Minerals.
   Stanley identified the first miner discovered as Steve Bradburn,
36, whose body was removed from the mine late Wednesday.
   Joe Burleson, an administrative assistant for Cumberland Valley,
said the two other miners, Joe Ditty, 32, and Tony Osborne, 31, were
discovered late Wednesday night.
   Ditty, from Harlan, was a brother to the mine's co-owner, Stanley
Ditty, officials said. No hometowns were available for Bradburn and
Osborne.
   The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said 12 people
work on one shift, mining a 48-inch seam at the No. 2 mine, which
had no fatalities or serious injuries in 1988.
   State and federal officials said the mine had no violations
involving roof regulations in 1988.
   Kentucky reported only one roof-fall death last year, down from
15 in 1987.

<HEAD>First Cuban Troops Due Home Next Week, Castro Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro on Wednesday said
the first of 3,000 Cuban troops in Angola will return home Tuesday,
the official Prensa Latina news agency reported.
   Castro also warned that a plan to cut the number of U.N.
peacekeeping troops in neighboring Namibia would permit South Africa
to install a puppet government in that country, also known as
South-West Africa.
   ``We will fulfill our obligations before the first of April,''
Castro said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City. He was referring
to the deadline for the pullout of the first 3,000 Cuban troops from
Angola under a U.S.-brokered peace accord.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed a treaty Dec. 22 calling for
the withdrawal of the 50,000-strong Cuban force from Angola within
30 months, half of them by Nov. 1.
   Castro said a proposal to reduce the size of a U.N. peacekeeping
force in Namibia from 7,500 to 3,000 troops would enable South
Africa to maintain a powerbroker's role in Namibia and complicate
the Cuban pullout from Angola.
   ``Difficulties have arisen'' in enacting the accord ``for the
independence of Namibia, for which SWAPO has fought many years,
spilling the blood of many of its combatants,'' Castro said,
referring to the acronym for the South-West African Peoples
Organization nationalist movement.
   ``Taking into account the growth of the South African forces .. .
in Namibia, the reduced number of (U.N.) troops could not guarantee
these goals and would benefit South African plans to install a
titular government in the country,'' Castro declared. He said Cuba
had made its concerns known to the U.N. Security Council.
   Castro's complaints echoed those made by Sam Nujoma, leader of
SWAPO, earlier Wednesday in Havana, the Cuban capital.
   Castro suggested that other African nations, including Nigeria,
Ethiopia and Tanzania, contribute troops to the U.N. force, Prensa
Latina said.
   Cuba sent troops to Angola in 1975 to help the Marxist government
fight invading South African troops and U.S.-backed rebels of the
right-wing National Union of the Total Independence of Angola,
called UNITA.

here. She was 88.
   Mrs. Ryder was the widow of Melvin Ryder, who in 1940 founded the
Army Times, and she had been in the management of the company from
its inception. She had been chairman of the board since he died in
1979.
   The company, which became the Times Journal Co. in 1984, now
includes five suburban daily newspapers in the Washington area: the
Montgomery, Prince George's, Fairfax, Arlington and Alexandria
Journals, with a combined circulation of 150,000. It also includes
The Prince William Journal, a weekly with a circulation of 26,000,
and six semi-weekly newspapers in the suburban San Diego area.
   It is the largest publisher of military newspapers in the country
with the weeklies, Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force Times, Federal
Times and Defense News, and the monthly magazine, Military Market.
   Mrs. Ryder, a native of Bedford, Ohio, moved to the Washington

the late 1920s.
   Survivors include three children of her first marriage, William
Donnelly, Richard Donnelly and Sister Ann Donnelly, all of
Washington; three daughters of her second marriage, Susan Skaggs of
West Chester, Pa., Mary Jane Belber and Milly Ryder, both of
Washsington; 16 grandchildren and nine great grandchidren.

<HEAD>U.S. Planes Shoot Down Two Libyan MiGs Over Mediterranean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Navy jet fighters shot down two Libyan
MiG-23 jets Wednesday after the Americans were approached at high
speed in what Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci called ``a hostile
manner'' in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea.
   Carlucci said the two American F-14 Tomcat jets acted solely in
self-defense. Based on preliminary reports, the Soviet-built Libyan
jets activated their weapon-targeting radar before the U.S. jets
opened fire with their air-to-air missiles, he said.
   Carlucci denied that the jets, assigned to the aircraft carrier
USS John F. Kennedy, were airborne to participate in a military
strike on a disputed chemical weapons production plant inside Libya.
   President Reagan now oppposes a U.S. military strike against the
plant because it would cause an international furor that might harm
other U.S. interests, the Washington Post reported in Thursday's
editions.
   Carlucci said the carrier was only crossing the Mediterranean
toward a port call and conducting routine operations when the
incident occurred at midday local time, about 5 a.m. EST.
   The U.S. planes, each carrying two crewmen, returned without
incident to their carrier and were then flown to Naples, Italy, for
debriefing, Carlucci said. The fate of the two Libyan pilots
remained unclear, although he said ``two parachutes were sighted''
and a rescue helicopter was later seen in the area.
   It was the first military confrontation between the United States
and Libya since a U.S. bombing raid over Tripoli in 1986. That raid
came after the Reagan administration said it had conclusive evidence
that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was behind a terrorist bombing
attack in West Germany.
   Reagan, on vacation in Los Angeles, was awakened about an hour
after the downing and told of the incident by Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, his national security adviser, in a phone call, said White
House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   The spokesman said he had no information on Reagan's reaction,
except to say that the president ``considers the incident closed.''
   In Washington at a Pentagon briefing, Carlucci echoed that: ``We
now consider this matter closed.''
   Libya's Foreign Ministry called it a ``premeditated attack'' by
U.S. forces and said it would seek an emergency meeting of the U.N.
Security Council.
   President-elect Bush was told of the incident by phone at 6 a.m.
Wednesday by the White House situation room, according to
spokeswoman Sheila Tate. ``He's being kept informed'' throughout the
day, she added.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said
the U.S. jets were acting defensively and the Libyan planes ``had
maneuvered themselves into a position of attack _ and they did it on
two occasions.''
   ``That violates the rules of engagement that we have common
understanding on in the international environment,'' Nunn said.
``You cannot, in this day and time and modern technology, wait until
another plane has fired in order to defend yourself. It's too late
then.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the downing
appeared to be ``self-defense _ pure and simple.''
   Gadhafi ``never learns,'' Dole said. ``Maybe this time he will
finally get it straight: Whenever he threatens American forces, we
will defend ourselves.''
   Carlucci said the Libyan jets were ``shot down in self-defense by
American F-14s with air-to-air missiles.''
   The defense secretary said the MiGs ``were detected shortly after
they left Al Bumbah'' airfield and were tracked. The U.S. pilots, he
added, ``maneuvered to avoid the closing aircraft. They changed
speed, altitude and direction.
   ``The Libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner. At
about 14 miles, the U.S. section leader decided his aircraft was in
jeopardy and they could wait no longer. One MiG-23 was shot down
with a Sparrow missile. The second MiG was shot down by a Sidewinder
missile at six miles.''
   The incident occurred well off the Libyan coast in international
airspace, Carlucci said. The aircraft carrier was about 127 miles
north of Tobruk, Libya, while the two F-14s were about 70 miles
north of the coast.
   A Navy E-2C Hawkeye radar surveillance plane was airborne with
the two Tomcat fighters and monitored the action, said one Pentagon
official who asked not to be identified.
   ``It was all routine, until these guys (the Libyans) took off and
headed straight for the F-14s,'' the source added.
   ``Based on our current information ... the (U.S.) pilots
descended in altitude from approximately 15,000 feet to 4,000 feet
and they took some five different evasive actions,'' Carlucci said.
   ``Each time, the Libyan aircraft sought to put their nose on our
aircraft. They also accelerated. So the hostile intent seems to be
fairly clear,'' he said.
   Carlucci said there was ``some preliminary information that
radars were turned on.''
   In Rome, Libya's ambassador to Italy, Abdel Rahman Shalgam,
called Wednesday's incident ``a unilateral act'' and a dangerous
action. He declined to say how Libya would respond.
   The Libyan Foreign Ministry said that as ``Libyan reconnaissance
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters, U.S.
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them
down.''
   Libya's official JANA news agency said the Foreign Ministry
ordered its United Nations representative to ``present an urgent
complaint to the Security Council concerning the aggression
perpetrated by the U.S.A. against two Libyan reconnaissance planes
... and to demand the holding of an urgent Security Council meeting
on this subject.''
   Last month, in a television interview, Reagan said administration
officials had debated a military attack on a newly constructed plant
that Libya is preparing to produce chemical weapons, but added:
``That is a decision that has not been made yet.''
   Libya claims the plant will make pharmaceuticals, and Gadhafi has
charged the United States is using the allegations of chemical
weapon production as a pretext to attack his country.
   Carlucci insisted Wednesday the Kennedy and its air wing had no
designs on the chemical weapons plant.
   ``This has nothing whatsoever to do with all the speculation, and
if I may say, excessive speculation, that has existed'' on the
chemical plant, Carlucci said.
   ``If you were going to make an attack on the chemical plant, you
would not position your carrier some 600 miles away. I think that's
self evident.''

   Two masked men claiming to be Red Brigades terrorists
shot and wounded the assistant director of a prison after trying to
seize him, authorities said.
   Egidio de Luca was returning to his home near Tivoli, about 30
miles northeast of Rome, on Tuesday night the two men blocked his
path, police said.
   The assailants, armed with pistols, identified themselves as
members of the ``New Red Brigades of the Fighting Communist Party''
and tried to grab de Luca, they said. When he reached for his gun,
the men shot him in the thigh, police said. A bodyguard following de
Luca then started shooting at the assailants, who fled to a nearby
car and escaped.
   De Luca was hospitalized in Tivoli in serious condition, police
said.
   The Red Brigades, a collection of far-left terrorist groups, used
killing, kidnapping and ``knee-capping'' _ shooting someone in the
knee _ to try to destroy confidence in the Italian state during the
1970s and early 1980s.
   The group has greatly diminished in size in recent years.
   The Fighting Communist Party is a military wing of the Red
Brigades and, according to the Italian news agency AGI, the New Red
Brigades is a faction with about 100 members, most of them very
young.
   De Luca is assistant director of Rome's Rebibbia prison, which
holds 1,300 people and includes a maximum-security section that
holds terrorists, among others. De Luca is responsible for a section
with people accused of common crimes, AGI said.
   Employees of the prison in the past have been victims of Red
Brigades attacks. De Luca's home was firebombed in 1980, when he was
employed at the prisons office of the Justice Ministry, the Italian
news agency ANSA said. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The last Red Brigades killing was in April, when Sen. Roberto
Ruffilli was shot near his home in Forli in northern Italy.

   Ear-splitting military training flights
over this densely populated country became a major issue in West
Germany in 1988 because of a series of crashes, and opponents have
vowed to step up their campaign this year.
   ``This self-imposed threat from the skies must end. Our populated
areas must above all be safe,'' Erwin Horn, a federal lawmaker with
the opposition Social Democrats, said Tuesday.
   NATO pilots resumed tactical flights over West Germany on Tuesday
following a three-week moratorium in memory of the victims of a Dec.
8 crash of a U.S. military jet on the northern city of Remscheid.
Five West Germans and the U.S. pilot were killed.
   Critics insist on more than a moratorium and say they will step
up their pressure for NATO forces in West Germany to abandon
low-level training flights, in which planes fly at altitudes as low
as 250 feet.
   ``We want military low-level flights to stop permanently,'' said
Werner Mey, head of the nationwide protest group, ``Coordination of
Opponents of Low-Level Flights.''
   ``There will be a whole spectrum of (protest) actions this
year,'' Mey said in a telephone interview from his home in
Biebelnheim near Mainz.
   The screeching of NATO jets on low-flying training maneuvers is a
frequent occurrence in West Germany, where air bases are scattered
across the country. There are about 400,000 foreign NATO troops in
West Germany, more than half of them Americans.
   A series of military air crashes in 1988 has ignited widespread
opposition among the West German populace to NATO low-level training
flights.
   Politicians from the Social Democratic Party are among the most
vocal opponents of the flights, at times scolding the United States
and other NATO partners with warplanes here over the issue.
   ``I appeal to the Allies to stop their low-level flights _ and to
carry out these flights at home,'' said legislator Albrecht Mueller,
a Social Democrat.
   He said West Germany's NATO partners should not expect ``German
citizens to bear burdens that their own people are spared from.''
   The debate over whether to stop NATO low-level training flights
has been a divisive one.
   Polls indicate that nearly three-quarters of all West Germans
want the flights to stop.
   In fact, observers note it can be politically dangerous to
support low-level training flights.
   ``Whoever says `Let's reduce low-level flights' is certain of
meeting with approval,'' the respected daily Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung said in an editorial on Tuesday.
   Government officials, under public pressure, say they want
low-level flights reduced to a ``minimum.'' But they insist the
exercises are necessary for the proper training of NATO pilots
stationed in this country to offset possible threats from the East
bloc.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz has been targeted for harsh
criticism during the dispute.
   ``Perhaps a defense minister is needed with more experience and
more talent in balancing out military needs with citizens who are
tormented by ... military flights,'' the Munich newspaper Merkur
said in a commentary.
   The dispute over low-level jet training exercises is the central
issue of a larger debate _ often targeting the prominent U.S.
military presence _ over whether West Germans are truly masters of
their own land.
   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on Tuesday
published a story about what it called ``round-the-clock noise
terror'' from U.S. helicopter units based near Frankfurt.
   It said ``protests against the helicopter base at Bonames (near
Frankfurt) have never been as loud as they are now.''
   ``The U.S. Armed Forces have not appeared especially ready to
cooperate'' in reducing the noise at the base, the newspaper wrote.
   The U.S. government insists its military forces do nothing to
limit West German sovereignty or to go against the wishes of the
West German government.
   But many leftists have charged that conservative West German
officials wouldn't dare to thwart the will of U.S. military
officials.
   Horn, in a list of demands on the defense minister, said Tuesday
that ``German jurisprudence and German law should be put to use in
order to work against the loss of sovereignty through non-use.''
   The opposition party plans to begin a parliamentary initiative
this month to examine whether West Germany's sovereignty rights are
in jeopardy, and if so what can be done about it.

<HEAD>Government Reports A Record 662 Drug-Related Deaths In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Crime Office says 662
people died from drug abuse in West Germany last year, the highest
number of drug-related fatalities in the country's history.
   Volker Limburg, head of the office's narcotics division, said
Tuesday that the record death toll was in part attributable to the
unusually high purity of some of the heroin being sold illegally in
the country.
   He said most addicts are accustomed to a more diluted form of the
drug, and that the 60 percent purity mix circulating has increased
the risk of overdose.
   On the other hand, Limburg said, a sharp rise in impurities in
some drugs also contributed to the unusually high death toll.
Authorities have found gypsum, or plaster, being used to cut heroin
by some dealers, he said.
   Suicide through intentional overdosing was a third cause behind
the high death toll, which exceeded the 623 drug-related deaths in
1979, the previous record year, Limburg said.
   The average age of the victims was 28 and heroin was most
frequently the drug involved.

   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith will
honor Secretary of State George P. Shultz with its Klinghoffer Award
for combating terrorism.
   Shultz will receive the award in June during the league's annual
meeting of its national commission.
   The award is given by the league's Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer
Memorial Foundation, which was started after Leon Klinghoffer was
shot to death by Palestinian terrorists who seized the Italian
cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985.
   In a statement dated Friday, their children, Ilsa and Lisa
Klinghoffer, cited Shultz's ``courageous decision'' to deny
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat a visa to
address the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
   The statement did not mention Shultz's subsequent announcement
that established the first official American talks with the PLO.
   The Klinghoffer Award was given in 1987 to the British government
for breaking diplomatic relations with Syria after an attempted
bombing of an El Al jetliner from London in which Syria was
implicated. No award was given in 1988.

   Heavy rains have sent rivers over their

killed at least eight people and left 553 homeless, civil defense
officials say.
   Authorities said Tuesday that many coastal towns were isolated
because of blocked roads after several days of rain.
   The mudslides began late Friday and continued through Tuesday in
the mountains north of Caracas along the Caribbean, said Freddy
Paris, head of Venezuela's Civil Defense force. He said emergency
workers at the mudslides recovered eight dead over the weekend.
   Poor neighborhoods of shacks built along the banks of creeks
suffered the heaviest damage, with some homes swept away, Paris
said. So far, authorities have counted 126 houses destroyed and 247
severely damaged, Paris said Tuesday.
   Most of the homeless were being housed in temporary shelters and
in businesses in local towns.

entertaining a small group of relatives, lobbyists and other guests
at his swearing-in party Tuesday when a man entered who received
perhaps the most emotional greeting of all.
   ``I have a Xerox machine here,'' said the custodian, peering into
Machtley's Longworth House Office Building suite.
   ``Grab him. Take it,'' the congressman roared.
   Machtley could hardly be blamed for his desperation. The office
he inherited came with furniture but no typewriters, copying
machines or other equipment _ hardly the best way to get a running
start in the 101st Congress, but a common situation for newcomers.
   The Rhode Island Republican is one of just 33 freshmen in the
435-member House, but he comes to the job with more notoriety than
most. He was the only one of six challengers to defeat an incumbent
in November, and the only one to oust a committee chairman: Democrat
Fernand J. St Germain, who headed the House banking panel.
   Machtley _ pronounced MAKE-ly _ received his party's nomination
only after a favored rival failed to file his declaration of
candidacy in time for the primary.
   His surprising 56 percent to 44 percent victory over the 14-term
veteran St Germain came after the incumbent was battered with
renewed attention to allegations that he received favors from
lobbyists. Machtley had never before run for public office.
   ``I accept that I won't go down there and turn Congress
upside-down legislatively,'' the 40-year-old lawyer said last week
from his office in Newport, R.I. ``But I have the educational
background so that I'll do a good job.''
   Machtley, a Naval Academy graduate who went on to become an
attorney, defeated St Germain after a campaign in which he took
popular positions in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, such as
favoring a woman's right to abortion and reduced spending on
President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   On Tuesday, his victorious campaign bore fruit as he officially
took over as the congressman from Rhode Island's 1st Congressional
District.
   Actually, Machtley began savoring the perks of office even before
he was sworn in.
   ``Look, there's Cooter,'' he told his family during their walk to
the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol when he spied a fellow
newcomer, Rep. Ben Jones, a Georgia Democrat best known for his
portrayal on television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' of the good ole
boy Cooter. ``I've met him. He's a nice guy.''
   Machtley and his wife Kati, who for now are staying with their
two children at a local hotel, began their day working out in an
exercise room at 8 a.m.
   He was in his office an hour later, joined by a few family
members, including his wife, two children, parents and
mother-in-law. The group crossed the street to the Capitol to watch
a two-hour session of the House that culminated in members taking
the oath of office.
   ``It's a real big deal,'' concluded his 12-year-old daughter,
Erin.
   Then it was back to his Longworth office, where a small group of
lobbyists, staff and other lawmakers dined on cold cuts, soda, beer
and wine, and mingled with relatives who told of the days Machtley,
while in the Naval Academy, earned spare change by diving for balls
in golf course ponds, polishing them up and selling them.
   ``I was the one who had to clean them,'' said his younger sister,
Susan Carl.
   Above the din of the reception, Machtley juggled interviews with
Rhode Island reporters and posed for photographs with his family. It
was all interrupted by a strange series of loud buzzes, well-known
to the ears of Capitol Hill veterans.
   ``What is that?'' he asked his aides.
   It was the signal used to summon members to the House floor for a
vote.

   In their bid to win public support, Cuban
authorities not only extol the virtues of socialism but also
frequently use ridicule to try to discredit the purported evils of
capitalism.
   The other day, the Cuban Communist Party daily newspaper Granma
cited some of the ``horror'' toys sold during the Christmas season
in the United States as examples of the crude excesses of capitalism.
   The article mentioned dolls that spew green vomit when squeezed
and toy monsters with removable organs soaked in fake blood.
   In addition, the commentary said, there are ``other objects so
incredible and abominable that the most elemental good taste
prevents their description in a newspaper.
   ``What can be expected from that country where private property
and the quest for profits are sacred and untouchable?'' the
commentary asked.
   Variations on the same theme accompany the rhetoric of President
Fidel Castro in his defense of the Cuban system.
   Castro has been especially strident lately. He seems to sense
that with the reformist trend in the Soviet Union and other
Communist countries, few of those countries' leaders are speaking
out for ideological purity.
   ``Socialism or death, Marxism-Leninism or death,'' the president
said Sunday night on the 30th anniversary of the revolution that
ousted rightist dictator Fulgencio Batista and swept Castro to power.
   As Cuban officials see it, to dilute the socialist ethic would
open the way to such capitalist ills as drug abuse and the AIDS
epidemic.
   Cuba's socialist model faces immense problems, ranging from
chronic product shortages to shoddy goods, but Castro still likes to
compare revolutionary Cuba with the U.S.-dominated pre-revolutionary
era.
   He says 100,000 Cuban women were involved in prostitution during
the 1950s and gambling casinos siphoned off the meager income of
workers, often leaving their children unfed.
   The old system, he says, left 80 per cent of the Cuban people
semiliterate. Now, he says, virtually every worker is highly
literate and politically aware.
   The United States now has the literacy problem, he says. He adds
that even a simple task like getting on the right bus can thwart
some Americans because they can't read the route signs.
   Capitalist societies, says Castro, are marked by ``consumer
anxiety'' and the quest for profit _ not by a ``zeal for resolving
mankind's problems.''
   Castro says he believes that under capitalism, people start to
believe they are entitled to more than they really need.
   To make the point, he sometimes resorts to exaggeration:
   ``When somebody has enough to dress himself nicely, he wants to
change clothes every day,'' he says. ``When he can change clothes
every day, he wants to change in the morning, at noon and in the
afternoon and before going to bed also. This is the system that
governs capitalist societies.''
   These types of ``crazy luxuries,'' Castro says, are common in
rich countries that pillage poor ones.
   At home, Castro has eased up a bit on some practices associated
with capitalism. Tipping, for example, is now tolerated. Officials
also allow moonlighting by carpenters and other skilled workers.
   But two years ago, Castro acted decisively against what he
regarded as more dangerous forms of capitalist penetration. He
discovered, for example, that some Cubans were making huge sums off
a 6-year-old experiment under which farmers sold a portion of their
goods at market rates.
   Castro abolished the program. He said some enterprising Cubans
were making 20 times more than a Cuban doctor who performs heart
transplants.

   Golfers entering the ``Arctic Open'' might
get a few extra yards of skid on their drives and they certainly
won't have to worry about a water hazard: They'll be playing on top
of one.
   The Jan. 28-29 open will be played on the frozen fairways of
Wehrspann Lake at the Chalco Hills Recreation Area. A nine-hole golf
course has been laid out on the lake.
   The Omaha Suburban Rotary Club hopes the tournament will raise
$20,000 for scholarships for handicapped high school students, said
club member Lyle Sapp. Anything more will be used to help the
homeless, Meals on Wheels program, and the Henry Doorly Zoo, he said.
   The tournament will benefit wildlife, too.
   When the ice melts, discarded Christmas trees, which will set the
fairway borders, will sink into the lake to provide habitat for fish
and other aquatic species.

   Meet ERL and FRED, two new wild and crazy
acronyms that are rolling off the tongues of state officials like
winter fog off Puget Sound.
   ERL stands for ``essential requirement level,'' that is: the
amount of money absolutely needed to pay for state government.
   FRED, who has far less status on the Capitol Campus than ERL, is
short for ``fraud early detection'' of welfare chiselers, one of
Gov. Booth Gardner's many programs that are supposed to save money
eventually.
   ERL and FRED are two new creations of state government
word-manglers, who are busy mangling as usual, especially when talk
turns to taxing and spending. This year, they've added a few new
ones to the idiom of Washington's capital.
   Along with ERL and FRED, ``Budget Driver'' is roaming the halls
of the Legislature and skidding across budget documents. Clearly,
FRED could be one of Budget Driver's many passengers this year while
ERL would supply the fuel.
   A Budget Driver, by the way, is defined as any major demand on
the state treasury that is growing due to factors beyond anybody's
control, like population growth.

   Resolutions for a skinny new year were taken
seriously by more than 30 people who attended a clinic at the
University of Illinois Physicians Office.
   The clinic offered a free body analysis to people willing to hook
themselves up to electrodes on Tuesday.
   The participants, ranging from age 20 to 60, allowed doctors to
apply metallic tape and clips to a hand and a foot so they could
measure their body fat.
   ``A lot of people make a vow to themselves at the beginning of
the year to lose weight, and especially coming off the holidays,''
said Mike Maggio, spokesman for the University of Illinois Hospital.
   ``It's a time for New Year's resolutions ... and coming off the
goodies,'' Maggio said.
   The electrodes send electric currents through the skin to measure
the amount of tissue resistance, said Dr. Georgia Andrianopoulos, a
director of the program.
   Because fat tissue conducts less than muscle tissue, doctors can
use the electrodes to calculate the percentage of body fat. They
also can determine the number of calories a person should consume to
lower the fat ratio.
   But does it hurt?
   ``Not at all,'' said Pam Gaidelis, 23, one of those who waited in
line. ``I was kind of scared seeing all the electrodes, but you
can't feel anything.''
   Ms. Gaidelis said she already lost 40 pounds on her own through
diet and exercise, but is looking for a way to keep the fat off.

   Hollywood legend Bette Davis says
disagreements with the director forced her to flee the set of her
latest film, ``Wicked Stepmother,'' for ``the good of my future
career.''
   The 80-year-old actress said director Larry Cohen was
unresponsive to her suggestions and unwilling to make changes. After
one week of filming, she flew to New York where she stayed for
several weeks, recuperating from dental surgery. But she decided not
to return.
   ``He never rehearses actors,'' she complained in Tuesday's
editions of the Los Angeles Times. ``He just rehearses the camera.
So we work for the camera. I was very uncomfortable in all the
scenes he had me play in that week.''
   ``People will be horrified at the footage on me,'' Miss Davis
said. ``I think that for the good of my future career I honestly had
no choice'' but to go public with the story.
   Cohen called Miss Davis a ``wonderful'' woman and dismissed the
criticisms, saying the cast spent hours rehearsing at his home.

   Actress Jane Seymour says she's sticking her
neck out by allowing her son and daughter to play the children of
Marie Antoinette because the movie in which she portrays the French
queen is ``extraordinary.''
   In a deal with the producers, Miss Seymour said Tuesday, she
secured roles for her daughter, Katie, 6, and son Sean, 3, as Louis
Charles and Marie Therese, who were imprisoned with their mother.
   ``I would normally keep my children away from this kind of thing.
If it was a sit-com or a weekly series, I would never let them do
it,'' the actress said.
   ``But this is something extraordinary and historic. It's a huge
definitive version of the French Revolution and provides them with a
marvelous opportunity to learn a little French and understand the
history, too,'' Miss Seymour said from her home in Bath.
   She gave no details of the deal with the producers.
   The film in French and English, tentatively called ``The French
Revolution,'' will be shot in Paris and Versailles for release in
October to mark this year's bicentennial of the French Revolution.
Marie Antoinette and her husband, King Louis XVI, were sent to the
guillotine in 1793.
   Miss Seymour starred in the ABC-TV miniseries ``War and
Remembrance'' and last year played the Duchess of Windsor and opera
diva Maria Callas.

   Physicians who treat women are being enlisted
in a nationwide effort to aid battered women and help break a
generational cycle that has caught some American families in a web
of violence.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is
sending information to its 28,000 members to heighten their
awareness of the problem of domestic violence and better enable them
to help abused women.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who joined the group for its
announcement of the campaign Tuesday, said stopping violence against
women is a major part of the effort to end family violence, a cycle
that often begins when someone is the victim of abuse and then grows
up to become an abuser.
   ``It's obvious that if you're going to break that chain ...
you've got to start with child abuse,'' Koop said. ``But you can't
just wait for the three generations to work themselves out. You've
got to take care of the elderly abused and you've got to take care
of the battered women.''
   The physicians' campaign is aimed at the estimated 15 million
women who have been beaten, raped or suffered other forms of
physical and sexual assault, a total that Koop says grows by 1
million a year.
   ``It is an overwhelming moral, economic and public health burden
that our society can no longer bear,'' Koop said. ``In this country,
no man has a license to beat, and get away with it. And no woman is
obliged to accept a beating, and suffer because of it.''
   Koop noted that help is available from state and national
coalitions and social service organizations, law enforcement
agencies and the courts, and he encouraged doctors to become part of
the crusade against violence.
   ``We say we are a civilized society,'' Koop said. ``All right,
let's act like one and let's stop the violence in our families and
let's end the battering of women in this country.''
   Koop said, however, he did not advocate mandatory reporting by
doctors of abused women. Such reporting, he said, could further harm
a woman by prompting retaliation against her or her children at a
time when she may not have the financial means to leave her home.
   The pamphlets and bulletins the group is sending to its members
outline the physical signs of abuse and suggest to doctors how to
discuss the problem with women who have been abused. The written
material includes information about women's legal rights, social
services that are available to women and strategies for helping
women escape from abusive situations.
   ``We are providing physicians with the tools they can use to help
women escape from such a relationship,'' said Luella Klein, a former
president of the physicians' association. ``We don't expect ob-gyns
always to treat the pathology of battering, but we expect them to
tell women what their rights are under the law and advise a woman
how to plan for dealing with her abusive partner.''
   Women who have been abused will often have injuries on their
head, face, neck, chest, abdomen, breast or arms, she said. Women
who are abused when they are pregnant often have abdominal and
breast injuries, she added.
   The doctors are also advised that abused women often complain
about headaches, insomnia, choking sensations and stomach, chest,
pelvic and back pains, she said. These women, she added, may appear
shy, frightened, embarrassed, evasive, anxious or passive, and often
cry.

   A man recently paroled from prison grabbed
about 15 hostages in a restaurant Tuesday night and was shot and
taken into custody after killing one hostage and wounding at least
two other people, police said.
   When the shootout ended at about 9 p.m., a waitress in her 40s
was dead and the gunman was in critical condition, police said.
   Police Officer Joe Berdin and Larimer County Sheriff's Deputy J.
Hirokawa were brought to McKee Medical Center with gunshot wounds to
the arms, hospital officials said.
   The trouble began just before 7 p.m. when police responded to a
disturbance call at the house of the suspect's girlfriend, who had
been assaulted, police Sgt. Ray Miller said.
   The woman told police the man had gone home, and when police went
there, he opened fire on them, wounding Hirokawa, Miller said.
   Police then chased the man to the nearby Riverhouse Restaurant,
where he took about 15 people hostage, Miller said.
   Police were negotiating with the man by megaphone when he began
shooting at about 9 p.m. Miller said the suspect was asking for a
plane to fly him to Libya.
   Miller said the suspect, in his early 30s, had recently been
paroled from prison, where he served time for a cocaine distribution
charge.

   Backers of the Equal Rights Amendment made it
the first order of business for the new Congress but say the real
battleground for its adoption is in the state legislatures where it
died in 1982.
   ``Our foremothers never gave up on the right to vote until we

   ``We are certainly not giving up,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,

the ERA as House Joint Resolution 1 before the new Congress as it
convened on Tuesday.
   Yard said the campaign for passage would concentrate on state
legislatures, where she said women would need to control one-third
of the seats, about twice the share they now hold, to ensure the
measure's ratification.
   ``It's shocking to me that on the 200th anniversary of the
Constitution, women are still not in it,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., said.
   The nation celebrated the bicentennial of the signing and
ratification of the Constitution in 1987 and 1988.
   The Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit sex
discrimination, came closest to passage nearly seven years ago,
having been approved by Congress and 35 state legislatures. The
proposed amendment still needed approval by three more state
legislatures when time for its ratification expired on June 30, 1982.
   It was re-introduced in Congress in 1983, 1985 and 1987 but did
not win the two-thirds support needed to be submitted to the states
again. The Republican Party has withdrawn its support for the
proposed amendment. And President-elect Bush, who once supported the
ERA, also has changed his mind.
   But Yard said she remained hopeful that such a proposal would be
adopted before the end of the century.
   Edwards said he was encouraged by the number of co-sponsors of
the proposal, but said he did not know whether it would make it
through Congress this time.

   Former White House chief of staff Donald Regan,
in a parting shot at President Reagan, says he hopes President-elect
Bush ``has learned from Reagan's shortcomings.''
   In a paperback re-issue of his insider book, ``For The Record,''
due to be published Feb. 1, Regan praised Bush while inveighing
oncemore against the management style of his former boss.
   While saying he felt confident that Bush had learned from
Reagan's successes, Regan said he hoped the president-elect ``has
learned from Reagan's shortcomings _ his baffling reluctance to give
orders, or even guidance, to his close subordinates, and the
tendency to permit some of his advisers to manage the presidency for
effect rather than for results.''
   The re-issue of Regan's book is scheduled to hit the newsstands
and bookstores on Feb. 1. Bush assumes the presidency on Jan. 20.
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman at Bush's transition headquarters
here, said that ``to my knowledge, he (Bush) has not solicited
advice from Donald Regan. I do believe they have always had a
cordial relationship.''
   A source in the Bush transition office, declining to be named
publicly, said that Bush has not spoken with Regan except during a
chance encounter at Burning Tree Country Club, a suburban Maryland
golf course.
   The initial publication of Regan's book last spring caused a stir
in Washington, as the former White House chief of staff depicted
Reagan as a laid-back president who had difficulty making decisions
and who didn't work hard.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, denounced Regan for telling the
insider stories. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater labeled
Regan's work ``a kiss-and-tell story in the mold of all books that
seek to exploit the presidency or the first family for personal
self-interest.''
   During a question-and-answer session on Dec. 16 with students at
the University of Virginia, Reagan quipped at one point that
``somebody's talking to me about doing a book, and there are some
backstage stories that I might enjoy getting out.''
   In the new chapter that Regan added to the re-issue of his book,
published by St. Martin's Press, Inc., in New York, the former chief
of staff also wrote that:
   _Bush ``cannot survive politically'' if he reneges on his
campaign promise to oppose increases in tax rates to cope with the
federal budget deficit.
   _Bush ``is no protectionist'' and predicted that the
president-elect will ``work to open markets abroad.''
   _Bush will ``almost certainly face the necessity of dealing with
a recession,'' perhaps in Bush's first term.
   ``As long as he listens to his own instincts, and to the voice of
his own experience, the American people will be well-served,'' Regan
said.
   He said that Bush ``must bring the White House's relationship
with the news media under control, so that he and his people spend
the greater part of their time dealing with the reality of the
nation's problems, rather than catering to the natural tendency of
the media to transform the presidency into entertainment.''
   Bush, in fact, signaled last month that he will not follow
Reagan's practice of allowing reporters to ask questions during
White House picture-taking sessions with visiting foreign leaders.

<HEAD>Foreign Ads Appear in Soviet Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Glasnost brought a little more color into the lives
of Soviet newspaper readers as Izvestia heralded with a front-page
splash of green the opening of its pages to foreign advertisers.
   For decades, the same government daily had railed against
capitalism in small, gray type. Now, it was introducing the Western
sales pitch.
   ``French perfumes, French wines and the French effort to find
comfort have been well-known to you for a long time,'' proclaimed
Pechiney, a French firm that bought all of page five in Tuesday's
ground-breaking edition. ``Now you have a chance to get more closely
acquainted with industrial France,''
   In a front-page announcement, Izvestia said the two pages of ads
from European and U.S. companies were the first in a weekly effort
``to give Western businessmen the possibility to enter into direct
dialogue with future Soviet partners who are trying to set up
contacts with the foreign market.''
   West Germany's Dresdner Bank, the first Western bank to open an
office in Moscow in 1973, had a quarter of page six with a green
stripe matching the splash of green on the eight-page paper's front.
   The ads represent a sharp turnabout for the central press. Soviet
newspapers usually consist of four to six broad sheets of small type
crammed from top to bottom of each page. They have not accepted any
advertising.
   In recent years, newspapers such as Moscow News, which is at the
forefront of Gorbachev's drive for greater openness and
restructuring Soviet society, have begun publishing occasional ads
for state-run enterprises.
   In announcing an agreement Oct. 15 to cooperate on the
advertising project with West Germany's Burda magazine, Izvestia
called advertising the ``engine of trade.''
   State-run enterprises are freer under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms to buy and sell on the world market in order to
attract new technology. But Izvestia said they needed an open
exchange of information with foreign firms.
   ``There are completely new problems for us,'' the paper said.
``One of them, and by far not the last, is business information.''
   Karl Schlue, Moscow representative of the Dresdner Bank, said he
did not know precisely how much the advertising cost, but that a
full page was about $50,000. Payment is in hard currency, which the
average Soviet cannot possess legally.
   Schlue said it was difficult to anticipate how often his company
would advertise, or what kind of results it expected.
   Other advertisers Tuesday included Armand Hammer's Occidental
Petroleum, Monsanto, and the Munich-based Mann firm. Most of the
firms have permanent representatives in Moscow, and Pechiney
provided information about its joint project to build an aluminum
factory in Soviet Armenia.
   The foreign ads in Izvestia almost exclusively explained the
companies' business in simple type with few illustrations. There was
no change in the format of the rest of the paper.
   Izvestia said that for the time being, the advertising will be
carried once a week in papers distributed in Moscow and abroad. That
will make up not less than 600,000 of the paper's total distribution
of about 9 million copies.
   It said the advertising would stress industrial and scientific
products to help bolster the Soviet economy, rather than foreign
consumer goods that are not for sale in the Soviet Union and cannot
be purchased with consumers' non-convertible rubles.
   State-run firms also are free to advertise on Izvestia's pages,
and one placed an ad in Tuesday's edition.
   The Hydromechanization Trust of the Ministry of Energy and
Electrification said it was prepared to work together with foreign
companies on industrial projects across the Soviet Union.
   But ads for Aeroflot, the state-run airline, or items in constant
deficit such as toothpaste and tights will not appear, Izvestia said
in the Oct. 15 edition. Nor, it said, will ads for the ``latest
model of Mercedes, suits by Cardin, or invitations to vacation in
Fiji.''

<HEAD>Secrecy Issues Again Threatening To Delay North Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massive amount of classified information
pervading the Iran-Contra case is threatening again to delay this
month's scheduled start of former presidential aide Oliver L.
North's criminal trial.
   A federal appeals court Tuesday temporarily stayed pre-trial
review of North's plans to divulge classified information when his
lawyers question high government officials in open court.
   And the federal judge in the case, Gerhard A. Gesell, on Tuesday
turned down a request to further censor classified documents
prosecutors want to use as evidence to accommodate objections of
intelligence agencies.
   The decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here to
consider North's motion to permanently bar Gesell from giving
prosecutors a summary of the proposed defense testimony could force
a delay in the trial, now set for Jan. 31.
   North is charged along with former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord
with conspiring to illegally divert more than $14 million in
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The three-judge appeals panel issued an indefinite
``administrative stay'' of Gesell's plan to give independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh the 162-page defense summary while it considers
what the defense called ``grave constitutional issues'' involving
North's right to a fair trial.
   Gesell, meanwhile, refused Walsh's request to make more editing
changes in the 300 prosecution exhibits.
   U.S. intelligence agencies are concerned that sensitive
references in the documents that cover some 3,000 pages could
disclose covert operations or secret dealings with foreign nations.
   A ranking administration official said it was too early to assess
the full impact of Gesell's ruling on the case against North.
   But Gesell's latest decision was a fresh reminder that government
refusal to disclose certain classified information at trial could
scuttle major charges against the former White House aide.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the attorney
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security.
   The administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the decision did not spell the end of the case against North
but it could bar Walsh from using some of the documents as evidence.
   Gesell, for instance, is insisting that the names of Israel, Iran
and the Central American nations appear in any document despite a
government proposal to refer to each nation by a letter.
   This procedure was used during the 1987 congressional Iran-Contra
hearings, even though the true identities of the countries quickly
became an open secret.
   Gesell is known to have raised concerns at the CIA and other
agencies about his insistence that government reports be quoted
verbatim with only a few modifications to protect sources and
methods of intelligence gathering.
   Walsh's request for a modification of Gesell's Dec. 12 order was
filed under court seal Dec. 22 after the independent counsel had
conferred with the White House and an interagency task force that is
reviewing the classified information at issue.
   North contends that Gesell's decision to let Walsh look at the
summary of his defense strategy will give prosecutors an unfair
advantage before the case goes to trial.
   Lawyers for the former National Security Council aide described
the document in court papers as ``a detailed road map to the defense
case.''
   ``Never has a criminal defendant been compelled to disclose _
before the prosecution has called its first witness _ the details of
proposed defense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issue
in this case,'' the defense said in papers filed Tuesday.
   Gesell had proposed to give Walsh the summary by Tuesday
afternoon, barring intervention from the appeals court. The case
before Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, James Buckley and David
Sentelle is one of several issues that could delay the proceeding.
   Also looming on the horizon is North's attempt to subpoena
President Reagan and Vice President Bush to testify as witnesses.
Justice Department officials said Tuesday that a motion to quash the
subpoenas could be filed by week's end.
   The government is expected to resist the subpoenas based on the
principle of separation of powers, executive privilege and the need
to protect classified information.
   North, meanwhile, has subpoenaed other administration officials,
notably Secretary of State George Shultz and several of his top
aides, including Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams,
Undersecretary Michael H. Armacost, legal adviser Abraham Sofaer and
M. Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant.

<HEAD>North Tactic Revives Old Debate: Can A President Be Forced To Testify?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effort by Oliver North to compel President
Reagan and President-elect Bush to testify at his Iran-Contra trial
has renewed a debate, almost as old as the Union, over ``executive
privilege.''
   Can a president, or a former one, be forced to testify in a legal
case? Courts have provided little guidance, but constitutional
experts said Tuesday that North's legal tactic may succeed.
   No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal
trial, but several have provided testimony or what might be
considered the equivalent.
   The personal stakes are high for North. The former White House
aide is charged with theft, conspiracy to defraud the government and
several other felonies in the case involving the support of
Nicaraguan rebels with money from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.
   His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 31 _ just 11 days after Bush
is to succeed Reagan. Besides Reagan and Bush, subpoenas also have
been issued for other key figures in the Reagan administration,
including Secretary of State George P. Shultz and four other State
Department officials.
   The man who first tried to force a president to testify was Aaron
Burr, a former vice president who stood trial in 1807 on charges of
treason.
   Burr sought to force Thomas Jefferson, the president under whom
he had served, to testify at the trial.
   Jefferson resisted. But Chief Justice John Marshall, presiding
over the trial, ruled against Jefferson. The president eventually
avoided having to appear by releasing some information Burr had
sought.
   The closest the Supreme Court has come to ruling on the issue
presented by North's subpoena came in the Watergate tapes decision
of 1974, in a case called Nixon vs. U.S.
   The court then ruled, 8-0, that President Richard M. Nixon had to
comply with a special prosecutor's subpoena seeking the surrender of
White House tape recordings.
   ``The general assertion of privilege must yield to the
demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal
trial,'' the high court ruled 15 years ago.
   Jerome Barron, a law professor at George Washington University
here, said Tuesday the 1974 decision is a strong precedent for North.
   ``Whether Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush can be subpoenaed was resolved
in Nixon vs. U.S., and the answer is yes,'' Barron said.
   ``If the evidence (sought by North) is material, I think Reagan
and Bush can be required to appear,'' Barron said.
   On the other hand, unnamed Justice Department sources were quoted
by The Washington Post as saying that Nixon vs. U.S. offers support
for fighting subpoenas of Reagan and Bush. They said the Supreme
Court emphasized that its Watergate-tapes decision did not deal with
a claim of privilege based on national security grounds.
   Justice Department and White House officials have said they will
try to have the subpoenas thrown out.
   Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who once served as general
counsel to the House of Representatives, said North may succeed.
   ``My sense is North has a good claim. The president was involved
in the process, and one of North's defenses is that he was serving
the president by following orders,'' Brand said.
   In 1975, then-President Gerald R. Ford gave a videotaped
deposition in the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who was
convicted of trying to assassinate Ford. The videotape was played
for jurors at Fromme's trial.
   While in office, President Jimmy Carter provided videotaped
testimony in two criminal prosecutions.

<HEAD>Historical Odds Are Against Successful Dukakis Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Memo to Michael Dukakis: If you're thinking of
making another run at the presidency in 1992, check the record. Only
once in this century has a defeated presidential nominee won the
office on his second try.
   That one was Richard Nixon.
   Dukakis announced in Boston Tuesday that he won't try for a
fourth term as governor of Massachusetts when this one ends in 1990.
He did not drop the other shoe: whether he will make another run at
the presidency or, on the other extreme, get out of politics
altogether.
   He acknowledged, however, that ``it is very difficult to run for
the presidency as an incumbent governor.''
   Dukakis would have plenty of company among presidential aspirants
who subscribe to the ``if at first you don't succeed ...'' school of
politics. The record is fat with candidates of the Harold Stassen
stripe who don't take a dearth of votes for a hint.
   Ronald Reagan sought the Republican party's presidential
nomination in 1968, 1972 and 1976 before finally getting it in 1980;
George Bush had tried in 1980, too.
   But when a candidate gets the nomination and then loses, his
party is loath to let him try again. The modern exceptions are
William Jennings Bryan who was nominated three times _ twice in this
century _ Thomas Dewey and Adlai Stevenson. There were boomlets for
a third nomination for Dewey in 1952 and Stevenson in 1960, but they
came to nought.
   After serving twice as vice president in the Dwight Eisenhower
administration, Nixon ran and lost in 1960 against John F. Kennedy.
He spent a good part of the next eight years collecting Republican
IOUs with almost ceaseless speechmaking and was nominated again in
1968.
   Losing a presidential election is more often than not a fast
slide into political oblivion for the candidate.
   Gerald Ford, who became vice president and then president without
benefit of elections, tried for a full term on his own and was
defeated by Jimmy Carter in 1976. He remains one of the most visible
former presidents because of his affinity for celebrity golf
tournaments. Ford also turned into a one-man corporation, lending
his name to boards of directors, lecturing for fees of $15,000 and
more, entering into a partnership to buy radio stations and
receiving $1 million for his memoirs.
   Carter was defeated after his one term by Reagan. He moved back
to Plains, Ga., but not as a peanut farmer. Instead, he took up
woodworking, traveling, meeting with world leaders, climbing Mount
Kilimanjaro, becoming a visiting professor at Emory University and
devoting time to the Carter Presidential Center where he hosts
international conferences.
   Walter Mondale's disappearance from the spotlight has been so
complete that Democrats rarely mention the man who lost to Reagan in
a 1984 landslide.
   ``Oh, I miss it a little,'' Mondale said in Atlanta during the
Democratic National Convention last summer, but added: ``You know, I
had my say, and I don't miss the 18-hour days.''
   Mondale practices law in Washington and Minneapolis and there's
been some talk _ not from him _ that he may try to reclaim his
Senate seat from Minnesota in 1990.
   Barry Goldwater, defeated by Lyndon Johnson in 1964, cooled his
political heels for four years, then was re-elected to the Senate
without the seniority he had built up in the previous two terms.
   Hubert Humphrey, who had been vice president for four years when
he lost to Nixon in 1968, spent a little while as a professor at
Macalester College and the University of Minnesota, then won back
his Senate seat in 1970. He ran again for the Democratic nomination
in 1972 but withdrew in the face of overwhelming odds at the party's
convention. He died of cancer in 1978.
   McGovern, the South Dakota senator who won the 1972 nomination
but lost to Nixon, stayed in the Senate until 1980 when he lost his
seat. He made a third try for the presidency in 1984 in a primary
campaign that lasted less than six months before he dropped out.
   The other presidential losers took their lumps and started anew.
   After his second consecutive defeat for president, in 1948, Dewey
said,``I have been graduated at a comparatively early age to the
role of elder statesman, which someone has aptly defined as a
politician who is no longer a candidate for any office.''
   A year later he wrote a friend: ``Nothing could arise now or in
the future that would lead me to be the nominee of our party in
1952. My decision on this matter is as certain and final as death
and the staggering New Deal taxes.''
   After more such disclaimers, he ran in 1950 for his third term as
governor of New York and won. Dewey died in 1971.
   Stevenson, the eloquent but reluctant Democratic candidate in
1952 and 1956, was appointed by President Kennedy to be U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, a post he held until his death in
1965.
   When he lost the second time, Stevenson recalled the Lincoln line
that he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark:
``Too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh.''

   Crying ``Let me stay with my
mommy, please!'' 12-year-old Ximena Vicario was wrested from the
woman who took her in as an infant, knowing that the girl's real
mother was likely killed by security forces.
   The wrenching scene Tuesday, replayed on afternoon and evening
television newscasts, dredged up bitter memories of the eight-year
military dictatorship that ended in 1983.
   During those years, at least 8,960 Argentines were arrested and
presumed killed as part of a brutal crackdown on leftist subversion.
   Ximena's parents, Juan Carlos Vicario and Stella Maris Gallichio
de Vicario, were arrested in February 1977 and never seen again.
They ``disappeared,'' as Argentines say.
   Then about eight months old, Ximena was handed over to a state
orphanage where Susana Siciliano worked. An identity tag stated the
baby's name, and said she was the daughter of a subversive,
according to court records.
   Ms. Siciliano took the baby home and renamed her Romina Paola. In
1981, she legally adopted the child.
   Three years later, Darwinia Rosa Monaco de Gallichio found out
what had happened to her granddaughter and began legal proceedings
to get her back.
   She was supported in her efforts by the human rights group
Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, which estimates that about 300
babies were born in or taken along with their mothers to clandestine
detention centers, and put up for adoption after the mothers were
killed.
   The group has helped reunite about 50 children with their
biological families.
   A federal appeals court ruled recently that Ms. Siciliano must
give up the child. Police took her and Ximena to court Tuesday,
where Federal Judge Juan Fegoli gave the girl to her grandmother
after more than seven hours of talks with both sides and with
psychologists.
   ``They took away my daughter,'' Ms. Siciliano cried as she walked
out of Fegoli's office.
   Ximena, dark-haired and teary-eyed, told reporters, ``I don't
want them to take me from my home, or put me on a program of visits
wtih obligatory hours and dates, like the children of separated
parents have.''
   ``I'm content to have another grandmother ... I want my
grandmother to come and see me every time she wants,'' but at the
house of Ms. Siciliano, she said. ``I'm going to escape if they take
me away.''
   Mrs. Gallichio lives in Rosario, 190 miles from Buenos Aires.
   Ms. Siciliano knew Ximena's background from the start, and hid
those facts when she applied for adoption, court records show. Ms.
Siciliano, who had said Ximena had been abandoned by her maid, faces
charges of abduction of a minor and falsification of records.
   An attorney for Ms. Siciliano said she will appeal Ximena's
custody to the Supreme Court.
   Ximena's case reminded many of ``El Caso Juliana,'' or ``The
Juliana Case,'' that in its own way tightened heartstrings across
this South American country several months ago.
   Juliana Trevino, 10, at first was ordered taken from her adoptive
parents, and then returned. Jose and Carmen Trevino never hid the
child's background, suspected she might have been the daughter of a
``disappeared'' couple, adopted her legally and worked with human
rights groups to establish her identity.
   Ximena's case is much more typical, and calls to mind the 1986
Oscar-winning movie ``The Official Story,'' in which an Argentine
family adopts the daughter of a couple executed by police.

<HEAD>President To Undergo Surgery For Hand Ailment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will undergo surgery in
Washington Saturday for a long-standing and worsening condition that
causes the ring finger of his left hand to bend inward and resist
straightening.
   The president will enter Walter Reed Army Hospital on Friday and
is expected to return to the White House on Sunday, Dr. John Hutton,
the White House physician, announced Tuesday.
   Hutton said the president will be operated on for a disease known
as Dupuytren's contracture.
   ``This procedure should not interrupt his normal schedule, other
than the obvious presence of a dressing on the left hand,'' the
doctor said.
   ``The president's contracture was minimal but present when he
took office in 1981, and has been followed over the past eight
years,'' he said. ``Within the past year, it has progressed to the
degree that surgical therapy is now necessary.''
   He said the surgery is expected to take two to three hours. The
president's arm will be put to sleep, but no general anaesthetic is
planned, he said.
   Dr. Charles Lane, a hand specialist in private practice in
Beverly Hills, said the cause of Dupuytren's contracture is not
known.
   The disease is named for a French surgeon and anatomist who
described it in 1833.
   It strikes men more often than women, but as many as one in every
five people over age 60 are likely to be afflicted with it,
according to information provided by the hand surgery section of the
orthopedic department at Walter Reed. Reagan is 77.
   ``It pulls the finger down so the finger can't be straightened,''
Lane said. ``So the finger gets in the way, particularly for such
things _ which might be a problem for Mr. Reagan _ as shaking
hands.''
   ``Also, it's hard when you shave and try to get your hand in your
pockets,'' he said.
   The curving of the fingers is caused by thickening of the gristle
below the skin, Lane said.
   He said the operation, although delicate, is not particularly
risky.
   The president and first lady are to fly to the White House on
Thursday after two weeks of relaxing at their new Bel Air home in
Los Angeles and visiting friends in Palm Springs.
   It will be Reagan's first surgery since he had an operation for
an enlarged prostate in January 1987. He also underwent surgery in
July 1985 for cancer of the colon and has been operated on for skin
cancer.
   In the past, Reagan has gone to Bethesda Naval Hospital, in the
Maryland suburbs just outside Washington.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Walter
Reed was chosen because the doctors who would do the operation were
located there.
   Hutton said the physicians involved would be Dr. George Bogumill
of George Town University, a consultant at Walter Reed; Col. Alan
Smith and Maj. Paul Perlik of the Hand Service at Walter Reed; and
himself.
   The anesthesiologist will be Lt. Col. Charles Gandy. Lt. Col.
Lawrence Mohr of the White House Medical Unit and members of the
Department of Medicine at Walter Reed will take part as consultants.
   The procedure is scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m. EST. Hutton said
the president is expected to be walking around by afternoon.

<HEAD>One Thousand Guests Due For Reagan Fund Raiser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 1,000 guests, paying $1,000 to
$2,500 a plate to dine with President and Mrs. Reagan, will feast on
lobster, veal, truffles and duck tonight at a fund-raising event for
the Nancy Reagan Center for teen-aged drug abusers.
   The event, billed as the only welcome home party to be held for
the Reagans before the president leaves office Jan. 20 and returns
to California, will feature entertainment by singer Frank Sinatra
and comedian Don Rickles.
   Television personality Merv Griffin will be master of ceremonies
for the event, to be held at the Beverly Hilton hotel.
   The president will speak.
   An announcement by the hotel described the fund raiser as a joint
effort of Griffin, the Reagans and hotel magnate Barron Hilton and
said it was expected to raise $1 million.
   Backers of the Nancy Reagan Center are seeking to raise $10
million to buy and renovate a former hospital in the San Fernando
Valley. They have reportedly raised $3 million.
   The center will be a residential treatment facility for drug
abusers aged 12 to 18 and is an outgrowth of the first lady's ``Just
Say No'' campaign.
   In addition to a wide variety of California wines, the 125
waiters at the black-tie dinner will serve such appetizers as
lobster tails in saffron sauce, steak tartare and shrimp sauteed in
garlic. The main course will be tournedos of veal topped with
Mendocino duck livers and truffles.
   To top it all off, each guests gets a candy-filled box made of
sugar with the Reagans' picture silk-screened onto it.
   An anticipated 950 guests are paying $10,000 for a table of 10.
An additional 65, who will also attend a reception with the Reagans,
are paying $25,000 for a similar table.

<HEAD>Reagan Submits Whistle-Blowers Legislation To Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says his new
``whistleblower'' bill will protect federal employes from reprisals
for reporting wrongdoing and at he same time prevent undue
harassment of agency heads about legitimate personnel decisions.
   A Democratic sponsor of similar legislation which the president
vetoed in October, however, says Reagan's version is insufficient
and ``probably irrelevant'' because George Bush will be president on
Jan. 20.
   Reagan's proposal is nearly identical to current law, Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said in a telephone interview.
   ``I don't think there's anybody except the president who thinks
that's adequate,'' she said. ``The quacking duck has laid an egg.''
   An aide to Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., who co-sponsored last
year's bill with Schroeder, said the lawmaker had not seen Reagan's
legislation, but was pleased that it had been proposed.
   ``I think it's important, the Congress thinks it's important, and
I hope we can all sit down and get a bill that can become law,''
aide Donald Upson quoted Horton as saying.
   Schroeder and Horton reintroduced the vetoed version of the bill
on Tuesday, the first day of the congressional session.
   In vetoing the original bill, Reagan said it ``would have
redesigned the whistleblower protection process so that employees
who are not genuine whistleblowers could manipulate the process to
their advantage simply to delay or avoid appropriate adverse
personnel actions.''
   In a message to Congress accompanying the new bill, he said,
``The legislation protects from reprisal federal employees who
expose wrongdoing within the government. It also ensures that
federal personnel managers are not burdened with routinely defending
appropriate personnel decisions.''
   ``Federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud, waste, abuse,
and violations of the law help to ensure that the federal government
uses American taxpayers' dollars effectively and efficiently,'' he
said. ``The nation's laws must encourage such reports and protect
those who make them from reprisal.''
   The vetoed bill would have required federal employes only to show
that whistle-blowing was a factor in their discharge or
reassignment, rather than a ``significant'' or ``dominant'' factor,
in order to prove they were discriminated against.
   Reagan said his bill would give federal employees the right to
initiate a proceeding before the Merit Systems Protection Board to
contest any action they considered a reprisal for whistle-blowing.
   It also would give preference to whistle-blowers who seek
transfers to other jobs comparable to the ones they hold.
   It calls for an Office of Special Counsel to protect federal
employees by seeking orders from the Merit Systems Protection Board
to set aside actions taken against employees until the employees'
case has been heard.
   Employees would have the right to seek review by a federal court
if they do not win their case before the board.
   Unlike the earlier bill, however, it does not call for the
special counsel to go to court to seek review of disputes to which
his office is a party. Reagan said this was an infringement of the
president's constitutional power to settle differences within the
executive branch of government.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors unleashed a tough new law
in their war on drug-dealing street thugs, hoping to send a repeat
drug offender accused of possessing 150 grams of crack to prison
with no chance of getting out.
   Richard Van Winrow, a 21-year-old reputed gang member, pleaded
innocent Tuesday to three drug-related charges at his arraignment
before U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall.
   ``The new law is being used to target gang members in the hopes
of reducing drug sales and consumption,'' said the prosecutor,
Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Lench. ``There's a hope there
will be an impact on the street-gang drug problem.''
   The charges against Winrow are believed to be the first filed
under the anti-drug law President Reagan signed in November, Ms.
Lench said. The law requires federal judges to impose life sentences
with no hope of parole on defendants convicted of drug trafficking
under certain circumstances.
   In Winrow's case, the circumstances are that he has at least two
convictions on felony drug-related charges and was holding at least
50 grams of crack cocaine when he was arrested, the prosecutor said.
   Winrow's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Kevin Brehm, said the law
is too harsh. He said it is unfair that someone with three
convictions for possessing cocaine, as Winrow has, faces the same
sentence as someone convicted at least twice previously of drug
trafficking.
   Others who can be sentenced under the law include defendants with
at least two felony drug convictions who are then convicted in
federal court of possessing for sale at least 1 kilogram of heroin,
5 kilos of cocaine powder or 100 kilos of marijuana. A kilogram
equals 2.2 pounds.
   ``This prosecution, and future prosecutions, are designed to
convince the drug dealers on the streets that we are not kidding and
they are not going to slip out of it,'' said John Gordon, head of
the Gang Drug-Trafficking Task Force in the U.S. attorney's office
here.
   Winrow is charged with one count of possession with the intent to
distribute cocaine, one count of carrying and using a firearm in
relation to the first charge and one count of possessing a firearm
as an ex-convict.
   A March 7 trial date was set for the Los Angeles man, who
remained in custody without bail.
   Winrow was convicted three times in 1987 for possession of
cocaine and was sentenced in state court to three years' probation
and 180 days in jail, said Ms. Lench, a Justice Department
prosecutor assigned to a joint federal, state and local street gang
task force in Los Angeles.
   The task force was formed last year to combat the Los Angeles
area's gang and drug problem. Last year, more than 330 people in Los
Angeles County were slain in gang-related violence, which
authorities contend is often linked to the drug trade.
   Winrow was arrested on Dec. 8 for investigation of possessing
about 150 grams of crack, the potent, smokable, highly addictive
form of cocaine, with the intent to distribute it, Ms. Lench said.
   Brehm said he may challenge the constitutionality of the new
federal law if Winrow is convicted. He also said he would
investigate whether Winrow was being prosecuted selectively.
   But Ms. Lench said Winrow was not singled out unfairly: ``He
happens to be the first who meets the criteria.''

   The U.S. dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading
index climbed to another record high in its half-day 1989 opening
session.
   The dollar closed at 124.05 yen, down 1.85 yen from Friday's
close of 125.90 yen. After opening at 123.98 yen, the currency moved
in a range of 123.80-124.35 yen. Currency dealers said the dollar's
fall followed a similar trend in overseas markets.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 84.66
points, or 0.28 percent, and closed at 30,243.66, a record high. The
index gained 88.74 points in early trading, and kept most of that
gain throughout the half-day session.
   ``Trading started off pretty well for the first session of the
year,'' said a dealer with Nomura Securities.
   Investors are still expecting domestic interest rates to stay
lower, encouraging buying orders, the dealer said.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange opened Wednesday after finishing last
year's trading on Dec. 28.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's plunge in Tokyo followed a
similar trend in overseas markets.
   A dealer with a foreign bank said some speculative investors were
sitting on the sidelines ahead of the release of the U.S. jobless
rate for December, due Friday.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Says Turkey Has `Appalling' Rights Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today condemned Turkey for
its ``appalling human rights records,'' saying it has received
almost daily reports since November of political prisoners being
tortured.
   The London-based rights organization says in a report released
today that the Turkish government has begun a public relations
campaign to improve its image abroad, but has taken no substantial
steps to end the torturing of political detainees.
   Amnesty said 250,000 political prisoners have been detained in
Turkey this decade, and ``almost all of them were tortured.''
   Thousands were imprisoned for non-violent political or religious
activities, 60,000 were convicted after unfair trails, more than 700
death sentences were imposed and at least 200 prisoners died in
custody, many alleged to be the result of torture, the organization
said.
   Amnesty said it sent urgent appeals to the Turkish government in
November and December, but it said Turkey has made no apparent
effort to change the ``brutal reality of torture, deaths in custody,
political imprisonment and unfair trials.''
   The group said that six months ago it gave Turkish authorities
the names of 229 men and women who had died in custody in the
preceding 7{ years, but ``the authorities have provided no
explanation whatsoever for 144 of the deaths.''
   The report says, ``Most reported cases of torture and deaths in
custody occur within the initial period of detention when detainees
are held incommunicado and interrogated.''
   It says the prisoners are tortured to obtain ``confessions,'' and
as a form of pre-trial punishment.
   The most frequently used methods are beatings with fists, feet,
truncheons or other tools, on any part of the body. The systematic
beating of the soles of the feet, or falaka, is the traditional
method, the report says.
   Among specific cases described by Amnesty is that of Sadik
Celebi, who was detained Nov. 16. Authorities provided no
information about his whereabouts until Nov. 26, when they delivered
his body to his family, the report says.
   Officials said Celebi died in an armed encounter with guerrilla
forces, but relatives said his body was covered with bruises in
addition to the bullet wounds, the report says.
   Amnesty quoted a Mardin State Hospital official as saying Celebi
had been dead since at least Nov. 22, the day before the guerrilla
encounter alleged by the authorities.
   It also cited Hasan Hakki Erdogan, who died in police custody in
Istanbul in 1984. Police said he died of kidney and heart failure.
Amnesty said it was only after five police officers were convicted
last month of torturing the prisoner that authorities acknowledged
he had been tortured.
   Turkey ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of
Torture in February and the U.N. Convention against Torture in
August.
   ``Despite these positive moves and repeated claims that human
rights are respected in Turkey, the authorities appear reluctant to
take even the most elementary practical steps to eradicate human
rights abuses and have failed to implement the provisions of the
treaties,'' Amnesty said.
   An Amnesty International delegation discussed human rights with
government officials in Turkey in June. In August, the organization
sent the government a memorandum on its concerns and recommendations
for preventing further abuses. In November, it published a report on
its concerns.
   Turkey has not responded to the recommendations in the memorandum
or the report, Amnesty said.
   ``Instead, it has conducted a worldwide public relations campaign
and Turkish embassies in several countries have provided Amnesty
International with largely incomplete and unsatisfactory
explanations for a range of human rights abuses.''

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
today on 1989's first trading day in Tokyo, while the stock market's
leading index set a record high for the third consecutive trading
session.
   The dollar, which ended 1988 trading at 125.90 yen, opened at
123.98 yen today and closed at 124.05 yen, down 1.85 yen from last
Friday's close. It ranged between 123.80 yen and 124.35 yen.
   The U.S. currency's plunge resulted from massive dollar-selling
after excessive dollar-buying toward the end of last year, following
similar trends on overseas markets, said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Trading today was directionless mainly because it was lacking
market-affecting news,'' he said, adding that the rate stabilized at
around the 124-yen level today.
   The majority of speculative investors remained on the sidelines
to await U.S. unemployment figures for December, due to be announced
Friday, he added.
   The dealer said the dollar-yen rate was unlikely to fluctuate
much before release of the figure.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Exchange closed this year's first
half-day session at a record high of 30,243.66 points after gaining
84.66 points, or 0.28 percent. The index gained 88.74 points in
early trading and maintained most of that gain.
   The Nikkei had set records of 30,050.93 on Dec. 27 and 30,159.00
on Dec. 28, in 1988's final session.
   ``Trading started off pretty good for the first session of the
year,'' said a dealer with Nomura Securities, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He said investors were expecting continuation of low domestic
interest rates and oil prices, two major factors encouraging
share-buying.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 350 million
shares.

   A fire in a turbine building at the Oconee
Nuclear Station caused operators to shut down one of its three
reactors, a utility company spokeswoman said.
   Tuesday night's fire on the non-nuclear part of the plant was
extinguished by a Duke Power Co. fire brigade. The ``unusual event''
posed no danger to plant workers or to the public, spokeswoman Mary
Boyd said.
   Workers were bringing Unit 1 on-line when an electrical breaker
associated with the reactor's coolant pumps apparently caught fire,
station manager Mike Tuckman said.
   The unit had been automatically shut down Monday by what is known
as a ``reactor trip,'' which he said occurs several times a year.
   When the fire occurred, operators manually took the unit off-line
and ``de-energized'' the four reactor coolant pumps, which under
normal conditions are used to carry heat away from the hot reactor
core.
   Tuckman said natural circulation of cooling water continued in
the reactor until one pump was re-started about 2{ hours after the
fire was put out. There was never any danger of core overheating, he
said.
   The ``unusual event,'' the least-serious of four emergency
nuclear plant classifications, began at 7:45 p.m., but Tuckman said
the situation remained stable.
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors were at the plant
Tuesday night monitoring the situation, Tuckman said.
   Ms. Boyd said workers would have to inspect the damage to
electric equipment before company officials can estimate when the
unit will go back into operation. Units 2 and 3 at Oconee continued
normal operation.

   An Oregon Air National Guard F-4 Phantom
jet fighter crashed into the Pacific Ocean on a training mission
Tuesday, killing one crew member and leaving the pilot in serious
condition, authorities said.
   Both crewmen suffered from hypothermia, or subnormal body
temperature, and multiple fractures after ejecting from the fighter
as it plunged into the Pacific about 10:30 a.m. 30 miles off
Tillamook Bay, authorities said.
   The plane's weapons systems officer, 1st Lt. Mark A. Baker, 30,
of Beaverton, was picked up at 1:45 p.m. and died about eight hours
later at Emanuel Hospital &amp; Health Center in Portland, National
Guard spokesman Mike Allegre said.
   The pilot, 2nd Lt. Mike Markstaller, 24, of Portland, was picked
up shortly before noon. He was in serious condition suffering from
hypothermia, said Emanuel spokeswoman Lisa Hall.
   A spokesman at McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma, Wash., Staff
Sgt. Skip Wiseman, said the jet was on a training mission out of the
Oregon Air National Guard base in Portland.
   The pilot declared an in-flight emergency shortly before the
crash, and a pilot in an accompanying aircraft reported seeing two
parachutes as the crew bailed out, Wiseman said.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis says his decision to forgo a
chance for a record fourth term has nothing to do with his prospects
in national politics, but admitted it's ``exceedingly difficult'' to
run for president as governor.
   With two years remaining in his term, Dukakis unexpectedly
announced Tuesday he would not seek re-election in 1990. He parried
questions about his political future, however, saying only he
intended to be active in national affairs and would not rule out
another run for the White House.
   ``Public policy and public service is what I'm all about, it's
what I love,'' Dukakis, 55, told a crowded news conference.``I've
loved this office, and I still do.''
   The defeated Democratic presidential candidate said his decision
not to seek an unprecedented fourth term as Massachusetts' governor
was not related to the 1988 presidential campaign or to a possible
1992 rematch against President-elect Bush.
   He acknowledged, however, that it was ``exceedingly difficult''
to mount a national political campaign while exercising executive
authority and defending his long record as governor.
   ``I think the deliberate distortions about Massachusetts ... were
increasingly difficult to defend,'' said Dukakis, whose initially
strong campaign withered under Republican attacks on his
gubernatorial record on crime, the environment and other issues.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt was the last sitting governor to win the
White House in 1932.
   When asked whether he intends to run for president in 1992,
Dukakis said, ``I've learned _ occasionally painfully _ never to say
`never' in politics.''
   However, the governor, who has ruled out a run for Congress, said
it was ``much too early'' to discuss 1992.
   Political analyst William Schneider of the American Enterprise
Institute, a Democratic think tank in Washington, said Dukakis'
decision was consistent with another run for the presidency.
   ``But it is regarded with some dismay, among Democrats, because
the conventional wisdom is that he was a poor candidate who ran a
poor campaign,'' Schneider said. ``He's got to change that
perception, to let people know that he has changed, that he learned
something.''
   Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic Party activist in New York City,
said Dukakis made a smart move if he intends to run for president
again, adding, ``Now, I'm not sure that's what this means.''
   She also said there is ``an undercurrent of anger'' within the
party.
   ``There is some feeling this could have been a Democratic year
and he blew it,'' she said. ``If he runs again, I don't know how he
copes with that.''
   Dukakis aides were divided over the likelihood that he would seek
the White House again.
   ``I have heard nothing that Michael Dukakis has said publicly or
privately, even one-on-one, that would bow in that direction,'' said
S. Stephen Rosenfeld, a presidential campaign aide who now serves as
Dukakis' chief of staff.
   But Paul Pezzella, who worked with Rosenfeld on the campaign and
now serves as his deputy, said: ``I think he'd like another whack at
it.''
   The announcement broke a political logjam in Massachusetts
politics and touched off immediate speculation about the new
landscape in the Democratic Party here and in Washington.
   In recent weeks, Dukakis had been urged by Democrats to announce
his intentions so they could begin making plans. ``It seemed to me
desirable to make the decision now, rather than later,'' Dukakis
said.
   Among Democrats expected to consider a run for governor are
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, former state Attorney General Francis
X. Bellotti and U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, along with
conservative state Rep. John Flood.
   If he completes his current term, Dukakis would surpass
Revolutionary War patriot John Hancock as the longest-serving
governor in Massachusetts history. Hancock held the office for 11
years.

<TEXT>
   Conductor Phillipe Entremont says he's resigning
from the Denver Symphony because budget cuts made his vision of the
orchestra's future ``like a bird being shot in midair.''
   Entremont has been principal conductor of the DSO since 1986 and
music director since 1987. He said Tuesday his resignation from the
posts is effective in June, the end of the season.
   Entremont, 54, also is a concert pianist, and conductor of the
Vienna Chamber Orchestra and director of the Orchestra Colonne de
Paris.
   He said he believed the DSO was ``progressing at a wonderful
rate'' toward the artistic goals he had set, but plans to trim its
schedule because of cuts to the artistic budget threaten ``to bring
the orchestra 10 years back.''
   ``With the division of opinion between myself and the board
regarding the orchestra's musical goals, I had no other choice (but
to resign),'' he said. ``I never cheat artistic matters.''
   The DSO has struggled financially in recent seasons, and in
September the symphony board announced it would seek protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. A panel appointed
by Mayor Federico Pena studied the situation and recommended a
budget for next season of $6.5 million, $800,000 less than the
1988-89 budget.
   Entremont said he had seen no encouraging signs in the last few
months that the board saw the orchestra as a major international
orchestra.
   He also criticized state government for giving insufficient
support to the arts.
   ``This orchestra I think deserves much better than it got. It's
really a first-class orchestra,'' he said. ``It was like a bird
being shot in midair.''
   DSO president Chris Dunworth said the board accepted Entremont's
resignation with regret, and planned to meet today to initiate a
search for his successor.

   Safdar Hashmi, one of India's most
popular street theater directors, was beaten to death because he
refused to stop a play supporting Marxist candidates in municipal
elections, police said.
   A member of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party and
three others were arrested and charged with murder, they said.
   Hashmi, 34 and a founding member of the Communist Party of India,
died Monday night, two days after he was beaten unconscious in
Sahibabad, where his troupe had been performing. The town is about
12 miles northeast of New Delhi.
   Doctors said Hashmi suffered a broken skull and massive internal
bleeding.
   Mukesh Sharma, a Congress Party candidate in the municipal
election, and three supporters were arrested Monday and charged with
murder, police said.
   Leading Indian artists and opposition politicians are demanding
an inquiry.
   ``What was characteristic of his life was characteristic also of
his death,'' said the pro-government Times of India newspaper said
in an editorial.
   ``He was the victim of the same forces he had fought all his
life. Safdar's murder is a reminder that what is happening today is
not just criminalization of politics but that politics have been
taken over by criminals.''
   Hashmi organized the street theater troupe in 1973 and it has
staged more than 4,000 performances across India, most of them
dealing with social problems such as dowry death, government
corruption, communalism and problems of the working class.

   Marine Police Cmdr. Zainal Abidin told reporters the patrol boats
raced to the area Tuesday on receiving information that the pirates
were sighted in a boat near Marakin island in the Sulu Sea off
Semporna, 1,050 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.
   On seeing the police, the pirates opened fire. Five of them
escaped in the boat, but the body of one pirate, identified only as
Bangku, 30, was recovered with two revolvers and ammunition.
   All the pirates were believed to be Malaysians.

<HEAD>Navy Crew Blamed As Being Drunk In Ferry Mishap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PUERTO BARRIOS, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of a ferry that sank
on New Year's Day with the loss of 79 lives claims the crew of the
naval patrol boat that was towing his boat was drunk.
   The mishap off the Caribbean coast was Guatemala's worst maritime
disaster.
   Late Tuesday, the captain of the ferry, who is charged with
negligent homocide in the case, blamed the navy crew for the
accident during an interview in a National Police jail in this city.
   The captain, Juan Pablo Esquivel, said those on the navy ship,
which he said included non-navy personnel, were ``celebrating on
deck'' during the towing operation. He said he smelled alcohol on
the breath of a machinist who boarded his packed ferry from the navy
vessel to check the motor.
   The ferry skipper said that after eight minutes of towing, the
navy vessel ``made a brusque acceleration'' that caused the ferry to
flip over.
   Capt. Rigoberto Kiste, of the Puerto Barrios naval base, said by
telephone that he could not officially respond to the charges
because the navy's investigation was continuing.
   But earlier Tuesday, another officer at the local naval base
denied that the patrol vessel, No. 654, was at fault and said the
ferry captain must shoulder prime responsibility.
   A tugboat captain and other witnesses told The Associated Press
that the ferry was towed with too short a cable and that the patrol
boat did not slow down even after the ferry started listing.
   ``The wake of the patrol boat was hitting hard against our bow,
and our bow was down in the water. You can't keep a ship under
control when its bow is down in the water,'' said Ladislao Ponce,
47, who has worked for 19 years as a tugboat captain and who was a
passenger on the ferry.
   Capt. Anibal Giron, second in command at Puerto Barrios naval
base and a graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, remarked:
``When people are in grief, when they've suffered loss, they look to
affix blame immediately. Our business is saving lives. We are as
upset about this as anyone.''
   Giron said the navy was investigating, but the preliminary
conclusion is that Esquivel, the ferry captain, was mainly to blame.
   Ponce was traveling with his wife and two daughters Sunday when
the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II flipped and sank in Amatique Bay
while making the 16-mile run from Livingston to Puerto Barrios.
Ponce's wife and one daughter drowned.
   Ponce said the ferry lost power either from lack of fuel or
engine trouble and drifted an hour until a naval patrol boat arrived
and offered a tow.
   ``The cable they used to tow us was very short, about 15 meters
(49 feet) long,'' said Ponce. He and Rodolfo Lucano, another
commercial captain, said the cable should have been at least 165
feet long.
   The vessel listed sharply twice, to port then starboard, ``but
they did not reduce speed. They must have seen that we were listing
dangerously,'' said Ponce. He said passengers were panicked by the
second steep tilt.
   The vessel flipped over, trapping passengers below.
   Rogelio Franzua, an 18-year-old high school student who had been
headed home to Puerto Barrios, also estimated the length of the
towing cable at 45 feet. He, like Ponce, said no life jackets were
aboard the Rufino Barrios.
   ``Both the ferry and the navy have responsibility. Because the
ferry was overloaded and without needed equipment. And the patrol
boat should have taken off at least some of us before beginning to
tow, and they towed us too fast,'' Franzua said.

<TEXT>
   Japanese companies captured half the
world's $50.2 billion semiconductor market last year while the
market share of U.S. companies declined, according to a survey
released today.
   The American share fell from 39 percent in 1987 to 37 percent in
1988 while the Japanese share rose about the same amount, from about
48 percent to 50 percent, according to the annual industry survey by
Dataquest, a market research and consulting firm.
   ``American companies are not taking advantage of high-growth
areas to the same extent,'' said Stan Bruederle, vice president for
Dataquest's components division research.
   Japanese companies' emphasis on the industry's fastest-growing
segments such as high performance microprocessors and, particularly,
dynamic random access memory, or DRAMs, was responsible for the 2
percent change in both region's market share, Bruederle said.
   The San Jose-based company, which surveyed 112 top semiconductor
suppliers, also reported that worldwide growth in the industry
slowed in the final three months of 1988.
   Global semiconductor sales in 1988 reached $50.2 billion, up 32.9
percent from 1987's $38.1 billion market. That increase was greater
than the industry's 22.8 percent growth in 1987 but less than
Dataquest's growth forecast of 35.8 percent.
   ``If you look at total worldwide revenues, this is typical of
what occurs at this stage of the business cycle,'' Bruederle said.
The semiconductor industry enjoyed its greatest growth in the decade
in 1984, when sales jumped 48 percent, he said.
   Dataquest said that Japanese companies' dominance in DRAMS, the
high-density, low-cost memories widely used in personal computers,
helped boost their share of the American semiconductor market to a
record 20 percent last year, up from 15 percent in 1987.
   But American companies also gained in the Japanese market,
capturing 10 percent of sales in 1988, an increase of nearly 2
percent from 1987. It was the first time U.S. companies improved
their share of the Japanese market since 1984, Dataquest said.
   Japanese semiconductor companies, however, have a built-in
advantage of being the primary suppliers of the Japanese market, the
fastest-growing market in the world, Bruederle said. Japanese
companies enjoy 89 percent of their domestic market.
   European companies' sales dropped to 10 percent last year from 11
percent in 1987, but companies in other parts of the world enjoyed a
greater market share, 3 percent in 1988 compared with 1.6 percent
the year before, Dataquest said.

<HEAD>Record 240,000 East Bloc Immigrants Arrive In West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrival of a record 242,000
immigrants from Eastern Europe _ more than half from Poland _ has
strained West Germans' hospitality and ability to integrate so many
newcomers.
   The Bavarian culture ministry, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that
a Russian-language school will open next fall in Pfarrkirchen to
help assimilate refugee children from the Soviet Union.
   Those making up the largest group of immigrants in 1988 _ 140,226
_ came from Poland, followed by 47,572 Soviets of German descent and
39,832 people from East Germany.
   The increase over the previous record of 90,000 in 1987 reflects
a relaxation of emigration policy in the three Soviet bloc countries.
   Even more refugees are expected this year, said Horst
Waffenschmidt, the Interior Ministry official responsible for
refugees.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts have eased
restrictions on those seeking to leave the country, and the more
tolerant view has been adopted to some degree by authorities in
Warsaw and East Berlin.
   Politicians and labor union officials concerned about West
Germany's 8 percent jobless rate have been increasingly critical of
the government's policy of accepting virtually all ethnic Germans
seeking to emigrate to the West.
   Many of the newcomers speak little or no German and are already
near retirement age or have limited job skills.
   The East European refugees usually require government-financed
housing, food, language training and other social services for
months after their arrival.
   Saarland state governor Oskar Lafontaine of the left-wing Social
Democratic Party complained in October that the ethnic Germans were
getting priority over people from Third World countries seeking
political asylum.
   Waffenschmidt, an influential member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrat Party, said the Bonn government is committed to
doing all it can ``to ease for these countrymen their new start in
our land.''
   He said $1.1 billion has been earmarked for aiding East European
refugees in 1989.
   Christian Democratic spokesman Johannes Gester on Tuesday urged
the government to create a fourth reception camp for Soviet bloc
immigrants to ease crowding at the three facilities currently
registering arrivals and provide initial assistance for them.
   Thousands of immigrants are camped in crowded barracks and tent
cities throughout the federal republic. Local governments struggle
with short funds and a tight housing market to provide suitable
dwellings.
   Emigration to West Germany from Romania fell by about 1,000 last
year to 12,902, according to the Interior Ministry figures. There
were 959 resettlers from Czechoslovakia, 763 from Hungary and 223
from Yugoslavia, the government reported.

<HEAD>Walesa Interview Published In Party Weekly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The influential communist party weekly
Polityka has published a full-page interview with Lech Walesa,
chairman of the banned Solidarity union movement, the state-run PAP
news agency reported today.
   The edition, due in newspaper kiosks Thursday, carries the
interview under the headline ``Agreement Is Necessary In This
Country,'' PAP said.
   The appearance of the interview in Polityka, which is used to
convey official party positions, is a further sign authorities have
accepted Walesa as a partner for discussions and are reconsidering
their 1982 ban on Solidarity.
   The publication comes a day after government spokesman Jerzy
Urban made clear that authorities are ready to begin talks on the
chief opposition demand, reinstating Solidarity, which was
suppressed in a December 1981 military crackdown.
   In a brief portion of the interview quoted by PAP, Walesa
reiterated that, ``Legalization of Solidarity is the key issue.''
   The excerpt continued, ``I repeat: We do not want to overthrow
the authorities. A compromise is in our common interest ... The
interest of Poland is the order of the day. This is the supreme
cause. That's why we must come to terms with each other.''
   Government spokesmen have said the Communist Party's governing
central committee could meet as early as next week to resconsider
the issue of Solidarity. However, some opposition spokesmen have
cautioned against excessive optimism about the developments.
   If the party indicates it will reinstate Solidarity, Walesa has
said he would enter talks with Communist authorities on restoring
the union movement and dealing with trying to revive Poland's
limping economy.

<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg's attorney says he doesn't expect
his client will be acquitted in his trial in which he is accused of
fatally beat his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter.
   ``I think the best we can get is criminally negligent homicide,''
lead defense attorney Ira London said in an interview in today's New
York Newsday.
   ``I know Joel won't like that because he wants nothing short of
acquittal, but I don't think it's realistic,'' London said Tuesday.
   ``He'll probably do jail time.''
   Also Tuesday, Judge Harold Rothwax ruled that Steinberg must
undergo an examination by a psychiatrist selected by prosecutors
because Steinberg's lawyers seemed to be presenting an insanity
defense without formally declaring so.
   Steinberg, 47, is accused of second-degree murder in the November
1987 beating death of Lisa Steinberg.
   Steinberg must decide whether to argue that he is not criminally
responsible by reason of mental disease or defect. If a defendant
makes such a claim, the prosecution can examine him.
   London said he probably will not argue insanity and probably will
refuse to allow prosecution psychiatrists to examine Steinberg. He
said the judge misunderstood the defense position.
   ``I don't think we're going to argue mental disease or defect,''
London said, ``but the problem is the judge interprets what we're
going to argue as mental disease or defect.''
   London said he will not argue that Steinberg was insane.
   ``I don't think he was crazy. I think what happened here is that
he did not have a perception of what Lisa was suffering,'' he said.
   He said Steinberg got bad information or no information from his
then-live-in lover, Hedda Nussbaum, about the child's condition.
   Rothwax told prosecutors to have the petition for him to sign
Thursday. He left it to both sides to work out an examination
schedule.
   If the defense doesn't invoke an insanity defense, the
prosecution psychiatrist won't be called, the judge said. If the
defense clearly does present an insanity defense, then the
prosecution will be prepared to rebut the testimony, he said.
   Last month, Rothwax turned down a defense request to present an
insanity defense, saying they had to present psychiatric evidence to
support the request. The defense then abandoned that approach.
   London said such a move would have required the defendant to give
up his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would
permit the psychiatrist to testify about any unproven comment he had
heard about Steinberg.
   Assistant District Attorneys Peter Casolaro and John McCusker
charged last week that Steinberg's lawyers were presenting an
insanity defense by using the testimony of lay witnesses.
   In the Newsday interview, London said he took the case because it
was a challenge.
   ``I have three daughters of my own and they were very upset when
I decided to take this case,'' London said. ``Steinberg approached
me. I never thought it was going to be as intense as it was, though.
But of course there was also a nice fee involved.''
   London declined to reveal the amount, but Newsday quoted an
unidentified court source as saying it was around $500,000.
   At the time of his arrest, Steinberg reportedly had $2 million in
assets, half of which was later taken by the Internal Revenue
Service in back taxes, the newspaper said.
   ``But after awhile, even my family came to understand this was
about more than a large fee,'' London said. ``They understand now
that if Joel Steinberg can get a fair trial in this country, anyone
can. Joel Steinberg deserves his day in court like everyone else.''

<HEAD>High Winds, Snow in the East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winds gusting to 60 mph today blew down trees, caused power
outages and triggered gale warnings from Maine to South Carolina as
snow fell over the Appalachian Mountains and the eastern Great Lakes.
   The fast-moving snowstorm Tuesday night left about 5 inches of
snow in Chadron and Strongsville, Ohio, 4 inches in Pittsburgh and
Cleveland and an inch in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia
   The storm was tapering off along the East Coast, but snow
advisories remained in effect in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware and Maryland, as well as in West Virginia and Indiana. A
heavy snow warning was posted in Ohio.
   Scattered rain showers and a few thunderstorms fell over Arizona
and Southern California, and the Pacific Northwest got some rain
showers. Dense fog was reported in Idaho, Utah and central
California.
   Skies were clear from Florida to the Gulf Coast states, the
central Plains and the upper Mississppi Valley and in most of the
Northwest.
   The highest winds on the East Coast were reported in North
Carolina, where 60 mph gusts were recorded in Jacksonville. Trees
were blown down and power outages were reported across North
Carolina and portions of Georgia. Storm warnings were up for waters
off the North Carolina coast.
   In Vermont, strong winds and subzero temperatures were expected
to produce wind chill factors of 30 to 40 degrees below zero.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 88 degrees at Kingsville and
McAllen, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for snow showers over the eastern Great
Lakes and central Appalachians; showers and thunderstorms from
southwest Texas to parts of New Mexico, southern Arizona and
Southern California; scattered rain and snow showers over northern
Arizona and southern Utah; and rain showers over the Pacific
Northwest.
   High temperatures were expected to be near zero and in the single
digits in far northern New England and northeast New York; the teens
and 20s across the rest of New England, northern portions of the
mid-Atlantic Coast states, the central Appalachians, the upper Ohio
Valley, the Great Lakes and Minnesota; the 50s and 60s in the Gulf
Coast states, the central and southern Plains and the Southwest; and
70s in Texas and southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees below zero at International Falls, Minn., to 73 degrees at
St. Petersburg, Fla.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Active Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in active European trading this
morning, spurred by heavy commercial buying. Dealers said the
dollar's strength pushed gold prices slightly lower.
   ``Plenty of people seem to want to buy the dollar right now,''
said a dealer with a Milan commercial bank who, like several others,
expressed surprise at the U.S. currency's strength.
   ``It seems there's no end to dollar bids,'' said a dealer at a
major West German bank in Frankfurt.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said steady demand for dollars was coming
from commercial institutions in Asia, where banks in Japan opened
their trading rooms for the first time this year.
   Another Milan trader said the market was expecting Friday's
release of U.S. unemployment figures for December to show a fall to
5.3 percent from 5.4 percent in November.
   That, the dealers said, could strengthen the dollar on
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
in order to prevent the economy from overheating.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell sharply against the yen compared with last Friday's
Tokyo close. But it was up from Tuesday's late rate in Europe.
   The dollar finished in Tokyo at 124.05 yen, down from last
Friday's 125.90 yen but higher than 123.50 yen in Europe on Tuesday.
In London late this morning, it was quoted at 124.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7770 West German marks, up from 1.7620
   _1.5085 Swiss francs, up from 1.4912
   _6.0680 French francs, up from 6.0125
   _2.00205 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9870
   _1,306.50 Italian lire, up from 1,295.75
   _1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1900
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8165, compared with
$1.8270 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $410.50 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $411.75. It was unchanged at midmorning
when the city's five major bullion dealers fixed the recommended
price.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.80, down from $411.25 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.95 to close at a bid $412.16.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.00 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.07.

   Chinese students in a central city beat a Sri
Lankan student, threw rocks at Africans and put up anti-black
posters as racial tensions spread to a fourth Chinese city,
foreigners said today.
   The violence occurred Saturday at the Central China Polytechnical
College in Wuhan, 680 miles south of Beijing, said a student from
Gabon and an American teacher.
   In Beijing, meanwhile, African students boycotted classes at the
Beijing Languages Institute today, one day after Chinese
demonstrated against an alleged attack by a black student on a
Chinese woman.
   ``Brothers, let us unite and fight for dignity,'' said a leaflet
distributed by Africans at the institute. ``Black is beauty.''
   In Wuhan, Chinese students put up posters saying ``Black devil,
go home'' on the walls of the foreign dormitory at the college,
according to a student from Gabon.
   He also quoted a Sri Lankan student as saying he had been
attacked and beaten by Chinese. The Gabonese said he did not think
the Sri Lankan had been seriously injured.
   About 300 Chinese students also roamed the campus on Saturday,
throwing rocks at the African students' dormitory, said the
Gabonese, who was at the college visiting friends when the attack
occurred.
   School authorities responded Sunday by suddenly taking the
college's 12 African students on a trip to the interior of Hubei
province, where Wuhan is located, said the Gabonese, a student from
Hubei Medical College.
   As of today, he said the students had yet to return.
   Other schools responded by canceling African parties and urging
dark-skinned students not to leave campus, said the Gabonese and an
American teacher.
   The incident in Wuhan began Tuesday when Chinese students from
the polytechnical institute wrote a letter to the school's director
saying they didn't want Africans in their university because African
were ``polluting Chinese society with their relations with Chinese
women,'' the student said.
   He said he learned about the contents of the letter from a
Chinese official at the college who is responsible for the Africans.
   The letter also expressed support for anti-black demonstrations
occurring simultaneously in Nanking, several hundred miles to the
east.
   Last week, thousands of Chinese youths demonstrated in Nanking
following a clash between African students and Chinese at Hehai
University over Chinese women.
   Chinese authorities say the brawl occurred when two African
students hit a gatekeeper who refused to allow two Chinese women to
attend an African Christmas Eve party. Official Chinese news reports
have said 11 Africans and two Chinese were injured.
   During the demonstrations, Chinese youths yelled racist slogans
and called for the Africans to be punished.
   Chinese authorities later arrested one African student, from
Ghana, and detained three others for questioning in a move
apparently aimed at quelling the demonstrators' wrath.
   On Tuesday, Su Xiaoxun, an official in Nanking, denied
allegations made by African students and diplomats that Chinese
forces on Saturday attacked and tortured Africans at a guest house
about 50 miles outside Nanking.
   African students and a diplomat from Benin claimed Chinese troops
had applied electic shocks to African students' faces, backs and
genitals.
   The 140 mostly African students had been forced to the guest
house on Dec. 26 following the African-Chinese clash and the
protests.
   In Beijing, about 500 African students at the Beijing Languages
Institute began their class boycott today as about 2,000 Chinese
ended theirs.
   The day before, about 200 Chinese marched for two hours,
protesting the incident during which an African student allegedly
followed a Chinese woman into her room at 4:30 a.m. on New Year's
Day.
   African students said they were boycotting classes because the
Chinese treat them ``like animals,'' according to the leaflet.
   ``If we keep silent against this discrimination we witness then
we are animals and are guilty,'' the leaflet said.
   Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese are
often openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is
very different than their own. The tensions become explosive when
Chinese women are involved.
   Chinese students are also unhappy with the way the government and
their schools are treating them and have jumped on the African issue
as a pretext to vent complex feelings of discontent about their
position in society.
   A fourth racially-related incident continued in Hangzhou, where
56 African students have been boycotting classes for a week because
they allege Chinese authorities say they all have AIDS.

<TEXT>
   At least 10 countries are reliably
reported to have chemical weapons, and several have unleashed them
in recent wars, Swedish researchers say.
   But an accurate and certain count of countries posssessing
chemical weapons is clouded by disinformation and vested interests,
said the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
   At one time or another, 38 countries were reported to have
chemical weapons, but the reports often were unreliable or hard to
assess, SIPRI said in its 1988 yearbook, which was published in
August.
   ``It's hard to put a figure on it,'' SIPRI researcher Johan
Lundin said in an interview today. ``A few countries have declared
they have chemical weapons, others say they intend to have them, and
there are a lot of allegations against other countries. We have no
information of our own.''
   SIPRI is a private research institute partially funded by the
Swedish government. It was established to monitor the world arms
trade and developments in disarmament, mainly through published
reports.
   SIPRI said in the 1988 yearbook that responsible U.S. and other
government officials speaking on the record listed nine countries as
having chemical weapons or intending to acquire them.
   These were France, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, the United States,
the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Iran and Vietnam.
   Since the book's publication, the United States has accused Libya
of having a weapons-producing capability. Libya denies it.
   Lundin said the U.S. allegation about Libya's capability was as
reliable as those on which the previous count of nine nations was
based.
   SIPRI said other countries have been named in less reliable
reports. A purported 1983 U.S. intelligence document leaked to the
British Broadcasting Corp. added the names of Burma, China, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Israel, Libya and Taiwan as possessors.
   Last year, Iran and Iraq were reported to have used toxic gases.
Combatants in Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan also made
unsubstantiated allegations that they were victims of chemical
warfare, Lundin said.
   In 1987, Libya was accused of using lethal gas in Chad and
Vietnam was charged with poisoning water supplies in Cambodia and
the SIPRI yearbook said chemical weapons were used in the Iran-Iraq
war.
   The previous year, charges of chemical war were raised against
Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Angola, Chad, Libya
and Nicaragua, SIPRI reported without elaborating.

<HEAD>Palestinian Teen-Ager Shot and Killed In Gaza Strip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers today shot and killed a
Palestinian teen-ager and wounded three other youths in clashes at
two refugee camps in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The Israeli army said it was checking the reports.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Deir el Balah, Palestinian
youths hurled stones at an army patrol, and troops opened fire,
killing Nasser Ismail Nasser, 16, officials at the camp's U.N.
clinic said.
   A 15-year-old from Deir el Balah was seriously wounded in the
chest during the clash, said officials at Gaza City's Ahli Arab
Hospital.
   In the nearby Nuseirat camp, two Palestinian teen-agers were
wounded in a stone-throwing clash with troops, Ahli Arab officials
said.
   The death brought to 346 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987 in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
Fourteen Israelis have been killed in the Palestinian uprising.
   Also today, the Foreign Ministry urged members of parliament not
to meet with PLO officials in Paris and the Netherlands. Members of
right-wing and religious parties asked the government to prevent a
delegation of four left-wing legislators from leaving the country
for the Paris meeting.
   A Foreign Ministry official said his office has urged legislators
not to attend the Jan. 12-13 European symposium on the Middle East
in Paris and a meeting at The Hague in the Netherlands on Jan. 30-31.
   The Hadashot newspaper reported that Labor members Avraham Burg,
Abba Eban and Chaim Tzadok planned to meet PLO officials in The
Hague.
   ``We asked from a foreign policy point of view that they not
attend,'' the ministry official said, adding the ministry could take
no further steps in the matter. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Israeli law forbids Israelis to meet with officials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, but lawmakers have parliamentary
immunity.
   On Tuesday, 31 right-wing and religious lawmakers asked the
government to prevent four parliamentarians from leaving the country
for the Paris session.
   ``It is forbidden to have contacts with the PLO and it doesn't
matter what proposals will be made,'' Likud legislator Tzahi Hanegbi
told Israel radio. He accused his four colleagues of flouting the
law.
   Yair Tsaban, one of the four lawmakers planning to attend the
Paris meeting, rejected the charge. ``We are convinced that it is
our responsibility to be there and to present the voice of the other
Israel,'' said Tsaban, a member of the socialist Mapam Party.
   The three other members of the delegation are Shulamit Aloni of
the Citizens Rights Movement and Labor legislators Ora Namir and
Lova Eliav.
   A coalition agreement signed by Labor and the Likud bloc rejects
talks with the PLO, and both factions on Tuesday night reiterated
their objections in a joint declaration in parliament.
   The United States recently opened talks with the PLO after PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist and said
he renounced terrorism. The change in U.S. policy was sharply
criticized by Israeli officials.

<HEAD>Anheuser-Busch Brewery Shuts Down Temporarily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. says it has suspended
production at its biggest brewery because an oil slick working its
way down the Mississippi River has slightly altered the taste of the
water used in making beer.
   ``Our quality control systems are highly sensitive to changes in
the content and aroma of the city drinking water used in the brewing
process,'' Andrew J. Steinhubl, senior vice president of brewing,
said Tuesday.
   ``And we acted immediately to cease production when we detected a
change.''
   Company officials had not detected anything that would indicate a
health hazard, Steinhubl said. The company said the shutdown will
last several days at most and will not affect the availability of
the company's products.
   The shutdown forced the layoff of about 2,000 brewing and
packaging production employees, Steinhubl said. About 4,000 other
employees, including maintenance workers and office staff, will
remain on the job, he said.
   The oil slick resulted from the rupture Dec. 24 of a Shell Oil
Co. pipeline in central Missouri. State officials said the spill was
the worst in Missouri history.
   Hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled into the
Gasconade River, a tributary of the Missouri River, which flows into
the Mississippi above St. Louis.
   By Dec. 28, the oil had reached the Missouri and Mississippi
river intakes of the St. Louis Water Department's plants. It now has
reached as far south on the Mississippi as Cape Girardeau, 110 miles
southeast of here, officials said.
   James Shea, St. Louis director of public utilities, stressed that
the water was safe to drink but that residents might notice a slight
oily taste or smell.
   City officials said the oil-tainted water is just now reaching
customers because the city filled its reserve tanks last week in
anticipation of the slick.
   Shell has recovered about 336,000 gallons of the oil from the
rivers, and its cleanup is expected to continue at least through
next week.
   Anheuser-Busch has 11 other breweries. The St. Louis brewery is
the company's oldest and largest, producing 13 million barrels of
beer a year, or 35,000 barrels a day.

   A motor launch carrying more than 140
people sank in the central Philippines, and at least 16 people were
killed, the coast guard said today. Another 12 people were reported
missing.
   Lt. Edmund Lustre, coast guard operations chief in Iloilo, said
the cargo vessel Jem II sank Tuesday off Romblon Island, about 150
miles southeast of Manila.
   He said a coast guard rescue team sent to Romblon reported 114
people had been rescued and that 16 bodies had been recovered.
   Lustre said earlier the boat carried more than 170 people and
that 45 were missing. He said in a telephone interview later those
figures were readjusted after rescuers found ``people were being
counted over and over.''
   Lustre said most of the passengers were believed to have been
high school students en route from Romblon to Panay after the
Christmas holidays.

   A former Czechoslovak diplomat in India, Vlastimil
Lubvik, has been granted political asylum in Britain, the Foreign
Office said.
   Lubvik was first secretary at his country's embassy in New Delhi,
but the Foreign Office would not say Tuesday night when he arrived
in Britain or give any details on his defection.
   A spokesman said that Home Secretary Douglas Hurd granted the
asylum request and Lubvik was in Britain.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said Lubvik
approached Sir David Goodall, the British High Commissioner
(ambassador) in New Delhi, more than two weeks ago and came to
Britain before Christmas. The agency said Czechoslovak authorities
reported Lubvik had disappeared and suggested he had been abducted.
   Relations between London and Prague have been cool in recent
years.
   In September, Britain expelled three Czechoslovak diplomats,
including two military attaches, for spying. Six days later, Prague
retaliated by ordering two British military attaches to leave.
   Britain has not yet formally responded to a Czechoslovak offer to
send experts to Britain to help try to discover whether the Semtex
plastic explosive they manufacture was the cause of the crash of the
Pan Am Flight 103 airliner in Scotland on Dec. 21.
   Britain also protested to Czechoslovakia about its treatment of
religious groups, claiming their human rights were being violated.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Rules Against Non-Sectarian Invocations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court rejected as
unconstitutional a school system's practice of offering
non-sectarian invocations before football games.
   A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1
Tuesday that the offering of prayers by laymen is still
objectionable because the practice ``has a religious purpose and a
primary effect of advancing religion.''
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Douglas Jager, 20, the former Douglas
County High School student who sued the 13,800-student Douglas
County school system in suburban Atlanta in 1985. ``This is exactly
where I wanted it to be.''
   At the time, invocations were delivered by ministers. Jager, who
described himself as an agnostic, said the prayers violated
separation of church and state.
   In the meantime, the school district opened up the invocations to
non-ministers. Jager and his father challenged the ``equal access''
plan as well.
   A federal judge threw out the original plan but said the
alternative was acceptable.
   However, the appeals court said Tuesday, ``There is no indication
that the school district will refrain from its 40-year-old practice
of having clergy deliver religious invocations before high school
football games.''
   Jeffrey Bramlett, the Jagers' attorney, said the decision should
provide guidance for other school systems that allow pre-game
prayers.
   ``Hopefully they will see the handwriting on the wall and will
recognize what they need to do to comply with the law,'' he said.
   School Superintendent Jim Steele said he had not seen the ruling
and could not comment.

<TEXT>
   A daughter haunted by nightmares about her
mother's 1985 disappearance pried open a locked basement freezer and
found the woman's battered body, prompting her father's confession
to the slaying, police say.
   Leonard Tyburski, who told police he kept the body in the freezer
for 3{ years because he loved his wife and didn't want to part with
her, was charged with murder, authorities said.
   ``It has some indications of Edgar Allan Poe and even some Alfred
Hitchcock,'' said District Judge James Garber, who arraigned
Tyburski on Tuesday and ordered him held without bond in the Wayne
County Jail.
   Garber delayed scheduling a preliminary hearing until Tyburski,
45, underwent psychiatric tests to determine whether he was
competent to stand trial.
   Tyburski, dean of students at Detroit's Mackenzie High School,
had cooperated with police investigating his wife's disappearance.
Dorothy Tyburski was 37 when he reported her missing on Oct. 2,
1985. Tyburski passed a lie-detector test and hadn't been considered
a suspect, police said.
   The case, treated as a missing person report, had been closed for
two years.
   But disturbing dreams by one of the couple's daughters led her to
suspect her mother's body was somewhere in the house, police said.
   Kelly Tyburski, a 20-year-old art student at Michigan State
University, ``had nightmares or dreams or whatever you want to call
them, that her mother was in a place where she couldn't move, either
tied up or locked up,'' said police Detective Richard Pomorski of
Canton Township, a middle-class community 25 miles west of Detroit.
   She didn't suspect her father until she remembered the freezer
had been used before her mother's disappearance, and the key to it
had disappeared, he said.
   Later, Detective Keith Lazar said, the daughter's dreams gave way
to suspicions when Tyburski began making up stories about why the
key was missing.
   On Monday, she pried the lock off the 15-cubic-foot freezer while
her father was away, police said. She found blood on the lid and
sides and her mother's clothed body bent over meat wrapped in
butcher paper, police said.
   Kelly Tyburski and her 16-year-old sister, Kim, called a friend
who drove them to the police station, ignoring their father as he
returned home, detectives said. Police obtained a warrant and
arrested Tyburski.
   Later, Tyburski told police he killed his wife during an argument
on Sept. 28, 1985, Pomorski said.
   ``It appeared he felt sorry for her,'' Pomorski said. ``He kept
her in the basement for 3{ years. His reason was that he loved her.
He didn't want to part with her.''
   Tyburski's daughters appeared with him during his arraignment but
did not speak with reporters.
   The cause of death remained undetermined pending an autopsy,
Lazar said.
   The couple had been married 17 years when Tyburski reported his
wife missing. Police said Tyburski told them his wife had left
``with the clothes on her back'' after an argument and that she told
him in late October 1985 that she planned to settle in Toledo, Ohio.
   Police had no reason to suspect foul play ``because people leave
home all the time'' Detective Lt. Larry Stewart said. ``We did some
relatively minor checking.''
   Tyburski passed a lie detector test, and later told police and
neighbors his wife had moved to Ohio and that she might have left
because of emotional problems stemming from the death of a sister,
Stewart said.

<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout with new fighting in south Lebanon. No pickup.

<TEXT>
   Fighting flared in south Lebanon today
after Syrian troops moved into neighborhoods on the outskirts of
Beirut to separate rival Shiite Moslem factions who had battled for
five days.
   A police spokesman said 10 combatants were wounded in the mortar
duels in Iklim el-Tiffah, shattering an overnight lull.
   The new casualties increased the overall toll in the five-day
confrontation to 29 killed and 76 wounded.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said it was not known which of the two factions _ the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah or the Syrian-backed Amal _ rekindled the
confrontation just north of Israel's self-designated security zone
in south Lebanon.
   The two factions have been fighting for control of villages
bordering the northwestern edge of the security zone. Amal is
entrenched in the market town of Nabatiyeh and Hezbollah holds
positions in the nearby villages of Jbaa, Ein Bouswar, Jarjou, Arab
Saleem and Louwaizeh.
   In south Beirut's slums, the undeclared truce held, but officials
feared it would not last in the absence of a political settlement of
the power struggle that has raged for nine months.
   The Shiite community's Mufti, or religious judge, said in a
statement: ``The only solution is to disarm the (two) militias.''
   ``Their weapons have become tools for killing children and other
innocent people,'' Sheik Abdul Amir Qabalan said. ``No one should be
allowed to possess weapons in south Beirut except the Syrian
forces.''
   The Syrians, who have had 4,500 troops in south Beirut since the
first round of Hezbollah-Amal fighting last year, moved into the
area at night.
   Soldiers, wearing helmets and armed with AK-47 automatic rifles
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, quietly entered contested
neighborhoods and tore down sandbag barricades the militiamen had
erected when the latest battle began on New Year's Eve, the police
spokesman said.
   He said the Syrian soldiers manned narrow buffer zones separating
the combatants and Syrian officers used loudspeakers to order
militiamen to ``withdraw from the streets and remove military
manifestations.''
   ``Several sand-bagged positions were removed before dawn. Several
gunmen withdrew from the streets. But they gathered at entrances to
buildings or basements,'' the police spokesman said.
   He described the Syrian move as ``another shot of tranquilizers.
The clashes will start again ... if the Syrians do not crack down on
one faction or the other.'' He said the situation in south Lebanon
was ``more delicate'' because there are no Syrian regulars in that
area.
   Many civilians were seen leaving the south Beirut slums for safer
areas in the capital during the lull in fighting today.
   ``They (militias) still have plenty of weapons and ammunition.
They will fight again,'' said Umm Mohammed, a resident of the south
Beirut neighborhood of Haret Hreik.
   ``I'll return to south Beirut only when one of the two factions
smashes the other or when the Syrians disarm both groups,'' she said
at her daughter's home in west Beirut.
   A Syrian military source who demanded anonymity said the army
``will talk to both sides, convince them of certain measures and
deploy on the ground to implement these measures. There is no
decision to crack down on either side.''
   In addition to their contingent in south Beirut, the Syrians have
7,500 troops in west Beirut and 25,000 soldiers in eastern and
northern provinces under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab
League.

   Band leader Xavier Cugat received
emergency treatment for severe lung inflammation at a clinic today,
and his doctors said he responded well.
   Doctors at Quiron Clinic said in a statement that the
89-year-old, Spanish-born musician ``was responding favorably.'' He
was admitted to the clinic's intensive care unit, spokeswoman
Inmaculada Cuenca said.
   Cugat, who is credited with introducing tropical rhythms into
American dance music, entered the clinic Tuesday night suffering
from ``severe lung inflammation and high blood pressure,'' said the
medical statement, which was signed by three doctors.
   Cugat was hospitalized Aug. 24 for heart and respiratory problems
but was released after a 10-day stay.
   At the time, Dr. Jordi Rius identified Cugat's ailment as a
``problem in the left (heart) ventricle probably secondary to a
respiratory infection.''
   Before that he was hospitalized in February for lung congestion.
   Cugat, a U.S. citizen since the age of 12, gave up a 50-year band
career in 1970 and handed over his orchestra to Tito Puente. Ten
years later he returned to Spain, where he was born in the
northeastern town of Gerona on Jan. 1, 1900.
   Cugat and his family left Spain for Cuba when he was 4.
   Since returning to live in Barcelona, Cugat has suffered four
heart attacks and a severe stroke. Nevertheless, he has appeared on
television and radio programs to give occasional interviews.

<HEAD>At Least 16 Injured As Police Chase Stolen Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who led police on a two-state
chase in a stolen bus, ramming cars and injuring 15 people, was
hospitalized under guard today, and transit officials said they
would probably tighten security at depots.
   Glen A. Barhight, 35, of Croydon was arraigned in his hospital
bed Tuesday on 16 charges, including aggravated assault, recklessly
endangering, receiving stolen property and causing a catastrophe.
   The nearly hourlong chase, which began north of Philadelphia and
briefly extended into New Jersey, ended when the bus slammed into a
tree northwest of Philadelphia, said Lower Moreland Police Chief
Frank Amabile.
   ``Thank God for that tree,'' said Richard Campbell, who was
sleeping in a second-floor apartment above a boutique when the bus
hit outside.
   The bus was the second belonging to the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority to be stolen in the past week. On Saturday,
an unidentified person took a bus from a depot, crashed into a dozen
parked cars and fled. No one was injured.
   SEPTA will probably speed up plans to fence in ``problem''
depots, said Howard Patton, chief of the authority's transit police.
   Barhight's attorney, Robert V. McGuckin, said his client was ``a
rather disturbed fellow'' who claimed to hear voices and had tried
suicide at least twice.
   A spokeswoman at Abington Memorial Hospital said Barhight was in
stable condition with a graze wound to his head, abdominal injuries
and cuts to an arm.
   A state trooper fired a shotgun at the bus during the chase,
according to police. But Amabile said Barhight wasn't hit.
   Besides Barhight, those injured were a police officer hit by the
bus at a police roadblock midway through the chase, and 14 occupants
of cars struck by the bus.
   The officer and six of the others were hospitalized. None was
seriously hurt.
   ``It was like something from a horror movie,'' said Mary Beach,
who happened on more than half a dozen wrecked cars on her way to
work. People were walking around dazed, and others lay on the
pavement, she said.

<TEXT>
   The University of Connecticut's fleet is
short one remote-controlled submarine.
   The submarine, insured for $71,100, sank in 378 feet of water on
Dec. 9 off the island of Molokai in Hawaii when its control cable
snapped, officials said.
   The submarine, measuring about 2 feet by 3 feet by 2 feet, is
``essentially a camera with some motors on it,'' Peter J. Auster of
UConn's National Undersea Research Center said today.
   The school said the loss should not affect research projects
planned for this summer in Africa, Israel and off the East Coast.
   UConn had two submarines; the lost vessel was the school's
backup, Auster said. In addition, the university expects deliverty
next month of another submarine, and has only one submarine pilot
anyway, he said.
   The submarine was tethered to a surface ship when its cable
became snagged, Auster said. He said the ship's crew tried to free
the cable, but it broke.
   Auster said a University of Hawaii crew will probably attempt to
recover the vessel next month.
   The vehicle was on loan to the University of Hawaii, which, along
with UConn, is among five U.S. schools with undersea research
centers supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Auster said.

<HEAD>Tentative $97 Million Settlement Reached in Malibu Landslide Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative $97 million settlement reached
with Malibu residents whose expensive homes were damaged in a 1983
landslide may halt what was expected to be one of the longest trials
ever.
   The settlement from the county, the state and insurance companies
was offered Tuesday to about 250 homeowners who blamed the landslide
on a decision to cut into a hillside to build a highway.
   The homeowners will receive an average of about $200,000 if the
offer is approved, said Kenneth Chiate, one of the homeowners and an
attorney in the case. The rest of the settlement goes toward
lawyers' fees.
   ``The vast majority of the homeowners wanted out,'' he said.
``It's been a long five years. No matter how much money we got,
there's no way it could pay for the damage some of them suffered.''
   The trial, which was due to start next month, was expected to
last two to five years and run up nearly $100 million in legal fees.
   Not all the homeowners were happy with the settlement offer.
Actor Pernell Roberts complained that it fails to punish the parties
responsible for the landslide.
   ``We will never have an opportunity to get at the real heart of
the crime,'' he said.
   ``This was a tragic situation where many people will never come
close to being fully compensated for their loss and the people
responsible for what happened will continue to make bad judgments
involving innocent people.''
   The homeowners claimed the slide caused $200 million in damage.
   Thirty homes were condemned. Many have moved several feet toward
the ocean since the slide and owners have been unable to sell, said
attorney Richard Norton, who represented some of the homeowners.
   Under the proposal, the county will pay $35 million. Homeowners
charged that the county helped cause the landslide by approving
development on Big Rock Mesa.
   The state Department of Transportation will pay $15 million in
addition to $25 million it agreed to pay earlier after being found
liable for contributing to the landslide by cutting into the mesa to
build Pacific Coast Highway.
   The homeowners' insurance companies will pay $22 million under
the proposal. However, some of those companies have not agreed to
that amount, Chiate said.
   The cases of 16 families not represented by Chiate or Norton
remain unresolved.
   Under terms of the settlement, the property owners would drop
future claims and the county would be absolved of responsibility.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Vorontsov meeting with foreign

<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Soviet diplomat said today
that unless the fighting stops in Afghanistan, the estimated 50,000
Red Army soldiers who remain there could stay beyond the Feb. 15
withdrawal deadline.
   ``If a cease-fire holds and there is no fighting in Afghanistan,
then that's a very good situation for Soviet forces to leave,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov told reporters as he arrived
in Islamabad.
   Afghan insurgents headquartered in Pakistan have refused to
accept a cease-fire until the current Moscow-backed government in
Kabul steps down.
   Asked whether Soviet troops could overstay the deadline,
Vorontsov said, ``We shall see. ... I don't know.''
   Vorontsov, who is also ambassador to Afghanistan, is searching
for a political consensus that will enable the Soviets to get all
their troops out on schedule and without being attacked along the
way.
   Shortly after arriving, Vorontsov met privately with Pakistan's
foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan. The Soviet official refused
to discuss the substance of the talks but as he left the meeting he
told The Associated Press ``the talks were very interesting and very
useful.''
   When he was asked to elaborate he said, ``We talked about
Soviet-Pakistan relations and Afghanistan.''
   Pakistan's foreign secretary, Humayun Khan, told The AP following
the meeting that ``both sides are trying to work toward a political
solution.''
   Pakistan, along with the United States, has strongly supported
the Afghan insurgents, who began fighting after an April 1978
communist coup.
   About 100,000 Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December
1979 to replace one pro-Moscow regime with another. Under
U.N.-mediated accords, half the troops had left by Aug. 15. The
balance are to be out by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets, who say more than 13,300 of their soldiers have been
killed in the war, have already begun withdrawing troops from the
western Afghan cities of Shindand and Herat, Western diplomats said
Tuesday.
   They also said Soviet civilian advisers are leaving Kabul en
masse and quoted Afghan officials as saying the main Red Army exodus
will begin Jan. 15.
   Vorontsov said today that no further talks have been scheduled
with leaders of the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance, with whom he
met in Saudi Arabia last month in the Kremlin's first official
recognition of the insurgents.
   The guerrilla alliance's chairman, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, told a
news conference Tuesday that he expected to meet Vorontsov on
Friday, but guerrilla sources say some alliance members want no more
meetings with the Soviets.
   The Saudi Arabia meeting was tacit acknowledgment from Moscow
that it is exploring a non-communist alternative to President Najib,
head of the embattled Kabul government.
   Nevertheless, Vorontsov today refused to write off Moscow's
allies in Kabul as participants in a future Afghan government.
   The ruling Marxists ``will survive by all means,'' he said. ``But
they are willing to participate in the creation of a broad-based
government.''
   The seven Pakistan-based guerrilla groups in the alliance, while
divided on most things, agree the Najib regime can play no part in a
post-war Afghanistan.
   Insurgents' claims that the Kabul government will collapse
without Soviet help is ``a big mistake,'' said Vorontsov. ``That's
wishful thinking.''
   Mojaddidi on Tuesday announced a last-minute attempt to form a
transitional government and said a 400-member consultative council
would convene within three weeks.
   Half its members would be drawn from guerrilla commanders
fighting Soviet and Afghan government troops, the rest would include
well-known intellectuals, tribal leaders and ``good Moslems.''
   But it will be difficult to select and convene such a council,
and the resistance movement has scant time to maneuver.
   Vorontsov was in Tehran on Tuesday meeting Iranian-based leaders
of Shiite Moslem Afghan guerrillas, who operate separately from and
have occasionally been at odds with the seven Sunni Moslem groups
based in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar that comprise the
main guerrilla alliance.
   At least 5.5 million Afghans have fled their country during a
decade of civil war, most to Pakistan. The insurgents use border
cities and refugee camps as bases and supply points for operations
inside Afghanistan.

   The founder of a controversial religious
camp for children says he'll disband the group because he can't pay
the bills, but he still supports followers charged with beating his
8-year-old daughter to death.
   Insisting ``I am not a cult leader,'' Eldridge Broussard Jr. said
Tuesday his Ecclesia Athletic Association was running out of money.
   The house in Clackamas where Broussard and his remaining 20
followers are living is up for sale, and he said the electricity was
being turned off at the group's Watts Christian Center in Los
Angeles. Phones at the Los Angeles facility also have been
disconnected.
   Broussard said his organization had been receiving from $8,000 to
$10,000 a month in donations, primarily from five to seven
contributors, when he moved from Los Angeles to northwest Oregon in
1987 with more than 70 adults and children.
   Now, he said, ``we can't pay the bills. ... We're being shut down
from all sides.''
   Broussard, who formed Ecclesia in 1975 to steer inner city youth
away from drugs and crime, said he didn't know where he would go,
but he planned to stay in Oregon and support the four followers
charged in the Oct. 14, 1988, death of his daughter, Dayna Lorea
Broussard.
   The four are awaiting trial on manslaughter charges.
   ``I don't believe that they beat our baby to death,'' Broussard
said.
   The former Pacific University basketball star has said his group
used strict discipline and rigorous training to groom Ecclesia
children for international athletic competition.
   The day after Broussard's daughter died, 53 children staying in
the group's nearby farmhouse were taken into protective custody by
the Oregon Children's Services Division.
   Juvenile authorities maintained the youngsters had been subjected
to ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes and that some had been
forced to watch and keep count as the Broussard's daughter was
beaten.
   Broussard, usually known for his wild gestures and fiery
speeches, sat in a rocking chair with his feet wrapped in a quilt
during the news conference and at one point came close to tears.
   He said he had told the Ecclesia children ``their daddy was going
away for a while,'' and that he was asking his remaining 20
followers to ``distance themselves from me.''

   One of California's biggest health
maintenance organizations says it will no longer serve about 11,000
poor people in the San Francisco Bay area, in part because of the
toll taken by crack.
   Maxicare Executive Director Henry Loubet on Tuesday cited the
high cost of treating infants whose mothers were addicted to the
cocaine derivative.
   The company lost $1.5 million in 1988 on its contract with the
state, which paid Maxicare $10 million to provide health services to
low-income residents in San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa
counties.
   ``In about 30 percent of the deliveries in the East Bay, there
was some relationship'' to cocaine, said Loubet. He said that while
a normal delivery costs about $3,000, a baby affected by cocaine can
cost as much as $150,000.
   The cutoff is service takes effect at the end of the month and
means a clinic in San Francisco and another in Oakland will close on
Jan. 31. Maxicare will lay off about 75 doctors and other employees
at the clinics.
   The company will continue to serve 50,000 members in the Bay area
and Sacramento, said Loubet.

   A senior aide to PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat today accused the Mossad, Israel's secret service, of bombing
Pan Am Flight 103 to counter growing international sympathy for the
Palestinian cause.
   However, Salah Khalaf admitted the PLO did not have concrete
evidence linking the disaster to Israel.
   Khalaf, co-founder of Arafat's Fatah, the mainstream Palestine
Liberation Organization faction, also renewed a PLO offer to help
Washington's probe into the bombing that killed 270 people on Dec.
21.
   The Boeing 747, with 259 people on board, crashed into the town
of Lockerbie, Scotland. All on board and 11 people on the ground
died.
   ``We charge Mossad of carrying out the operation,'' Khalaf said
at a news conference. ``The sole party to benefit from this incident
at this time in particular is Israel because it is seeking to
undercut the prominence that the Palestinian issue has gained
internationally.''
   The inquiry into the bombing has focused in part on Palestinian
extremists opposed to Arafat's recent peace overtures, which include
recognition of Israel, and on Iranian-linked Moslem fundamentalists.
   Among those mentioned as possibly being involved is Ahmed Jibril,
a former Syrian army captain who leads a Libyan-funded, Syria-based
PLO splinter group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Jibril's group has denied involvement in the incident.
   ``We have expressed readiness to exchange information about this
incident or any other, because we are definitely against
terrorism,'' Khalaf said. ``But until now, there have been no
contacts by the United States with us to translate this into
action.''
   An adviser to Arafat, Khaled Hassan, told the London Channel 4
Commercial Television Network on Tuesday that if the perpetrators
were Palestinians and were caught, Arafat would ``put them in front
of the court.''
   Khalaf, commenting on that remark, said: ``We are not yet in a
position to put anyone on trial...we can't even lay our hands on
Ahmed Jibril.''

<TEXT>
   Episcopal bishops are expected to act quickly to
confirm the election of the Anglican Church's first woman bishop now
that standing committees around the country have provided the
necessary supporting votes.
   The Rev. Barbara Harris, a priest in Philadelphia, passed the
milestone late Tuesday when an envelope arrived at the Episcopal
Diocese of Boston containing the 60th vote of support from the 118
standing committees.
   Harris needed the approval of a majority of the committees, or
more than 59 votes.
   The Boston diocese named Harris suffragan, or assistant bishop,
on Sept. 24. Months of debate followed, with several factions
opposing the election because of her sex.
   James Solheim, spokesman for the diocese, said Harris had won
support from roughly two out of three standing committees as of
Tuesday.
   The vote was ``the only serious obstacle to her consecration,''
he said. ``The expectation is that the bishops will vote quickly and
affirmatively.''
   The bishops' balloting will be conducted by mail, and the process
is expected to begin shortly, Solheim said.
   One reason Harris is expected to win support of a majority of
Episcopal bishops is that they themselves voted in 1976 to allow
women priests and bishops.
   Women have been priests since then, but Harris would be the first
female bishop in any branch of worldwide Anglicanism.
   Bishop David E. Johnson of the Boston diocese said in a
statement, ``I am especially delighted for Barbara that the church
has endorsed her for this new ministry, and it's an exciting way for
us to move into the new year.''
   Harris did not return a message left at her office at the
Episcopal Church Publishing Co. in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Her home
number has been changed three times because of death threats related
to her election, Solheim said.
   Harris' mother and the Boston diocese said she was traveling to
Boston.
   Harris, 58, is executive director of the publishing house and
interim rector of the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia. In
recent months, she has declined to comment until the standing
committees and the bishops confirm her election.
   Each standing committee consists of four lay members and four
members of the clergy.

   A woman accused of forcing her two
children to drink windshield wiper fluid has been sentenced to four
months in jail.
   Judge Robert W. Tyson Jr. on Tuesday also placed Benita Wege, 36,
on probation for five years on her no-contest plea to two counts of
child abuse.
   Her children, Brent, 8, and Brigitte, 7, were hospitalized in
critical condition along with their mother after drinking the fluid.
All three recovered. The fluid contained methyl alcohol, which can
cause blindness or death.
   Mrs. Wege and her husband were obtaining a divorce and had just
fought Feb. 2 when she and the children checked into a Coral Springs
hotel, where she gave them a mixture of wiper fluid and fruit juice,
authorities said.
   According to police, Brent said his mother told the children,
``We're going to have a party, and if we drink the blue stuff, we'll
sleep better.''
   He also told police his mother threatened to ``pour it down our
throats'' if the children didn't drink it.
   She and her husband later reconciled. Alan Wege said his wife was
punished too harshly.
   ``She should not be taken from her children,'' he said.

   Two student journalists have been ordered
reinstated at Dartmouth College by a judge who said their
suspensions were tainted by bias against the off-campus,
conservative weekly for which they worked.
   Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl on Tuesday said he found ``no
persuasive evidence'' that the students were actually punished for
their association with The Darmouth Review.
   But he said one member of the panel that disciplined Review
editors Christopher Baldwin and John Sutter harbored ``substantial
bias and prejudice'' against the weekly.
   As a result, he ordered the Ivy League school to reinstate the
two, who could be disciplined again by a reconstituted disciplinary
panel.
   Mohl's ruling ends the first skirmish on what he described as ``a
massive legal battleground'' in which the students, backed by
prominent conservatives including William F. Buckley Jr. and William
Simon, say that Dartmouth discriminates against conservatives.
   Mohl generally did not address First Amendment claims and other
core issues in the students' pending state and federal lawsuits.
   They were suspended in March for 18 months for harassment for
their role in a classroom confrontation with a black music
professor, William Cole. A third Review staffer involved completed
his six-month suspension; a fourth served probation.
   The students, who are white, denied any racial motivation, but
the incident heightened racial tension on the Hanover campus, where
Baldwin and other students, most of them Review staffers, were
disciplined for a nighttime sledgehammer attack on anti-apartheid
shanties on campus in 1986.
   Late Tuesday, Dartmouth had not decided how to respond to the
ruling.
   ``Although the court has temporarily set aside the disciplinary
committee's decision, we welcome the court's findings that the
college has safeguarded the students' rights and that the college's
discplinary procedures are fair,'' said spokesman Alex Huppe.
   Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale, Ill., and Sutter, 22, of St. Louis,
will return to campus late this week for the term that began Tuesday
after tying up loose ends at their jobs in New York, one of their
lawyers, Francis Murphy, said today.
   ``The students are overjoyed with the decision,'' said Murphy.
``They've missed Dartmouth greatly.''
   Mohl ruled that film professor Albert LaValley's presence on the
nine-member disciplinary panel ``was fundamentally unfair'' to the
students.
   The students questioned his objectivity because four months
before the classroom confrontation he signed a letter condemning the
Review for ``slanderous articles'' that ``seriously threatened the
principle of academic freedom.''
   Mohl did not judge other issues in the case, such as whether the
suspensions were supported by the evidence or were unduly harsh or
discriminatory.
   But he dismissed claims that two other panel members were biased
and that yet another member, who dropped off the panel before it
began deliberating, prejudiced the outcome by participating at all.
   Mohl concluded by scolding all the participants in the Feb. 25
confrontation in Cole's classroom.
   ``It cannot help but be noted that had greater civility and less
discourtesy been observed by ALL the participants in that brief
encounter ... an exhaustive expenditure of human and financial
assets might well have been avoided,'' Mohl wrote, underlining
``all.''

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi asked
Moscow to help prevent a possible U.S.-Libyan clash in the
Mediterranean by sending ships to an area of planned U.S. maneuvers,
the Tanjug news agency said today.
   The report from Tripoli, which gave no source for its
information, was apparently filed shortly after the United States
announced it had shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the
Mediterranean.
   Tanjug said the news ``was neither confirmed nor denied in
Libya.'' Libyan radio later reported the attack.
   Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, did not say when
Gadhafi had asked the Kremlin to intervene.
   ``The Libyan leader, reacting to the news about American
movements in the Mediterranean, asked Moscow to send part of its
Mediterranean fleet to the area of forthcoming American maneuvers to
avoid direct Libyan-American clashes, which could serve as an excuse
for new American and possibly Israeli attacks on vital targets in
Libya,'' Tanjug said.
   The news agency has a correspondent in Tripoli, and his reports
have often proved reliable.
   Tanjug did not specify which part of the Mediterranean Gadhafi
had in mind or how many Soviet ships he wanted to see moved.
   In Naples, Italy, U.S. Navy spokesman Lt. David Morris said the
Soviets routinely have a presence in the Mediterranean but that he
did not have specifics on the number or type of Soviet vessels there
now.
   Tanjug reported Libya had taken heavy military precautions
following word of U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean.
   Gadhafi's residence in Tripoli has been turned into a
``fortress'' with new tank and anti-aircraft reinforcements, Tanjug
reported.
   Additional anti-aircraft batteries have been placed on the roof,
Tanjug said, adding that French-built anti-aircraft missiles have
been mounted.
   The mobilization of Libya's reserve troops has reportedly been
ordered and military aircraft based at airfields on the
Mediterranean coast have been moved inland to points in the Sahara
desert, Tanjug said.
   Guns have been mounted in the streets at key intersections, and
Gadhafi's personal guard has taken over duties from traffic police
who normally regulate the movement of vehicles, the anency said.
   The correspondent also said he had learned that Col. Junis
Jabber, the commander of Libya's armed forces, may have lost his job
in an ongoing reorganization of the country's military strength. He
gave no sources for that aspect of the report.

   Israel's two largest political parties are
trying to prevent disclosure of the names of major campaign
contributors, a move denounced by one opposition lawmaker today as
``scandalous behavior.''
   Israeli law does not require disclosure of campaign
contributions, and the total amount of money raised by the parties
for the 1988 campaign is not known.
   But as much as one-third of the money reportedly comes from the
United States and other foreign countries.
   The controversy arose when State Comptroller Miriam Ben-Porat
announced that in her 1988 report she planned to name every
contributor who donated more than 50,000 shekels ($27,800) to one or
more political parties.
   The report would cover the recent parliamentary election.
   In response, the right-wing Likud bloc and the left-of-center
Labor Party introduced a joint bill that would give the parliament
speaker sole authority to publish the comptroller's report on
election financing and allow the speaker to withhold parts of it.
The speaker is always a member of the largest party, and the
position long has been controlled by Labor or Likud.
   Ms. Ben-Porat met with parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky of Likud
this week to express reservations about the proposed law, the
Jerusalem Post said.
   Shlomit Lavy, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, refused
to comment on the report.
   Spokesmen for Labor and Likud, who recently formed a new
coalition government, did not return telephone messages at their
offices.
   Parliament member Amnon Rubinstein of the left-leaning Shinui
Party today criticized the Labor-Likud proposal.
   ``To me, that is scandalous behavior,'' he said. ``We are talking
about millions of dollars the parties have received from big
business. The very fact that they want to conceal it speaks for
itself.''
   Rubinstein said the system opened the door to corruption.
``Somebody who gives huge sums expects the party to give him
preferential treatment,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``The fat cats abroad often give huge sums to both of the big
parties and then they make sure they get their outlay back in
investments, concessions and other financial privileges,''
Rubinstein told the Jerusalem Post.
   At the time of the 1988 campaign, Israeli media reports said
Swiss businessman Bruce Rappoport donated $1.5 million to Labor, and
U.S. millionaire Meshulam Riklis gave $1 million to Likud.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres raised $2 million during a nine-day
trip to the United States in 1988, and Likud legislator Binyamin
Netanyahu gained nearly $1 million for his party during a similar
visits, reports said.
   Rubinstein said he has pushed for a 30,000-shekel ($16,700)
ceiling on single contributions and a requirement that all
contributions be made public, but that the proposals were killed in
committee.
   U.S. law forbids donations from foreign nationals and limits
individual contributions to $1,000 and donations of political action
committees to $5,000. Public disclosure is required.

   Immigration agents looking for illegal
aliens at workplaces misused search warrants and questioned anyone
who looked Hispanic, even if the warrants named only one or two
people, civil rights attorneys charged.
   As a trial over the way the Immigration and Naturalization
Service conducts workplace raids opened Tuesday, civil rights
attorneys argued for strict regulations on agents who go to
factories and farms in search of illegal aliens.
   The trial is expected to last several months. U.S. District Judge
Robert Aguilar is presiding.
   ``Witnesses will establish that there is a consistent pattern of
non-specific or general warrants,'' said Suzanne Needles,
spokeswoman for the Employment Law Office of the San Francisco Legal
Aid Soiety.
   ``A warrant would name two persons, but the INS would arrive with
as many as 20 agents with guns drawn and visible, approach the
property at high speed, locate the two persons named, and then
approach anyone who appeared to be Hispanic.''
   U.S. citizens as well as undocumented aliens have been detained,
she said.
   According to court papers, in 25 northern California raids the
INS cited 32 people in search warrants but made 481 arrests.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, representing the INS, contended
the agency has the right to enter a workplace with a warrant based
on information that illegal aliens are there. Once inside, agents
can question and arrest aliens for cause, even if those aliens are
not named in the warrant, he said.
   ``The INS used the warrants of inspection solely for entry
purposes and, after entry, independently developed the probable
cause to arrest illegal aliens,'' Russoniello said in papers filed
with the court. He also said the INS practices have been upheld by
other courts.
   Although the case affects the INS only in northern and central
California, lawyers in the case said it could be influential
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Reagan Awakened With News of Shootdown of Navy Planes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts graf 5, Reagan was awakened, to say Reagan told one
hour after today's incident, versus more than six hours after earlier.</HEAD>

   President Reagan was awakened early today with
the news that U.S. Navy planes, acting in ``self defense,'' had shot
down two Libyan fighter jets that Pentagon officials said had turned
on the American aircraft.
   White House spokesman Roman Ropadiuk said Reagan, vacationing at
his new Bel Air home, was informed about the 5 a.m. EST incident by
national security adviser Colin L. Powell.
   Popadiuk said Powell telephoned the president after conferring
with White House Chief of Staff Kenneth N. Duberstein.
   The White House staff had come under fire in August 1981 after
failing to awaken Reagan after a similar encounter between U.S. and
Libyan jets.
   Reagan was awakened about an hour after today's incident, in
contrast to theprevious episode, when he was not told for more than
six hours.
   Describing the latest incident, Popadiuk said two F-14 jet
fighters ``were conducting routine defensive patrols from the USS
John F. Kennedy in the Mediterranean.''
   ``The Libyan aircraft approached the U.S. aircraft in a hostile
manner over international waters and the U.S. aircraft, acting in
self-defense, fired air-to-air missiles, downing both of the Libyan
aircraft,'' said Popadiuk.
   There were no reported U.S. injuries.
   A Pentagon spokesman said the American planes were not in the
Mediterranean because of increased tension between Libya and the
United States over a plant U.S. officials claim Libya is using to
produce chemical weapons.
   That spokesman, Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, said the F-14s fired after
they were approached at high speed by the Soviet-built MiG-23s ``in
the middle of the Mediterranean.'' Other Pentagon sources said the
Libyan pilots turned on the F-14s and activated their targeting
radar.
   U.S. officials have said they have proof Libya has started
producing small amounts of chemical weapons, but they are still
debating whether to try to stop it by force or by international
diplomatic pressure.
   The Reagan administration has sought to deter Libya from
producing the lethal arms and to stop other countries from providing
the Libyans with expertise and equipment.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., today urged the administration to
exhaust all diplomatic attempts before turning to a military
response.
   ``This is a problem for us to be sure. But it's also a problem
for other countries,'' Solarz said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.''
   ``So let's, before we act unilaterally here, first make an effort
to see whether other countries are willing to join with us,'' he
said. ``First diplomatically, and then, if necessary, militarily as
well.''
   Libya contends the facility which the United States has
designated as a chemical weapons plant _ near the town of Rabta
about 35 miles southwest of the capital Tripoli _ is only a medicine
factory. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has offered to open the plant
to international inspection, but Washington rejected the idea.
   Gadhafi has launched an international campaign of his own to
refute the U.S. assertions, saying the United States wants an excuse
to attack his country, as it did in 1986, and to kill him. The 1986
air raids, against barracks, living quarters and other installations
at Tripoli and the coastal city of Benghazi, came after the Reagan
administration accused Libya of having orchestrated the bombing of a
West Berlin discotheque patronized by American servicemen.
   Several countries, including West Germany, have voiced skepticism
about the latest U.S. claims. But Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, heading a U.S. delegation to an international conference
beginning Saturday in Paris on chemical weapons, will push the
American case while ``there is still time to do something about
it,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``Western assistance, in terms of technology, expertise,
materials, is still required if this plant is going to sustain
limited production, certainly if it's going to be able to produce on
a full-scale basis,'' said Redman.
   The New York Times in today's editions and ABC-TV on Tuesday
night reported that Libya has been moving chemicals needed for the
production of poison gas out of the plant in recent days, perhaps to
clear away evidence before an international inspection. Both reports
quoted unidentified U.S. officials.
   There was a spill of toxic chemicals at the plant during an
operational test run last summer, the Washington Post reported in
today's editions. The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying
that few details were known about the spill.

   Two consultants made periodic $1,000 payments to
a Navy official to help Hazeltine Corp. get inside information to
compete for a multimillion-dollar Navy contract, court papers allege.
   The documents _ a warrant to search Hazeltine's offices in
Greenlawn and an affidavit supporting the warrant request _ were
unsealed Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   According to the papers, consultant William Parkin was hired by
Hazeltine in 1986 to help the company win a $15.9 million Navy
contract, called UPM-150, to build a battlefield air-traffic control
system.
   Parkin split his $1,000-a-month payment from Hazeltine with
another consultant, Fred Lackner, who contacted Stuart Berlin, a
Navy procurement specialist with the Naval Air Systems Command.
Every few months the consultants gave $1,000 to Berlin, the
government documents said.
   ``Berlin apparently played a significant role in the development
of the UPM-150 RFP (request for proposal) and provided inside
information to Lackner for Hazeltine's use,'' the papers said.
``Lackner once told Parkin that the information Berlin provided was
information that the company could not obtain on its own.''
   The affidavit was based in part on conversations recorded from
Parkin's phone.
   The court papers were unsealed because prosecutors looking into
fraud and bribery in the procurement of Pentagon contracts said the
investigation phase of their case was complete and the affidavits no
longer needed to be secret. The search warrant was executed in June.
   Gerard Treanor, Parkin's lawyer, said, ``Our position is that the
government can try the case outside the courtroom, but Parkin is
going to be found innocent before a jury.''
   In Alexandria, Va., additional court documents were released late
Tuesday. Others are under seal in St. Louis, Minneapolis and Los
Angeles.
   Among the Alexandria documents was a search warrant of Parkin's
house in which investigators said the consultant may have been
engaged in criminal activity before he retired from the Pentagon in
1983.
   Telephone intercepts and recorded conversations ``indicated that
Parkin's business has been criminal prior to beginning his
consulting business. He has said that he was helping other
consultants make money while working'' at the Pentagon ``by
providing them with information,'' the document said.
   Parkin ``also mentioned working for companies directly while in
government,'' it said.
   A grand jury in Alexandria is expected to hand up indictments in
the case soon, possibly as early as this week.
   Parkin, a known target of the Pentagon procurement probe, had
been employed by the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project Office from
1977 to 1983.
   Hazeltine, a subsidiary of the St. Louis-based Emerson Electric,
makes electronics communications in its Greenlawn plant.
   Lt. Brian Cullin, a Navy spokesman, said Hazeltine and another
contractor, Gould Inc., had been the final two competitors for the
UPM-150 contract, which he said has not yet been awarded.
   Berlin has been transferred to a non-contracting position in the
Navy, Cullin said.
   The papers also briefly mentioned two other military contracts
involving Hazeltine and another consultant, Thomas Muldoon.
   Muldoon had been hired by Hazeltine in 1987 in connection with a
Marine Corps digital wide-band transmission system contract called
MRC 139, the affidavit said.
   It was alleged that Muldoon had discussed various bids for the
initial $1 million phase of the project with yet another consultant,
Mark Saunders.
   Investigators said in the papers that Saunders received the bid
information from George Stone, a Navy employee who previously was
director of the office of management ervices in the contracts
division of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.
   Stone has been suspended without pay from the Navy, Cullin said.
   The third contract involved the Navy's Secure Tranceiver and
Ancillaric Equipments program. The affidavit alleged that Parkin and
Muldoon discussed bids made for that project prior to their being
made public.
   Cullin said that Hazeltine is one of several contractors placed
on a certification list, which requires companies to certify in
writing that they have not done anything improper in obtaining
advance information about a contract.
   He said the Navy may impose harsher restrictions on Hazeltine.

   With the crack of gavels and the tinkling of
ice against party glasses, Congress is back, celebrating the
bicentennial of its first session in 1789 and looking to the future.
   Back, with members talking about what to do about the budget
deficit and under what circumstances to accept a pay raise or
whether or not the military base-closing list submitted by an
independent commission should be accepted as is.
   Back, with the majority Democrats extending what amounts to an
olive branch to the Republican White House soon to be run by George
Herbert Walker Bush.
   Back, with Bush swearing in 31 newly elected and re-elected
senators and one man appointed to the job.
   Back, with new senators and House members holding party after
party to celebrate election successes.
   Back, with one prominent exception.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., due to be sworn in for the sixth
time, chose instead to be in Providence, R.I., to see his son,
Patrick, sworn in as a member of the state Legislature.
   ``That's something that as a proud father he could not miss,''
said Melody Miller, a Kennedy staff member.
   In the Old Senate Chamber, used by that body from 1810 to 1859,
President-elect Bush administered at least one oath that wasn't on
the schedule.
   Bush, soon to be the nation's 41st president, turned to the
photographers surrounding him and asked them to raise their right
hands and to swear an oath _ an oath of good conduct and flattering
photographs _ during his administration.
   The moment came in a banter-filled pause during the ceremonial
reenactment of the oath of office for senators.
   On the Senate floor, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, switched desks
with newly elected Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., giving Mack a desk once
held by a family member, a senator from Texas.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., led newly elected Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., down the aisle and seated him behind the desk
occupied by Dodd's father, the late Sen. Tom Dodd, D-Conn. The
senior Sen. Dodd held the seat from 1958 until he was defeated in
1970 by former Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.
   Lieberman ended Weicker's three-term Senate career on Nov. 8.
   It's the 101st two-year Congress, the bicentennial Congress, 200
years since the first Congress convened in New York City in 1789.
   Rep. Bob Michel, R-Ill., remembered the description of the first,
1789 House of Representatives offered by Rep. Fisher Ames of
Massachusetts:
   ``The House is composed of sober, solid folks. There are few
geniuses; there are many who have experience, the virtues of the
heart and the habits of business.''
   Not much has changed, Michel said.
   ``Perhaps we are not the shining geniuses some others in this
town think they are,'' Michel said. ``But our members continue to be
solid and hardworking, and we still bring to this House from our
home towns the virtues of the heart.''
   The day saw Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, re-elected as Speaker of
the Democratic-controlled House. Wright defeated Michel on a
partisan tally, 253-170.
   Michel said he is ``the first man in our history to suffer the
indignity of losing this contest for speaker five times in a row.''
   Scores of members' small children dressed in their
starched-and-pressed finest were on hand as the House opened its
session precisely at noon.
   But soon some were squirming on their parents' laps or crawling
over the seat backs and along the floor.
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., placed a toddler on the Republican
committee table. The child walked along its length, holding onto the
congressman's lapels for support.
   One freshman congressman, Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., was seen
standing in a sixth-floor corridor of the Longworth House Office
Building looking at directional signs and muttering to himself.
   ``Sixteeen-oh-five, 1605,'' Poshard said. ``It's got to be around
here somewhere. Which way?''
   A reporter escorted the new congressman to his office.
   In the Senate, children and other senatorial relatives and
friends were confined to the galleries, filling every seat.
   Lady Bird Johnson, sitting near her daughter Lynda, watched
son-in-law Charles Rob take the oath of office as a U.S. senator
from Virginia.
   The ceremony occurred on the 40th anniversary of the day her
husband, the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, first took his oath
as a U.S. senator.
   The Senate chamber was resplendent.
   Since the 100th Congress adjourned in October a patterned,
dark-blue carpet had been laid, the presiding officer's chair framed
with a backdrop of gold curtains bordered with blue and red, and the
staff benches in the corners of the chamber upholstered in brilliant
scarlet.
   ``It's obviously all been done for television,'' Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., told a group of constituents.
   The convening of the 101st Congress marked a changing of the
guard in the Senate.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, is taking over as majority leader
from Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Byrd said the burdens of leadership had been lifted.
   ``The bags under my eyes are gone,'' he said.
   Mitchell said he finds his new responsibilities to be challenging.
   ``I'm not only learning something new every day; I'm learning
something new every 10 or 15 minutes,'' he said.
   One new senator, Republican Conrad Burns of Montana, came to
Washington from his only other public office: Commissioner of
Yellowstone County.
   What are the differences between the two jobs?
   ``Bigger zeroes,'' Burns replied.''

   Leaders of the newly-convened 101st Congress
are speaking kindly of president-elect Bush, and they're talking
about cleaning up Capitol Hill's image of corruption _ especially if
they can get a pay raise, too.
   The ceremonial start of the new session on Tuesday gushed with
optimism about what could be accomplished in the next two years,
with the Congress more firmly in Democratic control and with a new
Republican in the White House.
   ``By working together, we can help our new president fulfill his
beautiful promise of a kinder, gentler America,'' said Rep. Jim
Wright, D-Texas, upon his re-election Tuesday as Speaker of the
House.
   On the other side of the Capitol, Bush, in his role of vice
president, administered the oath of office to new and re-elected
senators. Former Majority leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., was
elected president pro tempore of the Senate, as George Mitchell,
D-Maine, took the floor in Byrd's old role.
   In a sign of cooperation, Senate leaders are arranging to speed
up work on confirming Bush's appointments. Hearings on Secretary of
State-designate James A. Baker III are scheduled to start Jan. 17 _
three days before Bush becomes president and can send the nomination
to Congress.
   Today, Bush leads a joint session of Congress to count the
electoral votes that will make him president on Jan. 20.
   Wright pledged ``the earnest and unstinting cooperation of the
leadership of this House'' in helping Bush with his foreign policy
goals, and the speaker even thanked his outgoing adversary,
President Reagan, for his international successes and ``encouraging
the growth and sustenance of politial freedom in countries
throughout the world.''
   The speaker listed the federal budget and trade deficits and a
myriad of social needs as requiring bipartisan cooperation.
   And he announced that he and Republican leader Bob Michel,
R-Ill., will soon appoint a bipartisan panel to review the House's
ethics code.
   Wright himself is at the center of an ethics storm in the
Congress. The House ethics committee is investigating allegations
that Wright misused his office for personal gain, and that he
revealed government secrets.
   Four House incumbents were defeated in the last election after
questions were raised about their personal or campaign finances.
Reps. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., and Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., both
re-elected, currently are under indictment on criminal charges.
   Concurrent with the ethics controversy is a new proposal to give
lawmakers a pay raise of up to 50 percent, and the two issues have
become intertwined.
   A presidential advisory board has recommended increasing pay for
awmakers from the current $89,500 to $135,000, but it said at the
same time House and Senate members should be banned from accepting
fees for their speeches. Critics contend that allowing members to
pocket up to $2,000 for their speeches _ often to lobbying groups _
reinforces the public's low opinion of Capitol Hill ethics.
   Reagan is expected to propose soon a pay raise smaller than the
commission recommended, and that raise would take effect March 1
unless both houses of Congress first vote it down.
   ``If the president goes ahead and proposes a pay raise we're
prepared to go ahead and eliminate the honorariums,'' said Rep. Tony
Coelho of California, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.
   Democratic leaders hope to avoid making members vote on the pay
raise, but Republican Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa announced Tuesday that
he was introducing legislation, with the support of three dozen
lawmakers from both parties, to prevent any sidestepping.
   The bill would prevent Congress from taking a pay raise without
voting on it first, and would delay the boost until after the next
election.
   ``This legislation not only prevents members from voting for a
pay increase for themselves during their current term of office, it
would also require each member to take a public stand on this
issue,'' he said. ``At the very least, we owe this to our
constituents.''
   Talk of a tax increase _ something Bush has vowed to fight _ also
cropped up as Congress launched another year of battling the federal
budget deficit. But leaders refused to let such seriousness
interfere with the pomp of the first day.
   As the top Republican and Democratic officers from both chambers
gathered to receive a ceremonial phone call from Reagan, reporters
asked about the chances for a tax boost this year.
   The leaders just laughed.

   Soviet media rapidly reported the downing of two
Libyan jet fighters by U.S. Navy warplanes today and made light of
American charges that Libya is producing chemical weapons.
   Tass, the official news agency, moved its first report on the
incident as a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry press center was
ending.
   That dispatch, based on an Associated Press report from
Washington, did not repeat the U.S. claim that the Navy jets
attacked the aircraft after being threatened by them over the
Mediterranean.
   Earlier, morning newspapers warned of an impending U.S. military
attack on Libya.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said any unprovoked
attack on the North African nation would merit worldwide
condemnation.
   Gremitskikh, speaking at the news briefing before reports of the
Mediterranean incident had been confirmed, blamed increasing
tensions in the region on foes of a Middle East settlement.
   ``I believe someone just doesn't like the beginning of
U.S.-Palestinian dialogue and prospects of moving the Israeli-Arab
conflict off dead center,'' he said.
   ``In such circumstances, any unprovoked military action, wherever
it comes from, would deal a very serious blow to the process of
improving the international climate and would deserve condemnation
from the international community, including the Soviet Union,''
Gremitskikh added.
   The Tass dispatch refrained from any commentary, echoing
restraint voiced by the Soviet press in earlier reports about
mounting U.S.-Libyan tensions.
   Despite the Kremlin's public professions of support for Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, Soviet officials privately say they consider
him impetuous and unreliable.
   U.S. officials say Libya has begun production of chemical weapons
at a plant south of the capital, Tripoli. The officials, including
President Reagan, have indicated a military strike on the plant is
under consideration.
   Radio Moscow, in its report on the incident, called U.S. charges
about the plant ``groundless.''
   Gremitskikh noted that Libya has denied any intent of
manufacturing chemical weapons and that Gadhafi offered to open the
suspect plant to U.S. inspectors.
   He would not say if the Libyans have requested military aid from
the Soviets to meet any U.S. attack.
   Soviet newspapers today warned of an impending U.S. attack on
Libya and made light of the Reagan administration's charges that the
North African nation has begun producing chemical weapons.
   ``Washington's current anti-Libyan campaign is a relapse of the
notorious `aircraft carrier policy' that the United States does not
at all want to renounce,'' the military daily Red Star claimed.
   Pravda said the U.S. accusations were designed to detract
attention from peace and disarmament proposals that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev made in a speech to the United Nations last
month.
   ``Generally, this is a well-known scenario,'' the Communist Party
daily added.
   The newspapers used relatively restrained language, which could
indicate Soviet wariness about allowing the dispute to damage
superpower relations.
   Both Pravda and Red Star printed photographs of the U.S.
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which the
military daily said was leading a 13-ship U.S. battle group toward
the Mediterranean.
   The Pentagon says the ship movements are part of a routine
rotation of forces. But Pravda headlined its report ``U.S.A. Is
Preparing a Blow Against Libya.''
   Pravda reminded readers of the ``barbaric air raids'' by U.S.
warplanes against Libya in April 1986 that killed at least 100
people. It said the American ``air pirates'' had then killed women,
children and old people.
   The North African nation, it said, ``has not by chance been
chosen again as the target of American interference.''
   It said Americans had long been subjected to the stereotype of a
``Libyan enemy,'' and that it was easy for the U.S. government to
revive its ``anti-Libyan campaign.''

   Some 2,000 teachers went on strike today,
closing the city's 34,000-student school system.
   The walkout began after talks failed to produce a new contract.
   Officials said they planned to keep the schools closed for the
duration of the strike but would re-evaluate the decision on a
day-to-day basis.
   Negotiators had agreed to continue talks past a midnight strike
deadline, but mediator David Thorley said the teachers walked out
because the two sides were nearly as far apart today as they were
when the session began Tuesday morning.
   The mediator said he would call for another session in a few days.
   The chief issue dividing the two sides is pay.
   The union asked for a 3 percent raise the first year of a
three-year contract and raises of at least 4 percent in the second
and third years. The board offered 2.5 percent the first year, 3.2
percent the second and 4 percent the third.
   About two dozen teachers picketed early today at some of the
district's larger buildings, said Janna Bruner, union
secretary-treasurer.
   Striking teachers did not impede other employees from entering,
said Joann Robb, a district spokeswoman. ``Everyone's behaving like
professionals,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Packed into a church, clustered among
tombstones or seated in overflow halls, relatives and townspeople
wept and prayed today for the dead of bombed Flight 103 as a
minister urged them to turn their thoughts away from vengeance.
   Lockerbie, the town where most of the Pan Am Boeing 747 crashed
after being blown apart by a bomb, came to a standstill for the
40-minute service for the 259 people killed aboard the plane and the
11 residents who died on the ground.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in black coat and hat, and her
husband Denis joined the other mourners, who packed into Dryfesdale
Parish Church, clustered among nearby tombstones or sat in crowded
hallways.
   The local people, dignitaries, relatives and Pan Am staff members
flown in by the airline for the service sang hymns and prayed.
   Afterward, the 63-year-old prime minister, who visited the crash
site the morning after the disaster, met privately with the
relatives in a school.
   Investigators have concluded a bomb blew up the plane, and
suspicions have focused on Middle Eastern terrorists, prompting Mrs.
Thatcher to advise the United States publicly against ``eye for an
eye'' retaliation.
   The Right Rev. James Whyte, moderator of the Church of Scotland,
echoed that advice.
   ``Justice, yes. Retaliation, no,'' he told the congregation from
the church's marble pulpit.
   ``We may be tempted, indeed urged by some, to flex our muscles in
response, to show that we are men,'' Whyte said.
   ``To show that we are what? To show that we are prepared to let
more young and more innocent die, to let more rescue workers labor
in more wreckage to find the grisly proof, not of our virility, but
of our inhumanity.
   ``That is what retaliation means. I, for one, will have none of
it, and I hope you will not either.''
   The simple, dignified service was televised live to the nation,
and to mourners gathered in a local cinema, community hall and
church.
   Many preferred to stand in the chilly rain among the old granite
tombstones outside the church, huddled under umbrellas, dressed in
windbreakers and cloth caps.
   The lights of the austere, Presbyterian church shone brightly
into the gathering afternoon gloom, and sheep grazed in a field
nearby. The Union Jack flew at half-staff.
   Inside the 91-year-old sandstone church, a man cradled his wife's
head as they sang a hymn, and a baby slept on its father's shoulder.
   For the first time in two weeks, the skies of Lockerbie were
silent, empty of the helicopters that have led a massive search for
wreckage and bodies over 150 square miles of countryside.
   Outside the town hall which has become a makeshift mortuary,
wreaths lined the sidewalk, and more bouquets were laid outside the
church.
   Pan Am said it flew several hundred employees and relatives of
victims to Lockerbie, including Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett.
Many employees wore the airline uniform at the service.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, also
attended, and U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II read one of the
lessons, from the Gospel according to St. John.
   Lockerbie's three churches, each of which lost parishioners in
Britain's worst air disaster, joined together for the memorial.
   The Rev. James Annand, minister of the Dryfesdale Church, was
joined in offering prayers by Lockerbie's two other ministers _ the
Rev. Patrick Keegans of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church and the
Rev. Alan Neal of the Anglican All Saints parish church.
   Also present were Lord Jakobovits, chief rabbi of the United
Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth; the Most Rev.
Edward Luscombe, primate of the Scottish Episcopal Church; and the
Most Rev. Thomas Winning, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow.
   The Boeing 747 was torn apart by a bomb on Dec. 21 as it reached
cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. Wreckage hit homes in Lockerbie,
and the fuel-laden wings exploded in a deadly pillar of fire.
   As search teams continued to hunt for wreckage and victims,
police said 126 of the 242 bodies recovered from the crash had been
released to relatives.
   But police said Tuesday they now see little chance of finding the
missing bodies of 20 passengers and eight local residents. They are
believed to have died in the Sherwood Crescent area of Lockerbie,
where parts of the plane's fuselage and wings crashed, forming a
30-foot-deep crater.
   Between 80 and 90 percent of the plane has been found, but only
20 percent of it has been picked up, police said. Much of it is in
inaccessible countryside.
   The body of Capt. James MacQuarrie, the pilot of Flight 103, was
cremated at Carlisle, 25 miles southeast of Lockerbie, on Friday
without publicity, said a Pan Am spokesman. The spokesman, who
demanded anonymity, said his ashes were carried back to the United
States by another unidentified Pan Am captain.

<HEAD>Germany: No Evidence Company Helped Build Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Libya-Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
said today the federal government has no evidence that a West German
company helped Libya build a plant to produce chemical weapons.
   Another official, a spokesman for Genscher, later said West
Germany had asked the United States for ``additional material'' to
back up claims that a German company helped build the plant.
   Genscher before the Pentagon announced in Washington that U.S.
warplanes today shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the
Mediterranean. U.S.-Libyan tensions have been building over American
claims that the Libyans have built a plant to make chemical weapons.
   Speaking at a news conference in Bonn, Genscher said the
government ``took very seriously'' allegations that the
Imhausen-Chemie company in southwest Baden-Wuerttemberg state was
involved in the Libyan plant.
   The foreign minister said that two days after he and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl were informed Nov. 16 of U.S. suspicions that Libya had
been helped by the West German company, the government's security
council met to discuss the matter.
   Genscher declined to disclose details of the discussion.
   ``The government has thus far found no evidence,'' to support the
allegations against the West German company, Genscher said.
   Hanns Schumacher, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters
the government has asked the United States for any additional
material to prove the allegations. ``Such material has not yet
appeared,'' he said.
   In Freiburg, district state director Willi Voegele said he has
informed the federal Finance Ministry that his investigation has so
far found nothing connecting the company with the allegations.
Voegele said his office was ordered Dec. 30 to check the company's
foreign export contacts.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, managing director of
Imhausen-Chemie, which employs 500 people, has denied the
allegations against the firm.
   The Libyan government insists that the plant is intended to
produce pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the nation.
   Dec. 30
   Chronicle-Tribune, Marion, Ind., on base closings:
   If Grissom Air Force Base ... (in Indiana) had been on the list
of military facilities to be closed, our attitude might be less
charitable. But we don't think so.
   The recommendation by a government commission that 86 military
installations be closed is only the first of several tough decisions
the United States must face if the budget deficit ever is to be
whipped.
   From all indications, the recommendations were made for all the
right reasons after a careful and thorough study. The primary
consideration _ the nation's defense _ should be strengthened by the
closing or realignment of the military bases.
   What do concern us are attemmpts by some congressmen to inject
politics into what was a non-political process. There is no cause
for any member of Congress to claim victory or defeat based on
whether his or her district lost or kept a military facility. ...
   The process was designed specifically to withstand political
pressure from congressmen trying to protect bases in their districts
_ and that's the way it appeared to work. ...
   The closing of the military facilities, while distasteful and
painful to some, are more than justified. The savings over the next
20 years are estimated to be $5.6 billion.

   Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on base closings:
   The initial reaction to the schedule of military base closings
was positive; nobody with power on armed services committees was
offended.
   But there are plenty of Congressmen who have been, and the
reverberations from the release of the listings is settling in.
   Illinois is one unhappy state, what with the inclusion of Chanute
Field and Fort Sheridan on the list.
   California is another big loser. But Texas _ surprise _ loses
very little, and the military-base-rich southern states sacrifice
very little in comparison to what they have. ...
   The chances are great that the list _ and the closings _ will be
sustained in the process ahead.
   Retiring Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci is expected to
approve the list _ he can't legally change it _ and it will be up to
Congress to act against it if it is not to be implemented.
   It is quite unlikely that Congress can get enough votes to
scuttle the plan.
   There is something sad about the convolutions of the law that set
up the commission and require Congress to vote up or down on the
entire package. But time has shown that this is the only way
unnecessary military bases will be abandoned.
   Congress has shown year after year that if it is left to them,
politicking will rescue even the most superfluous station. As
twisted as is the process, it at least seems at last to be getting
the job done.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the United Nations:
   The (United Nations), often maligned in the past as ...
ineffective in its principal role as peacekeeper, has of late
enjoyed some notable diplomatic successes. Also, under pressure from
several nations, ... it has adopted and is now implementing reforms:
spending cuts, staff reductions, consensus approval of major
financial decisions.
   The General Assembly's approval of spending plans clears the way
for payment of the balance _ $58 million _ of the $144 million
appropriated by Congress for the organization this year.
   Unpaid U.N. dues to go into the regular budget amount to $337.2
million currently, and in addition we owe $94.1 million for our
country's share of the cost of vital peacekeeping operations.
   Now that reforms are well under way and the congressional U.N.
detractors no longer have much legitimate cause for griping, we
should pay up with minimal further delay.

   Alamogordo (N.M.) Daily News on base closings:
   Many of the communities near the 86 bases under recommendation by
a government commission for closure will feel the economic pinch if
the recommendations are approved.
   But the nation's economy has to be taken into consideration as
well. Right now, the nation has a large deficit to deal with.
   Consolidating bases and closing down inefficient bases makes a
lot of sense. The recommendations made by the commission seemed to
be good ones.
   This country has too many problem areas such as the homeless,
AIDS and education to be wasting taxpayers' money needlessly.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on ``African Americans'':
   It may not catch on, but describing Americans of African descent
as ``African Americans'' is a good idea.
   The new term has been coming into favor among some black writers
and civil rights leaders for several years now.
   Jesse Jackson called attention to the trend _ and endorsed it
wholeheartedly _ at a recent civil rights conference in Chicago.
``Every ethnic group in this country has a reference to some land
base, some historical cultural base,'' he said. ``African Americans
have hit that level of maturity.'' ...
   More importantly, the term ``African American'' avoids any
reference to skin pigmentation, which ought to be irrelevant in
today's America. Far more relevant are the culture and experience
shared by a people.
   In the case of black Americans, that experience has been shaped
by centuries of oppression, beginning with the forcible abduction
and enslavement of their African ancestors. Blacks hung on to their
African heritage in the face of slavery and racism, creating a rich
and distinctive new culture. That culture can't be understood
without taking into account its African roots.
   ``African American'' reflects those roots. It also reflects a
pride in being both African AND American _ the kind of pride felt by
Greek Americans, Polish Americans and others whose ancestors came to
America by choice and suffered less in the new land. If most blacks
now choose to call themselves African Americans, the rest of the
country should oblige them _ and feel honored.

   A leading British conservative said
today that Libya may have ``paid the price'' for its aggressive
stance toward the United States in the downing of two Libyan
warplanes by the U.S. Navy.
   Soviet media quickly reported today's fighting over the
Mediterranean. Earlier, a Soviet official said unprovoked attacks on
Libya would merit worldwide condemnation in which the Soviets would
join.
   In West Germany, opposition leaders said they were surprised by
the incident. In Spain, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juan Lena said
Spain ``follows with attention and concern the development of
events.''
   The Pentagon reported two of Libya's Soviet-built MiG-23s were
shot down early today by U.S. F-14s from the aircraft carrier John
F. Kennedy. The incident was the first fighting between the United
States and Libya since U.S. jets bombed Libya in 1986.
   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House press secretary, said in Los
Angeles that the U.S. warplanes acted in self-defense after the
Libyan aircraft approached them ``in hostile manner over
international waters.''
   Tensions between the two nations rose recently over Libya's
construction of a plant the United States says is intended to
produce chemical weapons.
   Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said he hoped the
incident would not dominate an upcoming chemical weapons conference
in France. The meeting will bring together more than 140 countries
Jan. 7-11 to discuss expanding a 1925 treaty banning the use of
chemical weapons. Dumas said the downing of the jets ``reinforces
the need for this kind of international conference.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said
today the federal government has no independent verification that a
West German company helped build the plant, as the United States has
charged.
   Michael Mates of Britain's governing Conservative Party and
chairman of the parliamentary committee on defense, told the British
Broadcasting Corp.:
   ``If the Libyans have made an offensive gesture toward the United
States, I'm not surprised they've been shot down, because they're
not a friendly nation, they have committed many aggressive acts
against the United States.''
   He said Libya has tried to deny the United States access to
disputed waters. ``They tried to make false claims within the area
of the Mediterranean to keep out American troops who are entirely
entitled to be in international waters, and if they've paid the
price, well, that's tough.''
   British lawmaker Gerald Kaufman, the opposition Labor Party's
spokesman on foreign affairs, told BBC television: ``The Americans
ought to show the utmost caution and they really will need to
justify this activity if they're going to get any support or even
understanding from our country.''
   ``Lockerbie (the Pan Am plane crash last month) was an outrage of
the foulest kind. Britain has every right to be angry. The Americans
have every right to be angry. But as (Prime Minister) Mrs.
(Margaret) Thatcher said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
is not the way of dealing with it.''
   He recalled that in 1986 Britain allowed Washington to use
bombers based on British soil to bomb Libya _ an attack staunchly
defended by Mrs. Thatcher and denounced by the Labor Party.
   He said the Americans then acted ``in a very rash and foolish
way,'' and if the latest incident was part of a move to destroy an
alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya, ``I would regard that as
unacceptable, not because in any way I would support or accept that
Libya should manufacture chemical weapons, but because it is
unacceptable for one country to attack another internally because it
disagrees with what it's doing.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh,
commenting before receiving word of the U.S.-Libyan exchange, said:
``I believe someone just doesn't like the beginning of
U.S.-Palestinian dialogue and prospects of moving the Israeli-Arab
conflict off dead-center.''
   ``In such circumstances, any unprovoked military action, wherever
it comes from, would deal a very serious blow to the process of
improving the international climate and would deserve condemnation
from the international community, including the Soviet Union.''

   A panel of independent and drug industry
scientists began today trying to hasten the process for approving
new drugs to treat cancer and AIDS, a task its chairman says must
balance patient safety against the need for speedy treatment.
   ``While safety and efficacy must remain of paramount importance
in permitting the use of new drugs, it is also critical that the
Food and Drug Administration's regulatory procedures be such as to
not unduly hinder the rapid transfer of new agents to patients with
cancer and AIDS,'' said Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of the
President's Cancer Panel, which appointed the drug study panel.
   Hammer said the panel of experts has been asked by
President-elect Bush to review current drug approval procedures and
determine whether the regulatory processes governing cancer and AIDS
drugs should be different from the processes governing development
of drugs for diseases that are not life-threatening.
   Speaking to reporters after his address to the panel meeting at
the National Institutes of Health, Hammer said he believes the
approval process for cancer and AIDS drugs should be shortened from
the current period, which varies from two to three years, to less
than one year.
   ``We're not going to sacrifice safety and speed,'' he said.
``We're going to combine safety and speed.''
   Hammer said the FDA's recent announcement of new streamlined
procedures to move drug approvals more quickly are inadequate,
though he did not elaborate.
   However, he said, the involvement of leading pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies on the study panel will provide valuable
insight into the approval process.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the AIDS coordinator at the National
Institutes of Health, said ``extraordinary'' progress has already
been made in AIDS research, though no cure has been found and only
one drug has been approved for treatment of AIDS _ AZT, which has
been shown to prolong the lives of certain AIDS patients.
   ``There is a lot of despair out there, and that's understandable
because of the terrible scourge of this disease,'' he told panelists.
   He said scientists are ``cautiously optimistic'' that they will
develop a drug or combination of drugs within the next few years to
prolong the lives of AIDS victims. However, he said, there is
unlikely that a single drug will be developed that cures the disease.

   A survivor of a massacre in a Japanese
prisoner of war camp is trying to find the woman who left a message
on his telephone answering machine saying she remembered him and his
buddies.
   The message, apparently prompted by news stories on the 44th
anniversary of the massacre, was cut off before Mary Ann from
Wisconsin gave her full name and hometown, said Glenn McDole of Des
Moines.
   ``This is one of those times I wish I didn't have one of those
telephone answering machines,'' said McDole. ``We didn't get the
whole message and I don't know how to reach her.''
   McDole, 67, was a prisoner for 33 months during World War II. In
December 1944, he was one of 11 prisoners who escaped a massacre on
the Philippine island of Palawan in which 139 others were doused
with gasoline and burned or shot.
   He and two other remaing survivors attended an observance at the
Washington Monument last month to mark the 44th anniversary of the
massacre.
   Someone in Wisconsin named Mary Ann read about the observance,
and called McDole. The woman said she lived on Palawan Island during
the war and remembers ``you 11 men'' who survived Palawan Prison.
   ``You can hear her on the tape starting to say something else,''
said McDole's daughter, Kathy Tews. ``But then there's just
silence.''
   McDole, chief of the patrol division of the Polk County Sheriff's
Department, said he was one of about 20 men who tried to escape when
their Japanese captors ordered 150 men into trenches, doused them
with gasoline and set them afire. Eleven survived.
   McDole said he hid in a garbage dump and, with the help of
Filipinos, made his way to another part of the island. He later was
rescued by an American plane.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have dropped criminal
cases against 17 pilots in Orlando and Tampa charged with concealing
drug and alcohol convictions on government forms.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman said Tuesday the cases were
dismissed so that the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
can decide whether the Federal Aviation Administraion medical forms
filled out by pilots are vague.
   Four related cases from Tampa have been appealed to the higher
court, and Genzman said prosecutors could reinstate the 17 dismissed
cases if the four cases are upheld.
   They were the first in a national crackdown on pilots failing to
report convictions on FAA forms. Federal officials said they were
taking the action to ensure air safety.
   U.S. District Judge George Carr threw out cases against five
pilots in Tampa last month, ruling that the FAA medical forms were
``fundamentally unfair.''

   A prison parolee demanding a plane to
Libya grabbed about 20 hostages in a restaurant, killing one before
he was fatally shot by police, who accidentally killed another
hostage, officials said today.
   The gunman, Wayne Strozzi, 35, also wounded two officers before
he died at McKee Medical Center late Tuesday, authorities said.
   Strozzi, who was paroled in 1987 after serving 13 months on
cocaine charges, first assaulted his girlfriend at her apartment,
police said. Police then chased him on foot to the Riverhouse
Restaurant, said Sgt. Ray Miller.
   At the restaurant, Strozzi held about 20 patrons and staff at
gunpoint for about an hour, demanding a plane to Libya, Miller said.
   Strozzi apparently was angry that his girlfriend had begun dating
another man, police said.
   Sally Mills, a waitress at the restaurant, and Fenton Crookshank,
a customer, were killed, said Larimer County District Attorney Stu
VanMeveren.
   Mills, in her 40s, was shot by Strozzi as snipers fired on the
gunman, VanMeveren said. Crookshank, 45, was killed by a police
officer as the patron dove through a bathroom window in an attempt
to flee, he said.
   VanMeveren refused to name the officer who shot Crookshank.
Police said Crookshank had failed to respond to orders to halt as he
jumped out the window and approached officers.
   Another female hostage was treated and released for cuts on her
foot caused by shattered glass, authorities said.
   Officer Joe Berdin and Sheriff's Deputy J. Hirokawa suffered
gunshot wounds to the arms, said Carol Matheis-Kraft, assistant
hospital administrator. Berdin was listed in good condition and
Hirokawa was treated and released.
   The trouble began at 6:45 p.m. when police in this city of 30,000
people 50 miles north of Denver responded to a disturbance at the
home of Strozzi's girlfriend, who had been assaulted, Miller said.
   After fleeing to his house, Strozzi shot Hiorkawa and was chased
to the restaurant, where he took the hostages and readied a getaway
car. As he walked outside holding his semi-automatic pistol to the
head of diner Belva Bethel, he spotted officer Berdin in the parking
lot and shot him in the shoulder.
   Strozzi then pulled the woman back into the restaurant at
gunpoint and began making demands.
   ``He said he was going to waste everybody,'' said Jim Carr, a
member of a club that was meeting in the restaurant basement. The
club members escaped out the back.
   One hostage was Ms. Bethel's husband, Steve Bethel, a 32-year-old
reserve officer with the Police Department who said he cooperated
and tried not to intimidate the gunman.
   ``I couldn't tell if he was drunk, but he was on some kind of
drug, I know that,'' Bethel said.
   Strozzi released about a half dozen hostages before shooting the
waitress about 9 p.m., while police negotiated by megaphone. Police
snipers then opened fire, shooting Strozzi at least three times in
the head and abdomen.
   Crookshank was shot about the same time, police said.

   About 86,000 Hungarians opposed to the
construction of a Danube River power project have signed a petition
calling for a referendum on the plant, the state news agency MTI
reported Wednesday.
   President Bruno F. Straub said Tuesday night a referendum on the
plan was ``inconceivable,'' because parliament has decided to go
ahead with the project.
   Environmentalists, who say the plant will destroy wildlife,
wetlands and drinking water supplies, began the campaign in November
because they believed parliament's decision in October did not
reflect the will of the people.
   The session approved construction of the Nagymaros power plant,
which together with a hydropower station in Gabcikovo,
Czechoslovakia, is to be one of the biggest power generation plants
on the Danube.
   Environmentalists plan to present the proposal for a referendum
to Straub's Presidential Council or to parliament once they reach
100,000 signatures, the agency said.
   Straub ruled out a last-minute change in an interview on Budapest
TV, saying: ``Collecting signatures is a movement by young people
who want to use the chance to protest against something.''

   The military government has adopted a broad
range of austerity measures to go along with a stringent 1989 budget
announced by President Ibrahim Babangida.
   The ruling Armed Forces Council announced Tuesday a 200 percent
tax on cigarettes, a 50 percent increase in the price of fertilizer
and a 15 percent tax on deposits held in Nigerian bank accounts.
   The government also canceled a meal subsidy for senior civil
servants that was approved last year, and imposed a 15 percent
withholding tax on fees paid to company directors.
   Import duties were raised on a broad range of goods, while 15
items, including livestock, vegetables, processed wood and fabrics,
were placed on a prohibited import list.
   Earlier this week, a 42 percent increase in gasoline prices for
private users was announced. A gasoline price increase in June
sparked demonstrations in the capital.
   Nigeria has been suffering economic problems because of reduced
prices for oil, its chief export. It has a foreign debt of $25
billion.
   The annual budget announced Sunday called for expenditures of
about $7 billion against revenues of about $6.8 billion.

   Madrid officials ordered limits on the use

Wednesday, a day after the city declared a smog alert.
   The decision was made after weather forecasters said conditions
would keep a layer of smog over the city until Monday, said Lucio
Pita, head of the city's environmental protection department.
   Anti-pollution measures included limiting the use of coal-burning
heating systems to between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., banning all parking
by non-residents on 42 streets and imposing fines of up to $134 for
cars emitting excessive exhaust.
   The maximum fine for using a heater during banned hours amounted
to $760.
   ``The situation is not of danger, but of precaution,'' Pita said.

   Here is a transcript of the Pentagon briefing
Wednesday by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Adm. William
Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the incident in
which two U.S. Navy planes shot down two Libyan jet fighters over
the Mediterranean Sea.
   Carlucci: Good morning.
   The chairman and I here to present the facts of the Libyan
incident, as we understand them at this point.
   And let me emphasize that.
   These are preliminary reports, and preliminary reports are never
100 percent accurate.
   There are always changes in detail.
   But in the interest of getting to the American public and the
world in general the information that we have, we're going to
present a statement based on that information, but I urge you to
take into account the fact that preliminary reports sometimes do
change.
   This morning at about 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, or 12 a.m.
local time in the Mediterranean, two Libyan MiG-23 aircraft were
shot down in self-defense by American F-14s with air-to-air missiles.
   Two parachutes were sighted, and a Libyan search-and-rescue
helicopter was later detected headed for the area.
   The U.S. Navy aircraft were operating from the aircraft carrier
USS John F. Kennedy, which was off the southwest tip of Crete and
about 127 miles north of Tobruk, Libya. (Indicates location on map.)
And there you have the location of the aircraft. Tobruk is down in
this region.
   At the time of the incident, both the ship and its aircraft were
conducting training operations in international waters.
   The two F-14s, and you have the F-14 location right here
(indicates on map) were providing combat air patrol approximately 50
miles south of the Kennedy, which is some 70 miles north of the
northeast Libyan coast.
   The MiG aircraft were detected shortly after they left Al Bumbah
_ (indicates on map) _ that's right here _ at about 4:50 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time and were tracked as they closed the two F-14
aircraft.

<HEAD>WASHN: F-14 aircraft.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The F-14 pilots maneuvered to avoid the closing aircraft.
   They changed speed, altitude, and direction.
   The Libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner.
   At about 14 miles, the U.S. section leader decided his aircraft
was in jeopardy, and they could wait no longer.
   One MiG-23 was shot down with a Sparrow missile.
   The second MiG was shot down by a Sidewinder missile at six miles.
   These 6th Fleet ships and aircraft were operating in
international waters and international airspace at the time of the
incident and posed no threat to Libya.
   These routine operations are of the same type that have been
conducted in the same area many times in the past.
   The 6th Fleet operations have no connection whatsoever with
Libya's newly constructed chemical facility.
   These operations, which were conducted over 600 miles northeast
of the plant _ and the plant is right down in this region here _
(using map).
   So, you see where the carrier is, and it's 600 miles away.
   It had nothing to do whatsoever with that plant.
   We now consider this matter closed.
   Admiral Crowe and I are now prepared to take your questions.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. _ what were the indications of hostile intent? You've
mentioned the fact that the Libyan planes continued to close. What
else, if anything, was there that told the pilots the Libyans had
hostile intentions?
   Carlucci: Bear in mind what I said earlier, that these are
preliminary reports.
   The pilots are being flown to Naples for a detailed debrief.
   So, we will not know the actual maneuvers that took place until
we have the detailed debrief from the pilots.
   But, based on our current information _ and I emphasize that
point _ the pilots descended in altitude from approximately 15,000
feet to 4,000 feet, and they took some five different evasive
actions, and each time the Libyan aircraft sought to put their nose
on our aircraft; they also accelerated.
   So, the hostile intent seems to be fairly clear.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, was the _ what were the rules of engagement
that were _
   Carlucci: Normal peacetime rules of engagement.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Carlucci: No change _ there has been no change in the rules of
engagement.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. And there were no communication required then _
   Q. _ who gave the OK to fire?
   Q. _ between the F-14s and the Kennedy?
   Carlucci: Excuse me?
   Q. They didn't have to go back to the Kennedy and ask for weapons
release authority or anything like that?

<TEXT>
   Libya today formally requested an emergency
meeting of the Security Council to condemn ``American aggression''
in the downing of two Libyan jets over the Mediterranean.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a statement
saying he ``regrets the incident and hopes both sides will exercise
restrain so as not to heighten existing tension in the region.''
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser met the Security Council
president, Ismail Razali of Malaysia, and told reporters later he
had delivered a letter requesting the urgent session.
   No date for a session was mentioned.
   ``Without a doubt, we ask for condemnation of this premeditated
act,'' said Muntasser. He said the Libyan planes shot down today
were ``unarmed, on reconnaissance, ordinary, routine flying.''
   U.S. officials said the American planes opened fire after the
Libyan planes threatened them.
   ``We ask the Security Council to discuss this latest American
aggression against Libya,'' Muntasser said.
   ``I am saying to you they (the planes) were unarmed,'' he said.
``They were reconnaissance planes and everyone knows reconnaissance
planes are not the planes of aggression or attack.''
   He refused to say if Libya would retaliate.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters that Perez de
Cuellar had been informed that official letters about the clash were
being sent today from Washington and Tripoli.

   Here are some recent developments in
U.S.-Libyan relations following the American contention that Libya
had become able to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Sept. 14: The State Department says Libya now can produce
chemical weapons and calls that ``a particularly worrisome
development'' in light of a ``dangerous precedent'' of use of such
weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and ``the general record of
irresponsible behavior on the part of (Libyan leader Moammar)
Gadhafi.''
   Oct. 4: In a speech at the United Nations, the Libyan foreign
minister again demands compensation for the 1986 U.S. air attack on
two Libyan cities, an attack in which 41 people were killed.
   Oct. 25: CIA Director William Webster says a Libyan chemical
plant is the largest of its kind the agency has detected. Webster
says later he meant the plant is the largest of its kind in the
developing world.
   Oct. 26: Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, the government's top
antiterrorism expert, says there was no evidence Libyan planned to
arm terrorists with chemicals but reason to fear it might. ``They
have no record of restraint,'' he says.
   Nov. 25: A Libyan official tells Italy his country adheres to
international prohibitions on the use of chemicals weapons. Those
prohibitions do not cover manufacture or ownership.
   Dec. 19: The State Department says Libya is on the verge of
full-scale production and calls on all countries to deny related
technology to Libya, Iran and Iraq.
   Dec. 21: In a televised interview, President Reagan says the
United States has discussed military action against the chemical
weapons plant with allies, and ``that's a decision that has not been
made yet.''
   Dec. 22: Libya denies it has built a chemical weapons plant and
says doctors, nurses and pharmacists are planning a sit-in,
apparently to discourage any attack on what it says is a
pharmaceutical factory. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says
``military action is an option. We're not ruling it out.''
   Dec. 23: President-elect Bush says he shares Reagan's
determination to prevent the plant from spreading ``further
destruction,'' but declines to spell out what he thinks should be
done. The Arab League says it is not true that Libya is producing
chemical weapons.
   Dec. 25: Iran, Iraq and Syria announce support for Libya in the
dispute.
   Dec. 28: Reagan extends for six months U.S. economic sanctions
against Libya, first imposed in 1986. The action froze Libyan assets
in the United States and forbade certain dealings with Libya,
including oil production by U.S. companies there.
   Dec. 29: Libya's ambassador to Tunisia predicts better relations
with the United States under the incoming Bush administration. The
ambassador repeats denials that his country has built a chemical
weapons plant.
   Dec. 30: The United States rejects an offer by Gadhafi, conveyed
through Italy, for an international inspection of the plant. A
single inspection ``could not be conclusive'' because the plant
``could easily be modified to appear as a legitimate industrial
chemical plant,'' the State Department says.
   Jan. 3, 1989: The State Department says it has proof Libya has
begun limited production, and says the United States will raise the
issue at a NATO meeting in Paris beginning Saturday while ``there is
still time to do something about it.'' The Defense Department says
the sailing of an aircraft carrier battle group from Norfolk, Va. to
the Mediterranean is a standard deployment.
   Jan. 4: The Pentagon announces the shooting down of two Libyan
fighters by U.S. planes. The Washington Post reports the plant
suffered a spill of toxic chemicals last summer. The New York Times
and ABC-TV report recent movement of chemical raw materials out of
the plant.

   Keebler Co. said today it will eliminate
tropical oils and lard from its cookies and crackers to reduce
cholesterol.
   The company also said it would begin listing nutritional values
on its packages.
   Keebler snacks made without tropical oils and lard should begin
appearing on shelves in March, said Thomas Garvin, president and
chief executive officer.
   Tropical oils are heavy in saturated fats, which can be converted
by the body into artery-blocking cholesterol. Lard is high in
cholesterol.
   By the end of 1989, no Keebler product will contain coconut oil,
palm oil, palm kernel oil, lard or beef fat, said Keebler spokesman
Stuart Greenblatt. They will be replaced with vegetable oil lower in
saturated fat, he said.
   Butter and cheese, both of which contain fat, will be used in
some products, he said.
   ``We've been working on the reformulation for more than a year,''
Garvin said. ``We're extremely proud to respond to consumer concerns
about these ingredients by replacing them with more healthful oils.''
   Greenblatt would not disclose the cost of reformulating the
products but said the decision would not affect prices.
   Under the new labeling, Keebler products will show the number of
calories and amount of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, sodium,
cholesterol and other nutritional categories per serving, Greenblatt
said.

make this judgment on his own.    Q. Did the lead pilot fire both missiles,
Mr. Secretary? Did he fire both the Sparrow and the Sidewinder?    Carlucci:
I think both aircraft fired.    I think the lead probably was the one
that hit.    Crowe: It's clear both aircraft fired.    One was hit with
a Sidewinder and one was hit with a Sparrow.    We think they both came
from the lead aircraft, but both aircraft did fire missiles.    Q. Is
that a total of four missiles?    Carlucci: Yes.    Q. Libya has been
bloodied in the past by confronting the U.S. with planes and ships. Why
would they do this?    Carlucci: You'll have to ask them, not us.   
Q. Well, they had said they expected the U.S. to attack Libya because of
this chemical weapons plant.    Carlucci: All I can do is emphasize that
these were routine carrier maneuvers, a carrier battle group that has been
in the Mediterranean steadily.    We've had them there for years.   
It was on a normal training mission.    It is enroute to port. 
  It will continue enroute to port.    This has nothing whatsoever to
do with all the speculation _ and if I may say, excessive speculation _
that has existed _    Q. We in no way provoked them, or drew them into
this?    Carlucci: Absolutely not.    Q. Mr. Secretary, how long had
the carrier actually been in the general vicinity, within 100 or 120 miles
of Libya?    Carlucci: Well, it had been steaming eastward in the Mediterranean.
   I don't know how long it had been in that vicinity. ( o Crowe) _ Bill,
maybe _    Crowe: Since the Christmas vacation.    Q. And had it been
conducting flight operations on a continuing basis during that time? 
  Crowe: A few hours each day.    Q. Mr. Secretary _    Q. _ have the
activities of the Libyans been normal? Have they been checking out U.S.
aircraft a little more than routine lately?    Carlucci: We had not noticed
any abnormal activities until this incident.    Q. Mr. Secretary, does
that Libyan chemical plant pose any imminent threat to the region, and
what, if any, threats to U.S. interests?    Carlucci: The State Department
has indicated that we are gravely concerned with that chemical facility,
and I don't think it would be appropriate to go beyond that statement.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, you mentioned excessive speculation on the part _
when we were talking about this Libyan chemical plant. What has been excessive
speculation? What is your concern about that?    Carlucci: Well, I've
seen all kinds of details and speculation come out in the press.    I
know that you all have your sources, and you all think that your sources
are infallible.    But quite frankly, they are not.    And I've seen
a number of details come out in the press that are not accurate.    I've
seen a number of reports of what the Pentagon is thinking _ thinking that
has never been brought to my attention.

   Breyers Yogurt was ordered recalled from
stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware after a
cyanide-laced container of the product left a teen-ager in critical
condition, authorities said.
   Investigators in Camden County called Tuesday's incident an
isolated case of tampering because tests on more than 100 similar
yogurt containers turned up no sign of cyanide.
   However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would
inspect a manufacturing plant in South Edmeston, N.Y., today and
re-examine the carton.
   ``We need to go back and take a closer look,'' said Matthew
Lewis, an FDA district supervisor in West Orange. Lewis said initial
inspections of the carton and lid of Breyers black cherry yogurt
revealed no pinholes.
   ``We're all trying to find out where this happened,'' he said.
``Right now, we don't have any leads.''
   Tests by the FDA in Philadelphia confirmed the presence of
cyanide in the container late Tuesday.
   Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield, was in critical condition early
today, said Florence Rowe, a nursing supervisor at West Jersey
Health System's eastern division in Voorhees.
   The cyanide was found in an 8-ounce container of Breyers black
cherry yogurt with the code date Feb. 9, 1989. Officials say the
yogurt was purchased Jan. 1 at an Acme supermarket in Westmont in
southern New Jersey.
   ``Acme Markets Inc., in cooperation with Kraft, has voluntarily
issued a recall of all flavors of Breyers Yogurt from all 166 Acme
stores in the Delaware Valley,'' said Walt Rubel, spokesman for Acme
in Malvern, Pa.
   Kraft Inc. Dairy Group, based in Philadelphia, owns Breyers
Yogurt. The Delaware Valley generally is considered southern New
Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware.
   Acme also has removed all other yogurt from five of its Camden
County stores, the Health Department said.
   George Kerns, a spokesman for Camden County prosecutor's office,
said the cyanide appeared to have been on the top of the yogurt and
not stirred in. He said tests of 130 other samples of yogurt from
the Acme stores found no contamination.
   Kraft said it is cooperating with the FDA, local law enforcement
and public health authorities in the investigation. The company said
Breyers yogurt packages have a tamper-evident seal.
   Kerns said Lee's mother had purchased a batch of yogurt from the
store and two other containers had been eaten without any side
effects. Lee became ill while eating the yogurt on his way to school
with friends.
   He had eaten about a third of the container before he began
vomiting blood, Kerns said.
   The worst known case of cyanide tampering in the country occurred
in 1982, when seven people in the Chicago area died after consuming
tainted Tylenol.

<TEXT>
   Two contrasting chronicles of brotherly
relations _ the drama ``Rain Man'' and the comedy ``Twins'' _
commanded 1988's frantic final weekend at the movies, according to
box office figures from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   The No. 1 film, ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an
autistic savant on the road with his scheming brother, played by Tom
Cruise, sold $14.4 million worth of tickets.
   ``Twins,'' featuring Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger as
unlikely siblings separated at birth, finished second with sales of
$12.1 million, according to figures released Tuesday.
   With these two films passing the $10 million mark, business
during the four-day New Year's weekend was up sharply from a year
ago. The Top 10 movies this New Year's weekend gathered
approximately $69.8 million, up 24 percent from 1987's Top 10
grosses of $56.1 million.
   The Christmas weekend, however, reflected a 15 percent decline
from a year ago.
   Last year's winter hits were ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Throw
Momma from the Train,'' ``Eddie Murphy Raw'' and ``Broadcast News.''
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' a satirical
look at sleuthing with Leslie Nielsen, came in third over the
weekend on receipts of $7.9 million. It was followed by the animated
``Oliver and Co.,'' the Oliver Twist-inspired tale of a homeless
kitten, with grosses of $7.4 million.
   Two sophisticated comedies, ``Working Girl'' and ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels,'' finished in fifth and sixth place, respectively.
   ``Working Girl,'' the Cinderella corporate story featuring
Melanie Griffith as an ambitious secretary, collected $7.3 million.
``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' with Steve Martin and Michael Caine as
dueling con men, claimed box office revenues of $6.5 million.
   ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring Mel Gibson as a drug dealer trying
to start over in life with restaurant owner Michelle Pfeiffer, was
seventh with receipts of $4.6 million.
   In eighth place was the animated ``The Land Before Time,'' about
a baby dinosaur's travels in a prehistoric world, on sales of $3.7
million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's
reworking of the Charles Dickens Christmas classic, with revenues of
$3.3 million, and the horror film ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' with
sales of $2.6 million.
   Of the new holiday films in limited release, the two most
successful were ``The Accidental Tourist,'' with a per-screen
average of $44,033 in five theaters nationwide, and ``Beaches,''
with a per-screen average of $38,435 in seven movie houses.
   Here are the top movies for the four-day weekend as tallied by
Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of
theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks
in release.
   1. ``Rain Man,'' United Artists, $14.4 million, 1,254 screens,
$11,448 per screen, $42.5 million, three weeks.
   2. ``Twins,'' Universal, $12.1 million, 1,624 screens, $7,420 per
screen, $55.6 million, four weeks.
   3. ``The Naked Gun,'' Paramount, $7.9 million, 1,969 screens,

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi today called the U.S.
downing of two Libyan jets in the Mediterranean an act of increased
``American terrorism,'' the official Libyan news agency reported.
   Gadhafi vowed to ``meet challenge with challenge,'' JANA said in
a dispatch monitored in London. The reaction came about six hours
after the Libyan jets were shot down by aircraft from the U.S. 6th
Fleet.
   ``In spite of the increase in official American terrorism, which
is backed by brute force, and in spite of the threats, the
revolutionaries of great Libya will not bow their heads and will not
abandon their principles and the objectives of their eternal
motherland of unity, liberation and the building of progress,''
Gadhafi declared, according to JANA.
   ``If America has prevailed because it is a superpower in the air
and the sea, it will inevitably be defeated on land. We, as well as
the fish, are awaiting them,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying.
   Libya today formally requested an emergency meeting of the U.N.
Security Council to condemn the U.S. action. Ali Sunni Muntasser,
Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, said the Libyan planes had
been unarmed.
   No date was set for the Security Council session.
   Also today, the Yugoslavian news agency Tanjug reported Gadhafi
has asked the Soviet Union to use its navy to help prevent a
U.S.-Libyan clash in the Mediterranean.
   Libya's Foreign Ministry said the U.S. shot down the Libyan jet
fighters in a ``premeditated attack.'' And Libya's ambassador to
Italy said the downing of the planes was linked to U.S. allegations
that Libya has built a chemical weapons plant.
   ``At 1103 hours (5:03 a.m. EST) while two Libyan reconnaissance
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters, U.S.
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them
down,'' Libyan radio said, quoting a statement by the Foreign
Ministry in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   White House officials said the American aircraft opened fire
after being threatened. The Pentagon reported the Soviet-built
MiG-23s were shot down by U.S. F-14s from the aircraft carrier John
F. Kennedy in the Mediterranean. It was the first fighting between
the United States and Libya since U.S. jets bombed Tripoli in 1986.
   Libyan Ambassador Abdel Rahman Shalgam called today's incident
``a unilateral act'' and a ``dangerous'' action of escalation by the
United States in its response to the chemical plant situation. He
declined to say how Libya would respond.
   On Tuesday, U.S. officials said for the first time they had
evidence the plant had begun producing limited quantities of
chemical weapons.
   Libyan officials, including Gadhafi, have insisted the plant near
Tripoli will make pharmaceuticals and offered to let international
experts inspect the facility. The Reagan administration has rejected
the offer for a one-time inspection.
   Referring to the U.S. insistence that the plant is a chemical
weapons facility, Shalgam said of the U.S. administration: ``Why
don't they wait'' until the start of an international conference on
chemical weapons, scheduled to begin this weekend in Paris.
   ``We are willing to accept any international measure'' regarding
chemical arms, he said, as long as it applied to all nations, but he
said the United States was evidently not willing to do so.
   He stressed that Libya said it would open the plant in a few
weeks for inspection ``so that the whole world could see.''

   The U.S. downing of two Libyan jet fighters
Wednesday was the latest in a series of military clashes between the
two countries during President Reagan's eight-year tenure.
   On April 14, 1986, waves of U.S. land-based and carrier-based
warplanes carried out a series of middle-of-the-night bombing raids
on Libya. The U.S. planes dumped one bomb 10 yards from the
residence of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in his Tripoli fortress
headquarters, reportedly killing his baby daughter. Two crewmen from
a U.S. F-111 were killed in the action.
   President Reagan ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for what
U.S. officials said was Libyan involvement in the bombing of a
nightclub in Berlin frequented by U.S. soldiers. A U.S. soldier and
a Turkish woman were killed by the Berlin bomb.
   Among U.S. allies in Europe, only Britain cooperated, and other
countries refused to permit U.S. planes to fly over their
territories. As a result, the British-based F-111s used in the
attack had to be refueled in the air several times in a long dog-leg
flight over the Atlantic ocean, through the Straits of Gibraltar and
over the Mediterranean to Libya.
   On March 24, 1986, Libya fired surface-to-air missiles, missing
U.S. aircraft. The United States retaliated, saying it hit two
Libyan patrol boats and a missile battery at Sirte, Libya.
   The following day, the United States renewed its attack, hitting
the missile site again and two more Libyan boats.
   In June 1983, Navy F-14s intercepted two Libyan fighters outside
the Gulf of Sidra, but there was no shooting.
   An armed confrontation on Aug. 19, 1981, was similar to today's
incident. Two Soviet built MiG-23s were downed today by F-14 planes
from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy. There were no U.S.
casualties; officials said two Libyan parachutes were seen.
   In the 1981 clash, U.S. F-14 fighters shot down two Soviet-built
Libyan SU-22 fighter planes over the Mediterranean in a one-minute
battle off the Libyan coast.
   The Pentagon said the planes were shot down after an ``unprovoked
attack'' by the Libyans as the U.S. jets from the aircraft carrier
USS Nimitz patrolled above a Navy task force conducting a routine
exercise more than 100 miles off shore in the Gulf of Sidra.
   None of the Americans in the two-man F-14s was hurt in the
incident. One Libyan pilot was seen parachuting from his stricken
plane.
   The Libyans disputed the U.S. account, claiming their planes were
on routine surveillance missions.
   Libya has claimed the gulf as its territory since 1973, but the
United States does not recognize the claim.

   So, in my judgment, the speculation has been excessive, but let
me emphasize we do not comment on military contingencies.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, could you clarify _
   Q. Mr. Secretary, let me follow up. That was triggered by _ that
was triggered by President Reagan's own statement that he was
considering a military option.
   Carlucci: I don't think that's what the president said if you go
back and look at his actual statement.
   But, in any event, the reports I'm referring to are reports that
you all have been putting out from the Pentagon.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Do you have any indication _
   Q. Mr. Secretary, were the planes capable of making an attack on
the so-called weapons _ or chemical weapons plant? Were those F-14s _
   Carlucci: If you were going to make an attack on the chemical
plant, you would not position your carrier some 600 miles away. I
think that's self-evident.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Crowe: Nor used F-14 aircraft.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Was there any indication that the planes were going to fire?
That the MiGs were going to fire?
   Carlucci: I've indicated that, by their maneuvers, they were
clearly acting in a hostile fashion.
   Q. Did they paint with their radar?
   Q. Did we have a radar _
   Q. Did they lock on with the radar?
   Crowe: Once again, let me emphasize the point, we have some
preliminary information that radars were turned on.
   We do not know the nature of the radars.
   We do not _ until we debrief the pilots, it is really not
appropriate to get into that kind of detail.
   (Pentagon spokesman) Dan Howard: Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Mr. Secretary, other than the MiGs, were there any other _
   Howard: Let's not have a shouting match here. We have so many
people who want to ask questions, why don't we do it by raising your
hands and let the secretary recognize you.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, other than the MiGs that were shot down, were
there any other Libyan forces in the area that you are aware of?
   Carlucci: Not that we're aware of. (Inaudible.)
   Q. Mr. Secretary, could you describe any plane-to-plane
conversations between the Americans and the Libyans or perhaps any
other conversations _
   Carlucci: That's a little detail that we shouldn't get into until
we've had the debriefing of the pilots.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Well, we understand they were warned. Can you tell us how they
were warned?
   Carlucci: No. I'm not aware of any warnings.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Mr. Secretary, in the previous week or 10 days, had there been
any report from the area of suspicious or threatening behavior by
the Libyans of any kind?
   Carlucci: No. Not to my knowledge. Bill?
   Q. We had reconnaissance planes up over the past week or 10 days
around the carrier. They were never challenged or threatened in any
way by the Libyans until this morning?
   Carlucci: There have been normal challenges and this activity
took place in what is called a flight information region where you
do have these kind of challenges to identify aircraft.
   This has no legal standing.
   It's an ICAO regulation, but these kinds of challenges are normal.
   We do it ourselves.
   That has nothing to do with carrier training operations.
   Q. What you're saying is, if the Libyans had behaved the way they
behaved this morning a week or two weeks or three weeks ago, we
would have shot them down then, too?

<TEXT>
   Disaster-stricken Lockerbie embraced
the bereaved of Flight 103 in a simple, tearful church service
Wednesday at which a minister strongly denounced any thought of
vengeance.
   ``Justice, yes. Retaliation, no,'' the Right Rev. James Whyte,
moderator of the Church of Scotland, said in a sermon to a church
packed with relatives, Pan Am employees, townspeople and
dignitaries, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The service in the 91-year-old sandstone church came two weeks
after a bomb blew the jumbo jet with its 259 people aboard out of
the sky and bombarded the little town of Lockerbie with flaming
wreckage that killed 11 residents.
   Whyte echoed Mrs. Thatcher's public warnings against any
reprisals.
   ``We may be tempted, indeed urged by some, to flex our muscles in
response, to show that we are men,'' Whyte said from the marble
pulpit of Dryfesdale Parish Church.
   ``To show that we are what? To show that we are prepared to let
more young and more innocent die, to let more rescue workers labor
in more wreckage to find the grisly proof, not of our virility, but
of our inhumanity.
   ``That's what retaliation means. I, for one, will have none of
it, and I hope you will not either.''
   The bombing was ``an act of human wicritish Commonwealth; the Most
Rev.
Edward Luscombe, primate of the Scottish Episcopal Church; and the
Most Rev. Thomas Winning, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Glasgow.
   For the first time since the crash, Lockerbie's daytime skies
were empty of the helicopters that have led the search for wreckage
and bodies over 150 square miles of countryside.
   Police say 126 of the 242 bodies recovered from the crash have
been released to relatives, but while the search will continue,
authorities say they see little hope of ever finding the missing
bodies of 20 passengers and eight residents.
   Only three of the town's victims have been identified, and the
first, 10-year-old Joanne Flannigan, will be buried in Lockerbie on
Thursday. Her parents perished too, and their bodies have yet to be
identified.

   Carlucci: Any time an aircraft demonstrates clear hostile intent
_ and on the basis of our preliminary information, this is certainly
the case here _ our aircraft are entitled under the rules of
engagement to defend themselves.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, what happened after this incident? Was there
any scrambling of Libyan jets? Any Libyan activities that followed
this incident?
   Carlucci: Other than the SAR operation _ search and rescue
operation _ I have no indications of any other Libyan activity.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, could you clarify? Earlier you said that you
consider the case closed. Does that mean that we're back to
``business as usual,'' there's no extra alerts, there's no further
military action under way, just go back to where you were?
   Carlucci: That is correct.
   We will continue with our training operations, and the carrier
will continue its course into port.
   Q. No special alerts have been issued?
   Carlucci: No special alerts.
   Q. Just to clarify, Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Mr. Secretary, the Navy is saying _ excuse me _ that the
planes were warned in English to break off. Are you saying that
there was no such warning, or you're just _
   Carlucci: I know of no warning.
   Once again, we will debrief the pilots, but at this point, we
know of no warnings.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, you said the _ can I just go ahead? I can't
raise my hand here because I'm in front of the TV people.
   Carlucci: Yes, go ahead. (Laughter.)
   Q. You said that the Kennedy had arrived in the area around
Christmastime, and had begun training operations at that point, is
that correct?
   Carlucci: Admiral Crowe said that.
   Crowe: It arrived in the area.
   It had been in port over the holidays and then left port to go to
the eastern Mediterranean.
   Q. When was the last time, sir, prior to that, that it had
conducted training operations in this region?
   Crowe: I don't know about the Kennedy, but we were in this
specific area in October.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Carlucci: We've conducted training operations in this area
routinely. (To staff) _ I think, Barney, what is it? Some 12 times?
   Staff: Twelve times during the last year and prior to Oct. 18 in
that specific area.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, I wonder if you could compare the normal
challenges that you said occur in this area compared with what
happened today and why this was perceived to be hostile action as
opposed to what normally occurs?
   Carlucci: Well, any pilot can determine the difference.
   It depends on the maneuvers that the aircraft take.
   If you fly out and simply ask an aircraft to identify itself,
that's one thing.
   If you're coming directly at an aircraft, accelerating in speed,
and you _ when the aircraft maneuvers to get out of your way, you
reposition yourself so that you are basically in a firing position,
then the hostile intent is clear.
   But let me emphasize the point again, until we have debriefed the
pilots, we cannot present you with all the details.
   Q. But did the F-14 _
   Q. When do you expect that to take place?
   Carlucci: The pilots are en route to Naples right now.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, you said that their _ our F-14s reduced
altitude and changed their headings, and the MiGs positioned
themselves back on their head. The normal firing position in the
gulf _ preferred gulf firing position _ is behind. Did we change
altitude to get the same altitude as the MiGs? And would we not _
could they not have considered our changing altitude a maneuver to
get on their tail?
   Carlucci: No. Based on _ once again, based on the information we
have today, there is no way that the Libyans could have interpreted
our evasive maneuvers as hostile intent.
   Q. Were the MiGs lower than us? Did we reduce our altitude to get
to the same altitude of those, or get below?
   Carlucci: Actually, they went below the MiGs.
   Q. You said this had no connection to the chemical weapons plant.
But didn't that dispute over the chemical weapons plant create
heightened tensions? And did that in some way contribute to what
happened?
   Carlucci: We have expressed our grave concern over the chemical
weapons plant.
   There is a conference convening in Paris on Jan. 7 to deal with
the worldwide issue of chemical weapons.
   We are exploring this subject within the context of that
conference.
   We will, of course, at that conference express our concerns about
the Libyan facility.
   But there is no way in which our military _ routine military
training _ can contribute to heightened tensions in the area.
   Q. Do you think this incident will have any impact on this whole
dispute about the chemical weapons plant?
   Carlucci: I indicated that we consider the incident closed.
   Q. Mr. Secretary, do you _
   Howard: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've exhausted the
imformation available to us. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
   Carlucci: Thank you.

<BYLINE>Britain Agrees To Moscow Human Rights Conferece in 1991 ^By MAUREEN
JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain today announced its agreement to the Soviet
Union playing host to a human rights conference in 1991, paving the
way for a speedy start to new East-West talks on cutting
conventional forces in Europe.
   A Foreign Office statement said Britain's turnabout followed
substantial improvement in the Soviet human rights record. Sources
in Washington said Tuesday that President Reagan also has decided to
approve holding the conference in Moscow.
   The Foreign Office said British agreement in principle hinged on
the Soviet Union establishing effective guarantees of freedom of
speech, religion and emigration by 1991.
   Britain and the United States had taken the toughest line on
Moscow's ambition to host the conference, and today's announcement
opened the way to wrapping up 35-nation talks between East and West
in Vienna, due to end this month.
   The ending of the current Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe talks in Vienna is a prerequisite for starting new
East-West negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops
in Europe.
   The Foreign Office statement cited a string of improvements in
the Soviet Union's human rights record including, it said, allowing
Jews and others to emigrate, freeing political prisoners and ending
the jamming of Western broadcasts.
   It said that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an address
to the United Nations last month, had promised to reform the Soviet
criminal code and include human rights in new legislation.
   ``This is a substantial improvement in Soviet human rights'
performance which we welcome,'' said the Foreign Office statement.
   ``Nonetheless much remains to be done and we shall continue to
monitor the reforms carefully between now and 1991.''
   The British statement said that by 1991 ``we shall expect to
see:''
   _Implementation of Gorbachev's promised changes in the criminal
code;
   _Effective guarantees for freedom of religion, speech and
emigration;
   _An end to the imprisonment of people for their political or
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals;
   _That all long-term ``refuseniks'' are allowed to emigrate.
   It added that the Moscow conference should be held under the same
conditions as other Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe talks held in the West.
   The conference needed approval of all 35 member-states, and
Britain and the United States took the lead in setting conditions
for Moscow, which wants the conference to set the seal on
Gorbachev's reformist policy.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze stunned
participants when the Vienna talks opened in 1986 by proposing a
human rights conference in Moscow.
   Senior officials of the British Conservative government described
the proposal as outlandish and one top policy-maker likened it to
``holding a whiskey distillers' convention in Riyadh,'' capital of
teetotaling Saudi Arabia.
   But since then Western countries have acknowledged changes or
promises of change by Gorbachev.
   Austria, as host of the talks in Vienna, has invited the
participating nations to attend a three-day closing meeting Jan. 17.
   The new Conventional Stability Talks on arms and troop reductions
are due to be held between the 16 NATO countries and the seven
members of the Communist-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   The mandate for the talks is scheduled to be part of the final
accord of the Vienna meeting.
   The new conventional arms talks will replace the unsuccessful
Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks on reducing forces in
central Europe, which started in Vienna in 1973 and produced no
results.

<HEAD>Walesa Interview Appears in Leading Party Weekly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, interviewed
by the Communist Party weekly Polityka for the first time since
martial law was imposed, predicted authorities will have to
reinstate his union one way or the other.
   The 400,000-circulation newspaper published the full-page
interview in its Jan. 7 edition, which sold out quickly at one busy
newsstand when it became available Wednesday.
   The appearance of the interview in the influential weekly,
formerly edited by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and often
used to convey official party positions, was a further hint that
authorities have accepted Walesa as a partner for discussions and
are reconsidering the ban on Solidarity since 1982.
   Under the headline, ``That's Why We Must Come to An Agreement,''
the interview presented Walesa defending the right of Solidarity to
exist. The state-run PAP news agency also carried excerpts of the
interview, indicating they likely would appear in official
newspapers Thursday.
   ``The authorities will grant the union, whether they want to or
not,'' Walesa said, pointing to simmering public frustrations.
``Only will it be by force or without, and what will be the costs?''
   The publication came one day after government spokesman Jerzy
Urban made clear that authorities are ready to begin talks on the
chief opposition demand: the restoration of the legal status of
Solidarity seven years after it was suppressed in a martial-law
crackdown.
   Walesa has declined to enter the talks, saying he first wants
confirmation of official willingness to legalize Solidarity. The
government says the talks should start with no preconditions.
   ``Legalization of Solidarity is the key issue,'' Walesa said in
the interview.
   ``I repeat: We do not want to overthrow the authorities. A
compromise is in our common interest. ... The interest of Poland is
the order of the day. This is the supreme cause. That's why we must
come to agreement with each other.''
   Walesa also indicated that if legalized, the union would strive
for moderation.
   ``We agree there cannot be constant strikes, struggle, any
attempts at taking over power. We can guard against this. However we
shall not allow ourselves to be divided, to be left without
guarantees that we can maintain our independence,'' he said.
   Although the interviewers pressed Walesa on what guarantees he
could offer authorities, Walesa refused to be specific, saying that
he could only discuss such guarantees in private with authorities.
   But he said he understood officials' concerns. ``I understand the
fears on both sides. How could one help it?''
   Marian Turski, who conducted the interview for Polityka with
fellow political journalist Jerzy Baczynski, said Wednesday the idea
for the interview came up at a Dec. 13 newspaper editorial meeting.
Walesa was telephoned 30 minutes later and agreed to the suggestion
immediately, Turski said.
   The main part of the interview was conducted Dec. 14 at St.
Brygida's Church in Gdansk, but Walesa added some comments after a
Communist Party plenum Dec. 20-21, Turski said.
   ``We came to the conclusion that (through the interview) we could
accelerate certain things, as far as achieving national consensus,''
said Turski. ``And that is, among other things, the role of our
paper.''
   In its 31-year history, Polityka has served the top party
leadership as a sounding board for controversial ideas and a way to
prepare the ground for major decisions or to define the limits of
acceptable comment.
   The paper first interviewed Walesa shortly after the August 1980
Gdansk shipyard strike agreement that marked the beginning of
Solidarity.
   The recent interview came out between two sessions of a Communist
Party plenum at which Central Committee members have been asked to
reconsider the issue of Solidarity. The second part of the plenum is
expected as early as next week.
   If the party indicates that it will make Solidarity legal again,
Walesa has said he would start negotiations with the government at
long-delayed talks on how the union would be restored and other
problems facing Poland. The talks were proposed by the government
during a wave of strikes in August.
   It was not the first interview of Walesa since martial law. The
weekly Konfrontacje broke the unofficial ban on Walesa in the
official press with an interview published in September.
   Walesa also appeared uncensored on nationwide television Nov. 30
in a debate with official unions' chief Alfred Miodowicz, which
authorities said was one of the most-watched TV shows in Polish
history.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Navy planes today shot down two Libyan jet
fighters over the Mediterranean Sea after the American aircraft were
``threatened while conducting routine operations in international
airspace,'' administration officials said.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci emphatically denied that the two
American F-14s and their host aircraft carrier, the USS John F.
Kennedy, were in the area with the intention of attacking a Libyan
chemical weapons factory.
   ``The 6th Fleet operation had no connection whatsoever with
Libya's newly constructed chemical facility. These operations were
conducted over 600 miles northeast'' of the facility,'' Carlucci
said at a Pentagon news briefing.
   ``We now consider this matter closed,'' he said.
   The air battle was the first fighting between the United States
and Libya since American jets bombed Tripoli in 1986 and came amid
rising tension between the two countries over Libya's construction
of the plant.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman also said there
was no link between the plant and the warplane incident. ``There is
absolutely no connection to any other story or concern you may
have,'' he said. ``It may be ironic, but the two things are not
related.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called the downing of his jets an
act of increased ``American terrorism,'' and vowed to ``meet
challenge with challenge,'' the official Libyan news agency JANA
said.
   The American force ``posed no threat to Libya'' and the fighters
were operating under ``normal peacetime rules of engagement,''
Carlucci said, referring to the guidelines on when U.S. servicemen
can open fire on forces that are thought hostile.
   The commander of the F-14 patrol made the decision to fire at the
Libyan aircraft ``in self-defense,'' and apparently shot down both
planes, said Carlucci. The four crewmen of the two planes were being
flown to a U.S. base at Naples, Italy, for debriefing, he said.
   ``At the time of the incident, both the ship and its aircraft
were conducting training operations'' between the Greek island of
Crete and Libya, he said. ``The aircraft carrier was 127 miles north
of Tobruk, Libya'' and the F-14s ``were providing combat air patrol
50 miles south of the Kennedy, which is some 70 miles north of the
northeast Libyan coast,'' he said.
   Carlucci said the F-14s descended from 15,000 to 4,000 feet in
altitude and attempted five seperate evasive maneuvers. ``They
changed speeds, altitude and direction,'' he said.
   ``The Libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner,''
he said. ``Each time, the Libyan aircraft sought to put their nose
on our aircraft. They also accelerated, so the hostile intent seems
to be fairly clear,'' he said.
   ``At about 14 miles, the U.S. section leader decided that his
aircraft was in jeopardy and he could wait no longer. One MiG-23 was
shot down with a Sparrow missile. The second MiG was shot down by a
Sidewinder missile at six miles,'' he said.
   Afterwards, he said, ``two parachutes were sighted and a Libyan
search and rescue helicopter was later detected headed for the
area.'' It was not clear whether the Libyan pilots survived.
   The confrontation occurred about noon local time, or 5 a.m. EST.
   The two MiG-23s were spotted by radar taking off from the Al
Bumbah airfield in eastern Libya, climbing to 9,000 feet and then
accelerating and closing in on the F-14s, which were at 15,000 feet,
officials said.
   Officials said there were no indications that the Libyans fired
before the two American jets downed them.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said, ``Indications are that Libya violated what we call the rules
of engagement ... They maneuvered themselves into a position to be
able to shoot down American planes. The rules of engagement permit
self-defense in those circumstances.''
   ``Under those circumstances, ... clearly it was Libya that took
the provocative action,'' Nunn, D-Ga., told Atlanta radio station
WGST.
   ``Gadhafi never learns,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas. ``Maybe this time he will finally get it straight.
Whenever he threatens American forces, we will defend ourselves.''
   In Rome, Libya's ambassador to Italy, Abdel Rahman Shalgam,
called today's incident ``a unilateral act'' and a ``dangerous''
action. He declined to say how Libya would respond.
   The Libyan Foreign Ministry said that as ``Libyan reconnaissance
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters, U.S.
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them
down.'
   The JANA news agency said the Foreign Ministry also ordered its
United Nations representative to ``present an urgent complaint to
the Security Council concerning the aggression perpetrated by the
U.S.A. against two Libyan reconnaissance planes ... and to demand
the holding of an urgent Security Council meeting on this subject.''
   President Reagan, vacationing at his new home in Los Angeles, was
awakened and informed of the aerial confrontation about an hour
after it occurred, deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk
said.
   He said national security adviser Colin L. Powell telephoned the
president after speaking with White House chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein about the incident.
   The awakening of Reagan contrasted with an incident in August
1981 in which White House aides ran into criticism for not awakening
the president after a similar encounter between U.S. and Libyan jets.
   President-elect Bush also was told of the incident by telephone
at 6 a.m. EST and was bring kept informed of developments,
spokeswoman Sheila Tate said.
   Popadiuk said the U.S. fighters ``were threatened while
conducting routine operations in international airspace north of
Tobruk.''
   ``We will continue with our training operation,'' he said.
``There is no indication of any further Libyan movements outside of
the search and rescue operation. There was no change in the rules of
engagement. I wish to stress that our aircraft were on a routine
training operation and posed no threat to Libya.''
   The incident came amid rising tensions and concern over what the
United States says is a newly constructed plant to make chemical
weapons about 35 miles southwest of the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
   On Tuesday, U.S. officials said for the first time they had
evidence the plant had started producing limited quantities of
chemical weapons and has conducted trial runs of its production
equipment.
   Libya has claimed the plant will make pharmaceuticals and offered
to let international experts inspect the plant. The United States
claimed the offer was inadequate.
   Gadhafi has claimed that the United States is using the
allegations as a pretext to attack his North African country.
   Reagan pointedly refused to rule out a military strike at the
plant, and the United States was scheduled to discuss the plant at
an international conference in Paris beginning Saturday.
   The president told an interviewer last month that a military
attack on the plant had been discussed, but added: ``That is a
decision that has not been made yet.''
   The movement of a U.S. carrier group headed by the USS Theodore
Roosevelt toward the Mediterranean last week had prompted
speculation of an impending strike against Libya. The Pentagon
described it as ``a standard deployment'' and rotation of duty with
the Kennedy carrier group.

   The World Bank is raising interest rates for
more prosperous Third World countries to 7.65 percent annually, the
first such increase since the bank began lending at variable rates
in 1982, officials said Wednesday.
   The rate will apply during the first six months of this year on
$37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries, said Sheldon
Rappaport, a spokesman for the bank.
   For the second half of 1988, the rate was 7.59 percent. The
increase amounts to only 0.06 percent but will cost the borrowers an
additional $11 million, Rappaport estimated. The rate is based on
the cost of the bank's own borrowings and will be recalculated in
mid-1989. The bank gets most of its funds from borrowing on world
markets.
   The bank is owned by 151 governmwents, with the United States
holding the largest block of shares, and is the biggest single
source of aid to Third World countries to help raise their living
standards. It lends more than $19 billion a year.
   When it introduced variable interest rates on most of its loans
in July 1982, the annual rate was 11.43 percent. Since then, the
rate has been reduced each time it was recalculated, twice a year.
   The poorest countries, which borrow from the bank's International
Development Association, will continue to get loans for 40 years at
less than 1 percent a year, with long grace periods during which
only interest is due.

   Vice President George Bush declared himself
winner of the 1988 presidential election today in a quaint,
Constitutional ceremony certifying the ballot-box triumph he gained
last November.
   ``This announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of
the persons elected president and vice president of the United
States,'' Bush said after reading the results of the Electoral
College ballots.
   He immediately shook hands with House Speaker Jim Wright and
grinned as members of the House and Senate accorded him a standing
ovation.
   Bush's pronouncement of his election and that of Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle before a joint session of Congress capped
a carefully choreographed bit of stagecraft as old as the Republic.
   The final tally gave Bush 426 votes. Democrat Michael Dukakis
received 111 and Democratic vice presidential running mate Lloyd
Bentsen received one.
   That comported almost exactly with the results of the election,
with the exception of one West Virginia elector, Margarette Leach of
West Virginia, who cast her vote for Bentsen instead of Dukakis.
   Quayle did not attend the vote-counting ceremony, his office
said, because he had no official role and thought it more important
to work on private meetings concerning hiring his staff and plans
for the Jan. 20 Inauguration.
   ``He didn't want to go. It would have just been a photo op,''
said press secretary Dave Beckwith, adding that Quayle's staff had
discussed the matter with the Bush staff. Since Quayle is no longer
a senator _ his successor was sworn in Tuesday _ and not yet the
vice president, there was no need for him to be there, Beckwith said.
   The outcome was utterly lacking in suspense, yet it was an event
that has not occurred in precisely these circumstances since the
days of Martin Van Buren. The Constitution requires that the vice
president preside over the ceremony, and as Bush occasionally points
out, Van Buren was the last vice president to win election directly
to the White House.
   Thus he was the last man who presided over the ceremony that
certified his own triumph _ in 1837.
   Bush was greeted by applause when he led a parade of senators
into the House chamber for the ceremony. Two pages carried the
Electoral College votes cast by the states into the House in two
mahogany boxes.
   The vice president then mounted the Speaker's rostrum of the
House chamber for the ceremony. Four lawmakers opened and pronounced
the Electoral College results from each of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia ``regular in form and authentic'' and announed
the results.
   If there was no suspense, Bush injected a note of humor. When
Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., simply said that Arkansas had cast six
votes for president, Bush interrupted and said, ``The chair wonders
who won that one.''
   Bush did, along with 39 other states and the right to the White
House.
   At the same time Bush savors his presidential election victory,
aides say he is close to making the final appointment to his
Cabinet, that of energy secretary. James Schlesinger, who served in
the post during the Carter administration, remains the leading
candidate, according to one Republican source.
   Bush also is expected to appoint a drug czar within the next few
days.
   He met privately Tuesday with Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
the Arizona Republic reported that DeConcini is a top contender for
that job. DeConcini would not discuss specifics of the meeting.
   High-level appointments aside, Bush's trip to the Capitol for the
Electoral College ceremony closed the circle on the election of 1988.
   Bush was in the Capitol on Tuesday, as well, presiding over
swearing-in ceremonies for 33 new and newly re-elected senators. He
took time out long enough to renew ``loud and clear'' his campaign
pledge to oppose higher taxes.
   ``It's funny, I've talked to about 33 new senators and not one of
them has said that to me,'' Bush said when asked if a possible tax
ncrease had been discussed.
   He said of his campaign pledge, ``The American people have heard
it loud and clear.''
   Despite Bush's comments, many Democrats and some Republicans
believe he will have to change his mind to win agreement on a
comprehensive plan to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Bush performed the senatorial swearing in chores twice, first in
a formal ceremony on the Senate floor, administering the oath of
office to senators in groups of four. He then did it one by one in a
hall where photographers were permitted.
   The president-elect jokingly told reporters he was ``going to
make a little news up here for you guys.''
   But when he was asked whether he intends to fight a subpoena to
testify in the Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide Oliver
North, Bush retorted: ``I don't want to make that much news.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has decided to support a
schedule of three human rights conferences, including a 1991 session
in Moscow, the White House announced today.
   Deputy Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Reagan has authorized
the U.S. delegation in Vienna to support the three-conference plan,
``in cooperation with like-minded allies'' to encourage continued
progress on human rights in the Soviet Union.
   The conferences are scheduled to take place in Paris in 1989,
Copenhagen in 1990 and Moscow in 1991, he said.
   A White House statement noted significant progress on Soviet
human rights in the past three years, including release of hundreds
of political prisoners and an end to jamming of Voice of America,
Radio Liberty and other Western broadcasts.
   But Popadiuk added, ``The president recognizes that there is much
yet to be done in the Soviet Union before that nation meets
acceptable and universal human rights standards.''
   U.S. agreement to participate in the conference signals American
support for Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's internal reforms
and sets the stage for the opening of new East-West negotiations on
cutting troops and arms in Europe.
   The human rights conference and the European arms negotiations
are linked, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz has recommended
they proceed based on Soviet advances in human rights, a U.S.
official had told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   Reagan, on vacation in California, decided Tuesday to accept
Shultz's advice, said another official, who also spoke on condition
he not be identified.
   Shultz on Sunday is to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze in Paris, where they will be attending a conference
of more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of
chemical weapons.
   The start of conventional arm reduction talks between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has been awaiting
completion of a 35-nation review in Vienna of human rights in the
Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
   Evidently, Reagan has seen enough progress in the Soviet record
to close the conference in Vienna and move on.
   ``It's not a perfect scorecard, but they've done a lot,'' said
one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They've
come amazingly far.''
   The State Department last Friday credited the Soviets with
``significant progress'' in its treatment of political prisoners and
Jewish citizens who are refused permission to emigrate.
   The Soviets have released more than 600 political prisoners in
the last two years, including all the monitors of the 1975 Helsinki
agreement, which held out the promise of an improvement in the human
rights situation, Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman,
said last Friday.
   All prisoners charged with violating political or religious
constraints are now free, and less than a dozen of 120 cases of
Soviet citizens denied permission to join family members abroad
remain unresolved, Mrs. Oakley said.
   Jamming of U.S.-sponsored radio broadcasts has ceased and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his speech Dec. 7 to the U.N.
General Assembly pledged that laws bearing on human rights would be
changed, she said.
   ``They have made significant progress,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``I
think that's clear from the examples I've given.''
   Meanwhile, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported on
Monday that 3,652 Jews left the Soviet Union in December, the
highest monthly total since December 1979.
   The exodus for 1988 totaled 19,287, the highest for any year
since 1980 when 21,471 Jews left.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the conference, said ``we welcome
the marked increase in Jewish emigration in 1988. However, we had
hoped that the 2,696 refuseniks remaining in the Soviet Union would
have been granted permission, in a true expression of glasnost
(openness). Let us hope that the trend toward increased emigration
will continue in 1989, and that all remaining refuseniks will be
included.''
   Jewish emigration is one of the yardsticks used by the United
States to measure Soviet performance on human rights. The Soviets
recently turned over to the State Department a list of about 50
refuseniks, mostly from the Leningrad area, that were to be given
exit permits.
   This was one of the moves that prompted Shultz to recommend U.S.
approval of a Soviet proposal for holding an international human
rights conference in Moscow.
   Soviet imprisonment of about 30 citizens on criminal charges is
another problem that, from the U.S. view, appears to be easing. The
State Department suspects political motives for some of those
imprisonments.
   The Soviets have proposed a ``negotiating forum'' in which U.S.
officials would have access to court records and could present their
concerns that some prisoners may be the victims of ``trumped-up
charges,'' the official said.
   Gorbachev has been eager to host a human rights conference in
Moscow to demonstrate the reforms he has undertaken.
   It is intended as a review of the 1975 Helsinki agreement, which
was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and 32
European countries. Reviews are due to be held in Paris this year
and in Copenhagen in 1990.
   In order to gain what Moscow took to be Western acceptance of the
post-World War II borders of Eastern Europe, the Soviets in 1975
agreed to accelerate the exchange of democratic ideas across the
East-West divide.
   Ever since, the United States and its allies have used the
Helsinki accord to pressure Moscow to improve human rights
conditions.

   A university president in Nanking appealed
Wednesday for African students to return to the campus where a fight
with Chinese touched off racial hostility that has spread to at
least four cities.
   In Beijing, the nearly 500 African students at the Beijing
Languages Institute boycotted classes Wednesday, a day after Chinese
demonstrated against an alleged attack by a black student on a
Chinese woman.
   ``Brothers, let us unite and fight for dignity,'' said a leaflet
distributed by Africans at the institute. ``Black is beauty.''
   In Wuhan, an industrial city in central China, about 300 Chinese
students threw rocks at the African students' dormitory, allegedly
beat up a Sri Lankan student and put up posters saying ``Black
Devils Go Home'' in a disturbance Saturday at the Central China
Polytechnical College, foreigners said Wednesday.
   In the eastern city of Hangzhou, about 50 Africans were in their
second week of boycotting classes over what they say was an attempt
by university authorities to isolate them by saying they had AIDS.
   Liang Ruiju, head of Hehai University in Nanking, said he hoped
for the prompt return of about 40 Africans who have been isolated at
a guest house outside the eastern Chinese city for nine days.
   ``We have made full preparations to welcome foreign students to
return to school to study,'' Liang was quoted by the official Xinhua
News Agency as saying. He said there are a ``small number of African
students who do not study hard, behave poorly and often fight and
make trouble.''
   But he said, ``Hehai University has treated students from all
countries equally and never discriminated against African students.''
   The 40 African students _ city officials put the number at more
than 50 _ reportedly refuse to return to the campus out of fear for
their safety.
   They were among about 140 mostly African students who were forced
to the guest house after police blocked their attempt to board
trains for Beijing. They were fleeing thousands of Chinese youths
who ransacked their dormitory and staged street rallies demanding
punishment for Africans involved in a Dec. 24 fight in which 11
Chinese and two Africans were injured.
   A student from Ghana was arrested Saturday in a confrontation at
the guest house in which Africans claim police beat and tortured
them with electric batons. Three other students have been detained
for questioning.
   A diplomat from the Ghana Embassy in Beijing said on Wednesday
that the Foreign Ministry had ``denied everything'' related to
police brutality.
   Minister-Counsellor Y.N. Ohene-Akrasi said a group of about nine
African diplomats, who met with the Africans in Nanking last week,
planned to return on Friday to confer with the students.
   Ohene-Akrasi said the outbreak of racial strife in other Chinese
cities ``gives us concern. We are following these events very
keenly.''
   The two foreigners who described the disturbance Saturday at the
Central China Polytechnical College in Wuhan _ a student from Gabon
and an American teacher _ said school authorities took the college's
12 African students on a trip to the countryside on Sunday and they
have yet to return.
   The student and teacher spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Gabonese student said Chinese students at the college wrote a
letter to the school director saying they didn't want Africans at
the school because they were ``polluting Chinese society with their
relations with Chinese women.''
   In the city of Hangzhou, an African student at the Zhejiang
Agricultural College said the Africans boycotting classes in the
AIDS protest met school officials Wednesday who promised to give
them a written statement saying the university had no official
policy of discrimination against Africans.
   The student, Vincent Ongas, of Kenya, said that once the
statement is received the Africans would consider whether to end the
boycott. ``It was a tough meeting. As you know, we're not quite a
happy group in China,'' he said.
   The Chinese side denies all charges of racial prejudice and
expresses pride at its long-established policy of showing solidarity
with the Third World by giving scholarships to African students.
There are about 1,500 African students from 40 nations now in China.
   However, Africans say they are subject to racial discrimination,
and social contacts between African men and Chinese women are a
frequent source of tension.
   Chinese also resent that Africans, many from countries as poor as
China, receive far better food and lodging than Chinese students.

<TEXT>
   Excerpts from the interview with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa published in the Jan. 7 edition of the Communist
Party weekly Polityka:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The government can say that ``Solidarity'' means the struggle
against the authorities or the threat of anarchy. And it is right.
Somebody else will say that it is the struggle for reform. And he is
also right. For me it is the struggle for making the authorities
undertake reforms, carried on at various places, not en masse as it
once used to be but through various associations, clubs, economic
movements and its main, unionist stream.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The international situation is much better now. Important
transformations are taking place in other countries, especially in
the Soviet Union. I talked about this with Professor Andrei Sakharov
in Paris. They also understand in Moscow that it is necessary to
depart from the Stalinist system, to break with it. The totalitarian
structure must be replaced by pluralism.
   We also could hear a similar opinion voiced from the highest
rostrum in Poland recently. This raises our hopes that reformatory
forces will prevail in the governing camp. Solidarity keeps
repeating that it is ready to sign an anti-crisis pact in favor of
reform.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The authorities have seen that without agreement nothing can be
done in the country. And society has also learned that without the
authorities one cannot go far.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I state once again: In this country agreement is necessary. The
legalization of Solidarity is the key matter. There is nothing to be
afraid of. I repeat _ we do not want to overthrow the authorities.
Compromise lies in our common interest. Together we have to do
something for Poland. The interest of Poland is the order of the
day. This is the supreme matter and this is why we must reach
agreement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   You are saying that there is at threat of destabilization if the
authorities legalize the union. The authorities shall grant the
union, whether they want to or not. Only will it be by force, or
without, and what will be the costs? For me this is the question.
And tanks won't help here, because they did not once already. ...
Poland needs quick agreement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Guarantees? I reassure: We are not a threat to this authority,
this apparatus. We don't have any other party or group which could
take over power. And the party has lots of time to situate itself on
this evolutionary path. However it is threatened by a revolutionary
path. And that's why, if it does not come to terms with us, if we
together don't find a place for it (the party) and for us, then this
would be dangerous. Both for the party and maybe for us as well. It
is better to come to terms now, peacefully, rather than after
fighting. There is more to be gained. And it will be easier for the
party to rule when it is clearly aware of its place. In Poland there
must be place for everybody. The sooner the party comes to terms
with us, the better. A new solution by force? We don't want to
become Afghanistan. I will say what I said in 1981: Let's meet on
the road to reforms, because there is no other way out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I evaluate this meeting (TV debate Nov. 30 with the head of the
official union federation Alfred Miodowicz) very well, but not from
the point of view of a battle or victory. It must result in
something. The stagnation which has existed in Poland must end since
we all are losing because of it. ... This debate was like a breeze
in our inertia _ we have caught some wind in our sails.

   ``Coming to America'' may be going to court.
   A Memphis man, Laurence Armour, has filed a $40 million lawsuit
against entertainer Eddie Murphy, claiming the comedian stole the
plot for the hit movie from Armour's screenplay, ``The Cannibal.''
   Armour, 41, joins at least two others _ columnist Art Buchwald
and writer Shelby Gregory _ who claim the movie plot was taken from
their work.
   Armour said he sent the idea to comedian Richard Pryor in 1986.
Pryor and Murphy are pals, and both work for Paramount Pictures, he
said.
   ``Coming to America'' stars Murphy as an African prince who comes
to the United States to seek a bride who will love him for what he
is, not for what he owns.
   Armour said his screenplay begins the same way, with an African
prince who comes to America. But in his script, the prince becomes a
cannibal after finding he likes the taste of flesh while sucking
venom from a snakebite.
   Armour's federal court lawsuit alleges that there are 20
substantial similarities between his script outline, a newspaper
clipping he sent along with it, and the movie.
   Buchwald told People magazine in August the movie was based on a
story he sold to Paramount titled ``It's a Crude, Crude World.''
   Buchwald hasn't filed a lawsuit, but Gregory has sued for $10
million, claiming the movie was based on his script, ``Toto, the
African Prince.''
   S. Russell Headrick, a lawyer who has been retained to represent
Pryor, Murphy and Paramount in Memphis, said he is preparing a
response to Armour's lawsuit. He declined further comment.

   A man who helped rescue George Bush from
the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago is recuperating from back
surgery and will have to skip the president-elect's inauguration
Jan. 20.
   ``It's a $32 million party and I can't go,'' Dan Moody lamented
Tuesday.
   Moody, 71, said he received an invitation to the inauguration but
can't even ride in a car until Jan. 30.
   The retired electronics technician said he last saw Bush on Sept.
2, 1944, off the Bonin Islands south of Japan. Moody was a
torpedoman aboard the submarine Finback.
   The Finback rescued the crew members of a dozen or more downed
U.S. planes that day, Moody recalled. Among them was Bush, the
youngest pilot in the Navy.
   ``He survived, but his two crewmen didn't,'' said Moody. ``We
brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee.''
   The Finback returned to Pearl Harbor about four weeks later with
the aviators. Bush spent the long trip to Hawaii ``censoring the
mail,'' said Moody.
   Moody said he believed all living crew members from the submarine
were invited to the inauguration.

   Gov. Norm Bangerter has been ordered to cut
back on his one-on-one basketball games after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on an arthritic right knee.
   Bangerter, who turned 56 on Wednesday, the same day the state had
its 93rd birthday, underwent the three-hour procedure Tuesday
morning at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center, said
hospital spokesman John Dwan.
   The governor checked out of the hospital later the same day.
   ``His leg is very stiff and sore, and it'll take a couple of days
before he feels better,'' Dwan said. ``He should be ready to address
the Legislature when it convenes next Monday.''
   The operation, which has been planned for months, involved the
removal of a small amount of bone and cartilage debris.
   ``It's what is called a `low-gain' procedure. This is not going
to cure his condition,'' Dwan said. ``It may help him, give him a
few more years of relatively painless use of his joint.
   ``We'll just have to wait and see if it gives him any relief,''
he added. ``The governor has been advised to cut back on his
one-on-one basketball a little bit.''
   One of Bangerter's first acts as governor four years ago was to
install a basketball standard at the governor's mansion.

Wednesday morning as a jazz band played outside.
   ``I'm going to buy a pair of socks and some underwear here,''
said Curtis, nattily dressed in a blue pinstripe suit, black shirt

   ``I have never been to a Harrods' sale before. The atmosphere is
really exciting,'' he told reporters as he stood with Harrods owner
Mohamed al Fayed waiting for the first rush of shoppers.
   Only a few thousand people were waiting at the 11 entrances to
Harrods when the doors opened just before 9 a.m. and nobody spent
the night waiting to be first in line, as has often happened in the
past.
   Nonetheless, the store, in London's Knightsbridge section, was
predicting record sales during the three-week sale.
   Among the bargains: an 18-carat gold necklace reduced from
$290,000 to $145,000.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan was awakened about an hour
after Wednesday's downing of two Libyan jet fighters by U.S. Navy
planes over the Mediterranean Sea, in contrast to a similar incident
in 1981 when he was not told for more than six hours.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, the president's national security adviser, telephoned the
president at the home in the fashionable Bel Air district of Los
Angeles where Reagan will live after his term ends Jan. 20.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan have been staying at
the home during most of a two-week California vacation which they
will wind up on Thursday, returning to Washington for their final
two weeks in the White House.
   Popadiuk said Powell telephoned White House Chief of Staff
Kenneth M. Duberstein before informing the president of the shooting
at 2:53 a.m. PST.
   He said he had no information on the president's reaction, except
to say, ``The president . . . considers the incident closed.''
   In the earlier incident in August 1981, seven months after Reagan
took office, his aides were sharply criticized for allowing him to
sleep after they knew of the downing of two Libyan planes.
   In both incidents, two Libyan aircraft were downed by U.S. F-14s.
   In the 1981 case, Reagan was also in Los Angeles, staying in a
$750-a-day suite at the Century Plaza Hotel. At that time, he went
six hours and four minutes without knowing of the shooting.
   Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes said
presidential counselor Edwin Meese III and national security adviser
Richard V. Allen, both in Los Angeles with the presidential party,
were informed almost immediately.
   That incident, the first since the Vietnam War in which U.S.
planes fired on foreign planes, occurred at 10:20 p.m. PDT. Meese
telephoned Reagan at 4:24 a.m. PDT, Speakes said. They spoke for
four or five minutes and the president went back to sleep, he added.
   Popadiuk said he did not know whether Reagan went back to sleep
after being told of Wednesday's shooting. He also said Powell kept
in touch with the president by telephone during the day, bringing
him up to date on developments.
   In 1981, Speakes said Meese decided not to inform the president
after conferring with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. He
said Meese felt that no decisions were necessary and he wanted to
await a more complete report before disturbing the president.
   Speakes said the president did not object to not having been
awakened earlier. Others informed before the president included
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in Santa Barbara, Calif.;
Vice President George Bush in Maine; and CIA Director William Casey
in Washington.
   Speakes said Reagan's aides decided that only two decisions were
necessary and that they had been made shortly after the incident.
   One was whether to continue the training exercises, which the
fleet commander had decided to do, and the other was whether the
aircraft pilots should return fire, which they had already done.
   In Wednesday's case, also, officials announced that the training
exercise would continue.

   A top U.S. diplomat said Tuesday the United
States hopes a Paris conference on chemical weapons will expand the
power of the United Nations to investigate allegations of use of the
illegal arms.
   ``We would like chemical weapons never to be used and we would
like countries like Libya not to be producing them,'' said
Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, deputy permanent representative.
   ``Our goal will be to enhance the role of the secretary-general
to investigate promptly allegations of the use of these (chemical)
weapons and to report back to the international community so they
can do something about it,'' said Okun, the No. 2 U.S. diplomat at
the United Nations.
   Okun, in an interview with The Associated Press, commented on an
international conference on chemical weapons starting Saturday in
Paris, which will discuss what he called ``the poor countries'
atomic bomb.''
   The meeting was proposed last fall by President Reagan and French
President Francois Mitterrand to curb the use and production of
chemical weapons, and to strengthen international opposition to the
arms.
   The weapons already are outlawed by the Geneva Protocol of 1925,
but it has been violated widely by some developing nations.
   The conference will be attended by about 140 nations and
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Okun declined to discuss possible sanctions, such as a trade
embargo, for confirmed use of the weapons, saying that was premature.
   The U.N. General Assembly and Security Council have condemned the
use of chemical weapons in general and in the Iran-Iraq war. Last
summer, a U.N. report cited Iraq's widespread use of the weapons,
allegedly against its dissident Kurdish minority. Iraq denied it and
refused access to international investigators.
   Sometimes, diplomats have said, political considerations have
prevented the world body from promptly expressing outrage and
condemnation of a particular country. Last year when the Security
Council wanted to bring Iraq to the bargaining table to try to end
its war with Iran, some nations were reluctant to publicly condemn
Iraq, lest it refuse to talk.
   Okun said the U.S. goal at the conference is to heighten
consciousness about the use of chemical weapons.
   Asked about U.S. charges that Libya is about to produce chemical
weapons at a purported pesticide plant, Okun said plans for the
conference preceded the Libyan situation.
   ``It is not directly aimed at Libya, Iraq or anbody else,'' he
said.
   He emphasized that U.N. investigation of alleged chemical weapon
use was one thing and ``the production side is another question.
   ``But clearly a heavily defended (Libyan) plant that is producing
only `pesticides' in Libya allows us to assume the worst. We have to
assume that. It's a separate issue but we take it very seriously,''
he said.
   Asked against whom the Libyan plant would have to be defended,
Okun said he didn't know, but added: ``If their motives are not
good, they probably would have to fear a lot of people.''

<TEXT>
   Two Sikhs convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi are to be hanged
Friday, relatives of the condemned men and a government official
said Wednesday.
   ``Today's date is the blackest date for me, not because my
father's execution date has been fixed, but because an innocent man
has lost all hopes of mercy and justice,'' said Rajinder Singh, the
son of one of the men. ``My father was and is innocent.''
   He said his mother and brother were informed of the execution
date when they visited New Delhi's Tihar Jail on Wednesday.
   His father, Kehar Singh, 54, and Satwant Singh, 24, have been at
the prison since their arrest in November 1984. The men are not
related. All Sikhs take the name Singh, which means lion in the
Punjabi language.
   An official at the Home Ministry confirmed the hanging was
scheduled Friday but said it was open to change.
   ``We have to wait for the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The condemned, who are not related, have filed appeals before the
court that are scheduled to be heard Thursday.
   It is the second time their execution has been set. The Supreme
Court stayed the hanging 15 hours before it was scheduled Dec. 2
after Kehar Singh's lawyers challenged the dismissal of his mercy
petition to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
   Satwant Singh did not filed a mercy petition _ legally the final
avenue for a person condemned to die _ but under Indian law, his
death sentence was automatically delayed when Kehar Singh sought
clemency.
   Venkataraman turned down the mercy plea Monday, clearing the way
for the executions.
   On Thursday, the Supreme Court will hear Kehar Singh's appeal of
the president's dismissal of his mercy petition. The court also will
hear Satwant Singh's request that it investigate his allegations of
murder against two of Mrs. Gandhi's bodyguards.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two Sikhs.
   One of them, Beant Singh, was shot and killed by two bodyguards
minutes later. The other, Satwant Singh, was shot and wounded.
   Satwant Singh has alleged the bodyguards fired at him and Beant
Singh after they were disarmed. A magistrate's court and an appeals
court have already rejected his pleas to investigate the case.
   Kehar Singh, an uncle of Beant Singh, was convicted of conspiracy.
   Mrs. Gandhi's assassination was in apparent revenge for an army
raid she had ordered four months previously on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar, the holiest Sikh shrine, to rid the complex of Sikh
militants.
   More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the raid.
   Sikh militants are fighting for a separate nation in Punjab
state, where they are a majority. Throughout India, however, Sikhs
are a minority and claim discrimination by the Hindu majority.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said Wednesday
his government is in control a week after bloody riots, but
predicted ``troublemakers'' would try again and hinted at a tough
response.
   Four people were killed and scores injured in riots protesting
price increases and the civil war in southern Sudan that began
nearly six years ago.
   Mahdi said Wednesday the government was working on economic and
political reforms. Severe shortages of bread and gasoline continued
across the country and newspapers reported student protests in two
western towns.
   Officials said Wednesday 130,000 tons of wheat and flour from
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands had arrived in Port Sudan
on the Red Sea and would be used to relieve the bread shortage.
Bread, when available, has increased in price from the equivalent of
about 1{ cents to nearly 23 cents.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mahdi blamed the riots
on dramatic price increases for basic goods, which were rescinded
immediately. He asserted that his 3-year-old government was in
control and had the support of most Sudanese.
   ``I have no doubt that, if it comes to street support the
government will have greater support than any combination of its
enemies,'' Mahdi declared.
   He added, however: ``I think troublemakers will try to work up
something on the streets. ... The provocative procedures, if some
insist on them, will be neutralized. ... Ultimately, if it is a
question of street action, I think it will be defeated.''
   The prime minister conducted the interview in his downtown
offices, wearing the traditional Sudanese white flowing robe and
turban.
   Protesters stormed the offices on Dec. 29, smashing government
cars and shouting for Mahdi's resignation, but police dispersed them
with tear gas and water cannon before they reached the premier.
   Riots began after the government decreed price increases of 600
percent for sugar and 60 percent for cigarettes and a 15 percent tax
on domestically manufactured goods. Wages were raised by up to 500
percent two days earlier and the government said the new revenues
were intended to pay for them.
   ``I think the main cause of the demonstrations is the extent of
the changes that have taken place without necessary preparations,''
Mahdi said, and he was discussing with trade unions how to finance
the higher wages.
   He said revenue must be found ``and we are discussing these
sources. There will be more negotiations on all fronts.''
   Asked about possible peace talks with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in the south, Mahdi said he would send Defense
Minister Abdul-Maguid Hamed Khalil to meet with the rebel leader,
former army Col. John Garang.
   ``If they are interested in peace, they will have to meet with
the party against whom they're fighting,'' he said.
   No date has been set for Khalil's departure. Garang has said he
will speak only with someone who brings government endorsement of a
peace proposal he signed in November with the Democratic Unionist
Party, then a member of Mahdi's governing alliance.
   The Democratic Unionists left the coalition after Mahdi refused
to accept the terms. Many political observers say he rejected the
agreement to placate the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, a
buffer in the Cabinet between his Umma Party and the Unionists.
   What the Front opposes is a provision to suspend the
1,350-year-old Islamic legal code in Sudan, which the rebels in the
predominantly Christian and animist south consider a necessity.
Garang's army seeks greater autonomy for the the south from the
Moslem north of Africa's largest country.
   Mahdi said he wants peace, but ``What is under review are the
unacceptable aspects of the agreement.''
   Speaking of famine and disease in the south, which Western
officials say killed at least 560,000 people in 1988, Mahdi said
hope can be found in the food airlift being conducted by the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   He said the airlift, agreed upon by the government and rebels,
``has had a peaceful effect.''
   Relief efforts had been stalled by rebel threats to attack
convoys moving without permission, whether from the government or
international organizations. The government refused to cooperate
with international agencies dealing with the rebels.

   A motorist who admitted he ``was driving
like a nut'' was followed home and shot by an angry driver who
accused him of nearly causing a collision, police said.
   Eric Montgomery, 22, of Wheeling was charged Tuesday with
malicious assault in the Dec. 22 incident and was being held on
$15,000 bond in the Ohio County Jail, police said.
   The wounded man, Kent Blazier, 31, of Wheeling, suffered a
gunshot wound and was released from the hospital last week.
   ``The guy got out of the car and said (Blazier) was speeding and
nearly hit him and pulled out a gun,'' said police Sgt. Fred
Schultz. ``Blazier said, `You're not going to shoot me for that, are
you?' And then he shot him in the abdomen.''
   Blazier said he was upset the day of the shooting because he was
short of funds for a Christmas present he wanted to purchase. ``I
was drunk a little bit and I was driving like a nut, and I came down
a hill around a turn fast,'' he said.
   ``I was wrong, but I shouldn't have got shot for it,'' Blazier
said.
   He said he was home for about five minutes when he heard a man
yelling outside. He said an argument ensued and he was shot after he
tried to kick the assailant in the face when he pulled out a gun.
   Police refused to comment on the investigation or how they found
Montgomery, but Blazier said he provided authorities with a license
plate number.

   Joyce Mays, former nail biter, got her first
manicure 20 years ago to enhance the beauty of the big topaz ring
her husband gave her.
   Twenty years later, Mays' fingernails are her most prized
posession _ each five-inch-long, twisting, brightly painted one of
them.
   Now she uses the nails to draw the customers from among the
curious who gather at the window of the Finesse Hair Designers salon
and watch her give manicures.
   ``People stare at my nails,'' said Mays, 43. ``When they do, it
doesn't bother me. I try to get closer _ and give them one of my
business cards.''
   It has been three years since she cut her nails, which she paints
with acrylics, changing the designs about every three weeks.
   To protect them, she never uses them in mundane tasks like
dialing telephones. Instead, her knuckles get a lot of wear and tear.
   She also can't change the sheets on the bed. For that, she
enlists the aid of her husband, Bill.
   When Pope John Paul II visited New Orleans last year, she painted
a picture of the pontiff, hands clasped in prayer, on one thumbnail.
On the other was a likeness of St. Louis Cathedral, blue sky in the
background and a banner with the pope's name flying above it.

   There are about 35,000 babies just
waiting to be born in Louisiana. Officially speaking, that is.
   The babies are alive and kicking as far as their parents are
concerned, but they don't yet exist in state records. That's because
budget cuts have caused a three-month backlog on the issuance of
birth certificates in the state.
   ``We are waiting for the paper to come in. We expect it to come
in in about a week,'' said Gwen Bach-Stewart, spokeswoman for the
Department of Health and Hospitals. ``What we plan to do to get
caught up is to print 6,000 to 8,000 a week to knock out the
backlog.''
   When cash-flow problems developed last year, the department cut
in half its order of paper used in printing birth certificates, she
said.
   ``When the supply got low, we had to order again,'' Bach-Stewart
said. But state purchasing procedures are lengthy and the paper ran
out.
   State law requires the Office of Vital Statistics to send the
parents of all newborns a free birth certificate. Normally about
2,000 of the certificates are sent each week.
   Once the new paper supplies arrive, Vital Statistics will start
sending the certificates out at an expedited rate, assigning
additional workers to the job until the backlog is erased,
Bach-Stewart said.
   ``It is going to be behind for a while. If the public bears with
us we should be back to normal in a short time,'' she said.

<HEAD>`Miraculous' Glow, Religious Images Draw Hundreds to Firewood Yard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARRETT STATION, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 people have flocked
to a suburban firewood yard since Christmas Eve, sometimes standing
vigil until dawn, to see a glowing light and what some claim to be
images of the Virgin Mary or Jesus.
   The reported appearance of the light amid logs and stacks of
bundled firewood has drawn increasingly larger crowds each night to
this predominantly black community a few miles northeast of Houston.
   ``To me, it's a blessing,'' said Pat Reed, 46, a homemaker in
Barrett Station. ``I keep coming back for more. It's the most
wonderful thing that's ever happened. I think it will help draw us
together to serve God more.''
   The size of the crowds has prompted the Harris County Sheriff's
Department to offer assistance with crowd control as cars begin
stacking up at dusk and hundreds file into the site.
   Joseph Lemond, 75, who runs the firewood yard with his son, said
he first saw the light on Christmas Eve when he went to check
equipment in the yard.
   Photographs taken a few days later show a light radiating a
brilliant blue, beige and white diamond-shaped image, but Lemond
said the image is ``much clearer and more vivid when I've seen it''
than it appears in the blurred photos.
   After New Year's Eve, he said, the blue light faded to a golden
white, in which some spectators reported seeing a vision of Jesus
with a thorned crown, along with occasional glimpses of the Virgin.
   ``I feel the light is pretty miraculous,'' Lemond said.
   The light reflects off an overturned, white table lying near a
shed at the back of the cluttered lot.
   ``Everything has been like this for five years,'' said Lemond's
son, Martin. ``We've come out here at night and never seen it
before.''
   Last weekend, the family showed it to some neighbors and to a
Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Donald Fest.
   ``I saw the blue-and-white configuration,'' said Fest, who viewed
the light New Year's Eve. ``It's possible that it's supernatural,
but I'm not an expert. I can't explain it. I call it a curious
phenomenon.''

<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy on her second night of duty was
fatally shot at a jail early today by an inmate released hours
earlier, authorities said.
   Suzanne Kays, 33, was shot several times with her own gun at the
Lew Sterrett Criminal Justice Center after the rookie tried to stop
37-year-old Alfonso Seward from entering an area off limits to the
public, officials said.
   Kays, who had been named the top graduate in her class at the
training academy, was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
   Seward was shot several times by police officers after the
slaying, said Sheriff Jim Bowles. He was listed in serious condition.
   It was the first slaying at a Dallas jail since Jack Ruby shot
Lee Harvey Oswald on Nov. 24, 1963 in the basement of the Dallas
city jail, authorities said. Oswald had been arrested in the
assassination of President Kennedy.
   Today's shooting was the first slaying of a law officer in Dallas
in 1989. Five police officers were killed in 1988, the deadliest
year in department history.
   Seward, who had been arrested five times since Nov. 9 on
misdemeanor charges, had been jailed Monday for failing to pay for a
restaurant meal and was released Tuesday evening, less than eight
hours before the shooting.
   Sheriff's spokesman Jim Ewell said Seward had stayed in the lobby
for a couple of hours after being freed. Bowles said the man tried
to enter a secure area.
   ``There was an altercation and he assassinated her,'' the sheriff
said.
   After the shooting, the man waved the deputy's pistol at clerks
and a janitor and fired a shot in a corridor, Bowles said. Two
police officers with shotguns demanded his surrender, but he refused
and was shot in the lower body, the sheriff said.
   Kays was described as a model officer and had worked for the
county as a detention officer since 1981. ``Any time an officer is
slain, it's terrible,'' said sheriff's Lt. James Cron. ``But when
it's one of her caliber, it's a real loss.''
   Kays, who was single, and had served from Army from 1975 to 1979.
She joined the department in 1981, starting as a detention service
officer.
   She was the only female in the training class that graduated
Thursday and was awarded a wristwatch as the top student in
academics and firearms efficiency. As a detention officer, she had
not been allowed to carry a weapon.
   Kays was the first Dallas County law enforcement officer since
1982 to die in the line of duty.
   Bowles said he will order a review of security at the jail.

<TEXT>
   A farm couple who have bitterly fought
foreclosure were released from jail Wednesday after being charged in
an incident in which they refused to obey an eviction notice and
were carried out of their home by sheriff's deputies.
   Herman Gennrich was charged with trespassing and his wife,
Beverly Gennrich, was charged with trespassing and obstructing the
legal process, both misdemeanors, said Carver County Attorney Mike
Fahey.
   ``A condition of their release is that they not return to their
farm without permission from the court,'' Fahey said. ``If they do,
they'll probably be arrested again for trespassing.''
   The couple were removed from their home near Cologne on Tuesday.
Authorities, using trucks and trailers, then removed their
belongings, machinery and livestock.
   Sheriff's Captain Ed Hjermstad said the Gennrichs were carried
out of their house after refusing to leave and trying to ``arrest''
the deputies on trespassing charges.
   The deputies were carrying out a court order to foreclose on the
couple's farm about 40 miles southwest of Minneapolis, Fahey said
Tuesday.
   The couple were told to be off the 320-acre farm by Nov. 4, but
they had until Dec. 31 to match the bank's offer on their property,
which they failed to do, Fahey said.
   The Gennrichs' land was auctioned in May 1987, but the family was
allowed to farm the land for one year under a grace period
provision. The farm was purchased by Farm Credit Services for
$405,000.
   The Gennrichs are to appear in court again Jan. 11, Fahey said.
   In June 1987, Gennrich and his son, Robert, who owns an adjoining
farm, pleaded guilty to charges that they resisted attempts by
authorities to repossess equipment and livestock in February of that
year. Authorities said the father and son bashed a trailer and
brandished firearms when creditors tried to repossess the equipment.

<HEAD>Electoral College a 200-Year-Old Political Oddity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Electoral College, a 200-year-old political
oddity, has once again elected a president and vice president of the
United States.
   The electoral votes were carried by blue-coated pages into a
joint session of Congress at 1 p.m. Wednesday in a pair of large,
brass-bound mahogany boxes, secured with stout leather straps.
   The straps were unfastened, padlocks were unlocked and tellers _
two from the Senate and two from the House _ slit open the sealed
manila envelopes stored inside and read the official results, state
by state by state.
   Born of compromise in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the
Electoral College first saw service in the nation's first
presidential election in 1789, deciding that the voters were right
in selecting George Washington as president and John Adams as vice
president.
   In theory, the Electoral College could have arrived at a
different result entirely in 1789.
   And, again in theory, the outcome now could be entirely different
than that called for by the voters: George Bush for president and
Dan Quayle as vice president.
   Indeed, the result Bush announced, 426 electoral votes for Bush,
111 votes for Democrat Michael Dukakis, and one vote for Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, is one vote off the result dictated by voters.
   When the electoral votes originally were counted in state
capitals, one elector _ Margarette Leach of West Virginia _ cast her
presidential vote for Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and her vice
presidential vote for Dukakis.
   Why did she do that?
   ``I wanted to make a statement about the Electoral College,'' she
said. ``We've outgrown it. And I wanted to point up what I see as a
weakness in the system: That 270 people can get together in this
country and elect a president, whether he's on the ballot or not. In
most states, electors can do whatever they want, if you're over 35
and a citizen.''
   On Wednesday, Bush became the first sitting vice president since
Martin Van Buren in 1837 to announce his own election as president.
   Bush shook hands with dozens of House members as he entered the
House chamber in a procession in which the boxes containing the
electoral ballots came first, Bush came next and members of the
Senate brought up the rear.
   Early in the counting process, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., a
teller appointed by the House, forgot to give the names of the
winners, declaring only that ``Arkansas casts six votes for
president and six votes for vice president.''
   ``Who? Who? Who?'' the audience of lawmakers chanted.
   Bush got off a quip.
   ``The chair wonders who won that,'' he said.
   The House chamber burst into applause.
   ``It's obvious they all know the answer to that,'' Bush said,
displaying a happy grin.
   There were few other slips, although Annunzio repeatedly declared
that he was announcing ``e-lec-tor-i-al'' votes.
   At least one grumble was heard after Bush announced the results:
Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., said he believed the electoral system
should be scrapped and replaced with a direct popular vote. He
predicted that might well be done ``at some point where a president
is elected by a minority.''
   The Electoral College sprang from disagreement inside the
Constitutional Convention over how a president should be elected.
   Direct popular election was opposed by delegates who feared that
most people would not know enough about the candidates to make a
wise choice. Other objections were raised to proposals that Congress
select the president or that state legislatures do it.
   A committee was appointed and it hammered together a solution:
Each state would appoint presidential electors equal to the total
number of its senators and representatives in Congress.
   In present day terms, that comes to 435 members of the House of
Representatives and 100 members of the Senate plus three electoral
votes for the District of Columbia.
   On Election Day, the voters of each state actually choose
electors pledged to the candidate of their choice and selected by
state party organizations.
   To win election, a presidential candidate must receive 270
electoral votes, an absolute majority.
   If no candidate scores that high, the winner is picked by the
House of Representatives from the three top vote getters. In that
process, each state delegation casts just one vote.
   If no vice presidential candidate gets a majority, the victor is
chosen by the Senate from the top two.

   A former nurse's aide charged in the deaths
of two nursing home residents was the lookout while her accomplice
suffocated patients in their beds, friends of the defendant
testified Wednesday.
   In a preliminary hearing in 59th District Court, two women who
identified themselves as friends of Catherine Wood testified that
Wood had told them that a fellow nurse's aide, Gwendolyn Graham, was
responsible for the deaths of patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home
in this Grand Rapids suburb.
   Wood, 26, was charged Dec. 5 with two counts of murder. Judge
Sherwin Venema on Wednesday ordered her to stand trial on the
charges.
   Graham, 25, was arrested Dec. 4 near her home in Tyler, Texas,
and is fighting extradition to Michigan. She has been charged with
one count of murder.
   Police suspect the two women in eight deaths at the nursing home
in the first half of 1987, all of which were attributed to natural
causes at the time. Two of the bodies have been exhumed, those of
60-year-old Marguerite Chambers and 97-year-old Edith Cook.
   Dawn Male, who was fired as a nurse's aide at Alpine in 1986,
testified Tuesday that Wood and Graham showed her souvenirs the two
had collected from patients they allegedly murdered, but that she
thought it was a bad joke.
   She said the two, who were lesbian lovers, showed her a sock and
a necklace and listed six or seven names of patients they killed.
   ``Gwen (Graham) said she used a pillow to suffocate patients. I
didn't believe them. I thought they were joking around with me _ a
sick joke,'' said Male, who admitted having a sexual relationship
with the two women.
   Male said they told her Wood ``watched if someone was coming''
while Graham suffocated the patients.
   Both Male and another friend of the defendant testified Graham
was the more violent of the pair and had physically abused Wood.
   Nancy Harris, who met Wood in June, said Wood ``told me that she
was afraid for her life, that she was very worried about this
particular woman (Graham).'' ``She said she had seen this woman
suffocate Marguerite Chambers. She felt this woman was capable of
killing anyone,'' she testified. Wood said Graham had tried to
suffocate her, Harris testified.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Mayor Apparently Hiding After PLO Opposes Truce Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of the West Bank town of Bethlehem,
who proposed a truce in the Palestinian uprising, appeared to be in
hiding Wednesday after a warning from Yasser Arafat and death
threats painted on the town walls.
   The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday quoted Mayor Elias Freij as saying
he had withdrawn the truce idea.
   Freij said Friday that during a recent visit to Romania, he
raised the possibility of a U.N.-sponsored truce in the year-old
Palestinian uprising.
   He said he proposed conditions under which Israel would free
5,000 Palestinian prisoners, allow universities to open, and hold
municipal elections for the first time in 12 years.
   ``I spoke about a U.N.-sponsored resolution like the one that
stopped the Iran-Iraq war,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press. He said he asked Romania's president, Nicolae
Ceaucescu, to pass on the idea to Arafat.
   Since it began more than a year ago, 346 Arabs and 14 Jews have
been killed in the uprising, or ``intefadeh.''
   Arafat, in remarks broadcast Monday, said, ``No one can stop the
intefadeh, and any responsible Palestinian calling for stopping it
exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''
   The PLO leader's comments were carried by the French-run Monte
Carlo radio station, which has a large Middle East audience.
   Threats appeared on walls in Bethlehem, including ``Shame on
Freij'' and ``Death to the betrayers.'' They were were written in
red paint and signed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   One slogan signed by the front said Freij would share the same
fate as Zafer Al Masri, a pro-Jordanian assassinated March 2, 1986
after being named mayor of the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Al Masri was appointed with Israel's approval and amid
speculation he would play a role in a peace dialogue. The PFLP
claimed responsibility for his slaying.
   Freij, a Christian who has close ties with Jordan, was quoted by
the English-language Jerusalem Post as saying he was abandoning his
truce idea because of PLO opposition.
   ``It is not up to me to make a decision. It is the PLO, our sole
and legitimate representative, which makes the decision... I will
not pursue my proposal for a truce any further,'' Freij was quoted
as saying.
   Telephone calls to Freij's office went unanswered, and his home
telephone was out of order.
   Jamal Salman, secretary of the City Council, told a reporter he
did not know where the mayor was and knew nothing of his reaction to
Arafat's statement.
   A reporter who went to Freij's home was turned away by a member
of the Freij family. The relative said the mayor was not at home
after first going inside to see if Freij was available.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the daily Al Fajr newspaper, said he did
not believe Arafat had meant to threaten Freij or other moderates.
   ``I feel the intention of Arafat was to say that the intefadeh
was the most effective tool the Palestinians have to try to end the
occupation and create coxeistence between two states, Palestine and
Israel,'' Siniora said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Shiite Militias Battle In South Lebanon, South Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militias fought mortar
battles in south Lebanon on Wednesday, while in Beirut's southern
slums, Syrian troops moved to separate the warring factions.
   Police said 10 fighters were wounded in artillery duels between
the pro-Syrian Amal and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in the southern
Iklim el-Tiffah, near Israel's security zone.
   The casualties raised the toll from five straight days of clashes
to 29 dead and 76 wounded.
   Amal accused Hezbollah of shelling its forces from positions in
the deserted Jbaa, Ein Bouswar, Jarjou, Arab Saleem and Louwaizeh
villages on the northwestern edge of the security zone, a six- to
10-mile-wide strip of land Israel established in 1985 after
withdrawing the bulk of its troops from Lebanon.
   ``We had to respond in order to silence the sources of fire,''
said an Amal spokesman, who refused to be identified. ``We are
determined to end Hezbollah's provocative acts in the south once and
for all.''
   Amal, Arabic for ``hope,'' and Hezbollah, or Party of God, are
struggling for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, described the situation in south Lebanon as ``more
delicate than in south Beirut.''
   ``The two factions are heading toward a showdown, and the Syrians
are not there to control the situation at the last minute,'' he said.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, keeps 25,000 soldiers in
eastern and northern Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from
the Arab League. It has no troops in south Lebanon near the security
zone.
   In the slums of south Beirut, the Syrians have 4,500 troops who
were deployed in May to halt a three-week bloodbath between Amal and
Hezbollah.
   The police spokesman said Syrian troops, armed with automatic
rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, manned buffer zones
to separate fighters in south Beirut.
   He called the Syrian move ``another shot of tranquilizers'' and
said the clashes would start again ``as long as the Syrians do not
crack down on either side.''
   Some south Beirut residents said they were convinced more
fighting would erupt and left.
   ``They (the militias) still have plenty of weapons and
ammunition. They will fight again,'' said Umm Mohammed, a Harat
Hreik district resident who said she had moved in with her daughter
in west Beirut.
   ``I'll only return to south Beirut when either of the two
factions smashes the other or when the Syrians disarm both groups,''
she said.
   A Syrian military source said his command had no plans to do that.
   ``We talk to both sides, convince them of certain measures and
deploy on the ground to implement these measures. There is no
decision to crack down on either side,'' said the source who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The Shiites' mufti, or religious judge, called for disarming both
militias, saying ``their weapons have become tools for killing
children and other innocent people.''
   ``No one should be allowed to possess weapons in south Beirut
except the Syrian forces,'' Sheik Abul Amir Qabalan said in a
statement broadcast on Lebanese radio.

<HEAD>Carlucci to Approve Base Shutdown Plan</HEAD>

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has
approved the recommendation of a special commission to close dozens
of military bases across the country, setting the stage for a final
debate on Capitol Hill, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Carlucci's
decision ``was hardly unexpected'' and would be announced by the
defense secretary at a press conference on Thursday.
   Carlucci has been a strong backer of efforts to close unneeded or
obsolete military bases and strongly advocated the law passed last
year that created the special government commission.
   Under that law, since Carlucci has now endorsed the panel's
recommendations, Congress must either accept or reject the list of
bases proposed for closure in its entirety; it cannot pick and
choose or bargain over the fate of individual bases on the list.
   The commission has recommended actions affecting 145 military
facilities, including 34 bases that would be closed outright.
   The Defense Department declined to discuss Carlucci's decision on
Wednesday beyond saying he had scheduled a press conference ``and
will send to Congress his decision regarding the recommendations ...
on Thursday.''
   Carlucci could have taken until Jan. 15 to make up his mind if he
wished.
   The commission _ known formally as the Base Realignment and
Closure Commission _ has recommended that 34 military installations
and 52 military housing complexes be closed completely; that five
other installations be partially closed, and that 54 others get new
missions or additional personnel.
   All told, the panel has estimated the actions would produce
savings of $693 million a year.
   While that is not an inconsiderable sum, it represents only a
small part of the nation's spending on defense _ the Pentagon's
budget this year totals $299.5 billion. Nonetheless, congressional
leaders also have predicted the closing list will be approved.
   ``My general feeling is that this will be well received by the
Congress,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said after the list was unveiled.
   He said the odds ``are heavily in favor'' of the recommendations
taking effect.
   The largest affected bases are five Air Force bases _ Chanute in
Illinois; George, Mather and Norton in California, and Pease in New
Hampshire, all recommended for closing _ and three Army
installations. The Army bases include Fort Dix, in New Jersey, to
partially close, and Fort Sheridan in Illinois and the Presidio in
downtown San Francisco to close completely.
   The Philadelphia Naval Hospital also would be closed completed.
Other important bases that would be affected are Fort Meade, Md., to
partially close, and the Jefferson Proving Ground, in Indiana, to
close.
   The Pentagon has not shut down a major installation since 1977,
mainly because of pressure from members of Congress with major bases
in their districts.
   The closing process created last year requires the commission's
entire package of proposals to be either accepted or rejected
precisely with the idea of overcoming that political pressure from
congressmen trying to protect local bases.

<TEXT>
   A private research institute that
monitors the world arms trade says Libya probably has joined at
least nine other nations that possess or plan to acquire chemical
weapons.
   The organization, the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, also says, however, that an accurate and certain count of
countries posssessing such weapons is clouded by disinformation and
vested interests.
   At one time or another, 38 countries were reported to have
chemical weapons, but the reports often were unreliable or hard to
assess, the institute said in its 1988 yearbook, which was published
in August.
   Johan Lundin, an institute researcher, said in an interview
Wednesday: ``It's hard to put a figure on it. A few countries have
declared they have chemical weapons, others say they intend to have
them, and there are a lot of allegations against other countries. We
have no information of our own.''
   The institute is a private research institute partially funded by
the Swedish government. It was set up to monitor the world arms
trade and developments in disarmament, mainly through published
reports.
   The organization said in the 1988 yearbook that responsible U.S.
and other government officials speaking on the record listed nine
countries as having chemical weapons or intending to acquire them:
France, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, the United States, the Soviet
Union, Afghanistan, Iran and Vietnam.
   Since the book's publication, the United States has accused Libya
of having a weapons-producing capability. Libya denies it.
   Lundin said the U.S. allegation about Libya's capability was as
reliable as those on which the previous count of nine nations was
based.
   The institute said other countries have been named in less
reliable reports. A purported 1983 U.S. intelligence document leaked
to the British Broadcasting Corp. added the names of Burma, China,
Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, Libya and Taiwan as possessors.
   Last year, Iran and Iraq were reported to have used toxic gases.
Combatants in Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan also made
unsubstantiated allegations that they were victims of chemical
warfare, Lundin said.
   In 1987, Libya was accused of using lethal gas in Chad and
Vietnam was charged with poisoning water supplies in Cambodia and
the institute's yearbook said chemical weapons were used in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The previous year, charges of chemical war were raised against
Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Angola, Chad, Libya
and Nicaragua, SIPRI reported without elaborating.

   A shootout between a policeman and a suspect
killed a 14-year-old bystander, but an autopsy failed to show whose
bullet was responsible, authorities said Wednesday.
   Jeffrey Vilain was shot in the head Tuesday night as he and his
family were leaving a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting in Brooklyn,
police said.
   ``We know he died of a gunshot wound to the head but no bullet
was recovered,'' said spokeswoman Ellen Borakove of the medical
examiner's office. ``The bullet entered his right cheek and exited
the left side of the back of his head.''
   She said authorities would continue to try and learn who fired
the fatal shot.
   The shots were exchanged after plainclothes officers Kameron
Brown, 25, and Sean Jennings, 27, confronted a man with a gun they
saw get out of an unlicensed cab, said Sgt. Edward Burns.
   Darrel Koger, 24, was arrested in a nearby apartment, and
hospitalized for a gunshot wound to the leg, Burns said. Koger was
charged with attempted murder of a police officer and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, a 9mm automatic handgun.

<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to hear oral
arguments in an appeal by a migrant farm worker imprisoned for 20
years in the pesticide poisoning deaths of his seven children, the
man's attorney said Wednesday.
   Attorney Ellis Rubin called the move ``a significant step on a
possible road to freedom for James Richardson,'' a black man
convicted by an all-white jury of one count of first-degree murder
in a daughter's death.
   Attorneys for Richardson have obtained affidavits from two
nursing home aides who say the children's babysitter, later deemed
mentally incompetent, has confessed to poisoning the children's
fatal lunch; and from a former Arcadia police chief charging that an
ex-sheriff framed Richardson.
   Rubin had filed a writ with the Supreme Court asking for
permission to return to the trial court to argue that perjured
testimony was knowingly presented by the prosecution, the state
suppressed evidence and new evidence has been discovered.
   ``I will urge the court to grant us permission to go back to the
trial court in Fort Myers and seek a new trial,'' Rubin said.
   Richardson, whose death penalty was commuted to life by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1972, also is seeking clemency from the governor,
whose office is investigating both the criminal case and allegations
of prosecutorial wrongdoing.
   The prosecution argued at trial that Richardson killed his
children to collect on a life insurance policy signed the night
before the children ate their parathion-laced meal Oct. 25, 1967.
   But Rubin contends the prosecution withheld from evidence an
insurance agent's card showing the policy was only an offer at the
time of the mass killing.

   George Bush will conclude five days of
inaugural festivities on Jan. 22, two days after he takes the oath
as president, by leading 3,200 worshipers at an ecumenical service
of ``prayer and thanksgiving'' at Washington Cathedral.
   The public will be admitted as seating is available for the 11
a.m. EST Sunday service. Seats will be reserved for an estimated
1,850 invited guests, including Bush family members, Cabinet
members, Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, foreign
diplomats and clergy.
   The worship service was the president-elect's idea, inaugural
co-chairman Penne Percy Korth told a news briefing Wednesday. She
said Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle wanted to conclude
inaugural celebrations with ``quiet reflection and prayer.''
   Thousands of churches across the country have been asked to ring
their bells at noon that day and join the cathedral congregation in
prayers ``to humbly acknowledge the true source of our nation's
strength,'' she said.
   Bush and his family will sit on the front row for the cathedral
service led by Episcopal Bishop John T. Walker of Washington,
assisted by Jewish, Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox clergymen.
There will be not one, but three, brief sermons.
   Portions of the service will be led by Bush's oldest son, George
W. Bush; Susan Baker, wife of Secretary of State-designate James A.
Baker III; Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri; the Rev. Peter Gomes of
Harvard University, and Bishop Edmond L. Browning, presiding bishop
of the Episcopal Church of America.
   Roy Pfautch, a former Presbyterian minister from St. Louis who is
general chairman of the service, said Bush is ``a very active and
practicing Episcopalian'' but wants the service to include all
faiths to ``stress ties that bind and not those that divide.''

   The California Highway Patrol booked a
motorist for evading arrest and other charges following a long, slow
chase through four counties that never exceeded the speed limit, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   The CHP pursuit of a 1978 Volkswagen sedan began near Malibu at
about 6:45 p.m. Tuesday and ended more than four hours and almost
200 miles later in San Diego County, Officer Cliff Williams said.
   ``His vehicle ran out of gas, that's why he stopped,'' Williams
said.
   The driver, Brett T. Barish, 29, of La Jolla, was booked on
charges of failure to yield to a peace officer, driving while
intoxicated, driving without a valid license and seven miscellaneous
warrants, Williams said.
   The chase began when Officer Donna Urqidi tried to stop the
Volkswagen for driving very slowly while northbound on Malibu Canyon
Road, about 30 miles west of downtown Los Angeles.
   The car stopped, Williams said, but as Urqidi approached the car,
it pulled away. As Urqidi watched, the car turned eastbound on
Mulholland Drive, going 35 mph.
   Reviewing the report that summarized the ensuing chase, Williams
said, ``I've got six pages of where this vehicle traversed. It went
Mulholland past Cold Canyon, past Stunt Road, past Turtle Creek. ...
Let's see, then it turned onto northbound Topanga at 40 mph.''
   Within 15 minutes, a Los Angeles police helicopter chattered
overhead. And for the next four hours, at least two CHP patrol cars
pursued the car, sirens screaming and lights flashing, as it wended
it's way through Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange and San Diego
counties.
   At 7:18 p.m. the fleeing car was reported eastbound on state
route 134 at 55 mph. At 7:24 p.m. it was southbound on Interstate 5
at 55 mph.
   The CHP never really considered trying to force the car off the
road, Williams said.
   ``Ramming a vehicle could lead to more serious consequences,''
Williams said, explaining the danger to other vehicles on the
freeway. ``The only time we try to force someone off the road is if
they're doing something dangerous that represents a threat to public
safety.''
   The car turned southbound on Interstate 215, then turned onto
State Route 91 and followed that highway into San Diego County.
   The pursuit ended at 10:50 p.m. in the northbound lanes of
Interstate 15.
   ``It's unusual when people attempt to evade, whether it's fast or
slow,'' Williams said. ``But whenever they do evade us, we make
every attempt to make the stop.''

   Researchers say they may have observed an
astronomical oddity: a remnant of a supernova star explosion within
the remains of another supernova.
   If they are right, a star may have exploded less than 800 years
ago inside the expanding shell of material from another star's
explosion about 4,000 years ago.
   ``This is a speculative interpretation of the data,'' cautioned
P.F. Winkler of Middlebury College in Vermont, one of the
researchers reporting the evidence.
   ``I'm not persuaded by it,'' said Robert Fesen of the University
of Colorado in Boulder, who was familiar with the work.
   Fesen said it is highly unlikely that two neighboring stars would
explode at what astronomers consider virtually the same time. Nobody
has reported such a double supernova elsewhere, he said.
   The new work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British
journal Nature. It was written by Winkler, along with scientists at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory in Chile.
   At that observatory in February, they studied a collection of
intertwined filaments near the center of the Puppis A supernova
remnant.
   Analysis showed the filaments were made of different elements,
including oxygen and sulfur that could be ejected by an exploding
star. The appearance of the filaments was consistent with their
being a supernova remnant, and their speed approached that seen in
material ejected from a supernova, Winkler said.
   Although other supernova remnants give off X-rays and radio
waves, none was observed from the filaments. Winkler said that
suggests the filaments could be within the shell of the older
supernova, where the high-pressure, low-density environment would
prevent the emissions.
   Perhaps the double supernova resulted from explosions of two
similar stars that were orbiting each other, he said.
   Fesen said he believes the filaments came from the original
supernova explosion, and that they are a ``curious feature'' that
should be explained in some way.

<UNK>Suspected Killer of Amazonian Ecologist Says He Killed For Revenge</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man said he killed a renowned
ecologist to avenge his father, a cattle rancher involved in land
disputes with the scientist, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   ``I'm proud I shot him,'' Darcy Pereira da Silva, 21, was quoted
as saying in the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil. Pereira da Silva is
in jail in Rio Branco, in the Amazon state of Acre 2,656 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   ``I killed Chico Mendes because he forced my father to live on
the run from the rubber tappers,'' Pereira da Silva was quoted as
saying. ``He went to get an arrest warrant against my father, and
every time I saw him he was calling the police.''
   Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, who was shot and killed Dec. 22,
found out that Pereira da Silva's father, Darli Alves da Silva, was
wanted by police in the southeastern state of Parana in connection
with several murders.
   Mendes told local police about the warrant, and da Silva was
forced to go into hiding, Pereira de Silva said.
   ``I killed him because I missed my father. He was a good man,''
Pereira da Silva was quoted as saying.
   Pereira da Silva, who turned himself in to police four days after
the shooting, was quoted as saying Mendes opposed the family's
efforts to clear Amazon jungle land for cattle grazing.
   Mendes, 44, was the head of a local rubber tappers union in his
hometown of Xapuri, a jungle town 105 miles from Rio Branco. The
union often blocked ranchers' efforts to clear rain forest by
standing in front of bulldozers with family and community members.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said police were ``90 percent''
sure Pereira da Silva took part in the shooting. He said police also
were looking for an employee of the family ranch, Antonio Pereira,
in connection with the killing.
   Tuma called the shooting of Mendes ``a family decision'' by the
da Silva clan. He said police were looking for Darli Alves da Silva
and his brother Alvarino in connection with the crime.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of rain
forest about two-thirds the size of the continental United States,
has often erupted in bloody clashes between landowners and
politicians on one side and peasant farmers, progressive clergymen
and ecologists on the other.

   Opponents in a legal battle between
Dartmouth College and two suspended student journalists drew
opposite messages Wednesday from a judge's ruling that the two must
be reinstated to the college.
   In a decision released late Tuesday, Grafton County Superior
Court Judge Bruce Mohl ordered the Ivy League school to reinstate
Christopher Baldwin and John Sutter, former editors of the
conservative, off-campus magazine Dartmouth Review. The two were
suspended after a classroom confrontation with a black professor.
   Mohl found the school's disciplinary panel and the 18-month
suspensions it imposed in March tainted by the participation of a
professor who four months earlier signed a letter criticizing the
Dartmouth Review as racist and sexist.
   ``I'm happy as a pig in mud,'' said Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale,
Ill., reached at the National Review, a conservative political
magazine in New York where he has been working.
   ``I just want to go back and have a smooth and uneventful senior
year at Dartmouth,'' he said. ``I just want to put this behind me.''
   He and Sutter, 22, of St. Louis, are expected to return to campus
Thursday. Classes resumed at the school Tuesday. Sutter also has
been working as a journalist in New York.
   Their return won't end the matter; lawsuits are pending in state
and federal courts charging Dartmouth with discriminating against
conservatives.
   A spokesman for the college claimed Mohl's ruling was a victory
for the school because the judge found ``no persuasive evidence'' to
support the students' claim that they were brought up before the
Committee on Standards because of their association with the Review.
The disciplinary committee is made up of students, faculty members
and administrators.
   The judge thus unequivocally rejected the students' ``major claim
... that there was a bias against conservative students and students
affiliated with the Dartmouth Review,'' said the spokesman, Alex
Huppe.
   ``Any other reading of that would be a self-serving and
misleading reading,'' he said.
   But Harvey Myerson, one of the students' lawyers, said the judge
did support the students' contention when he said in another
paragraph, ``Contrary to the college's position, the charges against
the four students did arise directly out of their activities on the
Review.''
   Mohl went on to note that the confrontation between music
Professor William Cole and the students stemmed directly from their
efforts to get his response to a Review article criticizing him.
   ``We don't think there's any question about it,'' Myerson said of
whether the judge agreed the students were singled out for their
Review ties. ``That's been a cornerstone of what we've been saying
from the beginning.''
   Baldwin, Sutter and two other Review staffers clashed with Cole
after their magazine called one of Cole's courses ``one of
Dartmouth's most academically deficient'' and denounced him for
``racist rantings.'' One of the other students also was suspended,
but is already back on campus, and the fourth served probation.
   Myerson also insisted the judge drew no meaningful distinction
between the nine-member disciplinary panel, whose chairman was the
dean of the college, and Dartmouth itself.
   ``Obviously, the court didn't draw that distinction,'' Myerson
said. ``The court found that the actions of the Committee on
Standards were the actions of the college and ordered them (the
students) reinstated.''
   He called the dean the ``right-hand man'' to Dartmouth's
president, who, he noted, received the anti-Review letter signed by
the biased disciplinary board member.
   ``We felt from the beginning that the (disciplinary) process was
really a sham process,'' Myerson said. ``It looked clean, it smelled
clean, but it was dirty. The jury was stacked.''
   Huppe disagreed, saying Mohl had affirmed ``the fundamental
fairness of the disciplinary process.''

   An elderly South Texas weather prognosticator
assures George Bush's inaugural planners their worst nightmare _ a
snowstorm _ won't come true to ruin the festivities surrounding
Bush's swearing-in as president on Jan. 20.
   ``This old gentleman from South Texas sent me his almanac, which
said the period from Jan. 19 to Jan. 23 will have sunny, warm and
pleasant weather in Washington, D.C.,'' said Bobby Holt, general
co-chairman of the President-elect's Inaugural Committee.
   Holt, a millionaire oil and gas tycoon and old friend of the vice
president from Midland, Texas, told reporters Wednesday he couldn't
recall the amateur weatherman's name and couldn't vouch for his
accuracy.
   ``I'm scared to call him and ask about his track record,'' Holt
said with a nervous laugh. He admitted the threat of a heavy storm
during the inauguration was ``a constant worry.''
   The National Weather Service said it couldn't predict
Washington's weather that far ahead, except to say that average
temperatures during the five days of inaugural events will range
from 43 degrees to a low of 27.
   One of the worst inaugural snowstorms in modern memory occurred
the night before John F. Kennedy took the presidential oath in 1960.
The storm dumped eight inches of snow on Washington, halting all
traffic and stranding guests trying to reach inaugural events.
   Army troops shoveled Pennsylvania Avenue clear of snowdrifts, and
by noon on Jan. 20 it was clear, sunny and 22 degrees when a hatless
Kennedy took the oath on the East Front steps of the Capitol.
   Because of extreme cold in January 1985, President Reagan moved
his official swearing-in for a second term from the West Front of
the Capitol inside to the Rotunda, and the traditional inaugural
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House was canceled.

   South Korean government party officials
on Wednesday rejected a North Korean proposal for unification talks
involving political and religious leaders.
   The party officials accused North Korea of relying on a
``hackneyed'' propaganda aimed at causing unrest in South Korea.
   Opposition party leaders described the North Korean call as
impractical or another political tactic ``out of impure motives.''
   On Sunday, North Korean President Kim Il Sung called for a
political conference with South Korean political and religious
leaders to discuss reunification of the divided Korean peninsula.
   He invited to the proposed meeting in Pyongyang South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo; leaders of three main opposition parties;
Cardinal Kim Su-hwan, the top Roman Catholic leader in Seoul; and
two dissident leaders, Mun Ik-hwan and Paek Ki-wan.
   Kim Il Sung did not mention Roh's repeated proposals for summit
talks and invited him as head of the governing Democratic Justice
Party.
   South Korean government officials charged Kim Il Sung's proposal
was unfaithful and showed his intention not to recognize the Roh
government, while dissident leaders reserved comment.
   ``We believe the north is trying to dampen our positive
initiative for a summit meeting and other channels of dialogue,''
said a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kim Dae-jung, who heads South Korea's main opposition group, said
the North Korean proposal was impractical. He declined to elaborate.
   Rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam questioned the north's
intention behind the proposal, saying it ``appears to be aimed at
causing division among South Korean political parties.''
   The two Koreas in recent months have traded fresh proposals for
dialogue _ sports talks, political and military talks on arms
reductions and student talks _ in addition to on-going parliamentary
talks.
   Lawmakers from both countries held a series of talks last year,
with the latest meeting held Dec. 29 at the truce village of
Panmunjom.
   Such talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s, but
little progress has been made. Korea was divided north and south in
1945 when Soviet and U.S. troops ended Japan's colonial rule at the
end of World War II.

   The United States is pleased with Cuban
President Fidel Castro's announcement that he intends to release 225
remaining prisoners his government has recognized as political, the
State Department's spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We welcome the announced release of the political prisoners,
particularly the remaining four long-term `plantados,' all of whom
have served more than 19 years in prison,'' said spokesman Charles
E. Redman.
   ``Plantados'' are prisoners who refused on principle to
participate in rehabilitation programs or in some cases to wear jail
uniforms. Some have been jailed since the first years after the 1959
revolution.
   Redman said Castro has promised officials of the U.S. Catholic
Conference that he wil release the prisoners. The conference has
been pressing since 1985 for such action.
   The Washington Post said Wednesday the group of prisoners
includes 44 persons Havana has previously described as too dangerous
to release from jail.
   Of the prisoners on the government's roster of those who have
faced political charges, about 250 were released during 1988.
   The political prisoners the government has acknowledged include
those named in a list of about 450 presented to Cuba in May 1988 by
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, the Post said.
   During the summer, Castro said that everyone on that list would
be freed except the 44 he described as too dangerous.

   With the skirmish over the Mediterranean
serving as a backdrop, the Reagan administration readied an urgent
appeal Wednesday to industrialized nations to deny chemical weapons
technology to Libya and to approve economic penalties for poison gas
users.
   Even before U.S. jets shot down two Libyan fighter planes near
Crete, the Reagan administration had served not-so-subtle notice to
the world that it considers Moammar Gadhafi's drive to produce
poison gas _ an allegation the Libyan leader has consistently denied
_ a serious threat to world stability.
   In the wake of the clash, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
other senior U.S. officials sought to separate the incident from the
drumbeat of alarm the Reagan administration has sounded for more
than two months over the facility near the desert town of Rabta,
about 40 miles south of Tripoli.
   The skirmish is bound to be center-stage at the chemical warfare
conference that opens Saturday in Paris. And yet, William Burns, the
U.S. arms control director, said ``it is not aimed at bashing a
particular country.''
   Referring to the U.S. downing of two Libyan jets, Burns told
reporters at the State Department: ``I don't see it as really
germane to the conference. I think that other nations will not see
it as germane as well.''
   He said the American delegation will focus on trying to
strengthen the authority of United Nations Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use
and to authorize the U.N. General Assembly or Security Council to
impose sanctions on nations that ``challenge world order.''
   Burns conceded, however, this could be difficult since all
actions will be taken by consensus. This means a single participant,
such as Libya, could hold off an overwhelming majority.
   Mindful of the U.S. bombardment of the Libyan capital in April
1986, in which 37 persons including an adopted daughter of Gadhafi
perished, a sense of foreboding enveloped the conference even before
foreign ministers and ambassadors from more than 100 countries began
to assemble in the French capital.
   It is routine for the United States not to rule out any option,
including a military strike. And yet, when President Reagan took
this familiar stance last month the world took notice. The downing
of the two Libyan jets on Wednesday kept attention fastened on the
Libyan facility.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who flies to Paris on
Thursday and will hold talks there through Sunday, will concentrate
his efforts on the industrialized countries. Charles E. Redman, the
State Department spokesman, said the key was to deny Gadhafi the
equipment, material and expertise to produce poison gas.
   ``If these kind of things are going to be cut off it's going to
be very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate,'' he said.
   The 1925 international protocol under review in Paris bans the
use of chemical weapons, but does not outlaw their production. Some
20 nations, by U.S. estimate, either have produced chemical weapons
or are capable of manufacturing them.
   The protocol has no enforcement mechanism. Its effectiveness
depends on the self-discipline of the 130 nations that are parties
to the pact.
   At one time, the civilized world abhorred poison gas. But Iraq,
which signed the 1925 agreement, discovered in the Persian Gulf war
that chemical weapons were effective against numerically superior
Iranian forces. And some Third World countries resent interference
with their chemical industries.
   To try to stem proliferation, Redman said ``we are prepared to
discuss the strongest possible measures'' against countries that
export chemical weapons technology.
   The West European governments have responded with some skepticism
to the U.S. allegations against Libya and its alleged suppliers,
however. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Wednesday his government had no evidence proving West German
pharmaceutical firm had helped build the plant at Rabta. A spokesman
for Genscher said, meanwhile, Bonn had accused Washington for
``additional material'' to back up the allegation.
   But the Reagan administration has not pulled back.
   Robert M. Gates, a former CIA deputy director who was named last
week as deputy director of the National Security Council, said in a
recent speech that the plant was built with the help of ``nearly a
dozen nations, East and West.'' He declined to name them.
   The United States stopped production of chemical weapons in 1969,
then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the Soviet Union and
other potential adversaries had chemical weapons programs.
Currently, U.S. chemical components and artillery shells to contain
them are being produced but stockpiled separately.
   The Soviet Union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical
weapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministry
spokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed.
   Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in Geneva
to plan ways to restrict proliferation.
   So far, the United States and the Soviet Union are the only two
countries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, acknowledging recent human
rights reforms in the Soviet Union, agreed Wednesday to U.S.
participation in a 1991 human rights conference in Moscow.
   The meeting was part of a three-conference schedule in Europe
approved by Reagan.
   ``The president decided to agree to this schedule, including the
Moscow conference, as a means of encouraging continuation of the
significant progress in human rights that has taken place in the
Soviet Union over the past three years,'' deputy press secretary
Roman Popadiuk told a briefing as Regan vacationed in California.
   Britain quickly announced its concurrence in approving the 1991
Moscow conference, paving the way for new East-West negotiations to
reduce conventional forces in Europe.
   Britain and the United States had taken the toughest line on
Moscow's ambition to host a human rights conference, and Wednesday's
announcement opened the way to wrapping up 35-nation talks between
East and West in Vienna, due to end this month.
   The ending of the current Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe talks in Vienna is a prerequisite for starting new
East-West negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops
in Europe.
   Popadiuk said Reagan's decision was prompted by evident progress
in Soviet human rights, including the release of hundreds of
political prisoners and the granting of exit permission for many who
had long been refused the right to emigrate.
   ``Emigration rates from the Soviet Union are substantially higher
and jamming of the Voice of America, Radio Liberty and other Western
broadcasts have ceased,'' Popadiuk said
   The three-conference schedule which Reagan approved calls for a
meeting in Paris in 1989, a second in Copenhagen in 1990 and the
third in Moscow in 1991.
   Popadiuk warned that the United States could reconsider
participation in the Moscow conference if the Soviets should reverse
their recent pattern of progress in the area of human rights.
   ``The president recognizes that there is much yet to be done in
the Soviet Union before that nation meets acceptable and universal
human rights standards,'' Popadiuk said.
   ``We will make it clear to the Soviet Union that the lack of
future and institutionalized progress or a reversal of progress made
to date will cause us to reconsider our decision to attend a Moscow
conference in 1991,'' he said.
   The British Foreign Office placed similar limitations on its
participation, setting down specific requirements to be met by the
Soviets by 1991 if Britain is to participate in the Moscow
conference.
   The British statement said that by 1991 ``we shall expect to
see:''
   _Implementation of Gorbachev's promised changes in the criminal
code;
   _Effective guarantees for freedom of religion, speech and
emigration;
   _An end to the imprisonment of people for their political or
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals;
   _That all long-term ``refusedniks'' are allowed to emigrate.
   The human rights conferences and the European arms negotiations
are linked, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz recommended the
U.S. agreement to Reagan, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.
   ``At present, we believe that Western concurrence in principle in
such a Moscow conference may be the best way to encourage and
support future improvement in Soviet human rights performance,''
Popadiuk said.
   Shultz is to meet Sunday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Paris, where they will be attending a conference of
more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of chemical
weapons.
   The start of conventional arms reduction talks between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has been awaiting
completion of the 35-nation review in Vienna of human rights in the
Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
   Austria, as host of the talks in Vienna, has invited the
participating nations to attend a three-day closing meeting Jan. 17.
   The new Conventional Stability Talks on arms and troop reductions
are due to be held between the 16 NATO countries and the seven
members of the Communist-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   Agreement to the Moscow conference signaled a dramatic shift in
British attitudes since it was first proposed in 1986. At that time,
senior officials of the British government described the proposal as
outlandish and one top policy-maker likened it to ``holding a
whiskey distillers' convention in Riyadh,'' capital of teetotaling
Saudi Arabia.
   But since then Western countries have acknowledged changes or
promises of change by Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down Law Prohibiting Walks In Park Bushes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled unconstitutional an
ordinance designed to stop homosexual activity in Orlando parks by
prohibiting anyone from walking or sleeping in bushes.
   The decision Tuesday by Judge Walter Komanski reverses the
conviction of a retired Air Force colonel who was arrested even
though he said he was in a park only because he was waiting for his
wife. The judge said the regulations are too vague an attempt to
govern activity that is no threat to public safety.
   ``Ordinary innocent conduct is made criminal, and the police are
provided unfettered discretion to arrest law-abiding citizens who
may stray into bushes or foliage at a city park,'' Komanski said in
his ruling.
   Police have been using the ordinance for a couple of years to
crack down on homosexual activity and loitering by transients in
Langford Park near downtown. Police officials contended homosexuals
were using paths that wind through dense groves of trees and bushes
to commit sexual acts.
   Homosexual and civil rights groups have clashed with officers and
city officials over enforcement of the law, contending police were
stopping only single men while ignoring women, children and
heterosexual couples.
   ``I have no problem with them enforcing laws that apply to all
people,'' said Michael Wanzie, a spokesman for the gay rights group
We The People.
   Police Chief Dan Wilson said homosexual activity has declined
since last March and police have made fewer arrests.
   The city's police legal adviser, John Ross, said he would advise
the department to continue enforcing the law because Komanski's
ruling is not binding on other judges. But the defense attorney in
the case predicted that other attorneys would cite Komanski's ruling.
   The law makes it a misdemeanor to ``sleep or otherwise be or
remain in any bushes, shrubs or other foliage'' in a city park.
Violators are subject to a $500 fine and 60 days in jail.
   The ruling was on an appeal by William Marsden, who was arrested
May 19, 1986, at Langford Park. Police said an undercover officer
saw Marsden walking in the park for two hours before disappearing
into the bushes with another man.
   Marsden told County Judge Dorothy Russell that he was walking in
the park while waiting for his wife and walked off a boardwalk at
the time another man happened to be walking in front of him.
   Marsden pleaded no contest, was fined $100 and ordered to stay
out of city parks for 60 days, according to court records. He
appealed and the judge's ruling overturns the conviction.

   A consultant under investigation in the
Defense Department fraud case once left his car in the Pentagon
parking lot so a federal employee he had paid $100 a week could dump
government documents in the trunk, newly released ourt papers showed
Wednesday.
   The papers _ search warrants and affadavits _ were made public as
defense attorneys speculated that indictments in the nationwide
investigation which began in September 1986 could be returned as
early as Friday.
   Sharon Dibbley, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, said
the federal grand jury meets on Thursday and Friday. She would not
say whether Hudson expects indictments then, or when any
plea-bargain arrangements might be disclosed.
   Some companies and their employees are known to be talking to the
government about plea bargaining.
   Prosecutors said last week they no longer need to keep under seal
search warrants and affidavits issued in June because they have
completed the investigative phase of the case. Papers have been
released here and in Brooklyn, N.Y., but remain under seal in St.
Louis, Minneapolis and Los Angeles.
   A search warrant for the home of William Parkin, a consultant who
was employed by the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project Office from
1977 until 1983, provides a wealth of new detail about how Parkin
ran his consulting business, using money and personal relationships
to gather information.
   At the heart of the case are allegations that consultants were
paid by defense contractors _ and used the money to bribe Pentagon
employees _ to obtain inside information on contracts worth millions
of dollars.
   An unusual relationship developed between Parkin and Jean Uebele,
a former contract negotiator at the cruise missile office where
Parkin once worked, the search warrant showed. Information in the
warrant was obtained by intercepting telephone conversations.
   ``Uebele frequently called for her biweekly checks of $50,'' the
paper said. Parkin's secretary at the time, Sheila Wohlfarth, once
told Uebele she was making the checks out to ``Smith's Maid
Service.''
   Occasionally, Parkin asked Uebele to give him copies of documents.
   The warrant added: ``In one conversation in March 1987, Uebele
called Parkin and told him that if he parked his car in her place at
the Pentagon, she would put materials in the trunk, including all of
her instructions, cost and pricing lists, reference books, copies of
every contract and information relating to MCDEC.'' MCDEC is the
Marine Corps Development Education Center.
   Uebele retired from her Navy job last week, her office said. Her
former employers said they did not have a forwarding telephone
number, and her home number was unlisted.
   Parkin's attorney, Gerard Treanor, has said his client is
confident he had done nthing wrong. ``Parkin is going to be found
not guilty before a jury,'' Treanor said.
   The warrant also discussed conservations between Parkin, Mrs.
Wohlfarth and her husband, Robert Wohlfarth, a Navy patent attorney.
   ``In an April 1987 conversation, Wohlfarth complained to his wife
that Parkin promptly paid the other guys he worked with or they
called him. The implication was that Parkin owed Wohlfarth for the
information he had provided.''
   Wohlfarth refused to discuss the matter and referred all calls to
his attorney, Neil Eggleston, who was out of town.
   Parkin had a series of relationships with defense contractors,
including Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.; Hazeltine
Corp., Long Island, N.Y., Northrop and Unisys. Investigators say the
contractors paid Parkin thousands of dollars.
   The court documents said investigators believe Parkin may have
been working for private companies before he retired from the
government in 1983.
   Parkin ``has said that he was helping other consultants make
money while working at JCMPO by providing them with information,''
the papers said. ``Parkin also mentioned working for companies
directly while in government.''
   While the investigation was under way in 1987, Parkin apparently
was finding business more difficult. The search warrant said he
``told different people how it had become more difficult than in the
past to obtain the information because more people were concerned
about going to jail.''

   The U.S. F-14 fighter that shot down Libyan
MiG-23 warplanes over the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday is more
maneuverable and has more sophisticated radar and weapons than the
Soviet-made plane, say retired Navy officers.
   ``We have felt that the F-14 has been and continues to be the
world's best fighter plane,'' said retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, who
served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1970-74.
   The American pilots were almost certainly better trained than
their Libyan adversaries, other experts said.
   ``You are kind of putting professionals up against amateurs,''
said retired Marine Lt. Col. John Buchanan, a pilot who flew the
A-6, another carrier-based aircraft.
   Zumwalt, who lives in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, said
that ``even if the Libyan pilots were as good as ours, the F-14
could outpoint them.''
   U.S. analyses of the MiG-23 show it to be ``a highly
maneuverable, a very high-speed craft. But its avionics and missile
systems cannot compete with the F-14,'' he said.
   Norman Polmar of the Naval Institute Data Base said that the
``the F-14 is a lot more airplane, a lot more expensive to build and
to fly'' than the MiG-23, which epitomizes the Soviet philosophy of
building ``lots of less expensive airplanes.''
   The F-14 has two engines to the MiG's one, giving it greater
acceleration, has twin rear fins, giving it greater maneuverability,
and although both fighters have wings that sweep back in flight,
those on the F-14 operate automatically while the MiG-23's are
directed by the pilot, said Polmar.
   ``The (F-14) pilot does not have to think, he just flies,'' said
Polmar.
   Moreover, the F-14 pilot is assisted by a radar-weapons officer,
while the MiG-23 pilot is alone.
   One of the F-14's strongest points is its sophisticated radar
system, which is capable of looking down and over great distances
while tracking 24 targets at once, according to the Navy. The AWG-9
weapons tracking system can fire up to six Phoenix missiles while
continuing to scan the airspace, according to the Navy.
   Both the F-14 and the MiG-23 entered production more than 15
years ago and fly at similar speeds and heights.
   The F-14 Tomcat, which began aircraft carrier trials in 1972,
remains ``the premier all-weather, day-night air defense fighter in
the world,'' according to the Navy. Production by Grumman of Long
Island, N.Y., is expected to continue into the 1990s.
   A prototype of the MiG-23 was seen in public for the first time
at a Moscow air show in 1967. The fighter, known to NATO pilots as
the Flogger, entered active duty in 1973, according to Jane's ``All
the World`s Aircraft.''
   The Flogger is flown by all the air forces in the Moscow-led
Warsaw Pact and by 1987 had been sold to a dozen other countries,
according to Jane's.
   At takeoff, Floggers have wings that are fully extended to 46
feet and sweep back to about 25 feet as the fighter cruises at Mach
2, twice the speed of sound or about 1,400 mph, at its maximum
altitude of 59,000 feet above sea level, according to Jane's.
   Libya's MiG-23's are armed with one 23mm Gsh-23-L twin barrel gun
and can carry AA-2 Atoll air-to-air missiles, said Polmar.
   Before the incident, Libya's Soviet-built fighters included 44
MiG-21s, 131 MiG-23Es, 67 of the more advanced MiG-25 Foxbats and 92
Sukhoi 20-22 fighters. Additionally, Libya had 22 French-made
Mirages, according to ``The Military Balance,'' published by the
London-based Institute for International Strategic Studies.
   The American F-14 also is a swept-wing aircraft, taking off with
wings spread to 64 feet and flying with the wings swept back to 38
feet as it approaches a top speed of 2.34 times the speed of sound,
or 1,544 mph at its ceiling of 50,000 feet.
   The Tomcat is armed with an M-61 Vulcan 20mm gun and can carry
four Sparrow and four Sidewinder missiles, or a different mixture of
Sparrow, Sidewinder and Phoenix missiles, and it can carry bombs,
the Navy said.
   The F-14s on Wednesday fired Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles,
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said.

   President Reagan, acknowledging recent human
rights reforms in the Soviet Union, agreed Wednesday to U.S.
participation in a 1991 human rights conference in Moscow.
   The meeting was part of a three-conference schedule in Europe
approved by Reagan.
   ``The president decided to agree to this schedule, including the
Moscow conference, as a means of encouraging continuation of the
significant progress in human rights that has taken place in the
Soviet Union over the past three years,'' deputy press secretary
Roman Popadiuk told a briefing as Regan vacationed in California.
   Britain quickly announced its concurrence in approving the 1991
Moscow conference, paving the way for new East-West negotiations to
reduce conventional forces in Europe.
   Britain and the United States had taken the toughest line on
Moscow's ambition to host a human rights conference, and Wednesday's
announcement opened the way to wrapping up 35-nation talks between
East and West in Vienna, due to end this month.
   The ending of the current Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe talks in Vienna is a prerequisite for starting new
East-West negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops
in Europe.
   Popadiuk said Reagan's decision was prompted by evident progress
in Soviet human rights, including the release of hundreds of
political prisoners and the granting of exit permission for many who
had long been refused the right to emigrate.
   ``Emigration rates from the Soviet Union are substantially higher
and jamming of the Voice of America, Radio Liberty and other Western
broadcasts have ceased,'' Popadiuk said
   The three-conference schedule which Reagan approved calls for a
meeting in Paris in 1989, a second in Copenhagen in 1990 and the
third in Moscow in 1991.
   Popadiuk warned that the United States could reconsider
participation in the Moscow conference if the Soviets should reverse
their recent pattern of progress in the area of human rights.
   ``The president recognizes that there is much yet to be done in
the Soviet Union before that nation meets acceptable and universal
human rights standards,'' Popadiuk said.
   ``We will make it clear to the Soviet Union that the lack of
future and institutionalized progress or a reversal of progress made
to date will cause us to reconsider our decision to attend a Moscow
conference in 1991,'' he said.
   The British Foreign Office placed similar limitations on its
participation, setting down specific requirements to be met by the
Soviets by 1991 if Britain is to participate in the Moscow
conference.
   The British statement said that by 1991 ``we shall expect to
see:''
   _Implementation of Gorbachev's promised changes in the criminal
code;
   _Effective guarantees for freedom of religion, speech and
emigration;
   _An end to the imprisonment of people for their political or
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals;
   _That all long-term ``refusedniks'' are allowed to emigrate.
   The human rights conferences and the European arms negotiations
are linked, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz recommended the
U.S. agreement to Reagan, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.
   ``At present, we believe that Western concurrence in principle in
such a Moscow conference may be the best way to encourage and
support future improvement in Soviet human rights performance,''
Popadiuk said.
   Shultz is to meet Sunday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Paris, where they will be attending a conference of
more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of chemical
weapons.
   The start of conventional arms reduction talks between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has been awaiting
completion of the 35-nation review in Vienna of human rights in the
Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
   Austria, as host of the talks in Vienna, has invited the
participating nations to attend a three-day closing meeting Jan. 17.
   The new Conventional Stability Talks on arms and troop reductions
are due to be held between the 16 NATO countries and the seven
members of the Communist-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   Agreement to the Moscow conference signaled a dramatic shift in
British attitudes since it was first proposed in 1986. At that time,
senior officials of the British government described the proposal as
outlandish and one top policy-maker likened it to ``holding a
whiskey distillers' convention in Riyadh,'' capital of teetotaling
Saudi Arabia.
   But since then Western countries have acknowledged changes or
promises of change by Gorbachev.

   Enough body parts, including a severed head,
have been found and reassembled to tentatively identify the victim
as a city man with a checkered past who met a grisly end around
Christmas, police said Wednesday.
   ``Murder's always gruesome. When they decapitate the body and
then dissect it, it becomes that much more gruesome,'' said
Allegheny County Police Superintendent Robert Kroner.
   Body parts have been found in scattered locations east of
Pittsburgh. The victim is thought to be Anthony Patrick Michalowski,
a 22-year-old unemployed Pittsburgh resident known to hang out on
the street.
   The head, severed from his body with a machete or similar weapon,
was found along with a 1{- to 2-foot piece of large intestine in a
plastic garbage bag in a commercial garbage bin behind a shopping
center in North Versailles on Dec. 27. The victim had been dead 24
to 48 hours, said Coroner Joshua Perper.
   The lower jaw had been removed, apparently to hinder
identification. It was found Tuesday outside a steel mill several
miles away in North Braddock. A tongue, small intestines and several
strands of hair were found in the same plastic garbage bag with the
jaw. Authorities believe the body pieces came from the same body and
are testing them for confirmation.
   A dog turned up a lung Dec. 28 in Whitaker, across the
Monongahela River from North Braddock. Lab tests determined that the
lung and head came from the same body.
   The coroner's staff stitched the lower jaw and lip to the head on
Tuesday, allowing police to distribute a sketch of the victim's
face. Michalowski's aunt and brother recognized the sketch on
television, notified police and then identified the blond, blue-eyed
head at the morgue Tuesday night. Dental records, showing two
fillings, also suggest the victim was Michalowski.
   Police said a close comparison of the victim's teeth with
Michalowski's dental records will confirm the identification.
   ``We no longer have to call him `The Head,' '' Kroner said.
``That's a terrible thing to have to refer to a human being as `The
Head.' ''
   Identifying the victim, however, is ``only part of a victory,''
the superintendent said.
   ``We've got an awful lot of work to do. Our jobs are only really
beginning now,'' he said. ``Now detectives have to go out and start
interviewing people, start tracing his steps so we can get back to
the night of his demise if that's possible.''
   Michalowski was last seen alive around 7 p.m. Christmas Eve
standing on Pittsburgh's Liberty Avenue, a downtown strip known for
prostitution and pornography, Kroner said.
   ``He spent a lot of time downtown,'' he said. ``He had a lengthy
record for things street people do such as disorderly conduct.''
   Michalowski's criminal record, released by police, lists about 10
charges since 1984, and he was awaiting trial on robbery charges,
according to Kroner.
   Detectives were checking reports that Michalowski may have been
associated with prostitution or drugs, Kroner said.
   ``We're hearing a lot of stories,'' he said. ``We can't
substantiate the rumors.''
   Michalowski lived at times with his aunt, Carol Michalowski, on
Pittsburgh's North Side. She said her nephew had gone out for a
Christmas tree prior to the holiday and never returned.
   ``A head. That's all I've got. I don't even know if they'll give
me that,'' she told KDKA-TV.
   Detectives say they may need the rest of the body to be sure that
Michalowski was murdered and not just mutilated after dying from
another cause.
   ``The rest of the body certainly would be helpful,'' Kroner said.

<HEAD>U.S. Wheat Sold to China, Corn to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold an additional
440,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices and
also more corn to the Soviet Union, the Agriculture Department
reported Wednesday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 1 million
tons authorized Dec. 30 for China under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Under the EEP arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   The wheat sales, equal to about 17.3 million bushels, were
handled by five companies: Continental Grain Co., 70,000 tons;
Cargill Inc., 270,000; Tradigrain Inc., 30,000; Tradecom Inc.,
30,000; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 40,000.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for January delivery and will carry
an average subsidy rate of $22.64 per ton, or about 62 cents per
bushel.
   Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
China has 570,000 tons still available under the program.
   The Soviet Union bought an additional 250,000 tons of corn for
delivery under a long-term grain agreement with the United States.
That boosted corn sales to the Soviets in the 1988-89 agreement year
to nearly 10.2 million tons.
   Besides the corn, the Soviets have ordered 370,000 tons of wheat,
450,000 tons of soybeans and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus
500,000 tons of grain sorghum for 1988-89 delivery. Only the wheat
has been subsidized.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 440,000 tons of
wheat would be about 16.1 million bushels. The latest corn sales to
the Soviet Union would be about 9.9 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $64 million. The corn, at $2.60 per bushel, could
have a farm value of about $26 million.

   Surgeons transplanted a third liver into a
5-year-old boy whose second operation was made possible by a mother
who volunteered an organ intended for her child.
   Jason Point of Deale, Md., was in critical condition Wednesday,
considered normal for recent transplant patients. On Tuesday, he
received the third transplant in a 17{-hour operation at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Jason received his first transplanted liver in November 1985.
   Last November, after problems developed with that liver, he was
given a liver originally intended for Candi Thomas, 6, of Accokeek,
Md.
   Penny Thomas offered to let Jason have a transplant first when he
took a turn for the worse as Candi, herself the veteran of a prior
transplant, was being readied for surgery.
   Surgeons eventually corrected Candi's liver problem without
another transplant, and she left the hospital Dec. 16.
   Jason needed the third transplant because ``his condition had
gone downhill over the past week or so,'' said hospital spokeswoman
Lynn McMahon. Doctors discovered an abscess in the liver two days
ago.
   Both children were born with a birth defect that prevents proper
liver function.

   The shooting down of two Libyan jet fighters by
American military planes is just another bitter episode in eight
years of bad blood between President Reagan and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi.
   The tone of the U.S.-Libyan long-distance relationship was set in
1981 when the new president expelled Libyan diplomats from the
United States for an ``unacceptable pattern of conduct.'' And it
continued its unyielding way through last week when, less than a
month away from leaving office, Reagan officially declared that
Libya still was not meeting ``minimum standards of human behavior.''
   The United States has shown its disgust with the Libyans'
behavior the past three years by freezing Libyan assets in this
country. A paper Reagan signed on Dec. 28 extends the authority for
the U.S. sanctions for another six months because, Reagan said,
``the government of Libya continues to use and support international
terrorism.''
   Tension between the two nations has been rising in recent weeks,
with the United States charging that Libya has built a plant for
producing chemical weapons. Libya said the factory produces
pharmaceuticals.
   Reagan said military action against the plant was under
consideration.
   At the Pentagon on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
said in response to questions about the shooting incident that the
American planes and their carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, were not
in the area with the intention of attacking any such factory and
``had no connection whatsoever'' with it.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said, ``It may
be ironic, but the two things are not related.''
   Gadhafi called the incident an example of increased American
terrorism and said he would ``meet challenge with challenge.''
   The Libyan leader has been open about his own support for some
terrorism. In 1985, when Palestinians attacked airports in Rome and
Vienna, killing 15 people including an 11-year-old American girl,
Gadhafi called the incidents ``the most sacred action on Earth.''
   Asked about those remarks, Reagan said: ``I don't answer fellows
who think it's all right to shoot 11-year-old girls.''
   Gadhafi has been at Libya's helm since he overthrew King Idris in
1969. One of his first actions then was to close down U.S. and
British military bases.
   He nationalized most oil companies and expelled more than 20,000
foreigners, although thousands of Americans remained in Libya
working in the oil fields.
   With his oil money _ Libya remained the third-largest foreign
supplier of oil to the United States _ Gadhafi bought billions of
dollars worth of Soviet arms. He proclaimed his kinship with Fidel
Castro and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   In December 1979, a mob ransacked and burned the American Embassy
in Tripoli in support of the Iranians who seized the U.S. Embassy
and took hostages in Tehran. Then-President Carter ordered the
embassy in Libya closed, but American oil companies maintained
business.
   In May 1981, Reagan severed diplomatic ties and in August came
the shooting of two Libyan warplanes the U.S. government said were
trying to intercept two U.S. Navy F-14 fighters over the Gulf of
Sidra.
   Three months later, there were reports that Libya had sent ``hit
teams'' to assassinate Reagan, Vice President George Bush and other
top government officials. The tightened security put in place in
Washington as a result still is in place.
   In December 1981 the U.S. halted travel to Libya and asked
Americans to leave that country. Some did, but many did not. The
following March the Reagan administration banned all oil imports
from Libya, and Exxon and Mobil withdrew their operations.
   In June 1983, the U.S. Navy staged maneuvers off Libya's coast
amid allegations that Libyans were supporting dissidents in
Western-backed Chad and Sudan. Navy jets chased away two Libyan
MiG-23 fighters.
   More shooting broke out in March 1986 when American planes
extended their operations below the ``line of death'' drawn by
Gadhafi across the Gulf of Sidra and Libyans fired six
surface-to-air missiles toward U.S. aircraft, missing them.
   U.S. aircraft retaliated by shooting and setting afire a Libyan
patrol boat and hitting a shoreline missile site. The
administration's actions were applauded by congressional leaders,
Democrats as well as Republicans.
   On April 15, American planes bombed five military targets around
the major port cities of Tripoli and Benghazi to punish Libya for
what Reagan called ``Gadhafi's reign of terror.'' He said the raid
was in retaliation for the fatal bombing of a Berlin night club and
described it as ``an engagement in the long battle.''
   There is nothing new about the U.S.-Libyan tensions. Nearly two
centuries ago, President Thomas Jefferson dispatched warships to
blockade Tripoli harbor when the ruler of Tripolitana, Youssef
Karamanli demanded $250,000 a year to prevent his pirates from
raiding U.S. merchant ships in the Mediterranean.
   Then, as now, Americans said freedom of the seas was at stake.

<HEAD>FBI Investigating Armored Car Firm Because of Missing $2 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as $2 million in coins owned by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is missing, and the FBI is
investigating the suburban armored car company where the money was
stored, officials said Wednesday.
   The Fed suspended its dealings with the Public Armored Car Inc.
of Bensenville last week after an audit revealed the shortage, said
Nancy Goodman, a spokeswoman for the agency.
   Maureen Dillon, a receptionist at Public Armored, said company
President John Boyle was the only person who could talk about the
shortage and he was not in the office Wednesday.
   The exact amount of money missing was not released, but Ms.
Goodman said it was a ``substantial loss.''
   ``The only thing we had on deposit there was coins and when we
discovered the shortage, we removed the rest of our funds to our own
vaults,'' Ms. Goodman said.
   The FBI was investigating, Ms. Goodman said.
   FBI spokesman Bob Long declined to say whether the agency was on
the case.
   The Chicago Tribune quoted sources it did not identify Wednesday
as saying the loss was about $2 million, but said the exact amount
would not be known for several days.
   Public Armored was serving as a depot for coins being transferred
between banks and the Fed, Ms. Goodman said. The company began
working with the agency in July.
   The company was one of six storing coins and making coin
deliveries for the Fed to banks and savings institutions in the
Chicago area, Ms. Goodman said. Because insurance covers the loss,
no financial institution will be affected by the shortage, she said,
but they will have to make arrangements with other armored car
companies.
   ``We inspected their (Public Armored's) facility when we started
with them and did a second on-site inspection in late December.
That's when we found the shortage,'' Ms. Goodman said.
   The money shortage was ``very unusual'' because the Fed and the
firms hired to deliver cash are in daily telephone contact to
confirm how much money is delivered and to whom, she said.
   ``We balanced with them (Public Armored) by telephone every day
and those numbers balanced,'' she said. ``When we went to do a
physical inspection we found less money than what should have been
there.''
   When a bank wants to make a deposit in coins to its account at
the Fed, the coins are picked up by an armored company and taken to
a warehouse and the agency is notified the transaction has been
made, she explained. When a bank needs coins, the Fed is notified
and a delivery is made from the warehouse.
   Several banks use Public Armored to hold large amounts of coins,
she said. The company also has contracts to pick up coins for the
Illinois State Toll Highway Authority.

<HEAD>Panel Looks For Ways to Speed Approval of Cancer, AIDS Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of researchers began looking
Wednesday for ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer
and AIDS, and the Food and Drug Administration declared that ``drugs
for the desperately ill remain our highest priority.''
   Critics have accused the FDA of being too conservative in its
evaluation of new drugs for cancer and AIDS. At the panel's initial
meeting, officials of the National Cancer Institute said the
regulatory agency could make therapies available earlier without
sacrificing patient safety.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said recent changes in the
agency's approval process will make new drugs available in half the
time it used to take.
   Already, FDA review takes an average of seven months for cancer
drugs, he said, and the only AIDS drug approved so far underwent
review in 107 days.
   Young assured members of the panel of academic and drug industry
researchers that ``drugs for the desperately ill remain our highest
priority.''
   However, Bruce Chabner, director of cancer treatment at the
National Cancer Institute, said the FDA should be more flexible and
encourage early testing of new drugs in children who have cancer and
AIDS.
   Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute, said
the FDA is too stringent in the proof it requires that a new drug
extend survival longer than existing drugs. The result, Broder said,
is that effective therapies are being rationed.
   Dr. Louis Lasagna, chairman of the study panel, said his
committee hopes to establish ``mechanisms to mediate'' the fireworks
and improve communications between the FDA and the cancer institute.
   ``Because there is so much public pressure regarding AIDS, about
not wasting time getting treatments to victims ... we might be able
to capitalize on that concern to bring about improvements in the
drug approval process,'' Lasagna said.
   Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of the President's Cancer Panel who
appointed the study group last year, said he believes the FDA's
process for approving drugs can be reduced from several years to
less than a year.
   He said the FDA's recent improvements are not enough. But in
defense of the agency, he said: ``FDA wants to be sure of the
safety, and this is their first concern, and it should be. They
certainly don't want to give them (patients) drugs that are going to
kill them.
   ``On the other hand, we have to have indications that we can
prolong life of people with AIDS,'' he said, using that incurable
and fatal disease as an example.
   So far, the FDA has approved only one drug, AZT, that has been
shown to prolong the lives of victims of AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is in charge of AIDS research at the
National Institutes of Health, reported ``extraordinary'' progress
in the search for a drug that will significantly prolong the lives
of AIDS victims.
   ``But to someone who is suffering from a lethal disease who does
not have a non-toxic drug that's available, those types of
scientific advances ... really don't mean much,'' he said.
   ``There's a lot of despair out there and it's understandable
because of the terrible scourge of this disease, but we in science
are cautiously optimistic,'' he said.
   Fauci said it is unlikely that a ``penicillin equivalent'' will
be found as a cure-all for AIDS.

   An earthquake of the type that killed tens of
thousands last month in Soviet Armenia would cause many fewer deaths
in a typical American city because of differences in construction
standards, a U.S. engineer said Wednesday.
   Loring Wyllie, a San Francisco structural engineer and co-leader
of an American team of experts that surveyed the Soviet earthquake
site, said most of the buildings that collapsed were poorly
constructed, built from a common design and of concrete that
collapsed ``like a stack of cards.''
   ``We would have a lot less loss of life due to the diversity of
our construction,'' Wyllie said at a news conference.
   He said the Soviet buildings were constructed from blueprints
developed in Moscow for use throughout the Soviet Union. Most of the
destroyed buildings had been were built in recent years using
prefabricated concrete parts ``not at all of the quality you would
find here in the United States,'' he said.
   ``If that kind of construction happened on a job here in the
United Stastes, the inspector would have rejected it and the
contractor would have to redo it,'' said Wyllie.
   He said concrete used in the Soviet construction was ``frequently
filled with rock pockets'' that weakened the material, and that
concrete beams were often joined together in a haphazard fashion.
   As a result, when the earthquake struck, buildings up to 10
stories high collapsed very quickly, he said.
   Fred Krimgold, an expert from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and a member of an American search and resuce team that arrived in
Armenia four days after the earthquake, said the building design was
a prime factor in the high number of deaths.
   ``The floor system of these buildings is made up of (concrete)
planks,'' he said. ``When these floors collapsed, we got very tight,
compact rubble'' with few voids where people might have survived.
   ``As a result, this was one of the most deadly earthquakes we've
seen,'' said Krimgold. ``Typically, the ratio of injury to fatality
is on the order of three or four to one. In this earthquake, it was
the reverse.''
   Krimgold said that though the official death toll of the
earthquake has been placed at about 24,000, he believes the exact
number will never be well-documented. Some Soviet officials, he
said, estimated that there were more than 100,000 unregistered
people living in the area and that thousands of bodies buried in the
rubble will never be recovered.
   The rubble of many buildings that were thought to contain people,
said Krimgold, now are simply being bulldozed level with no effort
to recover bodies.
   ``There have been 24,000 bodies recovered,'' he said. ``But don't
mistake the number of bodies found with the actual number of dead.
... Fifty to sixty thousand, probably 60, is a reasonable estimate.''
   Krimgold, who has participated in rescue efforts following
earthquakes in Mexico and Central America, said more people survived
in those disasters because the buildings collapsed in large pieces.
These large pieces left hollows or pockets within the rubble where
trapped people could survive until they were rescued.
   Delays in reaching trapped Soviet victims also cost many lives,
he said.
   ``We uncovered a number of people who unfortunately had died only
recently before we got to them. They were not dead at the time of
the collapse,'' said Krimgold. ``Many people died of exposure
trapped in the buildings. The nighttime temperature was below
freezing.''
   The Armenian earthquake struck around 11:40 a.m. on Dec. 7. The
main shock measured 6.8 on the Richter scale, which is considered a
strong quake. It was followed a few minutes later by an after-shock
that measured 5.8.
   About 80 percent of buildings in Leninakan, a town of 250,000,
were leveled, and a number of smaller towns nearby were destroyed.
   John Filson, a U.S. Geological Survey expert and a co-leader of
the American team, said after-shocks continue in the area with one
measuring 5.0 occurring as recently as Saturday.
   Filson and Wyllie headed an 18-member team of specialists
organized by the USGS, the National Academy of Sciences and the
National Science Foundation at the request of Soviet authorities.
The group spent two weeks in the Armenian earthquake area gathering
scientific and engineering information in collaboration with Soviet
experts.
   Filson said the information will be analyzed and shared
internationally in an effort to better understand earthquakes and
how to construct safer buildings in areas of seismic activity.

<HEAD>Customs Service Labels Sport Vehicles, Small Vans As Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Customs Service said Wednesday it will
classify imported sport utility vehicles like the Suzuki Samurai and
most small vans as trucks, subjecting them to duty rates 10 times
higher than those for cars.
   Deputy Customs Commissioner Michael Lane said that in the past,
these vehicles sometimes had been classified as cars, upon which a
2.5 percent duty is imposed, and at other times as trucks, subject
to a 25 percent duty.
   The deciding factor often was whether the vehicles were fitted
with back seats and other amenities.
   Lane said auto industry officials have estimated the ruling could
affect 100,000 to 250,000 or more vehicles, many of which will be
switched from the car to truck category and could net the government
hundreds of millions of dollars in higher tariffs.
   Wednesday's ruling specifically applied to Suzuki's Samurai and
YOE, but Customs officers have been instructed to use the same
standard in classifying other imported vehicles, the agency said.
   Chrysler Corp. spokesman Al Slechter said the automaker was
``ecstatic'' about the ruling. He said it would end manipulation of
the tariff system and increase Treasury revenues.
   Suzuki spokeswoman Laura Segall said most Samurais already were
being imported as trucks but that the company was ``disappointed''
the Customs Service had ruled against allowing some sport vehicles
to be admitted as cars.
   Vehicles imported as trucks are not covered by the voluntary
restraint agreement under which Japanese automakers limit the number
of cars brought into the United States.

   Congress' budget agency said Wednesday that
unless new taxes or spending cuts are approved, the federal deficit
next year will be $141 billion, $14 billion higher than the White
House estimates and well in excess of deficit-reduction goals.
   Releasing its forecast only days before President Reagan sends
his final budget to Congress, the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office said it expects the deficits to decline only slightly in
future years unless action is taken.
   By fiscal 1993, when Gramm-Rudman mandates a balanced budget, the
federal deficit would still be $129 billion, based on current
trends, the report said.
   The deficit during the current fiscal year will be about $155
billion, the same as last year, according to the CBO report. And it
will drop only slightly next year, to $141 billion, if current
government services are maintained with no new taxes.
   That means $41 billion in spending cuts or new revenues would be
needed under the CBO projections to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit
to the $100 billion target in the budget balancing law.
   However, the administration, using more optimistic economic
assumptions, is projecting a 1990 deficit of $127 billion, making it
easier to hit the $100 billion deficit target required for Reagan's
final budget.
   If president-elect George Bush and the Congress don't approve
enough spending cuts or new taxes to get within $10 billion of the
Gramm-Rudman goal, the law imposes automatic spending cuts across a
broad swath of domestic and defense programs to take effect next
October.
   Bush has said repeatedly he would cut the deficit without any new
taxes. Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress have been
skeptical of his approach, which he terms a ``flexible freeze'' on
spending.
   President Reagan's $1.2 trillion budget, which goes to Congress
next Monday, will propose spending cuts, asset sales and hikes in
some user fees to reduce the deficit to $92.5 billion, Reagan's
budget director, Joseph Wright, has said.
   The Congressional Budget Office provides Congress with many of
its budget estimates as it considers spending legislation through
the year. However, the Gramm-Rudman law is triggered by the figures
provided by the president's Office of Management and Budget.
   The CBO deficit projections, compared to those made by the agency
last August, are $7 billion higher for the current fiscal year and
$5 billion higher for fiscal 1990. The key reason: the cost of
shoring up the ailing savings and loan industry.
   The CBO deficit report was based on projections that the economy
would continue a slow but steady growth of 2.2 percent in 1990 and
1991 and 2.3 percent in each of the next two years, with
unemployment holding steady, inflation increasing slightly next year
and interest rates gradually declining.
   House Budget Committee chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the
CBO report was troubling because it may indicate the White House
outlook was too sanguine. It that happens, deficit cutting efforts
may be found inadequate as the new fiscal year approaches _
triggering Gramm-Rudman's automatic spending cuts.
   ``If the projections are overly optimistic now, that means
reassessments could mean that we would face (automatic spending
cuts) to make up the difference,'' he said.
   ``The more we use the rosy scenario approach, the more we lose
touch with reality,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department announced new
security requirements for airports Wednesday that will require
tighter control over restricted areas, likely through the use of
computerized identification cards for employees.
   The department said the new Federal Aviation Administration
regulations will be phased in over the next 2{ years with the
busiest airports required to comply by early 1991.
   Although airport operators will be allowed to meet the new
security requirements through various ways, many are expected to use
a computer-controlled identification card system to control access
to restricted areas.
   The tighter regulations were proposed last March.
   The FAA estimates that 270 airports ultimately will have to
install the computerized ID system or another method or procedure to
provide a required level of security.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the new requirements will
provide ``tighter control over employee ID cards, both in terms of
who carries them and where an employee can and cannot go at an
airport.''
   He said the cards can be electronically coded to permit access
only to those areas an employee is authorized to enter. A card also
can be made ineffective if it is lost or the employee assigned the
card quits without returning it.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
asked Moscow to send part of its Mediterranean fleet to act as a
buffer in a possible U.S.-Libyan confrontation, the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug reported Wednesday.
   Tanjug reported later that Tripoli residents jammed filling
stations in a flight from the Libyan capital hours after hearing
that U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the
Mediterranean on Wednesday.
   It said Gadhafi's home was turned into a ``fortress,'' with
anti-aircraft missiles mounted on its roof.
   The initial Tanjug report from Tripoli, which gave no source for
its information, apparently was filed after the U.S. Defense
Department announced the air incident. Tanjug said the news ``was
neither confirmed nor denied in Libya.''
   Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, has its own
correspondent in Tripoli and his reports have often proved reliable
in the past.
   ``The Libyan leader (Gadhafi), reacting to the news about
American movements in the Mediterranean, asked Moscow to send part
of its Mediterranean fleet to the area of the forthcoming American
maneuvers to avoid direct Libyan-American clashes, which could serve
as an excuse for new American and possibly Israeli attacks on vital
targets in Libya,'' Tanjug said.
   It did not specify which part of the Mediterranean Gadhafi had in
mind, or say how many Soviet ships he wanted to see involved.
   In its later report, Tanjug said that ``only a few hours after''
the United States shot down the Libyan planes, ``migration of
citizens from Tripoli was noticeable.''
   Gas stations in Tripoli ``were jammed with cars, the same way as
before the American attack'' on the North African nation in 1986,
the agency said.
   Moments after the news of the incident, ``an avalanche of
protests against `American aggression' struck Libya,'' with
political activists calling for ``armed struggle'' against the
United States, Tanjug said.
   Tanjug reported that Libya took heavy military precautions
following word that U.S. fleet movements were under way in the
Mediterranean.
   Gadhafi's residence in Tripoli has been turned into a
``fortress'' with new tank and anti-aircraft reinforcements and with
French-built anti-aircraft missiles mounted on its roof, Tanjug
reported.
   The agency said mobilization of Libya's reserve troops reportedly
has been ordered and military aircraft based at airfields on the
Mediterranean coast have been moved inland to points in the Sahara
desert.
   In Tripoli, guns were mounted at key street intersections, and
Gadhafi's personal guard took over traffic duties from police,
Tanjug said.
   The correspondent also said, without identifying sources, that he
learned that Col. Junis Jabber, the commander of Libya's armed
forces, may have lost his job in a continuing reorganization of the
radical Arab nation's military strength.

   Libya asked Wednesday that the Security
Council hold an emergency meeting and condemn what it called U.S.
aggression in shooting down two jet fighters it said were on an
``innocent'' reconnaissance mission.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a statement
saying he ``regrets the incident and hopes both sides will exercise
restraint so as not to heighten existing tension in the region.''
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser met with Security Council
President Ismail Razali of Malaysia and delivered a letter
requesting the urgent session. The 15-member council scheduled
informal consultations on the Libyan request for Thursday morning.
   ``Without a doubt, we ask for condemnation of this premeditated
act of aggression,'' said Muntasser, the acting permanent
representative. The planes, he said, were ``unarmed, on
reconnaissance, ordinary, routine flying.''
   ``It was an innocent flight,'' he said.
   He declined to say if Libya would retaliate, saying it wanted the
Security Council ``to take its responsibility.''
   In Washington, officials said U.S. Navy planes shot down the
Libyan jet fighters over the Mediterranean Sea after the American
aircraft were threatened while conducting routine operations in
international airspace.
   The incident was the first fighting between the United States and
Libya since American jets bombed Tripoli in 1986 and came after the
United States charged that Libya had recently built a new chemical
weapons plant.
   Although the Reagan administration has refused to rule out an
attack on the plant, U.S. officials said the downing of the Libyan
planes was unrelated to the dispute over the facility.
   At the United Nations, Muntasser said: ``I presented a letter
from the Libyan government asking the Security Council to meet
urgently to discuss this aggression of U.S. forces against two
Libyan reconaissance planes on routine duty. They were attacked and
shot down.''
   ``We expect the whole international community to deplore this. We
expect even the American people will. Yesterday it was threats,
today it was acts.''
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar had been
informed by both sides that official letters about the incident were
being sent from Washington and Tripoli. Perez de Cuellar also met
with U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, but details of their
discussion were not disclosed.

   A federal appeals court panel Wednesday
rejected a bid by Oliver L. North's attorneys to avoid showing
prosecutors a summary of classified testimony the defense expects to
present at the Iran-Contra trial.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals dissolved a temporary stay it issued
Tuesday and denied a motion to permanently bar U.S. District Judge
Gerhard Gesell from giving the office of independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh a summary of proposed defense testimony that is
classified.
   The request could have forced a delay in the trial, now set for
Jan. 31.
   North's lawyers have said providing the 162-page summary to
prosecutors would unfairly present them with information on North's
defense and they petitioned the appeals court for a writ of mandamus.
   But in a two-page order, a three-judge appeals court panel said
such a step ``is to be invoked only in extraordinary situations,''
adding that although North had raised ``serious claims that he will
suffer deprivation of constitutional rights, he fails'' to satisfy
the stringent legal standard for obtaining such relief.
   ``This court will not interrupt a criminal proceeding and invade
the province of the district court when petitioner has an effective
remedy through direct appeal from a final judgment of conviction,''
said the appeals court.
   The decision came as Walsh met with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to discuss the continuing problems posed by classified
documents in the case against the former National Security Council
aide.
   Walsh, who said only that he had ``a very serious discussion''
with Thornburgh, was accompanied by aides who deal with the secrecy
issue as well as John Keker, recently named the lead trial
prosecutor in the North case.
   It was learned that Walsh sought the meeting with Thornburgh to
discuss the implications of Gesell's refusal Tuesday to reconsider a
Dec. 12 decision ordering the inclusion of certain sensitive
references in 300 documents prosecutors want to use as trial
exhibits.
   Walsh had asked Gesell to modify the order to accommodate
concerns raised last month by intelligence agencies.
   Meanwhile, in a four-page memo filed Tuesday in federal court and
publicly released Wednesday, North's attorneys reiterated their
objections to being subjected to being limited to an ``arbitrary
limit of 300 purportedly classified documents'' in a defense of
North at his trial.
   The figure had been set Dec. 12 by Gesell.
   North's lawyers filed a narrowed-down list of 300 classified
documents on Tuesday.
   ``There is no justification for such a restriction in this global
case challenging aspects of three years of United States foreign
policy,'' Brendan Sullivan and other North lawyers said in the memo.
   Walsh's office will be limited to using some 300 classified
documents in prosecuting North.
   North has deemed some 3,500 documents to be relevant to his
defense and the memo by his attorneys said the court's limitation is
``omitting thousands of other obviously relevant documents.''
   North's attorneys said the defense should not be compelled to
select its 300 documents when it is unclear what counts will be
tried.
   The conspiracy and several other counts in the case are in
jeopardy because the judge has directed more complete disclosure of
information in classified documents than U.S. intelligence agencies
appear willing to grant.
   U.S. intelligence agencies are concerned that sensitive
references in the documents Walsh plans to use could disclose covert
operations or secret dealings with foreign nations. Gesell said last
month the administration had deleted too much material from
classified documents the prosecution plans to use. The judge
detailed what must be disclosed in order to give North a fair trial
and Gesell on Tuesday rejected a request from Walsh to reconsider
that order.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the attorney
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security.
   In their memo, North's lawyers also said the court should have
held a hearing to determine the relevance of the 3,500 documents and
that the restriction of 300 documents compels North to identify for
prosecutors the documents the defense plans to use without even
knowing the substance of the testimony by the prosecution's
witnesses.
   North also says he is entitled to know what information in the
3,500 documents he wants to use is classified and what is not
classified.

   A woman reporting being molested in two
attacks while walking home early on New Year's Day, police said
Wednesday.
   ``As described by the victim, they were two separate
happenings,'' Sgt. Robert Wolfgang said.
   The 41-year-old woman said she was first attacked while walking
home from a tavern Sunday morning by a man who pulled her into a
darkened doorway and sodomized her, Wolfgang said.
   After the first attacker fled, the woman resumed walking and then
accepted an offer of a ride home from a motorist. She said she was
driven to a vacant lot and raped, Wolfgang said.
   After the second attack, a motorist who saw her walking and
crying took her to police. She was treated at Albany Medical Center
and released.
   The woman described two men to police. Wolfgang said the woman
had seen the first attacker in the bar she was in earlier, but did
not know either man. He said police have no suspects.

<HEAD>For Thousands Lost At Sea, Death Is Never Definitive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official death toll stands at two, but six
other crewmen from a container ship that sank last week have joined
thousands of people lost at sea who never get a final resting place.
   ``The search stays indefinitely in a suspended mode,'' U.S. Coast
Guard Petty Officer Ellen Marie Harrington said Wednesday. ``And
that's difficult because part of the grieving process is tied up in
having some sort of memorial or burial service.''
   After the 254-foot ship sank in 25-foot seas on its journey from
Port Elizabeth, N.J., to Bermuda, five crewmen were plucked from the
water, two of whom died. Six crew members were still missing
Wednesday and presumed dead, the Coast Guard said.
   ``You race out there with hopes of making a rescue and then for
one reason or another it doesn't happen. As time goes on there's a
definite psychological letdown because you start to edge toward the
reality of the conditions and the challenge,'' said Lt. Jonathan
Trumble. ``That's when you finally have to leave and go home
empty-handed or with corpses.''
   ``When we do have a successful search, there's a feeling that,
well, we kind of stole one from the ocean this time,'' he said.
   Trumble was heading the Coast Guard's command post in Boston when
distress signals came in from the Lloyd Bermuda, which was about 200
miles off the coast of New Jersey. Violent seas and a sudden shift
of cargo sent crewmen racing to unlash the ship's life rafts.
   Trumble said air and naval rescue teams mobilized with optimism.
   ``When they go out, there's a 100 percent chance of finding them.
We had high hopes that all 11 men were in life rafts, but as the
case wore on those odds decreased considerably,'' he said. ``Then
there's a real stomach-wrenching feeling. There's a real gut feeling
when you finally have to say `Look, we've done everything we
possibly could do ... and I call them home.' ''
   The Rev. Barbara Crafton, a minister at the Seamen's Church in
Port Newark, N.J., said it is with the search's suspension that
families begin a troubled mourning process.
   ``The grieving process is denied these families,'' she said.
``From the pastoral point of view there is a closure when you have
in fact seen the body of the one you loved, as painful as it is.
   ``In dealing with widows of seafarers, those whose husbands are
lost and never seen again get stuck in uncertainty,'' she added.
``They know intellectually he's dead, but emotionally there is a
lack of acceptance.''
   About 25 people attended a memorial service Friday at the
Seamen's Church, a regular gathering place for the Lloyd Bermuda's
crew members and other seafarers passing through the port city.
   ``(A memorial) isn't much, but it is something concrete that
certifies in an emotional way that this man's life is over and that
this is a life that had meaning,'' she said.
   During the past decade, an average 79 seafarers on American
vessels have been listed annually as lost and presumed dead at sea,
said Coast Guard Cmdr. Tom Purtell of the Marine Safety Evaluation
branch in Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a
Palestinian's request that he be freed until a decision is made on
whether he should be sent to the United States to stand trial for
blowing up a plane.
   Mohammed Rashid is accused of bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over
Hawaii in 1982, killing a 15-year-old Japanese boy dead and injuring
15 people.
   The court said he may flee the country if he is freed before a
final decision on the U.S. request for his extradition.
   No date has been set for Rashid's next extradition hearing, which
has been delayed for months on the grounds that the United States
has failed to provide enough evidence and documents to implicate
Rashid in the bombing.
   Rashid, 39, was arrested at Athens Airport by Greek police
following a tip by U.S. Embassy officials last year. He was
sentenced to jail for seven months for possessing a false passport.
   The extradition request is viewed as a test of Greece's
willingness to crack down on terrorism.
   A group of U.S. congressmen have introduced legislation calling
on the Greek government to extradite Rashid, who officials say may
have information regarding the Pan Am bombing over Scotland two
weeks ago.
   The congressional resolution, which will be voted on by the U.S.
House in coming weeks, also condemned Greece's socialist government
for freeing a Palestinian charged with the 1982 bombing of a Rome
synagogue.
   Italy had demanded the extradition of Abdel Osama Zomar, who was
held in a Greek jail for six years before he was permitted to leave
aboard a plane for Libya.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said two U.S. Navy F-14
Tomcat jet fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23 jets after the
Americans were approached in ``a hostile manner'' in international
airspace.
   Carlucci said the American jets acted in self-defense, opening
fire with air-to-air missiles only after the Soviet-built Libyan
jets activated their weapon-targeting radar.
   Carlucci denied that the jets were airborne to participate in a
military strike on a disputed chemical weapons production plant
inside Libya.
   The U.S. planes returned to their carrier, the USS John F.
Kennedy. The fate of the Libyan pilots was unclear, although
Carlucci said ``two parachutes were sighted'' and a rescue
helicopter was seen in the area.

Chidli Klibi, demanded that the United States end acts of
``provocation near the Libyan coasts.''

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, savoring his 40-state
1988 victory anew, announced to a joint session of Congress on
Wednesday the official results of his own presidential election
triumph.
   ``This announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of
the persons elected president and vice president of the United
States,'' Bush intoned as he presided over a House-Senate session
called to certify results of the Electoral College ballots cast last
month.
   It had been 152 years since a vice president had been able to
peform such a task. Grinning broadly, Bush rapped the gavel and
declared ``the joint session dissolved.''
   It was his final expected official act as the constitutional
presiding officer of the Senate. And it marked the first time a vice
president had been able to preside over his own presidential
election certification since Martin Van Buren did so in 1837.
   In a closely orchestrated session in the House chamber, the vice
president proclaimed that ``George Bush of the state of Texas'' had
received 426 electoral votes to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis'
111 votes. Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen got
one vote, filed in protest of the Electoral College system by one
elector.
   The session was called under a provision of the Constitution
which gives Congress the job of passing final judgment on the
authenticity of each state's electoral tally.
   After announcing the outcome, Bush shook hands with House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, and was given a standing ovation by members of
the House and Senate. Then he phoned Vice President-elect Dan Quayle
of Indiana to notify him.
   Quayle did not attend the vote-counting ceremony, his spokesman
said, because he had no official role and thought it more important
to work on hiring his staff and on plans for the inauguration on
Jan. 20.
   ``He didn't want to go. It would have just been a photo op,''
said press secretary Dave Beckwith.
   On another subject, Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said the vice
president had been notified at 6 a.m. of the U.S. Navy's attack on
two Libyan fighter planes over the Mediterranean and ``he's been
kept informed'' throughout the day.
   Bush also was reported to be nearing an announcement of his
choice for energy secretary. However, Bush transition sources said
James Schlesinger, who held that job during the Carter
administration, ias no longer viewed as a serious contender for the
post.
   The vice president and Schlesinger met last week to talk about
energy releated issues but ``the job was not offered,'' said a
senior Bush transition official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Sources close to Bush said he still hasn't made up his mind on
the post but former Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore, a longtime friend
of the vice president's, was a leading candidate.
   Rep. Robert Dorman, R-Calif., had a private lunch with Bush in
the Senate dining room before Wednesday's electoral vote couuting.
   Dornan, an early congressional supporter of Bush's, said they
discussed both the energy post and the other unfilled Cabinet-level
post, that of so-called drug czar, over turkey sandwiches.
   Dornan said Bush did not divulge his choice in either instance.
The congressman said he told Bush his own favorite for the drug post
was former education secretary Bill Bennett, who also has the
support of some top-level Bush advisers.
   Sources close to Bush also said Texas industrialist Ross Perot is
also on a short list of possible contenders for the drug job.
   The vice president has only two top-level posts to fill: the
energy job and the ``drug czar.''
   With the election outcome known well in advance, Bush carried out
his constitutional role according to a script that made up in ritual
and tradition what it lacked in suspense.
   Papers certifying each state's electoral ballots, sealed in
manila envelopes in two large brass-bound wooden boxes, were carried
in by pages.
   Under Bush's direction, four members of Congress designated as
counters _ Sens. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and
Reps. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., and Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. _ read the
results alphabetically, state by state.
   Each ballot was pronounced ``regular in form and authentic.''
   The lone presidential vote for Bentsen came from West Virginia,
carried by Dukakis. Elector Margarette Leach flipped her ballot,
voting for Bensten for president and casting her vice presidential
ballot for Dukakis.
   That, Ford observed when he read the West Virginia tally, was
``exercising the prerogative of the Electoral College.''
   Bush injected a note of humor at one point in the roll call, when
Annunzio said only that Arkansas had cast six votes for president.
   ``The chair wonders who won that one.''
   As the chamber erupted in laughter and applause, Annunzio
responded, ``It's obvious that they all know the answer to that
one.''
   While on Capitol Hill, Bush met privately with Sens. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D., in separate sessions. They
discussed ``issues of mutual concerns,'' said Bush spokeswoman Alixe
Glen.

   Jewish groups expressed outrage Wednesday at
the reported involvement of a West German company in Libya's
suspected chemical weapons production, saying the country that
gassed millions of Jews bears responsibility for preventing the
production of such arms.
   The groups said they were also investigating whether companies in
other countries had provided help for Libya's chemical weapons
plant, and would protest to those countries once their findings are
complete.
   The United States has said a West German company, along with
firms in Japan and Italy, supplied technology and expertise for the
Libyan plant located 35 miles southwest of Tripoli. Swiss, Japanese
and South Korean firms were also reportedly involved in building
what Libya contends is a pharmaceutical factory.
   U.S. officials told West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last
December that a company called Imhausen-Chemie was one of those
helping Libya. But Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Wednesday his country's investigation had not found any involvement
by the company in the plant.
   The director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a non-profit
organization which hunts surviving Nazi criminals around the world,
said Kohl's office told him Imhausen-Chemie had not applied for an
export license to Libya.
   Rabbi Marvin Heir said the deputy director of Kohl's office,
Stepan Eisel, told him in a telephone conversation Tuesday that if
investigators determine the company had exported material to Libya
without permission, it would be prosecuted.
   Heir said he had sent Kohl a telegram to express his ``shock.''
   ``The idea of German firms helping Moammar Gadhafi, the foe of
Israel and a dangerous enemy of the world, is repugnant to Jews,
especially because of the Holocaust,'' Rabbi Heir said. ``It is an
unforgivable act that should be harshly punished,'' he added in an
interview.
   ``It's part of Germany's responsibility to atone for the past by
preventing chemical warfare from ever happening again,'' Heir said.
   Israel Singer, Secretary-General of the World Jewish Congress,
said his group was ``making representations to several governments
to express our deep concern and profound anxiety at this volatile
and dangerous situation.''
   The WJC declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>More Bodies Recovered In Guatemalan Tragedy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PUERTO BARRIOS, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two funeral parlors ran out of
coffins on Wednesday and four more bodies were pulled from the
waters by this grieving port town, raising to 83 the number of
people killed when a ferry sank on New Year's Day.
   The skipper of the craft has been jailed and President Vinicio
Cerezo's administration has ordered an investigation into the worst
maritime tragedy in Guatemala's history.
   The Justo Rufino Barrios II evidently developed engine trouble
halfway on a 16-mile run from Livingston to Puerto Barros, 187 miles
northeast of Guatemala City.
   A navy patrol boat came to its assistance and offered a tow, but
survivors said the cable was too short and the patrol boat sank the
ferry when it suddenly accelerated.
   Survivors, including the captain, accused the crewmen of the
naval craft of being drunk and swamping the craft. Navy officials
insisted the ferry was overcrowded.
   ``They are trying to put the blame on me so as to remain
blameless themselves,'' Juan Pablo Esquivel, the 22-year-old ferry
captain, said in a jailhouse interview.
   Esquivel could face up to 10 years in prison for negligence in
the disaster.
   Over 160 people, including about 40 children, were on the ferry
when it went down, according to officials here. Officials said its
official capacity was 90 passengers.
   Four bodies were recovered from Amatique Bay on Wednesday,
raising the death toll to 83.
   None of the survivors interviewed alleged malice on the part of
navy crew. But Esquivel, who has been arrested on charges of
criminal negligence, said he doubted the navy would accept any
responsibility.
   Esquivel, interviewed Tuesday night, said the patrol boat's crew
was celebrating the new year on deck when it arrived to help the
ferry.
   ``They were in a state of drunkenness,'' Esquivel claimed. He
said a navy machinist who came on board the ferry to check the
engine smelled strongly of alcohol.
   Isaac Acevedo, another survivor, was quoted by the local
newspaper as saying, ``They (the navy crewmen) were drunk and gave
us a very brusque pull.''
   Capt. Anibal Giron, deputy commander of the Puerto Barrios naval
base and a graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, denied
Wednesday that anyone was drunk on the navy boat.
   Esquivel said he asked the patrol boat skipper to take on half
his ferry passengers before beginning the tow, but that the skipper
denied the request. Giron said the approaching dusk and the
difference in deck levels made a transfer impossible.
   Grieving townspeople continued showing up at La Milagrosa and
Estrada, the town's two funeral homes. Stands that normally hold
varnished wooden caskets were bare and carpenters were building
rough-hewn pine coffins to meet the demand.
   Rodolfo Lucano, administrator of the ferry service, said 150
passengers was a safe load for the 60-foot ferry.
   Esquivel said he was aware there were 100 adults, but said more
could have come on board without his knowledge.
   ``Even if it were overloaded that is not going to make it
capsize. What made it capsize was a a bad tow,'' Lucano said.

<HEAD>Armenia, Azerbaijan Appeal for Refugees to Return Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in Armenia and Azerbaijan on Wednesday
appealed to refugees who fled ethnic violence to return home and
promised severe punishment for those who instigated attacks that
left at least 31 people dead.
   ``Throw aside all hesitations and doubts. Your neighbors,
friends, comrades in work and study are waiting for you,'' said a
statement distributed by the Tass news agency.
   ``All those who encroached on the brotherhood of the people, who
expelled families, persecuted people on account of their
nationality, will be punished in accordance with all the strictness
of the law,'' it said.
   Tass said the statement from the Communist parties and
governments of the neighboring southern republics was published
Wednesday in the official press.
   According to official reports, about 180,000 people fled across
the border to their ethnic homeland to escape the violence erupting
in mid-November. In the past month, official reports have said that
some of the refugees had returned home, but no numbers have been
given.
   The appeal said the migration had attained ``enormous
proportions.''
   Both small republics have responsibility for feeding and housing
refugees. That is especially difficult for Armenia, which also is
struggling with the effects of the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated
its northern cities.
   The dispute between the republics began in February when
Armenians began agitating for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region of Azerbaijan, which is dominated by ethnic Armenians.
   Violence has broken out several times since then, and more than
60 people are known to have been killed. Azerbaijan and central
authorities in Moscow have rejected Armenia's demand for annexation.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Wednesday that 75 criminal
cases began in Armenia before Nov. 22 and that 70 began after that
date. It said the later cases included murders, assaults, robberies,
and intentional destruction of personal property.
   Izvestia also said some local officials were fired for failing to
keep the peace.
   It said two police officers in the Gugar region of Armenia, where
eight Azerbaijanis were killed in the most recent violence, had been
fired and a criminal investigation was under way against one of them.

<UNK>Police Reopen Case On Escape Of Master Spy George Blake</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Wednesday they reopened investigations
into the 1966 prison escape to Moscow of George Blake, a Briton who
became a key Soviet spy, after two British anti-nuclear campaigners
said they helped free Blake.
   Michael Randle, a former researcher in ``peace studies'' at
Bradford University in northern England, and London antiques dealer
Pat Pottle attracted new attention with plans to publish a book
about how they helped free Blake.
   ``We do feel that we were right to do what we did, and all our
reasoning will be in our book which is published in June,'' Randle,
54, told reporters Wednesday.
   In London, a spokeswoman at Scotland Yard police headquarters
said the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions asked police
to reopen investigations.
   ``This we have done, but we can give no further details,'' she
said, speaking on condition she was not identified.
   Blake, now 65 and the only surviving major British traitor known
to be in the Soviet Union, was sentenced in 1962 to 42 years
imprisonment in a highly publicized case. The 42 years were for the
42 British agents prosecutors said the Dutch-born Blake betrayed to
their deaths.
   Blake escaped from London's Wormwood Scrubs prison after serving
less than five years. In a Soviet television interview last April,
he said he hid in an apartment near the prison for a few days, hid
in another for two months and then was smuggled from Britain to the
Soviet Union by way of East Berlin.
   Blake, who married in the Soviet Union, painted an idyllic
picture of life in Moscow.
   The names of Randle and Pottle have been linked previously to the
Blake escape in newspaper stories. But their book, titled ``The
Blake Escape: How We Freed George Blake and Why'' appears to promise
the first full account.
   Camilla Nicholls, spokeswoman for the book's British publishers,
Harrap Ltd., said lawyers have told the company that publication is
not illegal. It is illegal to profit from criminal acts.
   ``We are advised the writing of the book is not a criminal act,''
said Ms. Nicholls.
   Randle said he and Pottle expected to be questioned by police.
``We are prepared to go to jail if necessary,'' he said. ``We feel
that our decision was a right one and we have always been prepared
to take the consequences.''

<TEXT>
   The chief Kremlin negotiator on
Afghanistan said Wednesday he is not certain that Soviet troops will
withdraw on schedule if Moslem guerrillas keep fighting the
communist Afghan regime.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, Soviet soldiers began leaving
Afghanistan on May 15, 1988, half were out by Aug. 15 and the
remaining 50,000 are to be gone by Feb. 15. The guerrillas, not
parties to the agreement, have continued the war.
   Yuli Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador to
Afghanistan, told reporters when he arrived in Islamabad on
Wednesday:
   ``If the cease-fire holds and there is no fighting in
Afghanistan, then that's a very good situation for Soviet forces to
leave.'' When asked what would happen to the withdrawal plans if the
insurgency continued, he said, ``We shall see, all of us. I don't
know.''
   Guerrillas have rejected the Soviet-backed government's offer of
a coalition and are ignoring a unilateral cease-fire it proclaimed,
which began Jan. 1.
   Vorontsov is expected to meet insurgent leaders Thursday in
Moscow's search for a political solution to the civil war that began
after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers entered
Afghanistan in December 1979 and totaled an estimated 115,000 when
the withdrawal agreement was signed April 14 in Geneva.
   The Soviet envoy held meetings in Saudi Arabia a month ago with
guerrilla leaders based in Pakistan, and conferred in Tehran earlier
this week with others based in Iran.
   About 5.5 million Afghans, one-third of the population, have fled
since the war began, nearly all to Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan's
neighbors on the east and west. Guerrillas use border towns and
refugee camps as bases and supply points.
   Pakistan and the United States provide most of the insurgents'
arms and financial support.
   Guerrilla sources in Islamabad said representatives of fighters
operating from Iran were expected to arrive Thursday to join the
talks with Vorontsov.
   Vorontsov said he was prepared to meet with the guerrillas, ``but
they were not ready yet before I came here.''
   A guerrilla source said privately the resistance leaders from
Iran and Pakistan probably would confer with each other before
meeting Vorontsov and whether they would see him jointly or
separately had not been decided.
   Vorontsov is trying to work out arrangements that will allow all
Soviet forces to leave by the deadline without being attacked along
the way. The Kremlin has acknowledged the loss of at least 13,300
soldiers in the war.
   He met with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan soon after
arrival but would not reveal the substance. He told The Associated
Press as he left the meeting, ``The talks were very interesting and
very useful,'' and when asked to elaborate said, ``We talked about
oviet-Pakistan relations and Afghanistan.''
   Humayun Khan of the Foreign Ministry told the AP: ``Both sides
are trying to work toward a political solution.''
   Western diplomats said Tuesday that Soviet troops were
withdrawing from Shindand and Herat in western Afghanistan. They
also said Soviet civilian advisers were leaving Kabul en masse and
quoted Afghan officials as saying the main Red Army departure from
the capital would begin Jan. 15.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who took over Jan. 1 as chairman of the
seven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan, told reporters
Tuesday he expected to meet Vorontsov on Friday, but guerrilla
sources say some alliance members want no more discussions with the
Soviets.
   Meeting with guerrilas is a tacit acknowledgment Moscow is
exploring a non-communist alternative, but Vorontsov refused on
Wednesday to write off the Kremlin's allies in Kabul as participants
in a future government.
   The ruling Marxists ``will survive by all means ... but they are
willing to participate in the creation of a broad-based
government,'' he said. The government in Kabul is led by President
Najib.
   Factions in the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance are divided on
many issues, but agree Najib's regime cannot have a role in postwar
Afghanistan.
   They contend his government will collapse without Soviet military
help, but Vorontsov called that ``a big mistake ... wishful
thinking.''
   Mojaddidi announced Tuesday 400-member council would convene
within three weeks with the task of forming a transitional
government.

<HEAD>News Program Promotes Story of 17 Survivors, Doesn't Show It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet television news program on Wednesday
promised viewers a report on 17 Armenian earthquake survivors
surviving nearly a month under the rubble of a grain elevator, but
failed to show the story.
   Editors of ``Vremya'' could not explain why the report,
apparently the same one denied a day earlier by Soviet officials,
was not shown on the program.
   ``Seventeen people survived almost a month under the ruins of an
elevator. We expect a report about this,'' announcer Anna Shatilova
said at the beginning of the nightly news program, which is watched
by tens of millions of viewers.
   In a report about the visit of Leningrad Communist Party leader
Yuri Solovyev to the earthquake-devastated city of Leninakan,
``Vremya'' showed a brief picture of rescue worker Sasha Ivanov from
Leningrad.
   ``Today, Leningrad resident Sasha Ivanov, who saved the lives of
17 people, as hundreds of his comrades from all corners of the
Soviet Union, was raising a new Leninakan,'' the report said.
   It showed the young, mustachioed Ivanov for only a couple of
seconds in a report of several minutes and said nothing about when
or how he saved the people.
   Hundreds of people were pulled alive from the wreckage of
Leninakan and other cities following the Dec. 7 quake. But the
official Tass news agency on Tuesday quoted Norik Muradyan, head of
the relief effort in the devastated city of Spitak, as saying the
last survivor had been rescued there 10 days ago.
   The Tass report was a denial of a story Monday by a French radio
station that 17 people had been rescued from a collapsed grain
elevator in Spitak. It said they had survived for more than three
weeks by eating grain and drinking melted snow.
   ``Vremya'' editors could not explain the confusion. ``You saw
everything on the screen that we received from Yerevan,'' said the
duty editor in charge of the program.
   The editor, who spoke in a telephone conversation with The
Associated Press on condition he not be identified, said Ms.
Shatilova's announcement at the beginning of the program could have
referred to the report about Ivanov, or that film crews in Yerevan
perhaps had not had enough time to put together a report.
   Editors at Tass in Moscow and at the official Armenpress news
agency in Armenia said they had no information to verify that 17
people were rescued from a collapsed elevator.
   Telephones at government offices and the Red Cross in Yerevan did
not answer Wednesday night.

   Congressional leaders said Wednesday the United
States acted appropriately in shooting down two Libyan fighters as
they accepted the Reagan administration's denial that U.S. forces
planned to attack a purported Libyan chemical weapons factory.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told a Pentagon news conference
the commander of the F-14 patrol made the decision to fire at the
Libyan aircraft ``in self-defense'' and apparently shot down both
planes.
   Carlucci also denied the two American F-14s and their host
aircraft carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, were in the area with the
intention of attacking the what the United States says is a chemical
weapons factory.
   Members of the House and Senate were nearly unanimous in their
support for the U.S. action, and legislators emerging from afternoon
briefings by the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed their satisfaction
with the administration's explanation.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said the American jets were acting defensively because the Libyan
planes ``had maneuvered themselves into a position of attack _ and
they did it on two occasions.''
   ``That violates the rules of engagement that we have common
understanding on in the international environment,'' Nunn said.
``You cannot, in this day and time and modern technology, wait until
another plane has fired in order to defend yourself. It's too late
then.''
   Nunn, who was contacted by Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and later attended one of the briefings, said
he was reassured there was no connection between the incident and
the chemical weapons plant.
   ``I've talked to Admiral Crowe about that and I've gotten an
emphatic no _ no connection in terms of what the American ship was
doing,'' Nunn said. ``The action took place 45-50 miles away from
shore. It wasn't even in the approximate region of that chemical
plant.
   ``So from the American point of view _ everything I know
indicates that there was no connection between what the ship or
planes were doing and our concern about the chemical plant in
Libya,'' he said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
said that based on information from the briefing, ``everything that
we've done was appropriate.''
   Aspin said he believes the administration's contention that U.S.
forces were conducting routine operations in the Mediterranean Sea
and suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi provoked the
incident.
   ``Gadhafi was looking for a little bit of a dust-up with the
United States,'' Aspin said.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said the ``information
presently available indicates our pilots acted defensively, and well
within the rules of engagement.''
   ``Congress should be informed, however, if the United States is
engaged in a piecemeal escalation of our conflict with Libya beyond
these legitimate acts of self-defense,'' Coelho said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said the U.S. pilots were ``provoked _ and they responded
decisively and correctly.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the American pilots ``had
reason to believe they were under attack and they were acting in
self-defense.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the downing of the
two Libyan jets _ the first battle between the United States and
Libya since American jets bombed Tripoli in April 1986 _ appears to
be ``self-defense _ pure and simple.''
   ``Gadhafi never learns,'' Dole said. ``Maybe this time he will
finally get it straight: Whenever he threatens American forces, we
will defend ourselves.''
   Libya's construction of a chemical weapons factory exacerbated
the already volatile relationship between the United States and
Libya. U.S. officials said Tuesday they had evidence the plant had
started producing limited quantities of chemical weapons and has
conducted trial runs of its production equipment.
   Libya has claimed the plant will make pharmaceuticals and offered
to let international experts inspect the facility. The United States
claimed the offer was inadequate.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said early reports indicate that the U.S. action ``was
warranted in that when an aircraft locks onto another aircraft with
its radar it then has the capability of launching a missile, a
radar-guided missile.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said the American jets took the
proper action and indicated that some U.S. action against the
chemical plant may be necessary.
   ``Under no circumstances would we countenance them letting the
genie out of the bottle in terms of chemical warfare and if
necessary, we would destroy that facility,'' D'Amato told reporters
in Albany, N.Y.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said the U.S. jets were justified in defending themselves.
   ``The technology involved in modern combat doesn't allow much
time to verify an attack _ one missile fired from beyond visual
range is all that is necessary to destroy a plane or ship,'' Wirth
said.
   ``In areas of high tension as in the Gulf or near Libya every
action must be regarded as potentially harmful,'' he said.
   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., chairman of the Armed Services
subcommittee on readiness, sustainability and support said the
United States ``did exactly what we should have done. ... Those of
us who have looked into it approve of what occurred.''

   European officials reacted cautiously to the U.S. downing of two
Libyan jet fighters Wednesday, Arab countries sharply criticized the
incident and Israel applauded the move.
   Government spokesmen in West Germany, Britain, France, Italy,
Spain, the Netherlands and Greece declined immediately to support or
condemn the incident in which two U.S. jets shot down the fighters
in a dogfight off the Libyan coast.
   Soviet media rapidly reported the incident, but the government
had no immediate comment. The official news agency Tass, reporting
Libya's call for an emergency Arab League meeting on the matter,
termed the shooting ``U.S. aggression against Libya.''
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat called the incident ``very serious.''
   ``It will affect negatively the Middle East peace process,'' the
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization told Cable News
Network in an interview from Cairo, Egypt.
   Chedli Klibi, the Arab League's secretary general, demanded the
United States end acts of ``provocation near the Libyan coasts.''
   Speaking from Tunisia, which borders Libya, he said the attack
constitutes an ``extremely serious aggression'' dictated by a
``false perception by the United States of its role in regulating
international problems.'' He said any escalation would have
``negative consequences'' on U.S.-Arab relations.
   A White House spokesman said two of Libya's Soviet-built MiG-23s
were shot down by U.S. F-14s about 40 miles off the Libyan coast
after the American aircraft were ``threatened while conducting
routine operations.'' The U.S. jets returned safely to the aircraft
carrier John F. Kennedy, the Navy reported.
   Tensions between Libya and the United States had escalated over
reports that the government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi built a chemical
weapons plant.
   In Syria, state-run television called the incident ``a flagrant
U.S. aggression.''
   Iran's Foreign Ministry called the U.S. action a violation of
Libya's sovereignty and said the attack would have ``dangerous
consequences.''
   Syria and Libya were Iran's only allies in the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq denounced the downing of the Libyan jets and accused the
U.S. of acting irresponsibly.
   In Jerusalem, Finance Minister Shimon Peres said, ``We
congratulate the American Navy for shooting down two planes that
were threatening it.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said:
``Based on previous Libyan behavior, we have no reason to doubt the
official American explanation of this incident.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has
evidence that Libya is capable of producing chemical weapons and
vowed to take action.
   ``We have unequivocal reports about plants built to produce
chemical weapons, not only in Libya, but in other countries
including those very close to us,'' Netanyahu said in an address to
Israel's parliament.
   ``There is a series of measures Israel is going to undertake,''
Netanyahu said. This will include proposals of economic and
political sanctions against Libya, Israel radio reported.
   Michael Mates of Britain's governing Conservative Party and
chairman of the parliamentary committee on defense said the Libyans
got what they deserved.
   ``If the Libyans have made an offensive gesture toward the United
States, I'm not surprised they've been shot down, because they're
not a friendly nation, they have committed many aggressive acts
against the United States,'' he told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hanns Schumacher,
declined to comment on the downing of the jets, and said Bonn was
not officially informed of the action.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said his country ``hopes
that tension in the Mediterranean does not increase'' as a result of
Wednesday's incident.
   ``It is still too early to know the exact circumstances of the
incident,'' Dumas said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand has called an international
conference for Jan. 7-11 to discuss expanding a 1925 treaty banning
the use of chemical weapons. Dumas said he hoped the incident would
not dominate the forum.
   The Italian government expressed ``deep concern'' about the
shooting. Premier Ciriaco De Mita's office said the incident would
be discussed at a previously scheduled Cabinet meeting Thursday.
   In Spain, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juan Lena said, ``The
Spanish government considers with serious concern any kind of
measure that leads to an increase in tension in the Mediterranean.''
   The Dutch govt ``regrets'' the incident and voices its ``great
concern,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   A Greek government spokesman said his country believes that both
sides ``at this moment should cool it and avoid actions that would
endanger peace in this sensitive region.''
   In Athens, about 3,000 leftist demonstrators chanting anti-U.S.
slogans marched to the U.S. Embassy Wednesday night to protest the
incident.
   In Zurich, the dollar closed sharply higher in interbank trading
and one dealer who did not want to be identified said the rise was
in reaction to the U.S.-Libyan confrontation. The dollar always
gains strength in times of international tension, he said.

<HEAD>60 Years to Clean Up Plants, DOE Says</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ,
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Department of Energy estimated Wednesday it
may take $91 billion to $200 billion over 60 years to clean up
radioactive and chemical contamination at 45 government civilian and
military nuclear plants around the country.
   In a report to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the energy department
said the work to be done includes cleaning up soil, surface and
ground water, including removal, treatment and disposal of bulk
wastes.
   Glenn, at a news conference, urged the Reagan and Bush
administrations to commit significant resources to the job.
   Chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, Glenn said
the situation at 17 nuclear facilities is so serious it represents
``nothing less than an environmental time bomb.''
   ``It's up to the White House to ask for enough money to defuse
that bomb before it explodes,'' Glenn said. ``The acid test of our
government's commitment to cleaning up these facilities does not lie
in this report, but in the amount of money that is actually budgeted
and spent for cleanup.
   ``Campaign rhetoric, promises and good intentions will not do the
job,'' he said. ``We've waited too long already to start this job.
We simply cannot afford to wait any longer.''
   Glenn said his committee will open hearings early in the year to
examine the energy department report and two others soon to be
issued.
   They include a follow-up report on the cost of clean up at each
specific nuclear site and the so-called ``2010 study'' which is to
examine goals for nuclear weapons production and facilities in the
year 2010.
   Glenn said the latter reports should be issued over the next few
weeks.
   Glenn said he is concerned that insufficient funds for the
cleanup job will be included in the budget being prepared by the
Office of Management and Budget and added: ``The main thing is, will
they have guts enough to put this in the new budget?''
   He said that he understands that OMB is considering proposing
spending of about $1.4 billion for the fiscal year beginning next
Oct. 1 but asserted that it will take at least $1.8 billion ``to
just keep up.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned, $1.4 billion is completely
inadequate,'' he said.
   Glenn said that while spending in the magnitude of some $6
billion a year is clearly called for, he believes a good start can
be made with a cleanup program costing $3.5 billion to $4 billion a
year.
   ``It's not going to get any cheaper,'' Glenn said. ``We know it
has to be done. Let's get on with it.''

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told a cheering
crowd Wednesday the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied
territories made his peace efforts possible.
   He said was able to propose ``peace from a position of strength''
because of the 13-month-old rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and hinted at withdrawing the offer if Israel does not agree
to talk with the PLO. Arafat went to the rally from an hour-long
meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization chief addressed the U.N.
General Assembly in Geneva last month, recognized Israel and
renounced terrorism. The Palestine National Council, which acts as
the PLO legislature, declared an independent Palestinian state in
November.
   Arafat, wearing his customary military fatigues, checkered
headgear and holstered pistol, spoke to a rally Wednesday of about
1,000 people organized by the Federation of Labor Unions to honor
the Palestinian revolt that began Dec. 8, 1987. Most were workers,
officials and political party officialss.
   ``People now are paying attention to (peace) offers we had made
previously because of the intefadeh and its economic danger to
Israel,'' he said, using the Arabic word for uprising by which the
rebellion has become known.
   After Arafat made his declarations in Geneva, the United States
opened contacts with the PLO, which it had refused to do previously.
Arafat did not mention the United States on Wednesday, but
criticized Israel's continued refusal to deal with him.
   ``I don't expect Israel to accept peace easily or to give in
easily,'' he said. ``It is a state established by war. The maximum
acceptable to it is a state of no-peace-no-war. But I tell them the
state of no-peace-no-war has come to an end.''
   He pledged to continue pursuing peace, but repeated an earlier
warning that, if the Israelis continue their refusal to talk, ``I
will return to the Palestine National Council and tell them it's no
use, these people do not want peace.''
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and refuses to
negotiate with it.
   Egyptian politicians and labor leaders from Jordan, Iraq and
Sudan spoke before Arafat, surrounded by 10 bodyguards, addressed
the rally.
   His remarks were received with cheers, applause and occasional
chants accompanied by a lute and drums.
   A group of young men and women sang: ``We are all Arafat; long
live Arafat, president of Palestine. Egypt's workers greet the
martyrs of the intefadeh.''
   In Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said Arafat would arrive
Jan. 27 to meet with the foreign ministers of Spain, France and
Greece.
   Spain assumed the rotating presidency of the European Economic
Community on Monday. The Common Market designated it and the other
two nations Dec. 19 to consult all parties involved about arranging
an international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Arafat has visited several European countries since the U.N.
session in Geneva seeking support for the Palestinian independence
declaration and his peace initiative.

   Here is the official English-language text
of a Libyan Mission statement issued Wednesday on the U.S. downing
of two Libyan jets:
   Communique issued by the People's Committee of the People's
Bureau for Foreign Liason.
   This morning, the United States of America launched a new and
premeditated attack against the great Jamahiriya. American airplanes
intercepted and downed two Libyan reconnaissance airplanes which
were on a routine mission over international waters.
   This premeditated American aggression was preceded by reinforcing
the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea with the movement of huge
naval military concenration comprising 13 naval vessels, the nuclear
airplane carrier Roosevelt, as well as a landing force consisting of
12,000 personnel. It was also declared that those naval forces were
sent to conduct maneuvers opposite Libyan shores.
   This naval military concentration was coupled with American
threats to attack Libya and destroy specific targets therein under
pretexts and justifications that have been rejected and condemned by
world public opinion.
   This massive American military concentration in the Mediterranean
Sea is only a smoke screen. It cannot cloud the fact that should be
clear to the world, i.e. launching a wide-scale attack against the
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya that targets its military
and economic installations.
   The pretext of conducting routine maneuvers reinforces rather
than weakens the American administration's decision to launch this
attack. This is underlined by the declarations and statements made
by officials in the American administration which do not conceal
their inclination to attack the Jamahiriya under any circumstances
and any pretexts.
   In protesting against repeated attacks made against it by the
American administration, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya calls upon the international community, its international
and regional organizations and bodies to shoulder heir
responsibilities and hasten to:
   _Stop the maneuvers conducted by American opposite Libyan shores
and call for the withdrawal of the American naval military
concentration which exists for aggressive purposes and not for
conducting normal maneuvers as America claims.
   _Shoulder the responsibility of the inernational community in
halting this aggression against pacifist and peaceful people.
   This aggression threatens peace in the Mediterranean region as
well as world peace and security.
   In facing an unjust aggression made against it by a world
superpower, the Libyan Arab people reserves its legitimate right to
defend itself and its existence.

<HEAD>Leaflets Calling For Ethnic Albanian Uprising Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaflets calling for an armed
uprising by ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's troubled southern
province of Kosovo have been discovered in a town in the region, the
state Tanjug news agency reported Wednesday.
   ``Pamphlets with hostile contents calling on the Albanian
national minority to start an armed insurrection to fulfill
separatist goals'' were found during the New Year weekend in the
town of Istok, about 150 miles south of Belgrade, the Yugoslav
capital.
   The leaflets also urged the Slav population of the province to
emigrate from Kosovo as soon as possible, Tanjug said.
   The region, Yugoslavia's poorest, has been the scene of strife
between the ethnic Albanian majority and the Slav minority since
some Albanians rioted there in 1981, demanding greater autonomy for
the province.
   Serbs and Montenegrins, the Slavs who make up about 15 percent of
Kosovo's population, say ethnic Albanians have been harassing and
persecuting them to force them to leave the province. They have
demanded tougher government action to prevent an alleged disruption
of law and order.
   Kosovo is an autonomous province of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia. Proposed amendments to the constitution, now under
consideration, would lessen autonomy and bring Kosovo under greater
central control by Serbia.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday upheld the government's
right to prosecute Panama's military ruler General Manuel Antonio
Noriega on charges he turned his Central American nation into a way
station for cocaine traffickers.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler rejected arguments by
Noriega's defense attorneys that as Panama's de facto head of state
Noriega was immune from prosecution.
   ``We have this material, this poison, being sent to us,'' the
judge said in a ruling from the bench after the two-hour hearing.
``To countenance sovereign immunity under these particular
circumstances would be a serious error.''
   Hoeveler noted the U.S. State Department's affidavit that Noriega
is not accepted as legal ruler of Panama. ``Our government has said
he is not, and in fact has characterized him as kind of an outlaw
head of state,'' he said.
   The judge refused to rule on two other issues raised by Noriega's
defense attorney Neal Sonnett.
   The defense had argued Noriega was being selectively prosecuted
to force him into concessions on control of the Panama Canal, which
under treaty is to be turned over to the Panamanian government at
the end of the century.
   Sonnett also said in his motion for dismissal that pretrial
publicity would make it impossible to find an objective jury.
   The judge said those issues would have to wait until the case was
ready to go to trial, which both sides interpreted to mean when
Noriega was extradited to the United States.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, conceded Noriega would be
difficult to extradite, but said his regime could fall anytime.
``He's on tenuous ground,'' Lehtinen said. ``He's just a second-rate
military commander, an upstart who seized power in Panama.''
   About 30 Panamanian exiles in the courtroom audience crowded
around prosecutors and later, outside the courthouse, cheered the
announcement of Hoeveler's ruling.
   The indictment accuses Noriega and 15 others of working with
Colombia's Medellin cartel to smuggle cocaine into the United
States, alleging that the general provided protection and services
to the traffickers.
   Following the February indictment, the United States declared an
economic blockade of Panama and worked openly with Noriega's
domestic opposition to depose him, but the effort failed. At one
point, over the objections of Miami prosecutors, the United States
offered to drop the indictment if Noriega would resign.
   The 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Miami
accused Noriega of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the drug
cartel. A grand jury in Tampa indicted Noriega on three marijuana
importation counts the next day.
   Chief Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie initially
sought to have the defense motion sealed for fear it might contain
``blackmail'' against the Reagan administration but agreed to
release the documents publicly when he found there was none. Noriega
has claimed to have information in his files on President-elect
George Bush.
   Sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by
conservatives in the Reagan administration to renegotiate the Panama
Canal Treaty signed during the Carter administration. The treaty
hands control of the waterway over to Panama at the end of the
century.
   ``There were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty,'' he said.
``We argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to a
decision to attempt to get Noriega out of power.''
   The motion contains quotes from the news media made by Reagan
administration officials, such as Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams, that the defense says demonstrate the political
nature of the case. Abrams is quoted as saying in May that ``the
indictment drove Noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining
tool.''
   The defense, calling the case against Noriega ``indictment
diplomacy,'' noted that in March the government offered to guarantee
it would not seek his extradition if he fled to Spain, and in May
offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left Panama.

   Libya claimed the destruction of two Libyan jet
fighters by U.S. Navy planes on Wednesday was a premeditated attack,
and Col. Moammar Gadhafi declared his nation would ``meet challenge
with challenge.''
   ``If America has prevailed because it is a superpower in the air
and the sea, it will inevitably be defeated on land,'' Gadhafi said.
``We, as well as the fish, are awaiting them.''
   Gadhafi asked the Soviet Union to move some of its warships in
the Mediterranean to the area in which U.S. vessels are operating
near Libya, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Tanjug reported later that Tripoli residents jammed filling
stations in a flight from the city a few hours after the aerial
encounter.
   Tanjug's correspondent, one of the few non-Arab journalists with
an office in Tripoli, has had excellent access to high Libyan
sources in the past and his reports often prove reliable.
   A reporter for Italian TV said Gadhafi's residence-headquarters
in Tripoli, already equipped with watchtowers and tanks parked in
camouflaged garages, had been even more heavily fortified.
   The Italian correspondent, who arrived in Tripoli on Wednesday,
said anti-missile batteries had been placed in key areas. He said
the government television station was one point at which security
was notably greater.
   He described the reaction as ``first incredulity, then anger''
when word arrived in Tripoli that fighters from the U.S. 6th Fleet
had shot down two Libyan MiG jets.
   Gadhafi's compound was a target of the last U.S. military strike
against Libya: bombing raids in April 1986 on Tripoli and Benghazi.
President Reagan described the raids as retaliation for the bombing
of a Berlin disco frequented by American servicemen, which the
United States blamed on terrorists sponsored by Libya.
   Wednesday evening, the Libyan Foreign Ministry summoned heads of
Western European diplomatic missions and asked them to condemn the
U.S. ``aggression'' and to prevent any escalation in tensions, the
official Libyan news agency JANA reported.
   Gadhafi, according to JANA, branded the U.S. action on Wednesday
as an example of increased ``official American terrorism, which is
backed by brute force.''
   In spite of it and ``of the threats, the revolutionaries of great
Libya will not bow their heads and will not abandon their principles
and the objectives of their eternal motherland of unity, liberation
and the building of progress,'' he declared.
   ``They will meet challenge with challenge,'' he said.
   In New York, Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser requested an
emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn ``this
premeditated act of aggression'' in shooting down two aircraft that
were ``unarmed, on reconnaissance, ordinary, routine flying.''
   Earlier in the day, Libya's ambassador to Rome linked the event
to U.S. charges that Libya had built a chemical weapons factory in
the desert southwest of Tripoli. In Washington, the State Department
said there was ``absolutely no connection.''
   Gadhafi has said the plant's function is to produce medicines.
JANA reported in recent days that Libyan doctors and nurses were
conducting a sit-in at the factory, anticipating a U.S. attack.
   The agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as describing U.S. naval
presence in the Mediterranean as ``a smokescreen'' for a
``large-scale aggression to be launched'' against Libyan military
and economic installations.
   Libya ``preserves its legitimate right to defend itself and its
existence,'' JANA quoted the ministry as saying. It said the
ministry had asked for an emergency meeting of foreign ministers
from Arab League nations.
   Libyan state radio carried this Foreign Ministry statement
earlier Wednesday:
   ``At 1103 hours (5:03 a.m. EST) while two Libyan reconnaissance
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters U.S.
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them
down.''
   Abdel Rahman Shalgam, the Libyan ambassador to Italy, said the
U.S. Navy action was ``dangerous,'' but did not say how Libya would
respond. His embassy issued a statement Wednesday evening calling it
``an act of destabilizing provocation for all the Mediterranean
area.''
   ``It is an incomprehensible provocation,'' the statement said,
and Libya ``asks for the solidarity of the Mediterranean area
peoples, recognizing (especially) the role played by Italy in
international peacemaking.''
   Giulio Andreotti, Italy's foreign minister, has recommended that
allegations about the chemical factory be discussed at an
international conference on chemical weapons beginning Saturday in
Paris.

   Israeli soldiers killed a 16-year-old boy
Wednesday and wounded five other Palestinians, hospital officials
reported, and left-wing legislators said they would defy Israeli law
and meet with PLO officials.
   A Palestinian man was shot dead in Jericho in the occupied West
Bank, but it was not clear whether the killing was connected with
the 13-month-old uprising in the occupied territories.
   Conferences are planned in Paris and the Hague later this month
despite Israeli laws that prohibit meetings with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   A Palestinian newspaper and Israeli magazine announced plans
Wednesday for a similar meeting in New York in March, to which
members of Israel's parliament and the Palestine National Council,
the PLO legislature, would be invited.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fire
during at least four clashes with stone-throwing youths, according
to Arab reports and hospital officials.
   Nasser Ismail Nasser, 16, was killed In Gaza's Deir el Balah
refugee camp, officials at Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City said. The
army confirmed Nasser's death, which brought to 346 the number of
Palestinians killed in the rebellion. Fourteen Israelis also have
died.
   In Jericho, 25-year-old Bassam Barahme was killed by unidentified
gunmen near his home Wednesday night, army officials and Israel
radio reported.
   Barahme was taken to Mukassad Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem and
died of two bullet wounds, the radio said.
   The reason for the attack was not known. A military official
said: ``Troops were not involved. It was a clash between residents.''
   The uprising has been credited with bringing about a more
moderate stance by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat that has, in turn,
encouraged some Israelis to press for a talks with the PLO.
   Arafat said Wednesday his peace overtures to Israel would be
withdrawn unless it agreed to negotiate.
   ``I don't expect Israel to accept peace easily or to give in
easily,'' he said during a rally in Cairo after a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak of Egype.
   But if Israel continues to spurn talks, ``I will return to the
Palestine National Council and tell them: it's no use, these people
(Israelis) do not want peace.''
   In Jerusalem, Lova Eliav of Israel's mainstream Labor Party said
Wednesday that he and five other Israeli politicians would attend
the meetings with PLO officials.
   ``I think the Israeli government must negotiate with the PLO and
the meetings in The Hague and Paris can be a catalyst for future
meetings,'' he said.
   Organizers of the Hague meeting said they believed the PLO would
be represented by two top officials, Bassam Abu Sharif and Khaled Al
Hassan.
   Eliav said he and and fellow Labor Party member Ora Namir would
go to Paris, along with Yair Tsaban of the socialist Mapam Party and
Shulamit Aloni of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement. All are
members of Israel's parliament.
   He said Abba Eban, a former Labor foreign minister, and Haim
Tzadok, a former Supreme Court justice, would attend the Hague
meeting.
   The Hebrew-language Hadashot newspaper also reported an
unidentified Labor legislator was trying to arrange a meeting with
Arafat in Paris.
   Meanwhile, Palestinian editor Hanna Seniora said his PLO-backed
newspaper Al Fajr and the Israeli magazine New Outlook would sponsor
a meeting March 18-20 in New York to bring Palestinians and Israelis
together.
   After Arafat said Dec. 14 in Geneva that the PLO recognized
Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism, the United States
opened meetings with the PLO. But Israeli officials continue to
denounce Arafat's organization as a terrorist group.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday that the ministry
asked Israeli legislators not to attend the meetings. A group of 31
right-wing and religious party lawmakers also asked government
officials to legally block those going to Paris from leaving Israel.
   An army official said the military was investigating the death of
an 11-year-old Palestinian who, family members charge, suffered a
fatal head injury when he was pushed off a military jeep on Dec. 10.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was
no evidence that the boy, Badr Karadeh of Nablus, was ever in
military custody.
   But a Palestinian physician, Dr. Abdel Hadi Abu Zant of Nablus,
said he saw the boy seized, beaten and taken away by Israeli
soldiers in a jeep.
   Two left-wing members of parliament _ Dedi Zucker and Yossi Sarid
of the Citizens Rights Movement _ have called for a Defense Ministry
probe.
   In another development, Mayor Elias Freij of the West Bank town
of Bethlehem, who proposed a truce in the uprising, appeared to be
in hiding Wednesday after a warning from Arafat and death threats
painted on the town walls.
   Freij had proposed conditions under which Israel would free 5,000
Palestinian prisoners, allow universities to open, and hold
municipal elections for the first time in 12 years.
   Arafat, in remarks broadcast Monday, said, ``No one can stop the
intefadeh, and any responsible Palestinian calling for stopping it
exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''

   People in the Northeast bundled up and those in the Southwest
covered up Wednesday, but residents of the southern Plains basked in
springlike weather as temperatures reached into the 50s from
northern Texas to Nebraska.
   In the Southwest, rain fell from southern California into western
New Mexico, with snow piling up in the Arizona mountains. Flagstaff
received 5 inches of new snow for a total of 10 inches on the ground.
   There was heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms elsewhere in
Arizona, with over a half inch of rain recorded Wednesday morning at
Kingman and Yuma.
   Southern California's deserts and valley also got a soaking, with
more than three-quarters of an inch of rain reported at Blythe and
Needles.
   Freezing rain iced roads around Cedar City, in southwest Utah,
making travel hazardous. Snow was heavy at times over parts of
southern Utah, where 2 to 4 inches were expected.
   The eastern Great Lakes and Appalachian region got its own share
of snow, with up to 8 inches reported in the southeastern Cleveland
suburbs of Bedford and Garfield Heights and 4 to 8 inches elsewhere
in the area.
   Snow also piled up in West Virginia. Up to 7 inches fell across
much of the state, with up to a foot reported in parts of the
northern mountains. Snowfall across the mountains of Pennsylvania
ranged from 5 to 7 inches.
   Temperatures across northern and central New England were between
10 above and 10 below zero at midday and northwest winds ranged from
10 to 30 mph, putting wind chill temperatures between 30 below and
50 degrees below zero.
   It was much better elsewhere in the Northeast. At Newark
International Airport in New Jersey, meteorologist Walter Zamorski
of the National Weather Service said the high for the day was 29
degrees at 1 a.m.
   ``It got colder as the sun came up,'' he said, chuckling. ``It
dropped into the teens by the afternoon, and with the wind chill, it
probably brings it close to minus 40 below.''
   In New York, the wind chill factor prompted the National Weather
Service to issue frostbite warnings for people venturing outdoors
without bundling up. In Syracuse, officials closed schools due to
the cold.
   By contrast, the southern half of the Plains enjoyed temperatures
into the 50s. To the north, after many days of sub-zero readings,
Devils Lake, N.D., hit 36 degrees Wednesday afternoon, tying the
1984 record high for the date.
   The low in the nation early Wednesday was 23 degrees below zero
at Pellston, Mich. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST
ranged from 11 degrees below zero at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 85
degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   For Thursday, the National Weather Service predicted widespread
rain throughout the middle Mississippi, lower Missouri and western
Ohio valleys. Numerous showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
southeast Kansas and central Oklahoma into Arkansas and the lower
Mississippi Valley. In the upper Midwest, freezing rain was expected
from southeastern Minnesota and central Wisconsin into southeast
lower Michigan and northeastern Ohio, with scattered snow from
northeastern Minnesota into central lower Michigan.
   In the West, numerous showers were forecast along the northern
Pacific coast with scattered rainfall farther south. Snowshowers
will be scattered from the northern Rockies into Nevada, with more
frequent snow from northern Montana into central Idaho.
   High temperatures again will be in the single digits and teens
across northern and central New England, and in the 20s from the
northern Rockies through northern North Dakota and the northern
Great Lakes into southern New England.
   From the California coast across the southern Plains into the
Tennessee Valley and the south Atlantic coast, highs were forecast
in the 50s and 60s, but rising into the 70s across the western and
central Gulf coast. The nation's southernmost reaches, south Florida
and the tip of Texas, will have temperatures in the 80s. Highs will
be in the 30s or 40s across the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Police Report Finding Two Caches Of Explosives</HEAD>

   Two caches of the
Czechoslovak-made plastic explosive Semtex belonging to the outlawed
Irish Republic Army were found on both sides of the Irish border on
Wednesday, police said.
   A cache in the center of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, contained
an unstated amount of Semtex, bomb-making equipment and ammunition,
police said.
   They said it was in a house in a densely populated area
overlooking Craigavon Bridge.
   Police in the Irish Republic said they found 21 pounds of Semtex,
along with 36 homemade mortars loaded with Semtex and ready for
firing, electrical bomb detonators, assault rifles and ammunition,
in a shed on an isolated farm near Birr, County Offaly, 70 miles
southwest of Dublin.
   Police in both cases said the caches belonged to the IRA, which
is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
   They say the IRA is believed to get its Semtex from Libya.
   The explosive looks like powder and comes in bags marked with its
name. Investigators say it may have been used by whoever planted a
bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103, a jumbo jet that exploded over
Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Art Agnos on Wednesday defended as
``low-keyed and responsible,'' a sweep of up to 50 homeless people
from a campsite of tarpaulins and plastic sheets near City Hall.
   The evictions Tuesday followed complaints the homeless camp was
blocking access to a building. About a dozen police officers watched
as public works employees removed the shelters. A garbage truck used
in the eviction was emblazoned with the slogan ``The Sweep Is On.''
   ``The campers moved voluntarily when requested to do so and were
given ample time to collect their belongings,'' said Agnos. ``The
homeless problem was created by federal policies that reduced the
amount of local housing aid by 80 percent over then past eight
years. No city can make up for that.''
   Agnos has refused to open a National Guard armory to the
homeless, saying it is too small and would be too expensive to run.
But four days before the sweep, he asked local religious leaders to
make churches and synagogues available.
   The encampment in U.N. Plaza, in view of City Hall, was set up a
few days earlier. Dozens of men and women spent the holidays in the
encampment, using sleeping bags, plastic sheets, tarps and blankets
to ward off the rain and cold as a series of storms struck Northern
California.
   Pacific Gas and Electric complained to police that the shelters
were blocking a fire exit, company officials said.
   ``Right now, we probably look like the bad guys,'' said PG&amp;E
spokeswoman Cynthia Schramm. ``But we have a lot of sympathy for
these people. We only wanted the police to unblock'' a fire door.
   Police Sgt. Dave Ambrose said the operation was ``not a police
action. The San Francisco police stood by while the Department of
Public Works took apart the temporary structures.''
   Earl Thompson, who helped start the tent community, refused to
leave and was arrested. Others who built their tent shacks on the
plaza wandered away, but vowed to move back.
   James Robinson, 32, said he didn't know where he would head next.
``It depends on how far they beat us back,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Katherine Baker, an organizer of the tent city, stood
a few yards away as DPW crews hosed down the bricks where the
homeless had been. She stood near a pile of blankets and shopping
carts that had once been the ``community house. ''
   She said they had banded together for self-protection against
theft or worse.
   ``If we're scattered ... we've got the robbers and night creepers
wanting to come by and mess you up,'' she said. ``We got nowhere
else to go ... the hotels aren't safe, the shelters are packed.''
   ``They treat us like tramps,'' said Baker. ``And it's hard _
every damn day. How long can one human being keep taking that from
another human being?''
   The city houses about half of San Francisco's estimated 6,000
homeless in budget hotels. Bob Prentice, coordinator of the mayor's
homeless program, said the city has been trying to find another
building that can be used as a temporary shelter.
   ``We're doing the best we can to get a place for them,'' he said.
``Until then, they have to keep a low profile.''

<HEAD>U.N. Official Visits South Texas To Observe Central American Influx</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Nations refugee expert visiting
the southern tip of Texas said Wednesday she has seen hundreds of
Central American emigrants camping in makeshift tents and crowded
into dilapidated motels.
   ``Clearly these people are experiencing difficulty and hardship,
and this is one thing I wanted to come down and see about,'' said
Susan Timberlake of the Washington, D.C., office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   Ms. Timberlake arrived in the lower Rio Grande Valley on Tuesday
night and planned to stay until Thursday visiting immigrant shelters
and meeting with local officials and Immigration and Naturalization
Service representatives.
   Ms. Timberlake said as of Wednesday she had not observed any
apparent violations of international law.
   Al De Leon, assistant INS district director for examinations in
Harlingen, said no violations of U.N. protocol were relayed to him
in his meeting with Ms. Timberlake.
   ``Basically, she is down here to observe and learn about the
situation,'' he said.
   More than 30,000 Central Americans have crossed the Rio Grande
illegally near Brownsville and sought political asylum since the end
of May when the INS started keeping count of the growing flood of
``other than Mexican'' newcomers.
   The concentration of Central Americans in the valley has
increased sharply since Dec. 16 when the INS started requiring
asylum-seeking immigrants in the area to submit their applications
at the INS' Harlingen office and to receive word of approval or
denial here.
   The U.N. refugee office's interest in Cameron County, the state's
southernmost, was not a result of the new INS procedure, ``but by
the fact that there are large numbers of asylum-seekers here, and
that's what the UN is interested in,'' said Ms. Timberlake.
   The office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, based in
Geneva, was established to protect refugees' rights. More than 100
countries have subscribed to a 1951 convention and-or a 1967
protocol relating to the status of refugees. Each defines who is a
refugee and outlines proper conditions for handling refugees.
   Much of the U.N. language was incorporated into U.S. law with the
1980 Refugee Act. Refugees are defined in part as people who are
outside their country because of well-founded fear of persecution.
   ``When I go back, I'll discuss what I've seen with my office and
with my headquarters in Geneva, and we'll sit down with the (U.S)
government and discuss it,'' Ms. Timberlake said.
   A main concern of the U.N. body is whether refugees have adequate
access to the asylum process, she said.
   Asylum-seekers previously were allowed to travel to their
destination cities, usually Miami or Los Angeles. A huge backlog of
asylum cases in those cities and a large number of unwarranted
asylum claims prompted the INS to adopt the new procedure, officials
said.
   INS officials have said most of the applicants are seeking
economic betterment, not fleeing persecution, and therefore do not
qualify for asylum. Those denied asylum will be asked to leave the
country or face deportation, but may appeal their cases.
   Because there is at least a 30-day wait for an answer from the
INS, many of the immigrants with no money and no place to go have
begun camping out in the brush under discarded sheets of plastic.
   A shanty town of plastic roofs continues to grow outside the
Catholic Church-sponsored Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central
Americans southeast of Brownsville. Casa Romero is limited to a
capacity of 200 by court order.
   Ms. Timberlake said she had visited that camp site, dotted with
human feces, where 250 people stayed Tuesday night, and the Amber
Motel, a condemned structure in Brownsville that remains packed with
Central Americans.

<TEXT>
   At age 11, Scott James had been in and
out of special schools. His mother deemed him uncontrollable and
tried for two months to have him placed in state custody, but state
officials refused.
   Protective custody, the state said, is for children who are
abused or abandoned, not those with behavior problems that require
treatment. Today, Scott is in state custody _ accused of murder.
   Scott is confined at the Maine Youth Center in South Portland,
accused of setting a New Year's Eve fire at a six-unit apartment
building in Biddeford that killed a 53-year-old man.
   Authorities have not decided whether the boy will be tried as a
juvenile or an adult.
   Officials who deal with emotionally troubled youngsters say Scott
is one of many children who need help but cannot get it because
there are not enough resources to go around.
   Roger Raymond, Biddeford's special education director, said he
contacted the state Department of Human Services two months ago
because he feared Scott was at risk.
   ``It's terrible what happened,'' Raymond said. ``It goes without
saying, we don't have the resources available for kids who are in
need of such services. And I doubt that his situation is unique.''
   After a three-hour detention hearing Tuesday, District Court
Judge Robert Crowley found probable cause for a felony murder charge
stemming from the fire death of Raymond R. Lauzon. Assistant
Attorney General Eric Wright said the boy must appear Jan. 17 in
District Court.
   Felony murder is a homicide that occurs during the commission of
a felony, in this case arson, in which someone's death is a
reasonably foreseeable result.
   Should Scott be tried as a juvenile and convicted, he could
remain in the custody of the state until he is 21 or 22 years old.
If tried for murder as an adult, he would face a minimum of 25 years
in prison and a maximum life term.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Scott's 8-year-old brother, Jason, told the
court that the two boys had been visiting Lauzon and were told to
leave when the older boy was caught trying to steal money from
Lauzon's bedroom.
   Jason said he walked away but Scott lingered around the apartment
building before joining him later.
   In interviews and court testimony, juvenile caseworkers, school
officials and Scott's mother, Janet Sullivan, portrayed him as an
emotionally troubled youngster who had been placed in three special
schools but remained uncontrollable.
   For the past three months he had run away about once a week from
Ms. Sullivan, 31, who is divorced, jobless and on welfare, according
to testimony.
   A spokesman at the Department of Human Services said Scott's
problems were not so severe that he needed to be placed in a foster
home or residential treatment center.
   Peter Walsh, director of the Bureau of Social Services, said the
department ``never found this child to be in jeopardy and needing
his relationship with his parent severed.''

<HEAD>Namibian Rebel Leader Says U.S. Trying To Keep South African Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slashing the number of U.N. peacekeeping troops in
Namibia will give South Africa an opportunity to maintain control
over the territory, a rebel leader warned on Wednesday.
   Rebel leader Sam Nujoma ripped a move by U.N. Security Council
members to reduce from 7,500 to 3,000 the contingent that will
oversee Namibia's transition this year to independence from South
Africa.
   ``This obviously is unacceptable, unjust and undemocratic,''
Nujoma told a news conference. ``It is an attempt to assist South
Africa to achieve politically what it failed to achieve militarily.''
   He said a U.N. force of 3,000 ``won't be able to control
anything,'' given the scope of Namibia's 800,000-square-mile
territory.
   Instead of reducing the transition force, Nujoma said, the United
Nations should increase it to ensure that the transition to
independence and black majority rule is carried out peacefully and
without South African interference.
   The proposal for a reduction in the 7,500-member force was based
on financial considerations.
   Nujoma, who leads the rebel South-West Africa People's
Organization, said the United States was one of those who supported
the reduction plan. He did not name the other nations that supported
it.
   Two weeks ago, South Africa agreed to implement a U.N. plan for
Namibia's transition to independence. As part of the deal, Cuba
agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Namibia's northern
neighbor, Angola.
   South Africa will be allowed to keep a residual force of 1,500
troops in Namibia until an independent government takes power, but
Nujoma expressed concern about alleged South African efforts to
continue influencing events in the territory.
   Among other things, he said anti-independence death squads
operate in Namibia.
   Nujoma was in Cuba for talks with President Fidel Castro and to
take part in activities related to the 30th anniversary of the Cuban
revolution.
   Namibia also is known as South-West Africa.

<TEXT>
   King Hassan II and representatives of
Marxist guerrillas fighting Morocco for control of the Western
Sahara met Wednesday for the first time since their war began more
than 13 years ago.
   The Moroccan government said Hassan's talks with the delegation
from the Polisario Front touched on a proposed referendum for
self-determination in the former Spanish colony, a phosphate-rich
territory Morocco annexed in 1975.
   Both Morocco and Polisario, which has bases in Algeria, have
agreed in principle to a U.N.-supervised referendum on the future of
the Western Sahara. No date has been set.
   Polisario has demanded that before a referendum, Morocco must
withdraw its troops and administrators. It has called for direct
negotiations, conditions refused by Morocco.
   A statement from the Information Ministry said the Moroccan king
received the delegation at a palace in Marrakech.
   Included in the Polisario delegation were Bechir Mustapha Sayed,
in charge of external relations, Brahim Ghali, responsible for
defense, and Mahfoud Ali Beiba, designated prime minister of the
Saharian Arab Democratic Republic, proclaimed by the Polisario in
1976.
   The Polisario Front has said it decided to send the delegation to
Morocco after the Moroccan monarch told the French press last month
that he was ready to meet Polisario officials.
   
   Polisario declared the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic in
February 1976. It has since been recognized by 45 countries, 27 of
them Organization of African Unity members.
   Relations between Morocco and Algeria, the guerrillas' main
backer, improved last year.
   Five Americans were killed last month when Polisario guerrillas
shot down a plane and disabled another that were spraying a remote
desert area for locusts. The guerrillas have apologized for the Dec.
10 incident, saying they mistook the plane for a Moroccan military
reconnaissance aircraft.

   Dolphins saved the life of a 17-year-old
boy who was attacked by a large shark while surfing off the north
coast of New South Wales state, police said. The shark tore a huge
chunk from the boy's surfboard.
   Police said a group of dolphins chased off the shark that
attacked Adam McGuire on Tuesday at Evans Head, about 400 miles
north of Sydney.
   McGuire, from Newcastle, about 100 miles north of Sydney,
suffered a badly cut abdomen in the attack, police and ambulance
officers said.
   He swam to shore despite his injuries and raised the alarm.
Ambulance officers attended McGuire and rushed him to a hospital,
where he underwent surgery and was in stable condition.
   Police said McGuire was surfing about 300 feet or more off Half
Tide Beach with two friends when a shark, believed to be a tiger
shark, attacked him twice.
   On the first pass, the shark gouged out a big piece of his
surfboard and knocked him into the water.
   Sydney shark expert John Hajje said McGuire probably could thank
his surfboard as much as the dolphins for his survival.
   ``The police told me that when the shark attacked it took a chunk
out of the board and he fell off,'' he said.
   ``Rather than attack him it kept on going for the board. It
really just brushed him and didn't take much of a bite.''
   Hajje said it was not the first time he heard of dolphins
intervening in a shark attack, although he had yet to confirm the
details of this incident.
   ``Dolphins are highly intelligent creatures and it certainly
wouldn't be beyond them to know when a human's in distress and help
out,'' he said.

   A man who spotted his stolen truck on a
traffic-clogged freeway ran after its driver with an unloaded rifle
and got the truck back, authorities said. The truck's driver was
arrested.
   About two dozen people, some using car phones, called the
California Highway Patrol for fear that Interstate 80 was about to
become a combat zone after they spotted Michael Wright, 45, stalking
the other man on foot.
   Wright, driving his car, recognized his stolen truck about noon
Tuesday on the freeway in Pinole, about 10 miles north of Berkeley.
Apparently undetected, Wright followed the truck south eight miles
until traffic stopped.
   Wright, who had a .22-caliber rifle with him, pulled his car onto
the shoulder of the freeway, got out and rifle in hand, approached
the truck, said Highway Patrol Officer Ted Wong.
   The driver of the truck saw Wright coming toward him, got out of
the truck and started running the other way, Wong said. Wright tried
to chase the man but lost him in traffic and returned to his truck.
   But by this time, motorists' calls brought the Highway Patrol and
Berkeley police to the scene, and one patrol officer drove to the
freeway exit where the suspect was getting off the highway.
   Eric Staudinger, 22, of San Pablo, was arrested for investigation
of auto theft and possession of stolen property, authorities said.
Wright and a friend drove his two vehicles to his home in Vallejo.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Ambassador to Austria Ronald
Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, said Wednesday
that he'll run for mayor of New York, becoming the first announced
challenger to incumbent Edward Koch.
   ``I have been a diplomat and a businessman but above all I'm a
New Yorker and I'm particularly concerned about the future of our
city, a city in crisis,'' the 44-year-old Republican said.
   Koch, a Democrat, has said he intends to run for a fourth term as
mayor of the heavily Democratic city.
   Lauder is on the Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest
Americans with a fortune estimated at $333 million.
   ``If I ran my business the way New York City is run, I'd be
bankrupt,'' said Lauder, who refused to say how much of his own
money he'd be willing to spend in a campaign to unseat Koch.
   Lauder made his announcement 140 miles north of New York City as
Republican and Conservative party leaders attended the opening of
the Legislature's annual session in Albany.
   A former treasurer of the state Republican Committee, Lauder has
toyed with running for statewide office in the past but has not done
so. He was considered a potential challenger to U.S. Sen. Daniel
Moynihan last year but declined.
   ``The major issue is we've reached a point where it's time for a
change,'' Lauder said of Koch's tenure.
   Sensing political vulnerability in Koch, several Democrats have
talked of running against him this year, but none have declared
their candidacy. The potential rivals include Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins, City Council President Andrew Stein, former
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Richard Ravitch, city
Comptroller Harrison Goldin and Charles Hynes, a special state
prosecutor who handled the Howard Beach racial assault case.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, also has been
mentioned as a potential candidate. Lauder said he'd be willing to
take on Giuliani in a primary.
   There's been talk in Republican circles that U.S. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato might be advancing Lauder's candidacy in an attempt to head
off any mayoral move by Giuliani. Lauder said he's spoken to D'Amato
and the senator is ``in good support of my candidacy.''
   D'Amato, who has had cool relations with Giuliani for more than a
year, was in Albany for the opening of the legislative session but
did not attend Lauder's news conference.

   A gunman who held 20 people hostage at a
restaurant before being shot to death by police told a waitress to
fetch his boots because ``a good cowboy dies with his boots on,''
the woman said.
   As Wayne Strozzi, 35, hung on, mortally wounded, he shot to death
another waitress. Another hostage was slain by police as he escaped
through a bathroom window and fled the Riverhouse Restaurant during
Tuesday's melee.
   Two police officers also were wounded by Strozzi during the
incident, which began when the paroled drug offender, apparently
angry that his estranged wife had begun dating another man,
assaulted her at her home. He fled first to his own home, and then
to the restaurant, where he held off police for more than an hour.
   District Attorney Stu VanMeveren said at a news conference that
the focus of his investigation would be on the ``justification or
non-justification of the shootings.''
   VanMeveren described Strozzi as a veteran of the Vietnam War who
was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Barbara Strozzi also described her husband as troubled by his
Vietnam experiences. She suggested that his wounding the officers
was a way of provoking police to kill him.
   ``I know that if he had wanted to, he would have killed them,''
she said. ``He had all kinds of (marksmanship) medals. When he shot
the officers, I think he wanted to commit suicide but didn't have
the courage.''
   During the standoff, Strozzi threatened he was ``going to waste
everybody'' and intended to burn down the restaurant, demanded a
getaway car and, finally, asked for his boots, a fresh shirt and a
plane to Libya.
   Following hour-long negotiations by megaphone, a sniper from a
Special Weapons and Tactics team opened fire as Strozzi stood with a
hostage near the front door, hitting Strozzi at least three times in
the head and abdomen. Strozzi then shot waitress Sally Mills in the
chest and thighs, police said.
   Strozzi and Mills died at McKee Medical Center. Mills, a single
mother in her 40s, had been working at the restaurant only a few
weeks, employees said.
   Fenton Crookshank, 45, who was attending a Lion's Club meeting in
the basement of the restaurant, was slain by a police officer as he
dived through a bathroom window and tried to flee. Authorities said
Crookshank, a former Nebraska school principal who managed a lumber
company, refused to respond to their orders to halt as he ran toward
them from the restaurant.
   Strozzi was paroled from the Colorado State Penitentiary in
October 1987 after serving 13 months on a conviction for cocaine
distribution.
   ``I couldn't tell if he was drunk, but he was on some kind of
drug, I know that,'' said Steve Bethel, 32, a reserve police officer
who was one of the hostages.
   Bethel said he and his wife, Belva, 30, and their three young
children had just finished dinner and were preparing to pay their
bill when the gunman came in.
   Bethel, who does not carry a gun off-duty, said Strozzi grabbed
his wife and stuck a 9mm handgun behind her ear.
   ``He told us, `Everybody down on the floor.' I thought he was
just going to rob the place,'' Bethel said. ``It happened so quick,
you didn't have time to think.''
   Dan Scheibe, a member of the Centennial Bass Fishermen's Club
which was meeting in the basement of the restaurant along with two
other groups, said he heard a man cursing and people screaming, at
which point he and nearly 40 other club members escaped through a
rear basement door.
   ``He said he was going to waste everybody,'' said Jim Carr,
another Centennial club member.
   Strozzi, seeking a getaway, ordered Bethel to drive his car to
the front entrance of the restaurant and put his three children in
it. After Bethel parked the car, Strozzi walked outside with Mrs.
Bethel when he spotted police Officer Joe Berdin in the parking lot
and shot him in the shoulder.
   Strozzi then pulled the woman back into the restaurant and began
issuing demands.
   Waitress Ann Knight said Strozzi ordered her to give him money
from the cash register. Knight said he also ordered her to fetch his
boots and a shirt from his pickup truck.
   ``A good cowboy dies with his boots on,'' she said he told her.
   When Strozzi told her to return a second time to his pickup
because she had brought the wrong shirt, Knight escaped.
   Strozzi released about a half-dozen hostages, including the
Bethel family and an elderly man, before the final shootout.
   Sheriff's Deputy Jay Hirokawa was wounded earlier when officers
responding to Mrs. Strozzi's call chased Strozzi to his own home. He
emerged and shot Hirokawa in the arm before fleeing to the
restaurant.
   Hirokawa was treated and released at the hospital, and Berdin was
listed in good condition.
   Another restaurant employee, Jennifer Matthews, 20, was treated
and released for cuts after she escaped by jumping through a window.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Boosts Prices and Devalues Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan government sharply
devalued the official currency exchange rate, raised bus fares
20,000 percent and increased fuel prices Wednesday in an effort to
keep the economy afloat.
   The economy is so battered after eight years of war against
U.S.-supported rebels that inflation last year topped 20,000
percent, according to official figures.
   The austerity measures were published in the Sandinista party
newspaper Barricada. They include an immediate devaluation of the
cordoba of more than half in relation to the U.S. dollar, a 20,000
percent increase in bus fares and a raise in fuel prices of about
120 percent.
   On Saturday, President Daniel Ortega said in a New Year's speech
he was cutting the defense budget by 29 percent, which includes a 40
percent cut for police and other security forces.
   Government spending on public works projects and other essential
investments are being reduced this year by 56 percent, Ortega said.
   The Sandinistas have maintained strict controls over business and
other economic activities since they seized power from a
pro-American rightist government in 1979. The government sets prices
for all essential goods and services, from gasoline to bread and
milk.
   Barricada said the Central Bank, Nicaragua's federal reserve, on
Wednesday raised the official exchange parity from 920 to 2,000
cordobas to the dollar. That is the rate the government uses for
essential imports such as crude oil.
   A parallel exchange rate, at which most transactions such as
paying hotel bills are carried out, remained at 4,500 to the dollar.
The black market rate is approximately 5,500 to the dollar, although
it is not very large.
   Urban bus fares went up from half a cordoba to 100 cordobas, or
one 9,000th of a U.S. cent to a little over 2 cents. The government
has been heavily subsidizing bus fares to keep them low.
   Similarly, the price of gasoline went up from 1,900 cordobas to
4,200 cordobas a gallon, or from about 42 cents to about 95 cents a
gallon. Gasoline is rationed, and motorists now get 17 gallons a
month.
   Buses and other public means of transportation are in a shambles
for lack of spare parts because of the U.S.-imposed trade embargo.
The United States said Nicaragua had established close military ties
with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
   Nicaragua gets weapons, training and other military assistance
from Soviet block countries. The Reagan administration has been
claiming these ties, together with alleged Sandinista aid to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador, are a threat to security in Central
America.
   As a result, Nicaragua now mainly trades with the Soviet bloc
with which it runs a big deficit. Imports last year totalled $800
million, while exports earned only $200 million.
   Ortega has said the trade embargo alone cost Nicaragua $315
million in income since the United States imposed it in 1985, and
another $422 million in credits which the Sandinistas were refused
because of U.S. pressure on world lending institutions.

   ``Starlight Express,'' the lavish Andrew Lloyd
Webber roller skating musical, will close Sunday unless ticket
demand picks up, Bill Evans, a spokesman for the show, said
Wednesday.
   ``It has to improve over the weekend to keep going,'' said Arthur
Cantor, production adviser for the musical which opened at the
Gershwin Theater in March 1987.
   The expensive musical breaks even at about $275,000 a week,
Cantor said, and is facing several lean weeks of business following
the traditional Christmas and New Year's box office surge.
   ``Starlight Express'' tells the story of a railroad race across
the United States. The show will have played 761 performances and 22
previews if it does shut on Sunday.
   The musical hasn't entirely recouped its high production costs,
said Cantor, but added that complete payback is ``pretty close.'' He
declined to be more specific.
   ``Starlight Express'' will begin a 10-city, three-year national
tour in late summer, said Cantor. The tour probably will start at
either the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles or the Golden Gate
Theater in San Francisco, he added. The original London production,
which opened in March 1984, is still running.

   Investigators believe the cyanide poisoning
of a teen-ager is an isolated incident, but said Wednesday they were
looking into a possibility it may be linked to an unsolved tampering
case of two years ago.
   The last known death or injury in New Jersey from product
tampering was in September 1986, when a Runnemede man died after
eating a small amount of soup that contained cyanide.
   In both cases, the tampered products were purchased at
supermarkets, but the tainted goods were manufacturerd by different
companies, said Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell.
   ``Obviously, we have to look into whether or not there's a
connection,'' said Asbell, adding that investigators have not found
such evidence. Asbell said he knew of no motive or suspects.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors, meanwhile, toured
the Kraft Inc. Dairy Group plant that produced the tainted Breyers
black cherry yogurt in South Edmeston, N.Y., officials said.
   ``We haven't seen anything that would indicate any problem
there,'' said FDA spokesman William Grigg in Rockville, Md.
   FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank E. Young has said the incident appears
to be an isolated case, Grigg said.
   Kraft Inc. Dairy Group, meanwhile, voluntarily added New York
state Wednesday to three other states where all flavors of Breyers
yogurt is being removed from retail stores.
   ``We are taking this step to remove any doubt in consumers' minds
about the integrity of the product,'' company President Thomas
Herskovits said in a news release.
   Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield, lapsed into a coma after eating
about a third of an 8-ounce container. Lee remained on a respirator
at West Jersey Hospital-Voorhees late Wednesday, said spokesman Ed
Kanis.
   Investigators also planned to look again at the carton in which
the yogurt was packaged.
   ``We need to go back and take a closer look,'' said Matthew
Lewis, an FDA district supervisor in West Orange. ``We're all trying
to find out where this happened. Right now, we don't have any
leads.''
   Lewis said initial inspections of the carton and package lid
revealed no pinholes. The company has said Breyers yogurt packages
have a seal that makes any tampering evident. Asbell said there was
no immediate evidence the seal had been broken.
   ``The number one question here is when and where the
contamination occurred,'' said John H. Kundts, an FBI spokesman in
Philadelphia.
   Breyers Yogurt products have been removed as a precaution from
167 Acme stores in southern New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware,
said Walter Rubel, a spokesman for the Malvern, Pa.-based chain.
   The yogurt containing the cyanide was purchased Sunday at a
Westmont Acme supermarket, from a yogurt batch dated Feb. 9, 1989,
officials said.
   Marilyn Riley, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Health, said state officials were cautioning consumers who called to
carefully inspect any products for tampering.
   But Lewis said tests Tuesday on 130 similar yogurt containers
turned up no sign of cyanide, which is used in rat poisoning and can
be fatal to humans.
   Authorities said the cyanide appeared to have been on the top of
the yogurt and not stirred in.
   The yogurt was in one of 6,900 cases, each with a dozen
containers, routed through a Kraft facility in Walton, N.Y., said
Mary Agnes Welsh, a spokeswoman for Kraft Inc. Dairy Group of
Glenview, Ill.
   George Kerns, a spokesman for Asbell, said Lee's mother had
purchased a batch of yogurt from the store and two other containers
had been eaten without any side effects.
   Lee, a junior at Haddonfield Memorial High School, became ill
Tuesday morning when he was eating the yogurt on his way to class.

   The pilot of an F-16a fighter jet ejected
safely Wednesday before his plane crashed in a sparsely populated
area north of Lake Okeechobee, authorities said.
   First Lt. Mark Pugh, 27, of Belpre, Ohio, ejected when his
fighter went down during a training mission at the Avon Park Range
near here, Sgt. Tony Rowland, public affairs officer for the base.
   Pugh, attached to the 308th Tactical Fighter squadron at
Homestead Air Force Base, was not seriously injured and taken to
MacDill Air Force Base Hospital for observation.
   Crews from Homestead were dispatched to the crash site after the
mishap, which occurred about 10 a.m., Rowland said. He added that
there was no preliminary indication of what caused the $13.9 million
jet to go down.
   An accident board will investigate the accident, the spokesman
said.

<TEXT>
   The shooting death of a couple a few
feet from their adoptive baby's crib has meant a second chance for
the 18-year-old biological mother, who said Wednesday she is ready
now to raise the child.
   Tracy Medeiros successfully fought to regain custody of Travis,
the son she gave up at birth nine months ago.
   As she prepared him for a trip home to Massachusetts, she met
Wednesday with social service workers, attended a parenting class
here and talked with a child psychologist.
   ``Now I know I'm ready. I've grown up a lot,'' said Medeiros.
   ``She's a gutsy little kid. She's young and that's the big thing
against her,'' said her attorney, Barbara Rohan. ``She's determined
to do it. She's really determined.''
   Pregnant at 17, Medeiros decided to give up the baby after her
boyfriend left her. A former boyfriend introduced Medeiros to his
cousin Tasia Stephens and her husband, William, of Novato.
   Married for 15 years and owners of successful hair salons and
video stores, Tasia, 43, and William, 45, wanted desperately to
adopt a baby.
   The young mother-to-be and the Stephenses grew close. Medeiros
stayed at a home for teen-age mothers in nearby Santa Rosa during
her pregnancy. She and the couple chose the baby's name together and
the couple was present at his birth.
   The Stephenses paid her medical and travel expenses, and kept the
baby even though the formal adoption process was delayed by a
backlog of cases. Medeiros planned to visit the baby and the
Stephenses during the yearend holidays.
   Then Novato police called her in Massachusetts to say the
Stephenses had been found shot to death in their bed Dec. 14.
Travis, hungry but unharmed, was found in his crib, where he had
been unattended for at least 24 hours, authorities estimated.
   Suddenly, Medeiros said, the safe, secure future she arranged for
her son was uncertain.
   ``My world was totally crushed,'' she said. ``I thought, `What am
I going to do with the baby?' I thought, `I love him, I want him to
be with me.'''
   A Marin County judge placed the baby in a foster home, and
Medeiros petitioned for custody. Relatives of the Stephenses argued
that returning Travis to his biological mother wasn't in his best
interest.
   On Tuesday, Superior Court Juvenile Commissioner Sylvia Shapiro
ruled the adoption wasn't final and Medeiros was still the baby's
legal parent. The custody agreement requires Medeiros to take
parenting classes and make monthly reports about the child's welfare
so the case can be reviewed in six months.
   As Medeiros prepared for the trip home, the Stephenses'
housekeeper and her boyfriend, Yolanda Segura and Zohelin Diaz, both
25-year-old Guatamalans, were arraigned on charges of murder. Police
said they know of no motives.
   Rohan said experts believe Travis was old enough at the time of
the slayings ``to be real affected by what happened to him,'' so
meetings with a child psychologist can help Medeiros detect signs of
emotional problems.
   Medeiros lives with her mother in Bellerica, Mass., and works at
a state institution for the retarded. She has arranged full-time
child care so she can continue working.
   ``At the time of the adoption, I was doing what I thought was
best for him. Now I'm doing what's best for him again,'' Medeiros
said, adding that she was so scared during the hearing that she
didn't speak.
   ``I never really wanted to give him up in the first place,'' she
said.
   Rohan said Medeiros at first was frightened by the new situation,
by the prospect of failure and by media attention, but the lawyer
said she detected a growing closeness between mother and child.
   ``He's a sweet, friendly little baby. He really is. He's
obviously been very loved,'' Rohan said. ``I think he's starting to
get to know her.''
   Sebastopol attorney Allison Pharis, who handled the adoption,
said Medeiros will ``be your basic hard-working, single mother
trying to make it.'' The Stephenses' relatives now want an amicable
relationship with her, she said.

   The losing side in a bitter contest among
Democrats for state Senate majority leader on Wednesday stripped the
winner of most of his powers, with the help of the small Republican
minority.
   Nineteen supporters of Sen. John J. Bevilacqua joined seven of
the chamber's nine Republicans to take charge on the second day of
the 1989 session.
   Sen. David R. Carlin Jr., who defeated Bevilacqua for the
majority leadership by a 22-19 vote of Senate Democrats in November,
was stripped of most of his formal powers, including the right to
name committee chairmen and control the flow of business on the
floor.
   The Bevilacqua forces elected their own slate of committee
chairmen, but agreed to accommodate some requests from Carlin
backers for particular committee assignments. Bevilacqua retained
his position as Judiciary Committee chairman.
   The Republicans, who have been badly outnumbered in the Rhode
Island Senate for most of the past 50 years, won the right for the
minority leader to unilaterally force bills to a vote.
   ``We did what we had to do,'' said Minority Whip Ann H. Hanson.
``Look at this as a political coup. That's what it was. We didn't
ask for it. It came to us.''
   Carlin and Bevilacqua avidly sought the support of the
Republicans, who held the votes necessary to give one side or the
other a majority of the Senate's 50 members. The major changes
Wednesday were adopted 26-24.
   Both sides offered similar concessions, but Hanson said
Bevilacqua's offer was earlier and more specific.
   In an occasionally heated debate, Carlin's supporters charged
Bevilacqua was seeking revenge for the nasty tone of the campaign
for the majority leadership.
   ``He didn't deserve to win and he doesn't know how to lose,''
charged Sen. William C. O'Neill.
   Bevilacqua said after the debate that he would seek peace with
Carlin, but would also ask to be included in some of the majority
leader's traditional prerogatives, such as representing the Senate
in budget negotiations with the House and the governor.
   ``We will not interfere or create roadblocks,'' Bevilacqua said.
``The people's business comes first.''
   Carlin would not comment on Bevilacqua's demand but said the
Senate as a whole would be weakened by the conflict.
   ``Instead of one voice who can speak effectively for the Senate,
we now have three factions,'' he said.
   Bevilacqua and Republican leaders said they did not plan to
continue their alliance by working together on legislation. ``This
is not a marriage. This is a long weekend at the very most,'' Hanson
said.

   A military hearing was held Wednesday
for an officer facing charges stemming from the death of a Marine
who was left in a California desert at the end of a military
exercise.
   The Article 32 hearing, the equivalent of a civilian grand jury
hearing, recessed indefinitely after hearing testimony against 1st
Lt. Allen Lawson, who is is charged with disobeying a lawful order
of a logistics officer, Capt. Donald Edwards.
   Lawson allegedly failed to give Edwards a copy of a roster of
Marines on checkpoint duty, including Lance Cpl. Jason Rother,
before the roster was posted.
   Rother, a road guide, disappeared Aug. 30 in the Mojave Desert
after a combined arms exercise at the Marine base at Twentynine
Palms, Calif. He was reported missing the next day, and his skeletal
remains were found Dec. 4.
   Two other officers face courts-martial in the case.
   The Article 32 hearing officer will review the evidence presented
Wednesday and determine if Lawson faces court-martial,
administrative action or if charges will be dropped.
   During the Wednesday hearing, additional charges of drunken
driving and drunkenness were brought against Lawson stemming from a
Dec. 23 incident in Jacksonville. He also was charged with driving
with a revoked license and with an open malt beverage container in
his vehicle.
   Lawson was earlier accused of willful disobedience of an order to
post road guides in pairs and dereliction of duty. Those charges are
pending.
   Sgt. Christopher P. Clyde, Rother's platoon sergeant, will be
tried by a special court-martial starting Jan. 10, according to Maj.
Stuart Wagner, director of Lejeune's Joint Public Affairs Office.
   Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying a lawful
order of the company commander, Capt. Michael Henderson, not to
allow anyone special liberty without prior approval of the battalion
commander.
   That allegation involves special liberty allegedly granted by
Clyde to Sgt. Thomas B. Turnell, Rother's squad leader.
   Turnell's special court-martial is scheduled to start Jan. 24. He
is accused of dereliction of duty and unauthorized absence.

   President George Sokomanu was ordered
held for another week on Wednesday after impeachment proceedings
against him were postponed by a cyclone, diplomats and news reports
said.
   Sokomanu, president of the South Pacific island chain since 1980,
is charged with inciting mutiny after his aborted attempt Dec. 21 to
overthrow the elected government of Prime Minister Walter Lini.
   The charge carries a maximum of life imprisonment.
   Sokomanu was ordered held without bail until his next appearance
before the Supreme Court on Jan. 13, Radio Vanuatu said. Five rebel
politicians involved in the failed coup also were ordered held for
nine more days, the state-run radio said.
   Radio Vanuatu said 50 supporters of the group filled the court
building.
   Diplomats and news reports said impeachment proceedings against
Sokomanu were delayed because of a cyclone that battered nearby New
Caledonia the day before, causing two deaths.
   The reports said some members of the Electoral College were
unable to reach the capital because of heavy seas and torrential
rain. Under Vanuatu's constitution, three quarters of the college,
which includes members of parliament and the heads of 11 local
government councils, are required to form a quorum.
   The Electoral College is expected to meet Tuesday and formalize
moves to dismiss the president from his mainly ceremonial post, the
diplomats said on condition of anonimity.
   The five politicians include the president's nepher, Barak Sope,
whom Sokomanu tried to install as prime minister. Sope and Lini have
been locked in a leadership struggle for the past year.
   Lini has governed the former Anglo-French New Hebrides since
independence in 1980.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
a visiting Iranian delegation on Wednesday that the Soviet Union
will soon permit free practice of religion, Tehran broadcast
reported.
   It said he made the comment at a meeting in Moscow with Iranians
who gave him a message from Iran's revolutionary patriarch,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, did not elaborate.
   It did not disclose the contents of the message to Gorbachev but
quoted Ayatollah Javadi Amoli, Khomeini's special envoy and the
delegation leader, as saying that ``Khomeini is a religious leader,
and his message is in accordance with his status.''
   The television also quoted Ahmed Khomeini, son of the ayatollah,
as saying the message praised Gorbachev's bold initiatives and
realistic handling of world politics.
   An excerpt from the letter read: ``It is clear to everyone that
from now on communism will be found only in the books about
political history,'' the television quoted the younger Khomeini as
saying.
   The message discussed the Moslem religion at length and urged
Gorbachev to seriously think about and explore Islam, the television
reported the patriarch's son as saying.

   The action follows similar announcements by Pepperidge Farm Inc.
and other manufacturers, who were prodded by a group called National
Heart Savers.
   In addition to removing tropical oils and lard from its products,
Keebler said it would begin listing nutritional values on packages
of its products.
   Tropical oils, made with products like coconut or palm kernels,
and lard are high in saturated fats, which can be converted by the
body into artery-blocking cholesterol.
   ``We're extremely proud to respond to consumer concerns about
these ingredients by replacing them with more healthful oils,'' said
Thomas M. Garvin, Keebler president and chief executive officer.
   Keebler said its products refashioned with vegetable oils, which
are lower in saturated fat, should begin appearing on store shelves
in March.
   By the end of 1989, no Keebler product will contain tropical oil,
lard or beef fat, said Stuart Greenblatt, a Keebler spokesman.
   Greenblatt said reformulating the food products would not affect
consumer prices.
   Last week, Pepperidge Farm Inc. promised to remove tropical oils
from its products, including its popular ``Original Goldfish''
crackers, due to consumer health concerns.
   Kellog Co. announced Dec. 12 that it had stopped using tropical
oils in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal. Sunshine Biscuits Inc.
announced Nov. 16 that it would remove palm oil and palm kernel from
cookie and cracker products.
   Phil Sokolof, founder of National Heart Savers, says tropical
oils have been popular among food manufacturers because they help
extend the shelf life of food products.
   The 65-year-old Nebraska multimillionaire placed advertisements
in newspapers in October criticizing manufacturers for advertising
specific products as healthy or cholesterol-free when they are
``poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats.
   Cholesterol is a form of fat, contained in many foods, that is
deposited in artery linings. Doctors have said oils high in
saturated fat cause the body to produce more cholesterol than it
needs, resulting in blockages and hardening of the arteries and
increased risk of heart disease.
   Keebler, headquartered in this western Chicago suburb, employs
more than 8,000 people nationwide and said its annual sales measure
more than $1 billion.

   Gunmen abducted two American missionaries
during a religious service and shouted slogans for the release of a
Colombia drug kingpin serving a life prison term in the United
States, police and a church spokesman said Wednesday.
   The gunmen on Tuesday night seized pastors Roy Libby and Ricardo
Grover in the town of La Florida and demanded freedom for Carlos
Ledher Rivas, a leader of the Medellin drug cartel, said police in
the southwest state of Cauca.
   In July last year, Lehder Rivas was sentenced in Jacksonville,
Fla., to 135 years in prison and fined $350,000 for smuggling tons
of cocaine into the United States.
   Hector Pardo, director of the Evangelical Federation of Colombia,
said in the capital, Bogota, that the gunmen initially seized three
pastors, including Noemias Salazar, a Colombian they later released.
   Libby worked in Bogota and has been in Colombia for 20 years.
Grover has lived in the country for 10 years, most recently in
Medellin, the second-largest city in Colombia. Their ages and U.S.
hometowns were not available.
   Pardo said the incident in La Florida, 180 miles southwest of
Bogota, took place during a religious service but did not specify
where it took place.
   He said the kidnappers also shouted slogans against the
extradition of Ledher Rivas, who was arrested and sent to the United
States in 1987 after a gun battle at his mansion in Medellin.

<HEAD>Carlucci Spells Out Terms for U.S. Military Aid To Argentina</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued U.S. military aid
depends on the the Argentine armed forces continuing to accept
civilian rule, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told the
defense chief.
   A brief letter, dated Dec. 22, was sent to Defense Minister Jose
Horacio Jaunarena and was published Wednesday by the newspaper La
Nacion. A spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the details.
   The letter came three weeks after the third military uprising in
20 months against the government of President Raul Alfonsin.
Translated from Spanish to English, it said in part:
   ``The recent military unrest in Argentina and the potential
threat that this type of development creates for democratic
stability and civilian control are a cause of concern.
   ``We should be proud that with the return to democracy we have
made notable progress in re-establishing a relationship of security
that reflects our common interest in defending Western values within
the framework of a government that is democratic and constitutional.
   ``Our capacity to maintain a bipartisian political consensus and
continue in this direction depends on the continuation of this form
of government in Argentina.''
   As requested by Carlucci, Januarena read the letter aloud to new
army chief Gen. Francisco Gassino, the heads of the navy and air
force, and other top officials, La Nacion reported.
   Jaunarena has met several times with Carlucci, first in
Carlucci's capacity as head of the National Security Council, then
as defense secretary. Former Sen. John Tower will replace Carlucci
in the Bush administration.
   Jaunarena visited Washington at Carlucci's invitation last
October, and the two reviewed performance tests by Argentina's Pampa
jet trainer that the U.S. Air Force is considering buying.
   Jaunarena also presented his army's request for help in making
serviceable 250 U.S.-made armored personnel transport vehicles and
20 helicopters. The navy and air force have similar requests pending.
   U.S.-Argentine relations have undergone chills and thaws since
the 1970s.
   President Jimmy Carter cut off military aid to protest the
``dirty war'' waged by the 1976-83 military regime in its brutal
crackdown aimed at subversives.
   President Reagan supported Britain during the 74-day Falklands
War in 1982. The conflict, which Argentina lost, was touched off by
Argentina's invasion of the South Atlantic islands it claims and was
trying to recover after 150 years of British sovereignty.
   Relations between Washington and Buenos Aires improved markedly
after Alfonsin's election in October 1983 ended military rule.
   One demand made by insurrection leader Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin
was for a bigger military budget, though the key demand was ending
the prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during
the crackdown on urban terrorism.

   A gunman killed a Saudi Arabian diplomat
as he walked back home in downtown Bangkok, police said Thursday.
   Saleh Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, a third secretary at the Saudi
Arabian Embassy, was killed instantly in the attack at about 2:45
p.m. Wednesday, said Maj. Gen. Veera Visuthakul.
   He was shot three times in the head with a pistol, and eight
empty shells lay near his body, said Veera, commander of the Special
Branch Police.
   Veera had just left the embassy on busy Sathorn Road and was
killed after he turned into a side street that leads to his
apartment building. The embassy and the apartment building are only
a few hundred yards apart.
   Veera quoted witnesses as saying the diplomat and his killer were
seen walking together just before the shooting.
   He said witnesses described the gunman as ``Arab-looking,'' but
no arrests were made and no motive established.
   The diplomat arrived from India last year. His duties included
handling applications from the thousands of Thais who travel to work
in Saudi Arabia each year.

   Palace doctors gave Emperor Hirohito an emergency
blood transfusion early Thursday morning after his blood pressure
dropped sharply, palace officials said.
   Palace doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor 0.86 pint of blood
after his systolic blood pressure fell to about 60, Kenji Maeda,
spokesman for the Imperial Palace Agency, said in a regular morning
news conference.
   An average person has a systolic blood pressure of about 120.
   With the latest transfusion, Hirohito has received 66.97 pints of
blood since he fell ill in September.
   Maeda said doctors found no traces of blood discharge to indicate
internal hemorrhaging. On Wednesday, palace physicians used a nasal
tube to extract blood that had accumulated in Hirohito's stomach.
   Hirohito has discharged blood intermittently since Sept. 19, when
he vomited a substantial amount of blood. Doctors have said they
believe the bleeding originated in the upper intestinal region,
where a bypass operation was performed in September 1987.
   On Thursday, Kyodo News Service quoted palace medical sources as
saying that bleeding and low blood pressure have taken their toll on
Hirohito and that blood transfusions were no longer as effective in
checking the hemorrhaging.
   Hirohito has no political power but serves as a symbol of the
unity of Japan.

<TEXT>
   A rookie sheriff's deputy, slain with her own gun
Wednesday at the Dallas County jail, had urged more hands-on
training for county law enforcment officers.
   Deputy Suzanne Kays, 33, was on her second day of work when she
was killed by a man at the Lew Sterrett Justice Center who was
released 24 hours early, apparently due to a clerical error, City
Manager Richard Knight said.
   The suspect, identified as Alfonzo Seward, is thought to have
taken the deputy's gun after decking her with a punch and shot her
several times at point-blank range.
   In a memorandum to the City Council, Knight said Seward had been
released early due to a clerical error, and that the employee
involved has been placed on paid administrative leave pending
further investigation.
   Knight could not be located for comment late Wednesday afternoon.
   The shooting came less than a week after Kays, in evaluating her
training, recommended that county law enforcement officers receive
more hands-on training.
   Kays, in a statement dated Dec. 29, was mildly critical of the
amount of training she received although she praised the quality of
academy instructors and small class size.
   ``The hands-on training and practicals, I feel, are a very
important part of a Peace Officer's training and I feel could have
benefited more with extra time spent on these areas,'' she wrote.
Our class was small, just 6, I really do not feel I could have
benefitted as much as I have, if I had been in a larger class with
less time allowed in some areas.''
   Lt. Jack Watson, commander of the training academy, could not be
reached for comment on Kays' evaluation of the county program, which
is required from all recruits after they complete the more than 600
hours of training that spans 17 weeks.
   The shooting suspect, who was wounded by police gunfire, has been
known to use at least three names and listed his address as a Dallas
rescue mission and a restaurant where he was arrested, police said.
   The suspect _ who has identified himself on previous occasions as
Alfonso Seward, Alfonso Steward and Alfonso Stewart _ had been
released from jail less than eight hours before the slaying, which
occurred shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday.
   The 37-year-old suspect, who has claimed to be both from Oklahoma
and Arkansas, was in serious condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital
with shotgun wounds in his legs and groin.
   He has been charged with capital murder and is being held without
bail. He also is being held for investigation of attempted capital
murder and attempted murder.
   The slaying was the first at a Dallas jail since Jack Ruby shot
accused presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald to death Nov. 24,
1963, in the basement of the Dallas City Jail, authorities said.
Oswald had been arrested two days earlier in the shooting of
President John F. Kennedy.
   Kays, who was single, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and served in
the Army from May 1975 to January 1979. She joined the Sheriff's
Department in December 1981 as a detention service officer.
   Kays was the first Dallas County law enforcement officer to die
in the line of duty since a deputy was killed while investigating a
burglary in 1982. Her death was the first slaying of a law
enforcement officer in Dallas this year.

<HEAD>Castro Plays Down Rift With Soviets, Attacks U.S., U.S. Diplomat
Walks Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro offered a ringing
endorsement of the policies of the Soviet Union on Wednesday night,
seemingly putting to rest suggestions of disagreements in
Soviet-Cuban relations.
   In a speech broadcast live on radio marking the 30th anniversary
of his revolution, Castro also bitterly criticized U.S. policies
toward Libya and other Third World countries, prompting a walkout by
the chief U.S. diplomat in Havana, Jay Taylor.
   Castro spoke for nearly three hours before a crowd of tens of
thousands at the site of a huge new exhibit commemorating the social
and economic achievements of the revolution over the past three
decades.
   In several speeches in recent months, Castro has made clear his
unhappiness with the market-oriented reform policies of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, indicating concern Cuba may have
``difficulties'' as a result.
   But Wednesday night, Castro dismissed Soviet-Cuban differences as
almost inconsequential and he praised the Kremlin's policies on
peace and disarmament and said the two countries also see eye-to-eye
on the problem of international debt.
   He also noted Moscow has been a staunch ally of the Cuban
revolution during times of relative tranquillity and also when
Castro's experiment has been under threat from the United States.
   ``We support the policies of peace of the Soviet Union,'' Castro
said. He referred specifically to Gorbachev's efforts to reduce the
risks of nuclear war.
   Castro criticized a threat by the Reagan administration to
destroy a chemical weapons plant it claims Libya has built.
   Castro said the United States has the most powerful chemical
weapons arsenal in the world and he asked, ``Why should it deny that
right to others?''
   Shortly afterwards, Taylor walked out of the ceremony in apparent
protest over Castro's remarks.
   Castro made no direct reference to the incident Wednesday in
which U.S. fighter planes downed two Libyan warplanes off the Libyan
coast.
   Castro was interrupted a number of times by applause from the
huge crowd, which gathered in late afternoon in an area adjacent to
exhibition highlighting the achievements of the revolution that
toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista on Jan. 1, 1959.
   The exhibition in south Havana near Lenin Park includes about 45
outdoor exhibits portraying Cuban advances in such fields as nuclear
energy, agriculture and other endeavors.
   Castro made an appearance Jan. 1 in the east coast city of
Santiago, which he regards as the cradle of the revolution because
of its progressive heritage.
   Many of those attending took part in the work brigades which
constructed the exhibit, known as ExpoCuba.
   Among the dignitaries sharing the platform with Castro were
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, Namibian rebel leader Sam Nujoma
and Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Milos Jakes.

   President Reagan has decided to accept the
Soviet Union's proposal for hosting an international conference on
human rights in 1991, sources said.
   U.S. agreement to participate in the conference signals American
support for Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's internal reforms
and sets the stage for the opening of new East-West negotiations on
cutting troops and arms in Europe.
   The human rights conference and the European arms negotiations
are linked, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz has recommended
they proceed based on Soviet advances in human rights, a U.S.
official told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   President Reagan, on vacation in California, decided Tuesday to
accept Shultz's advice, said another official, who also spoke on

   Gov. Michael Dukakis says his decision to forgo a
chance for a record fourth term has nothing to do with his prospects
in national politics, but admitted it's ``exceedingly difficult'' to
run for president as governor.
   With two years remaining in his term, Dukakis unexpectedly
announced Tuesday he would not seek re-election in 1990. He parried
questions about his political future, however, saying only he
intended to be active in national affairs and would not rule out
another run for the White House.
   ``Public policy and public service is what I'm all about, it's
what I love,'' Dukakis, 55, told a crowded news conference.``I've
loved this office, and I still do.''
   The defeated Democratic presidential candidate said his decision
not to seek an unprecedented fourth term as Massachusetts' governor
was not related to the 1988 presidential campaign or to a possible
1992 rematch against President-elect Bush.

   Physicians who treat women are being enlisted
in a nationwide effort to aid battered women and help break a
generational cycle that has caught some American families in a web
of violence.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is
sending information to its 28,000 members to heighten their
awareness of the problem of domestic violence and better enable them
to help abused women.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who joined the group for its
announcement of the campaign Tuesday, said stopping violence against
women is a major part of the effort to end family violence, a cycle
that often begins when someone is the victim of abuse and then grows
up to become an abuser.
   ``It's obvious that if you're going to break that chain ...
you've got to start with child abuse,'' Koop said. ``But you can't
just wait for the three generations to work themselves out. You've
got to take care of the elderly abused and you've got to take care
of the battered women.''

   Japanese companies likely will beat their U.S.
rivals to the market with superconductor products unless government,
industry and universities cooperate in long-range development, a
White House panel says.
   Important profit-making uses for superconductivity are at least a
decade away, but the United States cannot afford to leave them to
chance because the Japanese do not, the advisory group said in its
report to President Reagan on Tuesday.
   Today, Americans are probably ``neck-and-neck'' with the Japanese
in basic scientific research on superconductivity, said Ralph
Gomory, the chairman of the panel and the chief scientist of
International Business Machines Corp.
   ``Everybody's just out of the gate. Ahead or behind doesn't

   Federal prosecutors unleashed a tough new law
in their war on drug-dealing street thugs, hoping to send a repeat
drug offender accused of possessing 150 grams of crack to prison
with no chance of getting out.
   Richard Van Winrow, a 21-year-old reputed gang member, pleaded
innocent Tuesday to three drug-related charges at his arraignment
before U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall.
   ``The new law is being used to target gang members in the hopes
of reducing drug sales and consumption,'' said the prosecutor,
Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Lench. ``There's a hope there
will be an impact on the street-gang drug problem.''
   The charges against Winrow are believed to be the first filed
under the anti-drug law President Reagan signed in November, Ms.
Lench said. The law requires federal judges to impose life sentences
with no hope of parole on defendants convicted of drug trafficking
under certain circumstances.

<HEAD>Tim Dunigan Plays a Different `Davy Crockett'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tim Dunigan was an interested onlooker when
the television series ``Lucas Tanner,'' about a former baseball
player turned teacher, was filmed near his home.
   ``They filmed some of it in Webster Groves, Mo., where I grew
up,'' said Dunigan. ``I was interested because I wanted to be a
baseball player. I never thought about acting.''
   Nevertheless, Dunigan did begin acting, at Webster College in St.
Louis. He soon joined the St. Louis Repertory Co.
   Last year, Dunigan won out over more than 1,000 actors for the
role of the new Davy Crockett in NBC's ``The Magical World of
Disney.'' The role was originated by Fess Parker in the Frontierland
segment of ``Disneyland'' in 1954-55.
   The latest chapter will be seen Sunday, Jan. 15. Crockett, who
saves a young Creek Indian and becomes his guardian spirit, is
caught in a moral dilemma when the Army plans to attack the youth's
village during a sacred ceremony.
   ``My Davy Crockett is certainly different from Fess Parker's,''
Dunigan said during a brief visit in Los Angeles. The show is filmed
in British Columbia.
   ``Fess Parker will always be Davy Crockett to a lot of people. I
don't think people are going to forget him. I know I grew up
watching him. But I think people can watch me and enjoy me as Davy
Crockett, too. Actually, since I was born in 1955, I think of Fess
Parker more as `Daniel Boone' (whom Parker played in the 1960s). The
Davy Crockett I see was more of a Will Rogers of his time. He was a
storyteller who liked to sit around and tell good stories.
   ``I think people want to see the legend. Still, we have to give
it more reality. So there we are out in the woods. We have to tell a
story that both children and adults can enjoy. It's the hardest
thing I've ever done physically.''
   At times, the role has called for Dunigan to run up a mountain
wearing soaking wet leather clothing and carrying a heavy musket.
   Dunigan's Crockett is younger than Parker's, but the major
difference is that in the past 30 years, views regarding Indians,
ethnic minorities and women have changed. The upcoming episode
reflects that change. In the past, it's doubtful that Crockett would
have been sensitive to Indian sacred ceremonies.
   ``He did his share of Indian fighting,'' said Dunigan, ``but
later when he was in Congress he tried to help Indians. I'm out in
the woods. He's a hero. That's the way I play him. He's exciting. He
tells you straight.''
   Dunigan first came to Los Angeles for a pilot called ``Century
City,'' in which he played Richard Kiley's son. ``I'd been doing
musicals and had never been in front of a camera before,'' he said.
``You know what I liked about it? You could do it over again.''
   Dunigan's last show was the syndicated series ``Captain Powers
and the Soldiers of the Future,'' which was also made in Canada. In
1983 he was baby sitter to an orangutan in ``Mr. Smith.'' This
monkey business didn't last very long. On ``Wizards and Warriors,''
he was Prince Dirk Blackpool's incompetent brother, Geoffrey.
   He was also the original Templeton ``Face'' Peck in ``The
A-Team.'' He appeared in the pilot, but was replaced by Dirk
Benedict in the long-running series.
   ``They said I was too young and too tall,'' said Dunigan, who's
6-foot-5. ``I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was
difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended
when I was a sophomore in high school. It took me a while to get
over it. I kept saying, `What did I do wrong?' The producer, Stephen
Cannell, said I didn't do anything wrong, but I still felt it was my
fault. George Peppard called to cheer me up. He said he had been
replaced in `Dynasty' as the original Blake Carrington.''
   Dunigan was filling in for a week or so as Skip on the soap opera
``The Young and the Restless'' when he auditioned for Davy Crockett.
   ``I replaced the actor playing Skip when he went into the
hospital,'' he said. ``I didn't know the character. I'd have to
drive out to the Disney Ranch for Davy Crockett. Then I'd drive to
CBS Television City for the soap. I never knew which accent to do.''

   The Lutheran Church in East Germany
is under increasing pressure from the nation's communist government
to curb its support of human rights efforts and to disavow would-be
emigres.
   ``The government at the moment appears to view all our efforts
toward dialogue as destructive,'' Bishop Werner Leich, who heads the
nation's Lutheran Church Conference, told The Associated Press in a
recent interview.
   At a series of conferences last year, church leaders have called
for dialogue with government officials on a variety of topics,
including human rights issues, implementation of Soviet-style
political reforms, education policies and alternative military
service.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, has been a frequent theme, and church leaders have
criticized the nation's conservative leadership for rejecting
outright the need for such a reform course.
   Church calls for change, including a loosening of the nation's
tough foreign travel and emigration policies, have been rebuffed by
the government, which has seized or censored several church
publications in recent months.
   Human rights activists loosely allied with the church have been
detained and questioned. Would-be emigres _ some of whom turned to

   have been imprisoned. Others have lost their
jobs.
   Scores have been warned not to participate in silent vigils
staged in front of churches to protest government decisions denying
them exit visas.
   A church-sponsored international youth congress was also banned
in November. State-run news media said the conference's proposed
themes _ peace issues and discussions about reforms in the Soviet
Union _ could have ``threatened church-state relations.''
   The Communist Party's chief ideologues have charged that the
church has overstepped its bounds and have cautioned it to stick to
religious issues and stay out of politics.
   About 80 percent of the population is Lutheran.
   ``The East German Communist Party has traditionally been
orthodox, intolerant and inflexible,'' says a Western diplomatic
source. ``In regard to its (present) behavior toward the Lutheran
Church, it's certainlyliving up to that tradition.''
   Bishop Leich said the government's reaction to the church's
efforts to discuss social and political problems has been needlessly
harsh and that its refusal to discuss problems has led to a certain
resignation among East Germans.
   ``I have the impression that in many instances the political
leadership is no longer in touch with reality,'' Leich said.
   Leich ran afoul of the communist leadership when he declared
recently that socialism in East Germany should show a more human
face, in a reference to a term used to describe short-lived reforms
in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   The church has traditionally sought to work together with the
state in resolving problems from within, its willingness to
compromise summed up in agreements with the state that defined the
role of the ``church in socialism.''
   That view guided largely conformative church policy during the
difficult decades of reconstruction after World War II.
   But Leich said times have changed.
   ``Discussion has now become more important than simply following
orders,'' Leich said.
   ``We have always believed that our church has the task and
responsibility of helping to determine and to shape our society and
our nation. To do that, one must speak openly and critically.''
   But over the past year, the church has found itself increasingly
at odds with the government over the issue of ``ausreisewillige,'' _
or those who want to leave the country.
   Growing dissatisfaction over economic and political conditions
has led to a record number of applications from East Germans who
want to leave the country for neighboring capitalist West Germany.
   According to estimates by the West German government and human
rights groups, more than 750,000 people have filed applications to
leave East Germany.
   Counting family members, the total amounts to 1.5 million of the
nation's 16 million population.
   In keeping with its position to change the system from within,
church leaders have been careful not to encourage East Germans to
leave the country, arguing instead for patience and renewed
commitment to the community.
   ``We try to give people strength, but it's hard, very hard,''
said a Lutheran pastor, whose congregation in a small town outside
Dresden has dwindled over the years as more an more families have
left for the West.
   ``You can't hold a community together with people who already
have one foot in the federal republic (West Germany),'' said the
pastor, who asked that his name not be used.
   At a church conference earlier this year, participants urged the
government to loosen its travel and emigration restrictions, saying
``we'll want to stay, once we're allowed to leave.''

   The American Baptist Churches have decided to
maintain their historic ecumenical ties, but also to initiate a new
one.
   The denomination's general board voted to reaffirm membership in
the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, but
also to become an official observer in the National Association of
Evangelicals.
   The 1.6 million-member denomination had not previously been
linked to the NAE, a conservative evangelical body which does not
permit full membership to churches belonging to the NCC or WCC.
   Some American Baptists had sought withdrawal from the NCC and WCC.
   Paul Nichols of Richmond, Va., characterized the compromise
decision as ``conciliar, broad, inclusive _ an appropriate stance
for our denomination.''
   The decision culminated four years of monitoring and critiquing
the NCC and WCC.

   The first year of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America, established at the start of 1988 through merger of three
Lutheran bodies, has ``been a good year,'' says its chief executive,
Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom.
   It hasn't been ``an easy year, but a good one,'' he said. ``We
have had to make some painful adjustments in 1988 as dreams have
been fitted to reality. But we will make it. And we will make it in
good stable condition if all of us at the congregational level put

   Some evangelicals in a mainline denomination _
the United Church of Christ _ say they are starting their own
missions work because the denomination isn't doing enough to win new
believers.
   Barbara Weller, assistant director of Biblical Witness
Fellowship, says it decided to create a special missions committee
after research indicated extensive disenchantment with the church's
official missions work.
   Denominational officials said the move could hurt the church's
missions efforts.
   The action was similar to that of conservatives in the United
Methodist Church, which five years ago formed an unofficial separate
mission society to send missionaries abroad.

   Among all the New Year's resolutions that can be
made and broken, few carry a more ominous burden than the simple
``This year I'm going to get organized.''
   Even in a household of modest means, the paperwork pile can
easily get out of control _ bills, pay stubs, bank statements,
canceled checks and too many others to mention.
   At the start of a new year, the flow reaches flood stage with
W-2s, 1099s and the other trappings of income taxes.
   Most people don't have many alternatives to coping with this
problem, whether their filing system reposes in a single desk drawer
or a sophisticated computer program.
   You can pass along the burden of filling out your tax forms to
some trusted friend or paid preparer. But there is no way to dodge
the legal responsibility of being able to document where you stand
with Uncle Sam.
   ``The burden of proof for the accuracy of your return is directly
on you _ not your accountant, tax adviser or tax preparer,'' notes
the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in its ``Tax Guide and
Planner'' for 1989.
   Tax laws passed in recent years have only served to increase the
emphasis on record-keeping.
   These days, if you inadvertently fail to report the interest
earned on some small, forgotten bank account, the Internal Revenue
Service can quickly catch the omission.
   Then, it can demand not only tax payment for the neglected amount
but interest on the balance due and maybe penalties as well.
   Once you get your records in order, of course, there's the
continuing challenge of keeping them organized. What to do, say,
with that file marked ``Checking Account _ 1979''?
   The IRS usually has three years from the filing deadline to audit
an individual income tax return. The limit is six years if your
income is underreported by more than 25 percent.
   And there is no statute of limitations in cases where anyone has
filed a fraudulent return or no return at all.
   Let's suppose you are reasonably confident you reported all your
1979 income and didn't commit any kind of deceit in doing so. The
deadline has passed for auditing your '79 return, so you can go
ahead and throw that folder away...
   But WAIT! Does it contain receipts for improvements you made to
your house? Statements from a mutual fund in which you still have an
investment? Documents showing non-deductible contributions to a
retirement savings plan?
   Things like these could have an important bearing on the taxes
you might owe in some future year. Their rightful place is in a
``permanent'' set of records independent of year-by-year files.
   ``In general,'' Arthur Andersen's advisers conclude, ``when
you're in doubt about the importance of any record, keep it.''
   If all this makes you feel like an unpaid clerk-secretary in
thrall to the government, don't despair. Good records can have other
purposes and benefits.
   In the course of compiling and maintaining them, you can keep
yourself and your loved ones informed about where you stand
financially _ how you are progressing toward some goal, or just
``where does all the money go?''
   Records may also be vital to the orderly disposition of your
affairs should you die or become disabled.
   ``What would happen if someone needed to understand your affairs
but couldn't discuss them with you?'' Arthur Andersen observes.
   ``That day will unavoidably come, which is a powerful argument
for maintaining clear, accurate, accessible records of your tax and
financial life.''

<TEXT>
   How do you keep the kids down on
the farm after they've seen the big bucks and high life? In West
Germany, as in many other places, you usually don't.
   This is Europe's richest country and its living standard is among
the highest in the world. The family farm has a tough time holding
its own in such an atmosphere.
   When West Germany was born in 1949 it had 1,646,751 farms, but
that has changed dramatically.
   ``By the end of 1987 there were only 382,800 farms still
operating full time, with another 280,200 part-time farmers who held
other jobs,'' said Peter Neuling, an Agriculture Ministry
statistician.
   West Germany is heavily industrialized and densely populated,
with nearly 62 million people living in an area about the size of
Oregan. The average farm is just under 70 acres and a part-time
farmer generally works less than 15 acres, Neuling said in a
telephone interview.
   Farms are closing because industry is flourishing, Neuling said,
and that ``is a sign our economy is strong.'' But Alfred Kunze, 64,
and other farmers say the trend is killing a tradition important to
national self-sufficiency.
   ``We're not going to have anyone following in our footsteps;
there won't be any experienced young to take over,'' Kunze said at
his home in Auringen, about 35 miles west of Frankfurt.
   He acknowledged farming had become risky because of
overproduction throughout Europe. Kunze said his 36-year-old son
Hubert ``wanted to be a farmer but I told him to study another
business just in case.''
   Hubert Kunze now is a computer specialist and normally works an
eight-hour day. His father observed wryly: ``Farmers can't count on
eight-hour days.''
   As a member of the European Economic Community, West Germany must
import farm products from other members to help balance the
industrial goods it exports to them.
   That shrinks markets and prices for West German farmers, said
Alfred Kunze, who runs a 3,500-tree fruit farm in central Hesse
state.
   Taxes to support health, retirement, unemployment and other
social benefits also make farming more difficult here than in other
West European nations where labor and overhead are cheaper.
   As costs rose, West German farmers tried to close the gap with
increased crop yields and animal feed containing hormones, Kunze
said.
   He said use of new fertilizers had doubled grain production since
World War II and cited the example of wheat, which went from an
average of about 30 bushels an acre to more than 50.
   ``To speed up the growth of calves raised to produce
light-colored meat for veal, which the customers demand, the animals
were fed milk-base products spiked with hormones,'' Kunze said.
   Now, however, environmentalists complain that chemical
fertilizers pollute waterways and regulations forbid the use of
hormones in animal feed.
   In an attempt to cut production, the government is paying farmers
about $250 an acre to take land out of cultivation. More than 25,000
farmers have submitted applications let roughly 425,000 acres lie
fallow in the 1988-1989 growing season.
   ``This is going to turn German farmland into fruitless plains,''
said Klara Schecke, 60, whose family operates a dairy farm with 70
head of cattle near Bad Orb, 25 miles east of Frankfurt.
   Hiring help is difficult, even though 8.1 percent of West Germans
were unemployed at the end of November. Mrs. Schecke said it was
almost impossible to find a young person willing to learn farming as
an apprentice.
   An advertisement in Hessebauer, the Hesse state weekly farm
magazine, accomplished nothing, she said.
   ``In the latest edition there were 12 advertisments seeking
apprentices, Mrs. Schecke told an interviewer. ``We checked, there
hasn't been a single response. The young see absolutely no future in
farming anymore.''
   Manfred Mannel, a 32-year-old farmer from Schenklengsfeld, 70
miles northeast of Frankfurt, said much the same: ``We've advertised
since last year to hire someone to help. It's hopeless.''
   Eberhard Mann, spokesman for the Federal Labor Office, said
unemployment among people under 20 was 5.1 percent in November, but
``they're not interested in farming because it's a shrinking
business.''

   Three graduates of Cambridge University in
England were among the signers of the American Declaration of
Independence. There wasn't even one from Oxford University.
   Score that Cambridge 3, Oxford 0, says Mark Kaplanoff, an
American lecturer in history at Cambridge.
   Ancient history, scoffs Henry Drucker of Oxford. ``Five current
members of the U.S. Senate are Oxford men. Score that 5-to-3 for
Oxford.''
   Whatever the final score, the 780-year-old rivalry between
England's two premier seats of learning has spilled across the
Atlantic, indeed has gone global.
   And now the contest is taking a new form: fundraising.
   A Yank at Oxford, Drucker is not only a booster. He is also the
university's fundraiser. Appointed in 1987, he is the first person
to hold such a post since the founding of Britain's oldest
university 800 years ago.
   Cambridge set up a fundraising office in 1988.
   The fact is that both institutions are a bit low on endowments.
And so the two queens of Britain's 45-university chessboard are
starting to do what 3,000 American colleges and universities have
been doing with vigor for generations: hit their alumni and any
other likely prospects for donations.
   All Britain's universities are reacting to a squeeze for funds
under the pennypinching government of Oxford alumna Margaret
Thatcher.
   In 1981, Oxford _ which traditionally honored the 24 British
prime ministers it has produced thus far _ expressed its academic
displeasure with Mrs. Thatcher by denying her an honorary degree.
   Last October, Oxford Vice Chancellor Sir Patrick Neill,
complaining that the university has more than 100 academic posts
vacant for lack of money, launched a worldwide Campaign for Oxford.
Its goal is to raise 220 million pounds, or $395 million, in five
years.
   Cambridge, not in such dire straits, is working on a Cambridge
2000 Plan for the 21st century.
   ``We are plowing a quieter furrow, our needs are less
desperate,'' said William Squire of Cambridge in a telephone
interview. Squire became Cambridge's first development director
since 1200 A.D. in 1988.
   ``Both universities were encouraged for 60 years to depend on the
British government for more than half their funds,'' said Stephen
Bragg, who heads the Cambridge office of the American Friends of
Cambridge University, a group of U.S. alumni who, unasked, have
raised $12 million for their alma mater since 1966.
   ``Under the state-funded regime both developed greatly the range
of their teaching and research. Cambridge lists the discovery of
DNA, the development of radio-astronomy and pioneering work in
superconductivity as examples of speculative research which paid
off,'' Bragg said.
   ``But he who pays the piper calls the tune,'' he added, ``and
British universities are learning that in allowing government
subsidy for teaching and research to rise to more than 50 percent of
their total income, much of their freedom has been lost.''
   So the race is on to raise private donations around the world and
achieve the sort of independence that comes, for example, from
Harvard University's $4-billion endowment. By comparison, Oxford's
endowment is equivalent to $14.4 million.
   British universities' fundraising techniques look a little rusty
from disuse. One of Drucker's first discoveries on taking office at
Oxford was that the university did not even have an alumni roster.
   Jeanne Sigler of Jeanne Sigler Associates, a New York-based firm
specializing in nonprofit fundraising, noted, ``The alumni list is
the lifeblood of the American university. ... English attitudes have
traditionally differed.''
   Cambridge did have a list of worldwide graduates, including its
60 Nobel prizewinners (Oxford's Nobelist score, by the way, is 24).
But no addresses.
   So how many Cambridge grads are out there?
   ``About 100,000 to 120,000,'' said Squire, ``depending on the
mortality tables you use. We will be trying to reach them all.''
   With a one-year headstart, Drucker, the son of a department store
owner in Rutherford, N.J., is already reaching Oxford alumni with
the efficiency of a Yankee trader.
   ``We now have a mailing list of 120,000 graduates around the
globe,'' he said. ``That's more listings than the city of Oxford's
phone book. We expect to have 140,000 by 1989, including 8,000 in
the United States.''
   Cambridge has about 5,000 American graduates, who set up the
American Friends group.
   ``We now have similar organizations in Japan, Singapore and other
places,'' said Squire. ``We have students from 91 countries.''
   Drucker has two people working for him in the United States;
Squire doesn't have any yet. That compares with Columbia
University's fundraising staff of 150 and Princeton's 200.
   Both Oxford and Cambridge have already successfully tapped
international corporations for major funding. At Oxford, Squibb
Corp. of the United States has contributed $36 million to set up a
pharmacological research laboratory, while Monsanto Corp. and G.D.
Searle and Co. are giving $10.8 million for a biological institute.
   Cambridge has raised funds from Japan and the United States to
back new professorships. U.S.-based SmithKline Beckman Corp. has
donated $1.8 million for research on AIDS at Cambridge's School of
Clinical Medicine.
   ``For 700 years we successfully raised funds in England,'' said
Squire, ``and after two generations of government subsidies we are
now going back to our roots.''
   ``But it's not only money,'' he said during a visit to New York
that he insisted was not a fundraising trip. ``You have those three
Cambridge men who signed the American Declaration of Independence.
At this time, exhibits from Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum are
beginning a yearlong tour of American cities. It's a matter of
shared heritage and values over the centuries.
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``as you know, John Harvard was a
Cambridge man.'' Chalk up the founder of Harvard University as one
more point for Cambridge.
   Ancient history again, said Drucker, adding that Oxford ``is the
alma mater of the scholars who currently head New York University,
Georgetown University, the University of Pittsburgh, Mount Holyoke,
Pomona and Johns Hopkins.''
   Chalk up a few more points for Oxford.

   Elsie May Ashford hadn't seen her brother in 81
years _ not since she was sent as a toddler to live with her uncle.
A few weeks ago the Salvation Army reunited them.
   Tracing missing persons is just one of an array of social
services the church-in-uniform has taken on in a history of good
works that began with a soup kitchen in London's squalid East End in
1866.
   The organization and its social-evangelical work has since spread
to countries around the world.
   Although its image is still defined by its military uniforms,
brass bands and bell jingling at collection pots, the
2.5-million-member Army tries to adapt to the times.
   Recent innovations include budgeting advice for credit card
junkies, and free electronic telephone cards for down-and-outs and
runaways to phone home.
   The missing persons bureau handles 5,000 cases a year and claims
a 70-percent success rate.
   After 83-year-old Mrs. Ashford's son wrote in for help, it took
Maj. Colin Fairclough and his 24 assistants just two weeks to trace
William Pring, 85, who was living about 150 miles away.
   But the missing persons bureau won't handle cases where one of
the parties seeks a divorce.
   Although the Army regards itself first and foremost as a church,
its reputation rests heavily on its social work.
   ``Through our social work we are seen as being prepared to go
where other people are perhaps not quite prepared to go,'' says
Commissioner Harry Read, who directs evangelical work in Britain.
   ``We're the world's largest volunteer organization,'' said
spokesman Capt. Charles King. ``But at the same time, if our social
work was enormously professional but no one was hearing about
Christianity, we would be failing in our first task.''
   William Booth, the builder's son and born-again Christian who
founded the organization in 1865, envisaged an army of soldiers with
military ranks to wage war on Satan with Bibles and compassion.
   Booth, the first ``general,'' never meant to found a church or a
social service. He simply wanted the poor to go to church.
   ``He saw himself as a poor man's Billy Graham,'' but most
churches wouldn't have the smelly new converts and ``whether he
liked it or not, he had a church on this hands,'' said Read in an
interview in his spartan office at the Army's world headquarters
near the Thames River.
   Finding hungry people unreceptive to preaching, Booth opened a
soup kitchen. The first hostel opened in 1888.
   Bodyguards were hired to ward off mocking crowds who would pelt
Army preachers with eggs, fish and rocks. The first group of guards
happened to play musical instruments, so it became the first brass
band.
   The name, Salvation Army, was adopted in 1878, and from the
outset it stressed family, with Booth setting the example. His son
Bramwell succeeded him as general when he died in 1912, and son
Ballington and daughters Emma and Evangeline opened chapters in the
United States.
   The present general is Eva Burrows, an Australian and the first
woman since Evangeline Booth to head the Army.
   Today 60 percent of the soldiers have relatives in the Army.
   The organization has a 50-million-pound ($92 million) budget and
works in 89 countries, running hostels for 30,000 homeless, schools
for 280,000 children, and hospitals and homes for lepers, the blind,
handicapped, suicidal and sick.
   Among British charities, it spends the least on administration
and fund-raising, according to the non-profit Charities Aid
Commission.
   But changing mores and the growth of professional social services
have tended to eclipse some aspects of Salvation Army work.
   Its 25,000 officers haven't increased in number since 1972. It no
longer caters to unwed mothers, because they now more often choose
abortion or motherhood. And roughly one-fifth of its 950 beds in
London remain empty each night.
   Some criticize their hostels as ``institutional'' and object to
the 6.90-pound ($12.60) fee for a bed and breakfast, although the
government reimburses the sum and the truly needy aren't charged.
   ``People find it quite authoritarian,'' said Lorna Reith, a
worker with a small London homeless charity. ``I think it's a way of
forcing their religion on people.''
   The Army strongly denies any element of coercion, but sees a
basic duty to spread the gospel.
   ``We are not first and foremost a social service organization
with a church tagged on,'' said Maj. Colin Hunt, who heads one of
the army's 14,000 corps (churches).
   The Army upholds mainstream Christian beliefs, but eschews such

   Some evangelicals in a mainline denomination _
the United Church of Christ _ say they are starting their own
missions work because the denomination isn't doing enough to win new
believers.
   Barbara Weller, assistant director of Biblical Witness
Fellowship, says it decided to create a special missions committee
after research indicated extensive disenchantment with the church's
official missions work.
   Denominational officials said the move could hurt the church's
missions efforts.
   The action was simimilar to that of conservatives in the United
Methodist Church, which five years ago formed an unofficial separate
mission society to send missionaries abroad.

one.
   The denomination's general board voted to reaffirm membership in
the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, but
also to become an official observer in the National Association of
Evangelicals.
   The 1.6 million-member denomination had not previously been
linked to the NAE, a conservative evangelical body which does not
permit full membership to churches belonging to the NCC or WCC.
   Some American Baptists had sought withdrawal from the NCC and WCC.
   Paul Nichols of Richmond, Va., characterized the compromise
decision as ``conciliar, broad, inclusive _ an appropriate stance
for our denomination.''
   The decision culminated four years of monitoring and critiquing

<HEAD>Foreign Students Who Stay On: U.S. Gain or World's Loss?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From their clifftop campus in Hoboken, N.J., the
593 foreign students at Stevens Institute of Technology have a
grandstand view of the New York City skyline and the battery of
skyscrapers around Wall Street.
   To some, it's like a vision of the Promised Land _ and many are
tempted to stay in this country to start careers.
   Currently, 356,200 students from other countries attend more than
2,000 colleges and universities across America, and as many as
one-fifth of them do in fact stay on.
   ``Our best estimate is that in recent years only 80 to 85 percent
of foreign students in the United States returned home,'' says Jack
Reichard, vice president of the Washington-based National
Association for Foreign Student Affairs.
   Moreover, 50-60 percent of foreign students studying science and
engineering _ a vital area for their countries as well as the United
States _ decide to stay, according to a study by the National
Science Foundation.
   About 40 percent of non-American Ph.D. recipients in science and
engineering seek jobs in this country, and about 40 percent of
American university science and engineering faculty members under
the age of 35 are now foreign nationals, according to the National
Academy of Sciences.
   Whether these young intellectuals of the world should stay on to
make their careers in America or return home is a question in
growing contention. Their individual decisions to stay or to go home
could have a considerable impact on world affairs.
   Leon Febres Cordero, who earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree
at Stevens in 1953, completed a four-year term as president of
Ecuador last August.
   Niklos Nemeth, an economist with postgraduate training at Harvard
University, was named in November to be prime minister of Hungary.
   Benazir Bhutto, who has a BA from Radcliffe College, became prime
minister of Pakistan, elected in December as the first woman ever to
head a Moslem government.
   In dozens of other nations of every political persuasion,
graduates of American universities have occupied positions of
influence and power in politics, industry and other fields.
   Foreign students who decided to stay on in the United States have
been no less successful.
   Shanghai-born An Wang, who was sent to study physics at Harvard
by President Chiang Kai-shek of Nationalist China, stayed on in the
United States to found Wang Laboratories, a major scientific
company, and make a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $365
million.
   The average foreign university student attends courses for about
3.5 years, Reichard said in a telephone interview. So it may be
estimated, with about 350,000 foreign students in the country, that
approximately 100,000 new university-level students enter the
country each year.
   According to U.S immigration figures, about 20,000 of these
foreign youths, among the world's best and brightest, trade in their
student visas for immigration cards.
   The foreign students come from 186 countries and territories. Two
thirds of them are from developing nations, where in many cases a
depressing paradox awaits them on their return home: there is a
desperate need for their knowledge, but jobs are scarce and poorly
paid even at the advanced level they have achieved.
   So the temptation to remain in the United States is strong.
   Making it even stronger is the encouragement of some American
business and academic leaders, acutely aware of a shortage of
American-born science students in particular.
   According to the Council on Competitiveness, the United States
could face a shortfall of 500,000 American-born scientists and
engineers by the year 2010 due to retirements and the declining
number of American students choosing careers in these fields.
   The Council, composed of 151 chief executives of industry, labor
and higher education, also noted in a report last July that 1,300 to
1,800 engineering positions are vacant even now at American
universities.
   ``How can we replenish these faculty positions?'' asks Stevens
President Harold J. Raveche. ``It takes 10,000 high school students
expressing an interest in a science or engineering major to assure
us of 20 doctorates.''
   ``We should talk about our education deficit rather than about
our budget deficit,'' says Kenneth Wilson, 1982 winner of the Nobel
physics prize. ``We need math and science teachers,'' he said during
a forum on U.S. competitiveness at Stevens.
   The academic gap is being filled by an increasing number of
professors from other countries, particularly India, Japan and other
Asian nations.
   Sixty percent of all foreign students in the United States are in
engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, physical and life
sciences or management-related fields, according to the New
York-based Institute of International Education, which administers
international scholarship programs and places thousands of foreign
students in U.S. schools.
   ``An important policy need is to encourage developing-country
nationals to return home. Their U.S. education should represent a
brain gain, not a drain,'' says Institute chairman Charles H. Percy,
a former Illinois senator.
   Dissenting, Peter Sprague, chairman of the board of National
Semiconductor Corp., notes that ``the American university system is
unmatched in the world, and the United States is a mecca for foreign
students.
   ``About half our science and engineering graduate students are
foreigners. We should give them green cards,'' admitting them as
immigrants, said Sprague at the Stevens forum. He said he spoke for
the high technology industries of California's Silicon Valley.
   While U.S. universities may set a high standard, American primary
and secondary education is often inadequate, said Pulitzer
Prize-winning author David Halberstam at the Stevens forum.
   ``Technical universities like Stevens are at the cutting edge of
economic development,'' he said, ``but the Japanese are killing us
in ninth grade mathematics.''

<DATELINE>REGGIO DI CALABRIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lone assassin rapidly fired
five shots at point-blank range through the window of a small
pizzeria, then vanished into the cold December night on a motorcycle.
   He left behind three people dead or dying, three wounded and his
Belgian-made, 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun _ a trademark of an
underworld killing.
   The next morning, at a gas station across town, a mob-linked
contractor opened the door of his bulletproof car and died, along
with his son-in-law, in bursts of submachine-gun and automatic rifle
fire.
   The 'ndrangheta, the name for the Calabrian underworld, has made
a killing field of the faded cities and towns in the rugged hills
and along the jagged coast of Italy's impoverished southern tip.
   In the past year, 165 people have been murdered in the province
of Reggio Calabria, at least 50 of them in this city across the
Strait of Messina from Sicily. The death toll is staggering when
compared to just 31 killings in the province of Rome, which has a
population of about 3.7 million, more than six times greater than
Reggio Calabria's 589,000.
   Investigators say most of the Calabrian dead fell victim to the
struggle for control of the drug trade or to a 25-year-old blood
feud between two powerful crime families.
   ``In certain zones of Sicily, Calabria and Campagna (Naples), the
possession of the territory by organized crime is total,'' Domenico
Sica, Italy's high anti-Mafia commissioner, recently told
Parliament's Anti-Mafia Commission.
   The bosses of the 'ndrangheta, which means ``society of valorous
men,'' rule their Calabrian territories through fear and
intimidation. Their retribution is swift and lethal. Often, life in
their domain is short and incredibly cheap.
   One Rome-based investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the average price for a hired killing in Calabria is $400.
Free-lance hit men sometimes kill for free, hoping to curry favor
with a certain boss.
   Drugs are at the core of the criminal empire that links the
'ndrangheta with the Sicilian Mafia, Colombian cocaine kingpins and
heroin warlords of Asia.
   Experts estimate Italian crime bosses earn $10 billion to $12
billion a year from the international heroin trade and that sales of
cocaine and other drugs may push the total above $20 billion.
   The 'ndrangheta also profits from murders-for-hire, gunrunning,
trading in counterfeit dollars, and kidnapping rings that collect
huge ransoms for quick reinvestment in drug deals.
   Calabrian businesses must pay extortion to avoid the torch, and
corrupt politicians swell `ndrangheta coffers with millions
misdirected from public works contracts, government development
funds and investment schemes designed to benefit Italy's blighted
south.
   To reassert control, the government proposes expanding the powers
of police investigating organized crime and drug trafficking. One
measure would give police the authority to conduct undercover
investigations _ forbidden in a postwar Italy that remembers abuses
under the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.
   In Rome, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents already are
quietly training Italian authorities in undercover work.
   Interior Minister Antonio Gava also has promised better training
for police, specialized departments, creation of mobile groups to
help in trouble spots and new local commissioners to oversee the war
on crime in Calabria.
   This encourages Lt. Col. Corrado Borruso, commander of the
Carabinieri paramilitary police in Reggio Di Calabria, who are on
the front line of the war with crime.
   Borruso said he believes the government can defeat the
`ndrangheta, that it can use expanded powers and undercover
operations to go after the leaders and stop the killing.
   ``It will be a struggle, really a long struggle,'' said Borruso.
``We must seek to stop this slaughter through the arrest of the big
bosses who pull the strings of all the `ndrangheta operations.''
   However, some other investigators question the political will of
the government to do the things necessary to defeat organized crime.
Billions of dollars in illicit profits bolster the clout of the
Mafia and 'ndrangheta, and some politicians owe their careers to
votes collected by the mob.
   Privately some investigators admit they can't penetrate the
tightknit clans of the 'ndrangheta and don't know enough about its
operation.
   For example, they know the Calabrians help smuggle tons of
morphine base into Italy from southwest Asia, to refine it and to
sell it in Europe and in the United States through contacts in
Toronto.
   But they don't know the details of the partnership with the
Sicilians, who really control the drug market, or how much the
Calabrians share in the profits.
   Informers and hirelings willing to testify against their
Calabrian bosses are extremely rare.
   ``He who is blind, deaf and dumb will live a hundred years,''
advises an Italian proverb on the code of silence called the
``Omerta'' or ``Diffidenza.''
   The `ndrangheta has a long memory and a long reach. While Italy,
laments the Rome-based investigator, has no effective witness
protection program.
   The government's enemy is also formidable in its sheer size.
Police say there are 156 'ndrangheta clans in Calabria, 93 of them
in the province of Reggio Calabria. Police records list slightly
over 4,000 members of the clans in Calabria. But investigators have
said they believe that for everyone on the list there are at least
two who have escaped identification.
   Police from all agencies in Calabria number about 3,600.
   But Borruso and other investigators bristle at suggestions that
they need more manpower, apparently considering such recommendations
a veiled slap at police effectiveness.
   ``It is not only a question or a problem for the police,'' said
Borruso.
   The government, he said, must change the things in Calabria that
permit the `ndrangheta to flourish.
   His sentiments are echoed by politicians, both nationally and
locally, who believe Italy can never defeat the `ndrangheta in
Calabria, the Camorra in Campagna or the Mafia in Sicily as long as
the regions are allowed to languish in poverty.
   Calabria ranks at the bottom of the list of per capita income by
region, with its citizens earning 44 percent less than the national
average. Calabria's unemployment rate of 21.6 percent is nearly
twice the 11.9 percent for Italy as a whole and two and a half times
the rate for the country's affluent north.
   Calabria, like much of the rest of southern Italy, has not
benefited significantly from the industrial boom and the economic
resurrgence that Italy contends has given it the West's
fifth-largest economy. Many of Calabria's factories sit idle. Its
ports are largely empty. Much of its land is rocky, mountainous and
untilled.
   ``In the absence of an adequate presence by the state, the
'ndrangheta has penetrated into the vital nerve centers of the
economy, politics and public administration,'' Calabria's regional
president, Rosario Olivio, said at a recent meeting with Sica, Gava
and anti-Mafia investigators.
   ``The central problem is unemployment and around that turns
everything else,'' said Olivio.

<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UMTATA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widely ignored and usually docile,
South Africa's black homelands are producing a new generation of
leaders frustrated with limited autonomy and demanding a bigger role
in shaping the political future.
   The authoritarian tribal chiefs who have long ruled the 10
homelands are being replaced or challenged by younger men, who view
their territories as key partners in a united South Africa rather
than isolated tribal reservations.
   ``The youth see the homelands differently than their parents, and
it is not attractive to them,'' said Gen. Bantu Holomisa, the
33-year-old military ruler of Transkei. Transkei in 1976 was the
first homeland to become independent from South Africa.
   ``We have been given a raw deal (by South Africa), and we won't
settle for that again,'' Holomisa said in a recent interview in
Umtata, Transkei's capital.
   No foreign governments recognize the homelands, including the
four that South Africa classifies as independent _ Transkei,
Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei.
   Anti-apartheid activists dismiss the homelands as the
illegitimate offspring of apartheid, which denies South Africa's
black majority a voice in national affairs.
   The homelands have little industry, scarce arable land and are
heavily dependent on South African financial aid. They are largely
ignored both in South Africa and abroad, although they have more
than 13 million residents _ about half South Africa's black
population.
   Holomisa and other like-minded homeland leaders concede they lack
leverage when they ask the South African government for a role in
negotiating political change.
   But their goal of a unified South Africa directly challenges the
foundation of the ethnic-based homeland system designed by Hendrik
Verwoerd, South Africa's prime minister from 1958 to 1966.
   Verwoerd sought to make all black South Africans citizens of the
remote homelands, granting them local autonomy while whites
controlled the national economy and government.
   A conservative, older generation of tribal chiefs accepted
self-government in the 1960s and 1970s, receiving financial benefits
and the support of South African security forces. In return, the
chiefs have neither instigated nor tolerated anti-apartheid activism.
   However, younger leaders see the territories only as an interim
step on the road to a black government in South Africa.
   ``In our own territory, we have tried to ... promote our own
agenda and unequivocally to destroy the (apartheid) structure,''
Enos Mabuza, the 49-year-old leader of the KaNgwane homeland,
recently told the magazine Leadership.
   ``Our objective is that (KaNgwane) should be part of South
Africa, if not now, then in the long term,'' he said.
   Mabuza has risked the wrath of the South African government by
maintaining contacts with leaders of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement, the largest organization fighting the
government. He describes the ANC as ``a key actor, perhaps the most
important actor'' among black political organizations.
   He also has refused ``independence'' for tiny KaNgwane, near
South Africa's eastern border with Mozambique.
   The South African government would like all 10 homelands to
become independent as part of its policy of racial separation.
Critics say the government wants to fragment the black population
and decrease its political clout.
   Only four homelands have opted for independence, and none has
chosen that route since Ciskei in 1981.
   Several developments in the past year suggest growing
anti-apartheid activism in the homelands and a general discontent
with the system.
   _In KwaNdebele, voters in December overwhelmingly ousted all 16
Parliament members up for election, including Chief Minister George
Mahlangu. The defeated incumbents supported independence plans for
the small patch of arid territory outside Pretoria that is home to
about 300,000 people.
   _In Bophuthatswana, dissident army officers launched a coup
attempt Feb. 10 against President Lucas Mangope, who has led the
homeland since it was declared independent in 1977.
   The group that kidnapped Mangope was led by an anti-independence
politician, Peter Metsing, who remains at large. South African
troops rescued Mangope and restored him to power hours after he was
captured.
   _In Venda, a nominally independent homeland in the far north,
students and workers staged a highly effective general strike in
August to protest an alleged government cover-up of ritual murders.
   _In KwaZulu, homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha
political organization is locked in a power struggle with the now
banned United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of
anti-apartheid groups. More than 1,000 have died in black-on-black
faction fighting around the cities of Pietermaritzburg and Durban in
the past two years.
   Buthelezi, the best known homeland leader, is a critic of
apartheid and was an ANC member years ago. But many activists view
him as too conservative due to his current condemnation of the ANC
and his refusal to support confrontational tactics such as economic
sanctions, consumer boycotts and strikes.
   In Transkei, Holomisa says he does not pursue contact with the
ANC because it would invite economic punishment from the South
African government.
   Nonetheless, he says ``there will never be genuine change without
the ANC'' and other major anti-apartheid groups.
   Holomisa stresses that many of Transkei's most pressing problems
are economic, not political.
   Located on the Indian Ocean coast, Transkei is a visually
spectacular collection of rolling hills, winding rivers, and
waterfalls.
   But 95 percent of the people live in impoverished rural
settlements, and 80 percent are illiterate. Infant mortality is
high, and life expectancy is low. Most men who have jobs work
outside the homeland and either have long daily commutes or are far
from their families most of the year.
   Because Transkei is not recognized internationally, it receives
no economic aid except from South Africa.
   ``South Africa's racial policies have hurt us,'' said Holomisa.
``But international sanctions also make us suffer. There are human
problems here that can't be wished away by pretending we don't
exist.''

<HEAD>Ronald Reagan's Impact on World Affairs</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Ronald Reagan steps from the stage, he
leaves a world remarkably different from the one he inherited eight
years ago. During Reagan's watch, Soviet-American relations took on
a warmth that could not have been anticipated then. Much of Latin
America shed its dictators and embraced democracy. The United
Nations gained in importance. The U.S. government opened talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the Reagan
administration had labeled an outlaw band of terrorists. And the
administration sold arms to another adversary _ the regime of the
ayatollah in Iran.
   Associated Press reporters who have covered these events sum up
the Reagan impact on world affairs:

<NOTE>Reagan and the Kremlin: From `Evil Empire' to `Great Confidence'</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Reagan rewrote the book on dealing with the Kremlin.
But if the book has changed, so has Moscow and so has Reagan.
   At the outset, Reagan labelled the Soviet Union an ``evil
empire'' whose leaders asserted for themselves the ``right to commit
any crime, to lie, to cheat, to attain their goal.''
   ``So far, detente has been a one-way street that the Soviet Union
has used to pursue its own aims,'' Reagan said on Jan. 29, 1981.
   He backed his rhetoric with a trillion dollar defense buildup.
The Soviets cranked up their propaganda machine in response,
equating the Reagan administration with Hitler's Third Reich.
   After the Soviets walked out of talks to limit intermediate-range
missiles, Reagan pulled his biggest surprise, in March 1983
directing U.S. scientists to devise a shield against
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative reversed an 11-year-old policy
and has dominated the arms control debate since then. It is widely
credited with driving the Soviets back to the bargaining table.
   At the same time, one generation was giving way to another in the
Kremlin. Leonid Brezhnev, who was Soviet leader when Reagan took
office and under whom the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December
1979 and countenanced the military crackdown against Poland's
Solidarity labor union two years later, died in November 1982.
   He was followed in quick succession by two elderly men, Yuri
Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, who died in office and gave way
to Mikhail S. Gorbachev in March 1985. Reagan and Gorbachev found
they could do business.
   In December 1987, they signed a treaty that for the first time
eliminated a whole class of new nuclear weapons and created a highly
intrusive system of on-site verification.
   The two sides also have made progress on a treaty to sharply
reduce long-range weapons, although differences remain, especially
over Star Wars.
   The changes have been profound enough for Reagan to declare at a
news conference concluding the Moscow summit last summer that he had
``great confidence'' in Gorbachev's ability to change the Soviet
Union.

<NOTE>The Mideast: Deals with the Ayatollah and Arafat</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel considered Reagan its best friend in the
White House since President Harry S. Truman supported establishment
of the Jewish state 40 years ago. But in his last weeks, Reagan and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz authorized talks with the PLO.
It was a shocking turn of events bound to open a new chapter in the
Mideast's history.
   The decision, based on statements made by PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat renouncing terrorism and saying a Palestinian state would
live alongside Israel, dismayed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
was denounced by the Jerusalem government. Still, the criticism was
muted, while American Jewish leaders also held their fire. This was
largely due to the trust Reagan and Shultz had built up.
   Peace plans advanced _ unsuccessfully _ by Reagan and Shultz did
not provide for an independent Palestinian state nor call on Israel
to relinquish all of the West Bank and Gaza.
   U.S. criticism of the spread of Jewish outposts in the
territories was muted and a U.N. resolution condemning them as
illegal and an obstruction to peace was vetoed by the United States.
   The strenuous American campaign against terrorism led by Shultz
cemented ties with Israel, a target of extremists. American jets
bombed Tripoli, the capital of Libya, and Shultz denied a visa to
Arafat to speak at the United Nations in New York.
   Ironically, only a few weeks later, Shultz approved a
``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO, which enhanced Arafat's
prestige and was received with jubilation in the Arab world.
   In another curious twist, the Untied States and Israel secretly
provided arms to Iran despite Iran's presence on the State
Department's list of countries that support terrorism. The purpose
was to encourage moderation in Tehran and to secure the release of
American hostages. Nine remain in captivity as Reagan leaves office.
   In 1982, when Israeli troops and tanks rolled into Lebanon in a
campaign to wipe out the PLO, the Reagan administration organized a
diplomatic effort to stop the invasion short of Beirut and
dispatched U.S. Marines to protect the PLO as it evacuated the
country.
   Lebanese Christians massacred Palestinians that September in
refugee camps south of Beirut, bringing U.S. Marines back to lower
tensions. This mission ended in disaster. Terrorists blew up the
U.S. embassy in April 1983 and bombed the Marines' headquarters in
October, killing 241 servicemen.
   In 1983, Shultz worked out an agreement for Israel to withdraw
its troops while Lebanon moved toward recognition of the Jewish
state. Syria and Saudi Arabia persuaded Lebanon to abandon the
accord.
   In the meantime, Reagan's plan for peace talks between Israel and
the Arabs did not get off the ground when it was rejected by
Menachem Begin, then Israel's prime minister, in 1982.
   Shultz tried a similar version of ``land-for-peace'' in 1988, but
it was not accepted by Israel, Jordan and Palestinians.
   A tougher test of the U.S.-Iraelirelationship began with rising
violence by Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza a year
ago and the establishment of a U.S. dialogue with the PLO _ a matter
now put in George Bush's hands.

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It wasn't Ronald Reagan's doing, but the United
Nations began to play an important role in world affairs. Its
peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize and some member states
even started paying back dues.
   Reagan had been critical of the world organization for seven
years, but in October, addressing the 159 nations of the General
Assembly for the last time, he conceded: ``Yes, the United Nations
is a better place today. But so, too, is the world.''
   The United Nations has played or is playing a major role in
molding peace agreements, peace talks or peace prospects in
Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, Southern Africa and Namibia,
Cambodia and the Western Sahara.
   The United States, the biggest U.N. donor, feels it has prodded
the world body into cutting costs. Washington saw an anti-American
bias, overspending, overstaffing, bureaucracy and waste and
complained that poor, developing nations hostile to the West
contributed little but dictated how U.S. funds would be spent of
squandered.

   Most recently the United States was on a collision course with
the world body over its refusal to grant a visa to Arafat so that he
could speak here. The enraged General Assembly rebuked Washington
and traveled to Geneva in protest to hear him. But even that dispute
was set aside when the United States accepted what Arafat said as a
renunciation of terror and opened talks with the PLO.

<NOTE>In Central America, No One Said `Uncle'</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Reagan took office determined to reverse pro-Soviet
sentiment in Central America. He leaves with those hopes unfulfilled.
   Nicaragua's leftist government appears firmly entrenched as the
thousands of Contra rebels on whom Reagan invested much political
capital find themselves in dreary camps along the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border, cut off from U.S. military support.
Reagan once told a press conference that his goal in Nicaragua was
to see the Sandinistas ``say uncle.''
   In El Salvador, there is more uncertainty than at any time since
1984 when a democratically-elected president, Jose Napoleon Duarte,
took office.
   That event was a victory for administration perseverance but
Duarte's term is ending with a guerrilla war still raging and living
standards far below what they were a decade ago despite hundreds of
millions of dollars of U.S. aid. The country's political life is
marked by increasing polarization.
   Military governments in Guatemala and Honduras have given way to
elected governments but in both countries full blown democracy has
yet to take root.
   Nicaragua ranks as a major Reagan disappointment. In every other
regional conflict _ Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia _ the
administration can claim a measure of success.
   Reagan was never able to sell the notion to the American people
that the Sandinista government was a menace which, left unchecked,
would result in the spread of Marxism throughout Central America and
into Mexico.
   He could never rally a sustainable consensus in support of his
view that the best way to deal with the Sandinistas was through
generous support for the Contra rebels, who Reagan once called the
``moral equivalent of the founding fathers.''
   Within the Reagan White House the Contra cause became a highly
emotional issue. It induced some of the administration's most
strategically placed people _ National Security advisor John
Poindexter and Lt. Col. Oliver North _ to bend or perhaps break the
law because defeat of the Contras seemed so unthinkable. Both were
charged with breaking the law.

<NOTE>Arms Control: A Landmark Agreement and a Dashed Hope for Even More</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Reagan leaves office with a mixed record on arms
control. The treaty he signed at the Washington summit with
Gorbachev in December 1987 was a landmark. For the first time in
history, an entire category of U.S. and Soviet missiles _ those in
the intermediate range of 300 to 3,000 miles _ was abolished.
   The treaty also broke new ground in providing for Soviet
inspectors to observe the destruction of banned U..S. missiles here,
while American monitors checked up on the Soviets at their sites.
   Left undone, however, was the larger Reagan goal of completing a
treaty to reduce globe-girdling nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   Some of the weapons ticketed for cutbacks, such as sea-launched
cruise missiles, are extremely difficult to detect. Negotiations
stalled over verification procedures, while the Soviets never
abandoned their attempt to impose some sort of restrictions on the
U.S. anti-ballistic missile program as part of a Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty.
   The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative,
is aimed at mounting a defense in space against Soviet ballistic
missiles.
   In other arms control areas, Reagan did not reach an agreement
with the Soviets on ways to monitor underground nuclear tests nor
find a way to deter the proliferation of chemical weapons. He
accused the Soviets in reports to Congress of probably exceeding the
permissible 150-kiloton ceiling on underground blasts.

<NOTE>Japan: The Porcupine Cooperates</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The prime minister of Japan made his get-acquainted
call less than four months into President Reagan's first term.
   Questioned about defense policy by members of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki said Japan felt it
``Better to be a porcupine than a roaring lion.''
   But the official interpreter got it wrong and ``porcupine'' came
out in English as ``wise mouse.'' The Japanese embassy corrected the
animal mixup but the incident still triggered a burst of comment
that Japan was shirking responsibility and enjoying a ``free ride''
on defense at the cost of the United States.
   To some Americans _ those displaced from jobs by imports _ Japan
may look today like a lion-sized economic porcupine. But experts
rate overall relations better today than at the beginning of the
Reagan years.
   Quality- and price-conscious U.S. consumers continue to buy up
Japanese products. Lack of American competitiveness has become
recognized as part of the problem of U.S. trade deficits that rose
from $16 billion with Japan in 1981 to nearly $70 billion before
they started to decline last year.
   Eight years and two prime ministers after Suzuki visited
Washington, the Japanese continue to shun a ``roaring lion''
military role and there is greater acceptance of this at the
Pentagon and White House. The Reagan administration hails as a
success the defense relationship in which Japan now helps pay the
upkeep of nearly 55,000 U.S. personnel on its territory and provides
destroyers, anti-submarine patrols and jet fighters to defend
sealanes up to 1,000 nautical miles off its shores.
   It also applauds Japan's offsetting of its
constitutionally-mandated low military profile by becoming the
world's largest foreign aid donor with a five-year, $50 billion
program of assistance tied less and less to buying Japanese products.
   Experts give Reagan and his administration good marks for
recognizing Japan's growing status as an economic superpower vital
to the United States and encouraging the relationship to mature into
a partnership stressing dialogue and shared benefits more than
name-calling.

<NOTE>The Ron-Margaret Relationship: A Staunch Ally in Europe</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   LONDON _ The Reagan years brought a specialness to the
British-American relationship not seen since World War II, and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher made it the cornerstone of her foreign
policy.
   For Reagan, Mrs. Thatcher has stood alone among the other West
European leaders, even at political cost. For example, she was the
sole ally to back the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya, which most
others in Britain denounced as heavy-handed and futile.
   Under Mrs. Thatcher, Britain followed the United States out of
UNESCO in 1985; was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles in
Europe in 1983; and, when the superpowers agreed in 1987 to remove
the missiles, she publicly endorsed the deal despite private
reservations.

   Mrs. Thatcher was given to bluntly reminding her fellow Europeans
in NATO or the European Economic Community of their reliance on U.S.
military and diplomatic power. This has revived complaints that the
British cling to old trans-Atlantic ties and are unenthusiastic
Europeans.
   Reagan's style provoked amusement, concern or jibing among
British opposition parties and in newspapers. But not even in strict
confidence would Thatcher aides utter a word of criticism of the
president.
   Reagan and Thatcher have disagreed on economic issues like the
U.S. deficit, and she had misgivings about the missiles deal. But
they're obviously fond of each other, call each other Ron and
Margaret, and share some basic instincts, like their faith in the
free market and a strong defense, and their hatred of socialism.
   ``You have restored faith in the American dream,'' Mrs. Thatcher
told Reagan last summer when he paid a farewell presidential visit
to Britain.
   He said of the British leader who has been in office throughout
his two terms: ``We're very good friends and it is a friendship I
treasure very much.''

<NOTE>South Africa: A Diplomatic Success, But Apartheid Is Entrenched</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Reagan administration looked as if it was going
to come up empty on its southern Africa policies until Chester
Crocker, the assistant secretary of state, pulled out an 11th hour
peace agreement on Angola.
   Until Crocker, a former Georgetown University professor, helped
negotiate the peace agreement last month, he was best known as the
architect of the administration's policy of ``constructive
engagement.'' It called for the United States to use diplomatic
pressure to force the white-ruled government of South Africa to
change its policies of racial segregation, called apartheid..
   ``Constructive engagement,'' no longer part of the State
Department's official lexicon, was not a success. South Africa's
policies remain virtually the same, with blacks denied political and
social rights.
   In the United States, ``constructive engagement'' was the target
of criticism and ridicule. And opponents of South Africa mounted a
campaign which resulted in legislation in 1986 providing for
economic sanctions against the white regime. They provided for a ban
on new investments, a prohibition on the import of certain South
African products and the suspension of South African commercial
landing rights in the United States. Reagan's veto of the sanctions
was overridden decisively.
   In Angola, where the Reagan administration and South Africa had
supported rebels seeking to overthrow the Cuban-backed Marxist
government, Crocker was more successful.
   After months of mediating delicate negotiations, South Africa,
Cuba and Angola signed an agreement under which Angola pledged to
send home 50,000 Cuban troops posted in Angola.
   At the same time, South Africa granted independence to South-West
Africa, the continent's last colony. It will become the black-ruled
nation of Namibia.
   In sum, it was a mixed record for the Reagan administration.

<NOTE>Latin America: Democracies, Saddled by Debts, Threatened</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ With U.S. encouragement, much of Latin America has
undergone an unprecedented political transformation from
dictatorship to democracy over the past decade but the region is
nonetheless worse off economically now than when the generals were
in charge.
   Reagan and Shultz have repeatedly hailed the democratic
development in the hemisphere. Nonetheless, the same economic forces
that swept the dictatorships from power during the 1980's are now
threatening the emerging democracies. In some countries, the
possibility of a military coup is not ruled out.
   As Reagan leaves office, the potential political and economic
consequences of continued stagnation, partly the result of the
region's huge foreign debt, could become one of the major
hemispheric challenges for the new administration.
   President-elect Bush has called for a ``major review'' of
existing policy on debt, the centerpiece of which is the so-called
Baker plan, named for former Treasury Secretary and Secretary of
State-designate James A. Baker III.
   The plan calls for economic reforms in the debtor countries and
new public and private lending from the developed countries to meet
their capital needs. But lending has been far below what had been
expected when the plan was unveiled three years ago.
   Hemispheric countries over the past five years have shelled out
more than $120 billion in debt repayments than they have received in
new loans. Repayments on the region's $420 billion debt have meant
that decades of hard-won gains for some countries have been wiped
out.
   The region has been denied capital needed for investment and
imports vital for production have been cut back sharply. Inflation
and high unemployment are rampant.
   The list of countries which have made the shift to democracy or
are in the process of doing so since 1979 is impressive: Argentina,
Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, El Salvador,
Honduras and Guatemala.
   But in virtually all of these countries, the popular base of the
incumbent administrations has been eroding, reflecting the
difficulty they have in dealing with the consequences of excessive
borrowing in the past.
   Increasingly, Latin leaders see debt relief as perhaps the only
way their countries can restore economic growth and to prevent yet
another lost decade.

<NOTE>Mexico: Distrust on Both Sides of the Border</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Reagan's departure coincides with the start of a
six-year term by a new Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
offer both countries a fresh opportunity for a more harmonious
relationship.
   Reagan met frequently with former Mexican President Miguel de la
Madrid and the two got along well but the same cannot be said for
officials at the lower level.
   The two governments disagreed sharply over Central America,
particularly Nicaragua, where Mexico was viewed by administration
officials as perhaps the most stalwart non-communist backer of the
leftist Sandinista government.
   Elliott Abrams, the outgoing assistant secretary of state for
Latin America, concedes that the ``ideological tone'' of Mexico's
foreign policy over the years left the administration ``very
unhappy.''
   U.S. officials angered Mexico by suggesting that official
corruption was hampering that country's drug enforcement efforts.
Mexico felt the Reagan administration failed to appreciate the
sacrifices its security forces made to come to grips with the drug
issue.
   Drugs remain a potent issue. Mexico is believed to provide 30
percent of the marijuana and 40 percent of the heroin reaching this
country.
   Immigration is another divisive issue. The Reagan administration
maintained that unwise Mexican economic policies forced millions of
Mexicans to cross the border illegally. Mexico's view is that the
immigration is the result of the U.S. demand for cheap labor, which
it claims American policies fail to take into account.
   On the economic front, Mexico has maintained that paying the
interest on its $107 billion foreign debt makes growth impossible.
When Bush takes office, Mexico will be eagerly awaiting some sign
that he will be amenable to a policy under which Mexico's debt
servicing obligations might be matched to its payment capacity.
Mexico has felt for years that its debt is the primary cause for a
steady decline in Mexican living standards during the 1980s.

<HEAD>Overseas Investors Have a Yen for Hollywood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the same visions of stardom that carried
scores of farm girls to this town in years past, foreign investors
today are migrating to Hollywood to make it big in the entertainment
industry.
   Japan's Sony Corp. has been trying to purchase film studio MGM
for months without success. British broadcaster Television South PLC
acquired television producer MTM Enterprises for $310 million in
July. Australian businessman Alan Saffron bought film producer
Atlantic Entertainment Group on Dec. 13.
   And numerous other overseas buyers, flush with cash and bolstered
by strong currencies, have their checkbooks unholstered, waiting for
the right moment to join Southern California's movers and shakers.
   ``I predict that over the next three to five years, you're going
to have two or three major studios change hands,'' said Steve
Rosenberg, president of entertainment consulting firm Rose Media.
``I truly believe that the Japanese will at least own one of them,
and maybe the Germans will own another.''
   ``You get the glamor and glitter to some extent but there are
also investment characteristics,'' said Nancy Schwalb, whose Star
Partners arranges limited participation in films such as ``A Fish
Called Wanda.''
   Investors from Australia, Japan, France and Canada, Schwalb said,
``are interested in the industry because it's so strong and they
appreciate the growth.''
   Even though the film industry is enjoying record profits, several
large and small film studios are desperately in need of money.
``There are a lot of companies in serious trouble or potentially
serious trouble,'' said Charles Meeker, head of the entertainment
division at law firm White &amp; Case.
   Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures, for one, has floundered recently
and is rumored to be for sale. MGM sits dead in the water. Atlantic
Entertainment, just purchased by Saffron's KVC Video for an
undisclosed sum, was left destitute by box-office busts like ``Patty
Hearst'' and ``1969.''
   Yet the continuing deregulation of European television and the
boom in overseas VCR sales (60 percent of Japanese homes have VCRs)
have created a nearly insatiable demand for U.S. programming.
   American television shows and movies _ even domestic bombs like
``Airwolf'' and ``Rambo III'' _ have a remarkable ability to draw
audiences in most foreign countries.
   ``There's a major change in the regulatory environment in Europe
and there's an excess of Japanese capital looking for a home,'' said
Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. ``The combination of those two things means that
(foreign money) will move toward the domestic film business.''
   Entertainment-industry investments give electronic manufacturers
an unbeatable opportunity to create full-service companies. Sony's
recent $2 billion purchase of CBS Records, for instance, yielded a
firm with both hardware (record, tape and CD players) and software
(the Epic, Columbia and Portrait record labels).
   ``We're looking at Hollywood because of our interest in video,
precisely the same reason we looked at CBS Records because of our
interest in audio,'' said Michael Schuloff, Sony's vice chairman.
   Following Sony's model, Japan entertainment conglomerate Tokuma
Group has opened a Los Angeles office, scouring the city for related
investment opportunities.
   ``Mainly we are now looking for video rights ... for movies to
show in Japan,'' said Hiro Iijima, general manager of Tokuma's North
American operations. ``In the future, we would like to get
theatrical (motion picture), television and home video rights.''
   The easiest way to do that, of course, is to buy a studio already
owning such rights.
   The foreign equation can work both ways. A few leading
programmers _ Disney, NBC _ have begun spreading their franchises
overseas. So far, though, the advances have been tentative. ``But I
think you're going to see the successful U.S. studios make major
moves into foreign markets,'' Meeker said.
   Yet blindly snapping up an entertainment company is as perilous
as attending a Jerry Lewis film festival.
   Sony Pictures, a tiny movie company now disguised as SVS Films,
has yet to become a successful producer. Sony removed its name from
the enterprise when its releases (including a low-budget slasher
film called ``Party Line'') threatened to tarnish Sony's golden
corporate image.
   SVS' latest theatrical release, an exploitation film called
``Vicious,'' will not establish Sony as a high-brow producer. The
movie, playing in just a handful of theaters, is described by the
entertainment newspaper Variety as ``ludicrous,'' a ``violent
cheapie'' featuring a ``vulgar screenplay.''
   ``(Entertainment) is clearly more risky (than other loan
investments), but that's not to say that it's necessarily
outrageous,'' said William Newby, assistant vice president in the
entertainment industry department at National Westminster Bank USA.
   ``You can't always apply typical accounting standards to the
entertainment industry,'' Newby said. ``If a bank or any investor
does their homework, I think there are values to be found
certainly....
   ``But it seems to be an industry where an awful lot of folks
don't know what they're getting into.''

<NOTE>Canada: A New Era on Trade, But Air Pollution's a Sore Point</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   TORONTO _ Canada and the United States head for a new era of
trade cooperation as Reagan leaves office.
   The free trade agreement that he signed with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney a year ago won approval only after an intensive debate in
Canada that showed just how wary many here are of their larger and
more powerful neighbor.
   The impact of the agreement, which took effect on Jan. 1, will be
gradual over a 10-year period.
   But the debate also put the spotlight on the remarkable ties that
have developed between Canada and the United States already and
their two-way trading partnership, the largest such relationship in
the world.
   Canada's prosperity and economic growth have paralleled and
frequently exceeded the United States' during the past six years. As
in the United States, concern also has been voiced here that
affluence has gone only to some parts of society and instead of
trickling down has created a harsh, uncaring class system.
   Reagan and Mulroney shared not only a conservative outlook but an
Irish heritage that improved relations between Washington and
Ottawa, sometimes at odds before 1984 under Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau.
   The biggest lingering source of friction between the two
countries is the inability to achieve agreement on acid rain,
despite Mulroney's claims to easy access with Reagan. The Canadian
leader has said he hopes to do better on the issue with Bush.
   Mulroney seeks a treaty under which the U.S. government would
promise to order reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions under a fixed schedule, just as Canada is cutting its
emissions by 50 percent.

   President Reagan said he has decided against
any oil import fee or other action to curb oil imports but conceded
that ``the free world will become increasingly dependent on oil
supplies from potentially insecure sources.''
   The president said Tuesday that he acted on the recommendation of
Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, who reported that import
restrictions ``would not be cost effective and, in the long run,
would impair rather than enhance national security.''

   Wall Street opened for business in 1989 with a markdown Tuesday,
as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 23.93 points to
2,144.64.
   The dollar skidded largely because of pessimism about the U.S.
trade deficit. Bond prices fell sharply in a post-New Year's selloff
incited by weakness in the dollar and forecasts of higher interest
rates.
   On the commodities markets, coffee and cocoa futures prices rose
sharply while prices for cotton, sugar and orange juice futures
plunged; energy futures advanced; precious metals, grain, soybean,
livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures
retreated.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Toyota's Use Of Lexus Name For New Luxury Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. says it will go ahead with the
introduction of a new line of luxury cars despite a judge's ruling
that the models' name must be changed.
   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein in New York ruled that
Toyota may not use the Lexus name for the cars because it will
damage the trademark of a similarly named computer data-base service.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed against the Japanese carmaker
by Mead Data Central Inc., which sells a data-base service to the
legal profession under the name Lexis.
   Edelstein found Friday that the advertising barrage Toyota plans
for its Lexus line ``will dwarf the Lexis mark'' _ despite the
difference in spelling. He said that when people hear the name, the
car rather than the computer product might come to mind first.
   Edelstein added that Toyota ``consistently refused to acknowledge
that its use of Lexus might harm Mead's Lexis mark.''
   But the judge, noting that Toyota had already spent enormous sums
on Lexus, gave Toyota five days to accept an alternate order that
would permit it to use the name provided it meet certain conditions.
   Among them are making payments to Mead to enable the company to
preserve the distinctiveness of its Lexis trademark through
increased advertising, and running a disclaimer in all Lexus
advertising stating that the car line is not connected with Mead's
product.
   The amount of compensation to Mead for extra advertising would be
subject to negotiation between Mead and Toyota.
   On Monday, Toyota obtained a temporary stay of Edelstein's
injunction. On Thursday, a panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals is expected to hear arguments on whether the stay should be
extended, said Mead, which is based in Dayton, Ohio.
   If the stay is not extended, Toyota will be prohibited from using
the Lexus name when exhibiting its new car line at automobile shows
that open Saturday in Detroit and Los Angeles, Mead said.
   But Jim Olson, spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A Inc., said
Tuesday that the official launch of the car line, scheduled for
Thursday in Detroit, would go ahead as planned because of the stay.
   The U.S. affiliate, based in Torrance, Calif., also was named in
the suit.
   Olson said he could not comment on whether Toyota would accept
the alternate order, which was proposed by Mead, because the matter
was under appeal.
   ``We were shocked by the lower court's decision, which we
consider wrong and utterly without basis in fact or law,'' said Bob
McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales.
   Edelstein's ruling came under a New York law that entitles a
trademark owner to relief if it can demonstrate that its trademark
is likely to be diluted by another company's use of the same or
similar name.
   Arthur Greenbaum, a New York trademark attorney, said the
proposed advertising disclaimers have been used in similar cases,
but called ``unusual and creative'' the proposal that Toyota pay
Mead to increase its Lexis advertising.
   Toyota said it planned to have the Japanese cars in U.S.
showrooms in mid-September. The Lexus line represents a move to the
high end of the car market for Toyota, which established its
reputation as a maker of high-quality, moderately priced vehicles.
   Toyota said the two-model Lexus line, costing $20,000 to $35,000,
will compete with Mercedes-Benz and BMW, a segment of the market
being targeted by other Japanese carmakers.
   Lexis, the data-retrieval service, provides information on court
decisions, as well as access to many other data bases. It is used by
law firms as well as by those in many other fields.
   Mead Data Central is a subsidiary of Mead Corp., which also has
operations in forest products.

<HEAD>Big Bottling Deal Collapses After Government Info Request Delays
It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most expensive bottling transactions
ever proposed, Pepsico's $1.5 billion plan to buy General Cinema
Corp.'s soft drink bottling business, has collapsed following a
government request for more information that delayed the deal.
   The deal disintegrated Friday when the Federal Trade Commission
asked for additional details to determine whether it might violate
antitrust laws, the companies said Tuesday.
   Under the agreement signed by General Cinema and Pepsico on Nov.
30, the deal was contingent on a 1988 closure for tax reasons.
   Had the deal succeeded, it would have brought one of the nation's
biggest independent bottlers under Pepsi's control, allowing the
soft drink giant to consolidate bottling operations and reduce
costs, industry analysts said.
   The deal would have allowed General Cinema to take advantage of a
provision in the federal tax law allowing them to defer $400 million
in capital gains taxes over 20 years. That provision expired Dec. 31.
   General Cinema and Pepsico officials said Tuesday that they have
been already conferring about a new deal.
   But the announcement that the original transaction collapsed
evidently helped depress General Cinema's stock, which fell $1.50 a
share to $24 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pepsico was unchanged
at $39.50 a share.
   ``The question is, how much is it worth to them (Pepsico) and can
they continue to negotiate,'' said Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with
Dean, Witter Reynolds. ``But Pepsi feels it has a strategic fit
there and General Cinema has strategic problems of its own.''
   Jim Griffith, a spokesman for Pepsico, said it was not fair to
compare any deal made in 1988 with one that may be negotiated this
year. Griffith termed the FTC's action a ``disappointment.''
   Peter Farwell, vice-president of General Cinema, said the FTC's
move was unexpected. ``The deal as it stood in 1988 is off,'' he
said.
   ``The cost to Pepsico or the compensation to General Cinema will
be decidedly different because Uncle Sam will have his hand in the
till for more money,'' said Roy D. Burry, a senior vice-president at
the Wall Street brokerage house of Kidder, Peabody Inc. ``If a new
deal is done, the parties will have to take a lot less or pay a lot
more.''
   General Cinema, a film exhibition and soft-drink bottling concern
based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., owns and operates 1,359 movie screens
at 318 locations throughout the United States. Earnings from the
movie operations declined about 5 percent despite a slight rise in
box office revenues in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31.
   General Cinema also owns about 60 percent of the Neiman Marcus
Group, which consists of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and
Contempo Casuals stores. It has announced plans to open 10 to 12 new
Neiman Marcus stores by 1995.
   General Cinema also owns about 18 percent of the stock in Cadbury
Schweppes PLC since 1986, company officials said.
   General Cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 when it
acquired American Beverage Corp., which held Pepsi franchises in
Miami and northern Ohio. It subsequently purchased other franchises
and now has regional bottling facilities in Atlanta; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; Twinsburg, Ohio and Charleston, W.Va.
   The company's beverage unit had revenue of about $720 million for
the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31.
   Pepsico, headquartered in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the largest
soft drink and snack-foods producers, with revenues of more than
$11.5 billion in 1987.

<HEAD>Report Calls For More Spending, Better Organization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese companies are likely to beat their
American rivals to the market with products that use new
high-temperature superconductors unless the United States puts
better organization and more money into long-range development, a
White House advisory panel says.
   Important profit-making uses for superconductivity are at least a
decade away, but the United States cannot afford to leave them to
chance, the panel said in its report to President Reagan on Tuesday.
   The panel urged the creation of four to six superconductivity
consortiums scattered around the country that would unite
university, government and industry laboratories that are working on
superconductivity.
   The consortiums would cost the federal government about $25
million to $30 million a year, on top of the roughly $90 million the
government already spends on superconductivity research, the panel
said.
   In addition, the panel recommended an increase of ``a few million
dollars'' a year in grants to universities for basic research.
   Superconductors can conduct electricity without any loss of
energy from resistance when they are kept extremely cold, raising
the possibility of more efficient engines and motors, faster
computer chips and improved scientific devices such as particle
accelerators and magnetic fusion machines.
   Newly discovered materials are superconductive with less
refrigeration, which makes them cheaper and easier to use.
   However, the report said some of the hopes for superconductivity
are overblown. For example, magnetically levitated trains still may
not be practical in spite of higher-temperature materials, said
Ralph Gomory, the chairman of the panel and the chief scientist of
International Business Machines Corp.
   The proposed consortiums would close the gap between the
short-term profit focus of industry laboratories and the long-term
scientific focus of university laboratories, Gomory said.
   Americans are probably ``neck-and-neck'' with the Japanese in
basic scientific research on superconductivity, Gomory said.
   But the report said that in terms of commercial applications, the
Japanese effort is ``better structured than the U.S. both for
systematically developing new materials and for coupling these
developments closely to industry.''
   Gomory said important commercial applications are so far off that
there is plenty of time for Americans to catch up.
   ``Everybody's just out of the gate. Ahead or behind doesn't
matter. What matters is who's better structured to run,'' he said.
   The committee endorsed the current system under which federal
spending on superconductivity work is divided among five agencies.
   On the science front, it said universities should continue to be
the focal point for research, partly because they are best suited to
train future generations of scientists in the new field.
   According to the proposal, the consortiums would have a 10-year
lifespan and include 20 or more researchers with perhaps twice as
many students.
   ``This proposal minimizes the role of government, builds on the
strength of the American university system and strongly involves the
third essential element, industry.''
   Here is what the committee concluded about particular industries:
   AEROSPACE: New superconducting materials could be used in the
frigid cold of outer space, a relatively small market. Other uses
are at least a decade away.
   CHEMICALS: Chemical companies are interested in supplying
superconducting materials, but cannot do so until a market develops.
   ELECTRONICS: Superconducting materials could be used in
conjunction with standard semiconductors in hybrid circuits. Densely
packed chips probably will need to have superconducting wiring by
around the end of the century.
   POWER GENERATION: There is ``at least a possibility'' for the use
of superconducting materials in underground power transmission, in
transformers and in ship propulsion.
   TRANSPORTATION: Unless materials can be found that are
superconductive at temperatures well above room temperature, ``the
impact on the automotive industry appears to be minimal.'' Likewise,
magnetically levitated trains are not much more economically
feasible with the latest higher-temperature superconductors than
they were with low-temperature materials.
   In addition to Gomory, committee members included IBM scientist
Praveen Chaudhari; H. Kent Bowen of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology; John Foster, vice president for science and technology
at TRW Inc.; Ted Geballe of Stanford University; Ken Oshman, a
founder of Rolm Corp.; and J.R. Schrieffer of the University of
California at Santa Barbara, who won a Nobel Prize for
superconductivity research.

   The energy futures market began 1989 the same way
it ended the old year: on a strong note.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
heating oil rose 0.94 cent Tuesday to settle at 53.23 cents a
gallon, after rising 0.71 cent on Friday.
   The market was closed on Monday in observance of New Year's Day.
   The February contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline, another
refined petroleum product traded on the exchange, closed at 47.27
cents a gallon, up .14 cent from Friday, when it gained 0.87 cent.
   January West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, increased 12 cents to settle at $17.36 a barrel. The
contract rose 43 cents on Friday.
   Traders said strong seasonal demand for heating oil added a
positive tone to the market Tuesday.
   Traders also remain optimistic that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will adhere to its new production quotas, which
went into effect Jan. 1.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed in November to hold daily production
to 18.5 million barrels to help prop up sagging worldwide oil prices.

<HEAD>Jefferies Takes Stand in Stock Manipulation Trial of GAF</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former securities executive Boyd L. Jefferies,
one of the biggest victims of the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal, has begun testimony as the government's star witness in the
trial of GAF Corp. and one of its officers on stock manipulation and
fraud charges.
   Tuesday's appearance was the first time the former chairman of
Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co., a key source of evidence in at
least three major prosecutions of alleged securities fraud, has
testified in open court since he was implicated in the Boesky
scandal nearly two years ago.
   Jefferies told the court about a series of discussions he had
with James T. Sherwin, vice chairman of the GAF, concerning the
alleged manipulation of Union Carbide stock in late 1986.
   ``I had spoken to him quite often,'' Jefferies said. ``I learned
to recognize his voice.''
   Sherwin and GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical company, were
indicted by a federal grand jury here in July on charges of stock
manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and other
crimes for their alleged attempt to boost the price of Carbide, the
former target of a failed GAF takeover attempt.
   The indictment said the motive of the alleged manipulation was to
a create the false impression that Carbide stock was rising, drawing
buying interest from other investors and thereby maximizing GAF's
gain from the sale of a huge chunk of Carbide stock it had acquired.
   Sherwin allegedly asked two unidentified Jefferies &amp; Co. traders
to make Carbide's stock rise by purchasing it, and he promised to
reimburse them for any losses that might occur.
   Jefferies testified that the brokerage ultimately lost about
$40,000 on the Carbide transaction. Jefferies said when he told
Sherwin he was going to send him an investment banking bill to cover
the loss, `He said, fine.'''
   Federal prosecutors said Jefferies may be on the stand all week
in the jury trial before U.S. District Judge Mary J. Lowe, which
began early last month. GAF and Sherwin have vowed to vindicate
themselves in court.
   If convicted on all charges, the defendants face severe
penalties. Sherwin could receive a maximum sentence of 50 years in
prison and a $2.5 million fine. GAF faces $15 million in fines.
   It is the first case to go to trial in the prosecutions that stem
from disclosures by Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who
turned state's evidence and paid the government $100 million in
penalties in November 1986.
   Four months later Boesky's revelations led them to Jefferies, who
negotiated his own plea bargain and promised to cooperate in
exchange for lenient treatment.
   He agreed to plead guilty to two criminal charges, for which has
not yet been sentenced. In addition, he resigned as chairman of the
company that bears his name and promised to stay out of the
securities business for five years.
   Jefferies has proven to be one of the biggest sources of evidence
in Boesky-related prosecutions, and is expected to be the main
government witness in separate cases that have been brought against
takeover speculators Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis and Paul Bilzerian.

   The Big Three automakers, the soft drink makers
Coca-Cola and Pepsico and oil giants Exxon Corp. and Atlantic
Richfield Co. are among the best places for blacks to work, a
magazine survey says.
   Black Enterprise magazine released a list of 35 companies
Tuesday, saying those included were chosen for the employers'
commitment to affirmative action and minority recruitment.
   Earl G. Graves, the magazine's editor and publisher, said the
recent waves of corporate downsizing, takeovers and restructuring
``have significantly impacted on the numbers of black employees and
advancement opportunities for blacks in some companies.''
   But, he added, ``Our survey clearly indicates there are still
many in the corporate community strongly committed to the creation
of a work place in which minorities can make solid professional
contributions and gain positions of power and influence.
   ``Our report also shows the impetus for strong affirmative action
in corporate policy must come from the top down and be based on
bottom-line incentives for managers to support these efforts,''
Graves said.
   To compile the list of 35 companies with the best affirmative
action records, Black Enterprise said it surveyed 270 employers on
the number of minority professional and non-professional employees,
compensation, minority recruitment, management training and employee
development programs, minority vending opportunities and
contributions to black organizations.
   Others on the list include International Business Machines Corp.,
Avon Products Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., Gannett Co. Inc., McDonald's
Corp. and Amtrak.
   The magazine cited IBM for the fact that blacks comprise 12.3
percent of its 3,850 managers; Avon for an in-house management
training program; Kodak for its aggressive minority recruiting and
minority scholarships; Gannett for rewarding managers for meeting
affirmative action goals; McDonald's for its career-development and
training programs; and Amtrak for the ``sharp teeth'' of its
affirmative action program.
   Graves said minorities are expected to fill the employment rolls
as the nation's labor force shrinks.
   ``Companies who are now creating corporate cultures which include
minorities will be better positioned to meet the challenges of
domestic and international markets in the not-too-distant future,''
Graves said.
   The list is contained in the magazine's February issue, scheduled
to be on newsstands Jan. 19.

   Chrysler Motors Corp. says it will
make a 300-horsepower, V-10 engine during the 1990s primarily for
trucks but possibly for sports cars.
   Company engineer Chris Theodore said the engine, with a
displacement of about 8 liters, is being designed mainly to compete
with engines in full-size pickups made by General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
   However, officials said Tuesday as Chrysler showed off six of its
futuristic ``concept cars,'' that it may be used in automobiles. The
engine was in one of the concept cars on Tuesday _ the Dodge Viper
R-T10.
   Thomas Gale, vice president of product design at Chrysler Motors,
the car-building arm of Chrysler Corp., said the engine would be
made in the Detroit area, but refused to be specific about details.
   Chrysler now makes a 318-cubic-inch V-8 at its Mound Road engine
plant in Detroit.
   ``Jokingly we call it King Kong,'' Theodore said. ``I'm sure it
will have another name before it goes into production.''

percent on March 25, 1985, and six-month bills averaged 8.56 on
April 8, 1985.

<HEAD>Value Of EEC Food Mountain Down 56 Percent In 1 Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of European Economic Community
food in storage fell by 56 percent to $5.4 billion in the year ended
Sept. 30, with the amount of surplus butter showing the most
dramatic decline, the 12-nation trading bloc said Wednesday.
   The EEC's ``butter mountain'' declined by 837,000 metric tons to
221,000 metric tons in the 12-month period starting Sept. 30, 1987.
It costs the EEC about $354 a year for every metric ton of butter
held in cooled storage.
   Other surplus stocks also declined in the year to Sept. 30.
Cereals fell 3 million tons to 10.7 million tons, and stocks of
powdered milk fell by 708,000 tons to reach 14,000 tons.
   ``The reduction in the value of the stocks is the result of an
active policy of selling off'' cereals, butter and powdered milk at
reduced rates, EEC Commission said.
   In recent years, the EEC has revamped its agricultural policy by
cutting prices and fixing quotas in the dairy and selected other
sectors to prevent a buildup of surplus stocks.

   American auto buyers will get their first look at
Japan's new entries into the luxury car market at this year's annual
auto show in the carmaking capital of the nation.
   Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti line and Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus
line are intended to compete with European luxury cars like
Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
   Toyota, meanwhile, is continuing a legal battle with Mead Data
Central Inc. over whether the Lexus name infringed on Mead's
trademark for its Lexis data bank.
   The North American International Auto Show opened to the news
media on Tuesday and will open to the public this weekend. More than
400,000 people are expected during its nine-day run at Cobo Hall in
downtown Detroit.
   ``There will be some glitches, but everything is pretty much on
track,'' Dan Hayes, executive vice president of the Detroit
Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsors the show, said
Tuesday. Such events in Europe often are sponsored by manufacturers,
but in the United States, dealers typically put them on.
   A competing Chicago show runs from Feb. 11-19. But this year,
organizers of the Detroit show say they are giving Chicago a run for
its money.
   The number of exhibits will increase to 41, 17 more than in 1988.
Floor space has increased by 60 percent to about 700,000 square feet.
   Some of the exhibitors are using two stories to show off their
products and most will have audio or video presentations and models
explaining ride, comfort and suspensions of new cars.
   Hayes and other association executives like to brag about the
``firsts'' scheduled for this show.
   Also, Motor Trend magazine has moved its announcement for the
1989 car of the year to the Detroit show for the first time and
several car companies are showing off their latest crop of ``concept
cars,'' vehicles which may indicate the future of driving.
   Chrysler Corp. showed off six of its concept cars Tuesday at the
company headquarters in Highland Park. They include the tiny
Plymouth Speedster, just under 11 feet long, or about a foot shorter
than the width of a highway traffic lane, and the
aerodynamic-appearing Jeep concept vehicle.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose a modest 0.3 percent in November, overcoming declines in
the military and transportation sectors, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $227.7 billion, up $630
million from the October number.
   Orders had increased a sharp 2.0 percent in October after falling
1.9 percent in September.
   Over the last several months, new orders have followed a see-saw
pattern, pushed back and forth by fluctuations in the volatile
defense and transportation sectors.
   Defense orders plummeted 16.7 percent to $8.9 billion in
November, following a 43.2 percent increase in October.
   Transportation orders fell 6.1 percent to $32.8 billion, with
declines posted in all subcategories except commercial aircraft. In
October, transporation orders soared 10.4 percent.
   Excluding the military, orders in November rose a strong 1.1
percent following a 0.6 percent gain a month earlier. Excluding
transportation, orders rose 1.4 percent in November and 0.5 percent
in October.
   Meanwhile, the key category of non-defense capital goods, a
closely watched barometer of industry investment plans, rose 3.0
percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $35.7 billion. It has
fallen 0.7 percent in October and 10.2 percent in September, raising
concern that the year-long boom in capital spending was tapering off.
   American manufacturers have enjoyed brisk export sales as the
decline in the value of the dollar has lowered the cost of U.S.
goods overseas. Consequently, they have increased spending to
modernize and expand their factories.
   Orders for durable goods, ``big ticket'' items ranging from
toasters to tanks, were virtually unchanged in November at $122.8
billion.
   However, electrical machinery shot up 8.3 percent on the strength
of a 26.2 percent gain in orders for communication equipment, most
of it from the military.
   Orders for non-durable goods climbed 0.6 percent in November
following a 0.9 percent gain a month before. The department said
gains at chemical plants and textile mills accounted for most of the
gains.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were up 0.5 percent in November
to a seasonally adjusted $224.1 billion.

   Securities brokerage Security Pacific Hoare Govett
announced Wednesday it was getting out of the British and
international bond markets and laying off 140 people.
   Chief executive Peter Voss said the company was abandoning the
bond market operations because of increasing competitive pressures
and its assessment that the markets will remain unattractive for the
next three to five years.
   He also announced that the company's Japanese operations will be
reshaped so that Security Pacific Hoare Govett will no longer be
marketing Japanese shares and warrants.
   The announcement by Security Pacific Hoare Govett, the
international merchant banking arm of Security Pacific merchant
bank, was the latest in a series of cutbacks by firms in London's
financial district.
   Merchant bankers Morgan Grenfell laid off 450 staff just before
Christmas when it ceased the wholesale buying and selling of shares
due to a lack of recovery in the stock market following the October
1984 crash.
   Stockbroker McCaughan Dyson Capel Myers laid off 40 stockbroking
analysts and sales staff in early December when it closed its
department dealing with research services in the European markets.
   Exco, the money market subsidiary of British and Commonwealth,
closed its PG Securities operation with the loss of 56 jobs in early
December. PG Securities was a broker in the Eurobond market.
   Bond market business tripled after the deregulation of Britain's
financial markets, known as Big Bang, in October 1986 but the market
had to support nearly 30 dealers compared with five before.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. executives today rolled out a
new line of multipurpose passenger vehicles for 1990 and for the
first time included an Oldsmobile MPV in its stable.
   William W. Lane, Oldsmobile General manager, said the utility
vehicle will give Olds the chance to capitalize on the growth in the
minivan market. The trend was started and is dominated largely by
Chrysler Corp.
   Chevrolet General Manager Bob Burger said Chevrolet's Lumina,
Oldsmobile's Silhouette, and the Pontiac Transport SE, will be built
at the GM plant in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   Production of the vehicles is expected to reach 100,000 during
the 1990 model year, rising to 225,000 in later years, Burger said.
   Lane said he expects the minivan market to sell 1 million
vehicles a year in the 1990s, compared with 750,000 sold annually
now.
   Chevrolet and Pontiac currently produce minivans and share the GM
production on a rough 65 percent to 35 percent basis, Burger said.
   Lane declined to speculate on what percentage Oldsmobile would
garner in the new production. He predicted most of Oldsmobile sales
would come from crossovers from other manufactuers.
   The GM guiding principle, he said, is ``he who sells them is the
one who earns them,'' meaning that sales dictate the production
split among GM divisions.
   Lane said Oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business
because 1.1 million customers switched from cars to light trucks in
1988.
   ``Among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market,
34 percent purchased a midsized van,'' he said.
   In an elaborate news conference featuring the three MPVs, the
Lumina sedan, the Corvette ZR-1, the Pontiac Stinger concept car and
Oldsmobile's Aerotech II, GM officials said the company is moving
forward quickly in aerodynamic design. It was the first time GM
divisions have shared a news conference to unveil new vehicles.
   The displays were presented at the North American International
Auto Show, which opens to the public Saturday in Detroit. Forty-one
other manufacturers are showing off new models designed to attract a
greater share of the 15 million-vehicle U.S. car and truck market.

   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a calm follow-through to the
previous session's early run-up and late sell-off.
   Analysts said expectations of new export sales should continue to
support the crop futures markets.
   ``I still think the front end of the wheat market could easily
move beyond $4.50 and corn could test $3 a bushel,'' said Arthur
Parrish, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   But they said Tuesday's heavy profit-taking, particularly in the
corn and soybean pits, had taken some of the wind out of the
markets' sails.
   ``The speculative buying that fuels major advances has been kind
of hesitant,'' said Katharina Zimmer, a wheat market analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.39{ a bushel; corn was \

<HEAD>IRS Commissioner Says Agency Doing Utmost to Provide Right Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commissioner of the Internal Revenue
Service said today the agency is making a major effort to ensure
that taxpayers receive the right answers when they call the IRS.
   One of every four answers from the IRS were wrong last year,
Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs acknowledged, ``and we've gone back
to the drawing board ... to try to improve accuracy levels.''
   ``We hope to improve substantially this year,'' Gibbs said as the
agency launched its annual campaign to urge taxpayers to file their
returns as early as possible.
   The IRS has increased the number of supervisors to oversee
employees who answer technical questions by phone, Gibbs said. A big
plus, he added, was the decision to put about 1,000 temporary
telephone ``assisters'' on the permanent payroll, which has allowed
the IRS to enhance their training.
   Gibbs said taxpayers who file early are apt to receive any refund
in three or four weeks. Late filing can mean a six-week wait _
assuming the IRS encounters no problems such as computer breakdowns
that plagued the 1985 filing season.
   He said the temporary amnesty that allowed taxpayers to pay too
little of their tax in advance without penalty, mainly because of
underwithholding due to the massive 1986 tax overhaul, will not be
renewed.
   ``We are going back to business as normal ... urging people to
get their withholding correct,'' Gibbs said. ``There will be
penalties asserted against those who do not.''
   Gibbs unveiled a series of print and broadcast commercials,
donated by the Advertising Council, aimed at encouraging early
filing. The central theme of the commercials is that taxpayers who
procrastinate may find themselves in a nightmare of their own
creation when they have to rush to meet the filing deadline.
   Most taxpayers will have less to fear with their 1988 returns,
compared with those they filed a year ago, Gibbs said. That is
because there are relatively few changes in the tax law that affect
the returns due by April 17.
   But there is no doubt that chances of making mistakes increase
when filers rush into their returns at the last minute without ample
preparation, Gibbs said. Last year, taxpayers and IRS employees
combined for an estimated 20 million mistakes.
   The agency expects 109 million returns will be filed this year,
up from 107 million a year ago. About three of every four will
generate refunds.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Up Modest 0.3 Percent In November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
increased by a modest 0.3 percent during November, according to a
government report Wednesday that some economists said reflected
continued but slower economic growth.
   Buyers placed orders worth a seasonally adjusted $227.7 billion
during the month, up $630 million from October. Orders had risen 2
percent in October and fallen 1.9 percent a month earlier.
   For the first 11 months of the year, orders were up 9.3 percent
over the comparable period in 1987.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., said the latest report was ``consistent with the
other evidence that the economy is certainly still on the upswing''
although slower growth is expected during 1989.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, items expected to last
at least three years, were virtually unchanged during November at
$122.8 billion, although there was a hefty 8.3 percent increase in
requests for electrical machinery, mostly communication equipment
for the military.
   In the volatile transportation and defense industries, orders
were down 6.1 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively, following
increases in the previous month of 10.4 percent and 43.2 percent.
Virtually all transportation categories except commercial aircraft
declined in November.
   Among non-durable goods, orders were up 0.6 percent to $105
billion, following a 0.9 percent gain in October. The largest
November increases among orders for non-durable goods were in
chemicals and textile mill products, while the biggest decreases
were in petroleum products and apparel.
   Robert G. Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said the slower rate of growth in November indicates ``new
orders seem to have lost much of their forward momentum,'' except in
the civilian aircraft industry.
   ``If you exclude that (aircraft), orders seem to be in a bit of a
lull,'' he said. ``The implication is that orders are going to have
to gather steam if manufacturing is going to continue the pace of
last year.''
   Dederick said weaker growth is not necessarily bad, given a
Federal Reserve Board preference for subdued growth to stave off
inflation.
   Samuel D. Kahan, of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities in
Chicago, said that while the November increase was modest, ``the
trend is still up. Moreover, the backlog of unfilled orders
continues to rise, suggesting that growth in industrial production
still will be fairly good.''
   He said growth in the fourth quarter of 1988 had been expected to
be strong but debate still was open on ``whether there will be some
kind of slowing in the new year. So far, the economy keeps chugging
along.''
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, which reflect
industry investment plans, orders were up 3 percent, much of it due
to demand for civilian aircraft.
   Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers
said the report indicated ``a robust order picture for manufacturing
in general.''
   ``We are not getting any reports from manufacturers of any
slowdown in orders across the broad spectrum in manufacturing,
indicating the capital spending boom is going to continue in 1989,''
he said.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were up 0.5 percent in November
to a seasonally adjusted $224.1 billion.

   L. William Seidman is a lot like a protective
parent when it comes to the nation's banking funds.
   Nothing gets his guard up more than talk of a proposed matchup
between his ``baby,'' the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures commercial bank deposits, and the wayward thrift insurer,
the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp.
   ``People keep telling us they have to get married, and we're
looking at the bride very carefully,'' said Seidman, FDIC chairman
for the past three years and one of the most forceful regulators in
Washington.
   As he tries to help set the banking agenda for the Bush
administration, Seidman (pronounced Seed-Mun) is blunt about his
feelings on the thrift crisis and opposition to an FDIC-FSLIC
merger, which some propose as a step toward solving FSLIC's money
problems. Banks, though, worry such a merger will result in
skyrocketing insurance premiums.
   ``There was a time when you could have merged the two. (But) a
merger now will bankrupt the funds,'' Seidman said in an interview.
   Unlike the FDIC, FSLIC is technically insolvent due to the large
number of problem-thrift bailouts. Last year alone, FSLIC spent
$38.6 billion to help merge or sell 222 insolvent S&amp;Ls. Hundreds
more remain financially shaky.
   Seidman proposes, among other things, that the government bite
the bullet by spending another $30 billion in 1989 to close 100 of
the sickest thrifts. The other problem S&amp;Ls could be dealt with over
a longer period of time.
   He also wants the government to consider revamping the entire
deposit insurance system to include new broad powers for his agency
and splitting FSLIC from its parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board.
   ``If I were advising the president I think he should do it
(resolve the thrift crisis) early on in the honeymoon days ... when
it's someone else's problem,'' he said. ``If he waits too long, it
becomes his problem. It's not a politically attractive issue.''
   Seidman's zeal is understandable. He had his own problems after
taking the helm of the FDIC in October 1985, becoming its 14th
chairman.
   For one thing, he inherited the fallout from Continental Illinois
Corp.'s near demise a year before. During his tenure, Seidman has
contended with more than 600 bank failures, including a
post-Depression record 221 in 1988.
   The FDIC posted its first operating loss last year, although it
remains firmly solvent, with a net worth of around $15 billion at
the end of 1988.
   Seidman, 67, came to the job with surprising little banking
experience.
   At the time of his appointment, he was dean of the College of
Business at Arizona State University. Before that, he served as vice
chairman at copper giant Phelps Dodge Corp. and a managing parter in
the accounting firm Seidman &amp; Seidman, started by his father and
uncle.
   His business acumen and investment savvy also have helped make
him a millionaire many times over, and he has several homes around
the country, including one in Hawaii. He shares some of his business
smarts in a just-published book he co-authored, ``Competitiveness:
the Executive's Guide to Success.''
   Seidman also is no stranger to Republican politics. From 1974 to
1977 he served as assistant for economic affairs under President
Ford, a childhood friend from his hometown Grand Rapids, Mich. From
1983 to 1984 he was co-chairman of the White House Conference on
Productivity.
   He also ran an unsuccessful campaign to become Michigan auditor
general in the 1960s.
   All that experience ``and my good looks,'' Seidman said, has
helped in tackling the banking world. There have been some big
issues to tackle, including: the Latin debt problem, the campaign to
expand into investment banking, and lately, the debt-financed
takeover craze, which Seidman warns could endanger big lending banks.
   ``My experience says that credibility is the No. 1 asset you have
to have,'' Seidman said, ``and telling it like it is is the best way
to deal with things.''
   A free-market advocate, Seidman has been called a team player by
those who know him well. But he's also not afraid to speak his mind.
   For instance, at the American Bankers Association annual
convention in Honolulu last fall, a red-faced Seidman denounced the
comptroller of the currency, Robert L. Clarke, who is on the board
of the FDIC, for suggesting that commercial banks prepare for a
possible FDIC-FSLIC merger. Just the day before the two men held a
friendly, informal news conference.
   ``He (Seidman) feels very strongly that the resolution (of the
thrift crisis) should not come on the backs of commercial banks,''
said James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with the investment
firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods.
   ``He has been a good steward for the industry at a time when the
effects of deregulation (of the 1970s) have caused signficant
turmoil as shown by the bank failures over the years.
   ``He has been a breath of fresh air.''
   Short, stout and nearly bald, Seidman bares a slight resemblance
to the late actor William Frawley, known as Fred Mertz on the ``I
Love Lucy'' television series. He has the same gravelly voice.
   But he's far more physically active than the Mertz character was,
enjoying polo and a variety of other sports _ and not as grouchy,
especially to his six children and several grandchildren.
   ``He knows how to relax. It's a wonderful gift,'' said his wife,
Sally. ``He could have a horrendous day and then he just forgets
about it when he gets home.''
   While at work, Seidman also tries to keep things informal,
remaining accessible to banking analysts and the press. If it were
up to him, he'd probably be wearing sweat shirts and casual slacks
to work.
   Before attending a recent ABA dinner in Honolulu, ``He asked me,
`Do you think I have to wear a suit and tie?','' Mrs. Seidman
confided. ``And I said, `Yeah, you better.'''

<HEAD>World Bank Raises Interest Rate; First Time Since 1982</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank is raising interest rates for
more prosperous Third World countries to 7.65 percent annually, the
first such increase since the bank began lending at variable rates
in 1982, officials said Wednesday.
   The rate will apply during the first six months of this year on
$37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries, said Sheldon
Rappaport, a spokesman for the bank.
   For the second half of 1988, the rate was 7.59 percent. The
increase amounts to only 0.06 percent but will cost the borrowers an
additional $11 million, Rappaport estimated. The rate is based on
the cost of the bank's own borrowings and will be recalculated in
mid-1989. The bank gets most of its funds from borrowing on world
markets.
   The bank is owned by 151 governments, with the United States
holding the largest block of shares, and is the biggest single
source of aid to Third World countries used to help raise their
living standards. It lends more than $19 billion a year.
   When it introduced variable interest rates on most of its loans
in July 1982, the annual rate was 11.43 percent. Since then, the
rate has been reduced each time it was recalculated, twice a year.
   The poorest countries, which borrow from the bank's International
Development Association, will continue to get loans for 40 years at
less than 1 percent a year, with long grace periods during which
only interest is due.

<HEAD>Tax Chief Says File Early, IRS Will Respect Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's chief tax collector urged
Americans on Wednesday to file returns early this year and said the
IRS for its part will fully respect a new ``taxpayer bill of
rights'' and try to provide filers better advice.
   Lawrence B. Gibbs, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,
said of the taxpayer-rights bill at a news conference.``We feel it
is a good bill ... (and) we are going to implement the letter as
well as the spirit of the law,''
   The legislation, enacted in reponse to scattered reports of
abuses by IRS employees, requires the agency to fully inform
taxpayers of their rights any time an audit is begun. Other
provisions extend the notice required before the IRS can seize
property and prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the
basis of how much they collect.
   Gibbs acknowledged that IRS employees gave the wrong answer to
one of every four technical questions asked last filing season. ``We
were not satisfied last year,'' he said, ``and we've gone back to
the drawing board ... to try to improve accuracy levels.''
   ``We hope to improve substantially this year,'' said Robert
LeBaube, director of taxpayer services. One significant factor, he
said, is that the IRS was able to put on the permanent payroll 1,000
``telephone assisters'' who in past years would have been hired only
for the tax season. This allowed the agency to intensify the
training of those employees.
   ``There is a clear correlation between experience and accuracy,''
LeBaube said.
   In addition, the number of assisters working under each
supervisor has been reduced from about 20 to about 12, he said.
   Gibbs said the IRS is convinced that taxpayers who file early,
avoiding time pressures that grow near the filing deadline, are much
more likely to have an error-free return. For that reason, the IRS,
the Advertising Council and the news media are combining efforts
again this year to deliver the ``file early'' message.
   ``Make your taxes less taxing,'' read the print ads. ``Do them
today.''
   The television commercials attempt, in a good-natured way, to
scare taxpayers into not waiting until the April 17 filing deadline.
``Why let it haunt you when you can do something about it? asks one
commercial featuring a howling wind and a bewildered taxpayer who
might have stepped off another planet.
   Gibbs said most taxpayers will have less to be confused about
than they did a year ago. Most of the hundreds of changes brought
about by the 1986 tax overhaul showed up for the first time on
returns filed last year. There are very few significant changes
affecting returns that will be filed this year.
   Early filers are likely to get any refund within three or four
weeks, Gibbs said. Those who file in late March or April may have to
wait six weeks or longer.
   Taxpayers in 36 states who qualify for refunds may be able to
file their returns electronically this year. The remaining states
will be added next year. As many as 2 million returns _ four times
the number last year _ are expected to be filed electronically this
year, Gibbs said.
   Electronic returns must be filed through paid professional return
preparers, from one computer to another. This significantly reduces
IRS paperwork.
   The agency expects 109 million returns to be filed this year, up
from 107 million a year ago. About three of every four will generate
refunds.
   Gibbs said the IRS will not renew a temporary amnesty that last
year allowed taxpayers to avoid a penalty when they had too little
tax withheld from their paychecks.
   ``We are going back to business as normal ... urging people to
get their withholding correct,'' Gibbs said. ``There will be
penalties asserted against those who do not.''
   In general, taxpayers have until Jan. 17 to pay 90 percent of
estimated 1988 tax liability and avoid any underpayment penalty.
Taxpayers with significant amounts of income not subject to
withholding _ such as interest and dividends _ could be subject to
penalties unless they meet that 90 percent target.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Lilly's Attempt To Hire Competitor's Former Manager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. has been barred temporarily
from hiring a former product manager for a competing pharmaceuticals
company on the grounds that he knows too many trade secrets.
   Marion Superior Court Judge James S. Kirsch issued a temporary
restraining order Monday to stop Lilly from hiring Robert B. Summers
of Indianapolis.
   Summers had been an employee of the Indianapolis division of
Boehringer Mannheim Corp., a subsidiary of a multi-national
pharmaceuticals company based in Germany.
   Boehringer alleged in court documents that Summers ``has
knowledge of Boehringer trade secrets,'' and could use them to do
``irreparable harm'' to the company.
   Boehringer is seeking a permanent injunction barring Summers from
ever working for Lilly. Kirsch's order is temporary, pending a
hearing Friday.
   Summers had worked as a product manager in Boehringer's
diagnostics division before Lilly hired him to be manager of
marketing services for Elco Diagnostics Co., a new Lilly unit to
market diagnostic products.
   Among the first products to be marketed by the new Lilly division
will be a glucose monitor and a line of insulin pumps. Summers had
access to confidential information about similar products at
Boehringer, a subsidiary of BMC International Ltd., according to
court documents.
   The company said Summers' acceptance of the job would violate a
non-competition agreement he signed with Boehringer. Boehringer
officials said Summers had agreed not to work for any competitor for
six months should he leave the company. He resigned Dec. 20.
   Edward A. West, a spokesman for Lilly, said the
Indianapolis-based company was reviewing the court order and would
have no comment.

<HEAD>Georgia Firm Is A Leader in Building Athletic Fields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OMEGA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the National Football League's top two
teams brawl in Miami on Jan. 22 for Super Bowl XXIII, one of the
unsung heros will be the hybrid grass on the playing field developed
near this tiny south Georgia town.
   Southern Turf Nurseries Inc., a leader in constructing and
renovating athletic fields and golf courses, gave Miami's Joe Robbie
Stadium a state-of-the-art playing field last year, using a tough
strain developed at the University of Georgia's Coastal Plain
Experiment Station in Tifton and a patented underground
moisture-control system.
   The grass covers spots quickly and is extremely durable but
plush. It's used in nearly all new athletic fields and golf courses
in the Southeast, said Southern Turf spokesman Steve Mathis.
   ``A good athletic field is expensive,'' Mathis said. ``We can
build a field for less than $100,000 without drainage. But it can go
to $1 million for a top-of-the line baseball field.''
   Omega, a rural farming community of 1,000 residents, has a couple
of cotton gins and some turn-of-the century brick buildings that
house a grocery store, a hardware store and a few other businesses.
   During the summer, 15 to 18 tractor trailers leave the Omega farm
every day to supply Southern Turf crews working all over the
Southeast. The firm also air freights sod and sprigs around the
world.
   ``When our little phone rings here in Omega, it could be somebody
in Hong Kong,'' said General Manager Steve Gibson. ``You never know
who might call.''
   At the Dolphins' stadium, workers installed a system dubbed
Prescription Athletic Turf, or PAT. PAT fields have a network of
pipes beneath the grass for irrigating when the soil is too dry and
removing moisture when it is too wet.
   Southern Turf has installed similar systems at Florida State
University's stadium in Tallahassee and at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium, home of the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons and
baseball's Atlanta Braves.
   To install a PAT system, workers remove the top 12 inches of
soil, level the field and dig a network of shallow ditches that
provide clearance for the water pipes.
   After the entire field is covered with plastic, a bulldozer
pushes sand over the plastic and workers cover the sand with a layer
of peat moss.
   Workers use machines to blend the peat moss and sand, forming a
new 12-inch layer of topsoil, then grass sprigs are planted or sod
installed.
   Sensors buried in the field turn the system's pumps on and off,
maintaining proper moisture levels.
   ``Most people, when they see a field, only see the grass,'' said
Mathis. ``The real work is underneath.''
   Artificial turf is more expensive to install and maintain than
natural grass, and it is less popular with players, Mathis said.
Some experts believe artificial turf contributes to sports injuries.
   ``Instead of mowing it, you're scrubbing it, trying to remove the
blood, the chewing tobacco and the beer,'' he said. ``In seven to 10
years you have to spend another $500,000 replacing the rug.''
   After Southern Turf installs a grass field, it's the
groundskeepers' responsibility to maintain it.
   The Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium Authority recently ordered
1,200 square feet of sod to repair unsafe and unsightly areas. Steve
Ortmayer, the San Diego Chargers' director of football operations,
described the playing surface as ``the poorest I've ever seen.''
   Mathis said such comments are embarrassing for his firm and he is
optimistic the stadium authority will heed the company's suggestion
to hire a year-round groundskeeper. At present the stadium has a
groundskeeper only for baseball.
   ``We know our job was done right,'' said Mathis. ``We've
recommended on several occasions that they hire a man 12 months a
year.''
   Since its founding 40 years ago, Southern Turf has planted more
than 2,000 athletic fields and golf courses around the world,
including the Augusta National Golf &amp; Country Club in Augusta, Ga.,
where the Masters Tournament is played, the Assayegh Soccer Field in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.
   Customers also include the Daytona International Speedway, the
Gator Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the New Orleans Saints, Hialeah race
track and many major universitie Southeast,
including the University of Georgia.

<HEAD>Wheat Closes At New 7{-Year High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed strongly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat and soybeans
gaining sharply on reports of new export business.
   Wheat for near-month delivery surged to a 7{-year high near $4.50
a bushel on news that China had bought 440,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices, analysts said.
   Soybeans for January delivery climbed more than 14 cents a bushel
on rumors that the Chinese were seeking to buy as much as 1 million
metric tons of U.S. soybeans.
   ``The best performer overall has been the wheat market,'' said
grain-market analyst Arthur Parrish with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   ``Wheat's an export-driven market as you get into the latter part
of season and with exports being such as they are, almost on a par
with last year, that speaks very well of that market,'' he said. ``I
continue to see more upside in wheat.''
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 8\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.47{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 5} cents higher with March at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were } cent
to 2 cents higher with March at $2.45} a bushel; soybeans were 7

   Braniff Inc. on Wednesday announced a bold stroke
designed to put the regional airline in closer competition with the
nation's major carriers, saying it will acquire 50 Airbus Industrie
A320 planes and has options to get another 50 in a deal valued at up
to $3.5 billion.
   The deal could nearly triple the fleet size of Braniff, a carrier
with 53 jets that has endured three changes of ownership, a Chapter
11 bankruptcy reorganization, a major recapitalization and the
transfer of its major operations to Kansas City from Dallas in the
past six years. The airline has vowed to become a more competitive
force in the industry.
   ``Today's announcement, I think, takes us a giant step forward
toward making that goal a reality,'' William McGee, Braniff's
chairman, told a news conference in New York.
   The move also represents one of the largest single orders for
jets produced by Airbus, a European aircraft consortium that has
emerged as a major competitor against the U.S. giants of the
industry, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The Airbus A320 is a 150-seat, highly efficient aircraft used
widely to replace aging jets, which requires only two pilots in the
cockpit rather than the customary three. It was unclear how
Braniff's acquisition of these planes would affect previously
disclosed plans to acquire 23 Boeing 737s from AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines.
   ``It's a sizable infusion of new capacity in Braniff,'' said
Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``It will certainly allow Braniff to rationalize and modernize their
fleet and be much more competitive.''
   Braniff currently operates 25 Boeing 727s, 10 Boeing 737s and 18
BAC-111s, built by British Aerospace PLC.
   Last June, investment group BIA-COR Holdings Inc. acquired
Dallas-based Braniff for $100 million from Dalfort Aviation Inc.,
which is owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago. Through the
investor group, PaineWebber Inc. controls a majority stake in the
airline.
   The group appointed five top executives from Piedmont Airlines to
manage Braniff. McGee, who had been Piedmont's chairman, helped
build that airline into the nation's ninth-largest carrier, and one
of the most profitable airlines, before it was acquired by USAir
Group Inc. in 1987.
   Kevin Murphy, who follows the industry for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
suggested that the current team at Braniff could be beefing up the
airline in preparation for selling it.
   ``Our principal objective is to grow Kansas City,'' McGee told
the news conference, referring to Braniff's main hub.
   He said the airline may introduce international service from
Kansas City as well as first class service on existing flights.
McGee said he expects Braniff to join the ranks of the airline
majors _ as measured by $1 billion or more in annual revenue _
within a year and a half.
   The carrier should become profitable by the end of this year, the
Braniff chief projected.
   Another airline analyst, who asked not to be identified, said
Braniff needs to guard against getting too big _ the predicament
which prompted its bankruptcy in 1982.
   ``You don't try to dance with the elephants,'' he said.
   McGee confirmed reports that the deal includes 16 planes
originally intended for Pan Am Corp., which recently decided to
scrap an order of A320s in exchange for a $115 million payment from
Airbus. Pan Am had a firm order for 16 of the aircraft and an option
on 34 more.
   In a separate statement Wednesday, Pan Am also confirmed that it
had transferred the Airbus order to Braniff and announced that it
will buy up to four new Airbus A310-300 long-range planes instead.
   ``While the A320 is a fine aircraft, our current route structure
and our near-term scheduling plans do not require introduction of
this aircraft type at this time,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas G.
Plaskett said.
   Engines for the Airbus planes, which are included in the price,
will be supplied by IAE International Aero Engines, a consortium of
U.S., British, West German, Japanese and Italian engine makers which
is based in East Hartford, Conn. The U.S. partner is Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft of East Hartford.
   The deal would be worth the $3.5 billion only if Braniff
exercises options to acquire all 100 planes. Airbus will sell the
first 42 planes to a financing group, which will in turn lease them
to Braniff. Airbus will have to make its own financing arrangements
for the other eight in the first group of 50.
   The members of the financing group are GPA Group Ltd. of Shannon,
Ireland, an aircraft leasing company which has an option to buy 10
percent of Braniff; Airbus; and the engine supplier, IAE.

<HEAD>Borden Puts Corporate Raiders On Notice Through Unusual Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. put corporate raiders on notice
Wednesday that if an unwanted buyer tries to chop up the food and
chemical giant, Borden's 25 top managers will quit en masse under an
unusual takeover defense.
   ``We think any potential raider would think twice about losing
that group at once,'' said R.J. Ventres, Borden's chairman and chief
executive officer. He added that he believed banks and investment
houses would be reluctant to loan money or raise funds for such a
raider.
   Ventres said the New York-based company knew of no takeover
attempt, and that Borden already has a poison pill plan designed to
fend off an unwanted suitor.
   Instead, he told reporters at a news conference, the new plan was
devised to ensure that if such an attempt were made, Borden
stockholders would receive what the company considers a fair price.
   To determine that price, the company first would calculate its
value through traditional methods, such as analyzing cash flow and
market share. To that figure would be added at least half of the
``strategic'' value that a raider could obtain by breaking up the
company, consolidating production and other efficiencies obtained
after takeovers, he said.
   An alternate way of determining ``fair'' value would be if the
takeover offer would result in the cash purchase of 85 percent of
Borden's ``disinterested'' shares _ those not already held by the
purchaser, Borden's directors or top management.
   If a raider failed to meet either one of those tests, the
``people plan'' would go into effect. Under that plan, if any one of
the top 25 Borden managers were dismissed after a takeover without
cause, all 25 would leave the company.
   In other words, if a raider took over Borden at less than the
``fair'' price, and then tried to sell off one of Borden's
divisions, the head of that division would be considered dismissed
without cause, and the 24 other top executives would tender
resignations. The agreements with the 25 would be in force for three
years after a takeover.
   ``In effect, if (a bidder) refused to pay our shareholders a fair
price under this new standard, it would be difficult for him to
restructure or sell off parts of the company for a period of three
years,'' Ventres said. ``The moment he tried, he would lose the key
operating management.''
   Ventres said the 25 managers agreed to the plan because they have
invested an average of 21 years in the company and want it to remain
independent. They also received enhancements in their employment
contracts, he said.
   Under their previous contracts, each would have received two to
three years' pay upon termination after a takeover, depending on the
number of years of service. Under the enhanced contracts, each would
receive up to three years' pay. Each also would receive a stock
option equal to his last stock option.
   Ventres said the total cost of the employment contracts, should
they be terminated upon a hostile takeover and breakup, would range
from $35 million in the first year of the three-year period, when
each would receive three years' pay, to $10 million in the third
year, when each would receive a minimum amount.
   He rejected characterizing the contracts as ``golden
parachutes.'' He said they were standard employment contracts that
were enhanced slightly under the new plan.
   John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the plan was unique, but questioned its
effectiveness.
   ``It's not really going to stand in the way of an all-cash bid
that the shareholders view as fair,'' he said. ``I just view it as
another form of a poison pill, that might make Borden a little less
vulnerable to a takevoer, but I stress the word little.''
   He added that Borden did not seem a likely takover target for two
reasons: Its management has done a good job boosting its stock
price, and nearly 40 percent of its sales volume is in milk, a
business in which a company has a hard time controlling the
marketplace. Corporate raiders, he said, usually target companies
that have a firm grip on their markets.
   ``It does show one thing about Borden: that there is a
camaraderie of top managers,'' he said. ``They do emphasize the word
team. They all socialize together. It's a real good environment.''
   For 1987, Borden had a profit of $267 million on sales of $6.5
billion; it estimates its sales last year rose to $7.2 billion. The
company is a leader in the dairy, snack food, pasta, grocery
products, wall covering, forest product resins and packaging-films
fields.

   If you ever wonder why so much borrowed money can
go into leveraged buyouts at such high interest rates, consider
this: Most of it is tax-deductible.
   And if you wonder why Americans don't save more, consider that
interest earned, even on piddling savings accounts at modest rates,
is subject to income taxes.
   Take the idea a step further:
   Untaxed money for leveraged buyouts tends to push up interest
rates, simply because borrowers will pay higher rates; moreover,
such borrowing may diminish funds available for more productive
corporate uses.
   Meanwhile, taxes on interesta connecting hub at

   ``Although O'Hare is the world's busiest airport, the Chicago

of air transportation to Asia,'' Wolf said.
   ``The situation is unfair to the Chicago area and runs contrary
to the interests of the United States,'' he said.
   Under United's proposal, it would fly nonstop from Chicago to

<TEXT>
   More than 700 cars and trucks went on display
Wednesday at the North American Automobile Show, and if the new
models are any indication, the cars of the '90s will have a
decidedly wind-swept look.
   The newly renamed Detroit Auto Show began two days of media
previews with the introduction of a new luxury car line from Japan,
a new domestic minivan and questions about whether the nameplate of
another Japanese entry in the high-priced car niche will be covered
up in a trademark dispute.
   Also at the show, General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith said
the world's largest automaker expected to post a record profit for
1988, though he declined to give a figure.
   GM's previous record year was 1984, when the automaker posted
earnings of $4.52 billion on sales of $83.89 billion. For 1987, GM
had a profit of $3.55 billion on revenue of $101.78 billion.
   Smith also predicted the Big Three _ GM, Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. _ would earn a record $11 billion in 1988, though he
did not break it down by company.
   The 700,000 square feet of Cobo Hall lit up with neon, videos and
presentations to show off the products of 41 automakers.
   Gleaming new cars turned slowly on display platforms as models
practiced their speeches. Dancers warmed up at the Toyota exhibit,
smoke poured from a Dodge truck display and workers put finishing
touches on carpeting as reporters and company executives wandered by.
   The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is used to
introduce new models and to gauge public interest to futuristic
``concept'' cars.
   The common denominator for the hundreds of cars on display is
smooth lines. Some say the streamlined look, which clicked at Ford
Motor Co. with the Taurus and Sable models in 1983, is firmly
entrenched in automobiles and light trucks.
   GM showed off its ``Multi Purpose Vehicle,'' or minivan, for 1990
that it will market through its Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac
dealers.
   Meanwhile, high-priced cars for the 1990s are getting a boost at
the show. Nissan Motor Corp. officials unveiled three cars from its
new Infiniti line _ a two-door coupe and convertible and a four-door
sedan. The cars, expected to be in Infiniti dealer showrooms in a
year, will range in price from about $22,000 to $40,000.
   The cars are targeted at West German luxury performance cars made
by BMW and Mercedes-Benz that often are favored by the 35- to
54-year-old buyer on the way up the financial ladder.
   ``The first aim is the large base of Japanese owners who are
moving up in the 1990s,'' said Infiniti General Manager William
Bruce.
   He declined to predict sales of the cars other than to say they
are expected to be modest. About 100 dealers have been signed up to
carry the cars, which will be marketed separately from Nissan cars
and trucks.
   Toyota Motor Corp. has scheduled an introduction of its Lexus
luxury car line for Thursday, but a lawsuit filed by Mead Data
Central Inc. could mar the car's unveiling. Mead claims the Lexus
names infringes on the trademark for one of its computer data-base
services, Lexis.
   A federal judge in New York last week issued a restraining order
barring Toyota from using the Lexus name, but an appeals court
stayed that order. A hearing on extending the stay is scheduled for
Thursday in New York.
   The Lexus name appears 29 times on signs and cars at the
company's display at the auto show. Toyota spokesman Kurt Von
Zumwalt said arrangements have been made to cover the names if the
injunction goes into effect.

   Stock prices staged a sharp rally Wednesday,
rebounding from the losses they suffered in the first session of
1989.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 23.93 on Tuesday,
climbed 33.04 points to 2,177.68.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,187 up, 331 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.70 million
shares, up from 128.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 176.03 million shares.
   The dollar rose in foreign-exchange trading, reversing its
decline Tuesday.
   Analysts said traders bid the dollar up amid the uncertainty
raised by news that U.S. planes shot down two Libyan fighter jets
over the Mediterranean Sea.
   But demand for stocks was limited, brokers said, by caution in
advance of Friday's report from the government on the employment
situation for December.
   If the data show strong growth in payroll employment, many Wall
Streeters believe the Federal Reserve would be more likely to
tighten credit further in its campaign to keep inflation from
flaring up again.
   In the auto group, General Motors gained 1| to 83~; Chrysler 1\
to 26}, and Ford Motor } to 51[. Roger Smith, GM's chairman, said
preliminary indications point to record earnings for the company for
1988.
   Big-name technology issues also were strong. International
Business Machines rose 1{ to 122{; Hewlett-Packard 1| to 53~, and
Digital Equipment 1} to 100\.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, Exxon added } to 44; General
Electric } to 44}; Coca-Cola 1[ to 44|; Philip Morris 1[ to 102, and
Procter &amp; Gamble ~ to 85].
   Federal Express rose 3\ to 53| and Emery Air Freight { to 5| on
word that a prime competitor in the express shipping business,
United Parcel Service of America, was seeking rate increases for
several of its services.
   Freeport-McMoRan jumped 2] to 30]. The company's directors voted
an increase in the quarterly dividend and special extra payouts of
25 cents a share through the third quarter of 1990.
   Integrated Device Technology dropped 1[ to 10| in the
over-the-counter market. The company estimated lower earnings for
its ``disappointing'' third fiscal quarter ended Jan. 1.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $34.38 billion, or 1.26
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
2.08 to 157.06.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.78 to 323.44, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 4.12 at 279.43.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
4.20 to 382.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 307.77, up 2.53.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Soar Following Reports Of Train Bombings In Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on supply worries rekindled by the apparent
bombing of three locomotives in Peru and a decline in the exchange's
warehouse stocks of copper.
   On other markets, precious metals futures retreated; grain and
soybean futures surged; energy futures were mixed; cattle futures
rose while pork futures fell; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Copper settled 3.1 cents to 6.3 cents higher with the spot
contract at $1.58 a pound and the more actively traded contract for
delivery in March at $1.426 a pound.
   The bombing of the locomotives in Peru, the world's sixth-largest
copper producer, served to remind traders that the settlement last
month of a 57-day Peruvian miners' strike did not defuse the
country's internal political tensions or the potential for
disruptions in the copper pipeline.
   Although no copper was lost in the explosions, ``the issue is
that it will impede shipments of metals, including copper, to the
ports,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Meanwhile, the Commodity Exchange reported a 301-ton decline in
its warehouse stocks of copper to 7,964 tons. It was the first daily
decline after more than a week of steady or rising supplies,
indicating that copper consumers have returned to the marketplace
after a holiday break, Ms. Raptopoulos said.
   Finally, copper for March delivery broke through strong
resistance at $1.40 a pound, which prompted heavy buying by
speculators who trade based on chart signals. The contract's close
at $1.426 a pound was viewed as another bullish technical signal,
said Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``The market's been in consolidation for more than a month and we
may be breaking out of it to the upside,'' he said. ``The market has
the potential here for a significant move. If it can just move a
little higher, you could easily be in the $1.50 to $1.60 area.''
   Copper futures hit an all-time high of $1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8.
   Precious metals prices fell on the Comex in response to the
dollar's strength, which was in turn a reaction to the U.S. downing
of two Libyan fighter planes off the Libyan coast, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.40 lower with February at $411 a troy
ounce; silver was 8.6 cents to 9.6 cents lower with March at $6.025
a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid reports and rumors of new export business.
   Wheat for near-month delivery surged to a 7{-year high above
$4.47 a bushel on news that China had bought 440,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, analysts said.
   Near-month soybeans climbed more than 14 cents a bushel to their
highest close since Oct. 5 on rumors that the Chinese were seeking
to buy as much as 1 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans.
   And corn futures climbed substantially on rumors, later confirmed
by the Agriculture Department, that the Soviet Union had purchased
250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   ``Wheat's an export-driven market as you get into the latter part
of the season and with exports being such as they are, almost on a
par with last year, that speaks very well of that market,'' said
grain-market analyst Arthur Parrish of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 8 cents higher with March at $4.47\ a
bushel; corn was 2} cents to 5{ cents higher with March at $2.83{ a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.45{ a
bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 14\ cents higher with January at
$8.16 a bushel.
   In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 28 cents lower
with February at $17.08 a barrel; heating oil was .58 cent to .81
cent lower with February at 52.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .20 cent lower to .12 cent higher with February at 47.32 cents a
gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .10 cent
to .75 cent lower with February at 73.42 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .15 cent to .53 cent lower with January at 84.15 cents a
pound; hogs were .18 cent lower to .32 cent higher with February at
46.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to 1.03 cents
higher with February at 43.45 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index settled 5.25 points higher at 282.90. Each point is
worth $500.

   The dollar advanced against most major currencies
Wednesday in moderate trading, bolstered by tension in the
Mediterranean and market expectations of strong U.S. employment data.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid of $408.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $411 late
Tuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, a troy ounce of gold
fell to $408.70 from $410.80 on Tuesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar rose on news that U.S. fighter
planes shot down two Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean. The
U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of international
tension.
   ``The dollar did snap back quite a bit,'' said Robert Hatcher,
vice president of corporate foreign exchange in the New York office
of Britain's Barclays Bank PLC.
   He described the dollar buying as a ``flight to quality''
prompted by the incident in the Mediterranean.
   In addition, many traders are said to be expecting Friday's
government report on unemployment for December to show strong job
growth. Such a showing could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates to rein in growth, a move which would boost the
dollar, analysts said.
   Before European markets opened, the dollar fell in Tokyo against
the Japanese yen on the first day of trading there after the New
Year holiday. Dealers in Tokyo said there was massive selling of
dollars after excessive buying at the end of 1988.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.05 Japanese yen, down from
Friday's 125.90 yen before the holiday. In London late Wednesday the
dollar traded higher at 124.95 yen. By the end of trading in New
York, the dollar was quoted at 124.97 yen, up from 123.82 yen late
Tuesday.
   The dollar's fall in Tokyo didn't seem to affect dealing in
Europe, where the U.S. currency rose after the opening on the heels
of a large number of commercial orders and expectations of higher
interest rates.
   The dollar also gained against the British pound, which lost its
two cent gain of Tuesday, dropping back to $1.8065 from $1.8270. In
late New York trading a pound was worth $1.8090, cheaper than
$1.8225 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.7875 West German marks, up from 1.7670; 1.5282
Swiss francs, up from 1.4907; 6.0910 French francs, up from 6.0340;
1,314.50 Italian lire, up from 1,300.50; and 1.1925 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1916.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late rates,
included: 1.7875 West German marks, up from 1.7620; 1.5180 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4912; 6.0985 French francs, up from 6.0125; 2.0140
Dutch guilders, up from 1.9870; 1,313.00 Italian lire, up from
1,295.75; 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1900.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid price of
$409.75 a troy ounce, down from $411.75 late Tuesday. The close in
Zurich, Switzerland, was $409.40 bid, down from $411.25.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $412.16 bid, down from
$414.11.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.01 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.07. On New York's Commodity Exchange, silver for
current delivery closed at $5.937, down from $6.023 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Wall Street giant Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. has paid a $156,334 penalty for failing to register two mutual
funds with Illinois officials before selling shares in the state,
the government said Wednesday.
   Secretary of State Jim Edgar, whose office regulates securities
dealers in Illinois, said he believes the penalty is the largest
ever assessed in the state for failure to register mutual funds.
   Edgar said the case isn't connected to the federal investigation
of Drexel in New York, where the firm is based. On Dec. 21 Drexel
agreed to pay the U.S. government a record $650 million in fines and
restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle a massive
securities fraud case.
   An investigation by the securities department of Edgar's office
found that shares in the funds worth more than $205 million were
sold to Illinois residents by the firm beginning in April 1987.
   The penalty was calculated on the basis of $106,334 in management
fees earned by the company while the shares were being sold
illegally. The remaining $50,000 is a grant from Drexel to the
Investor Protection and Education Program administered by the
securities department.
   Since paying the penalty, the firm has registered the mutual
funds, and shares can now be sold legally in Illinois, Edgar said.

   Nissan Motor Corp. is putting up some
stiffer-than-usual dealer requirements for its new Infiniti car
line, and much of it has to do with money.
   Infiniti General Manager William Bruce said Wednesday that it
would take between $2.5 million and $5 million, depending on land
cost, for a business person to set up an Infiniti franchise.
   That, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association,
is about twice the typical start-up cost for getting into the
automobile-selling business.
   Bruce also said each of the 100 or so dealers who have signed
letters of intent to handle the new Japan-made luxury car are being
told that their businesses must conform to certain architectural and
space requirements.
   Just four cars will be displayed at a time, he said, each with a
viewing area separated from the others by Japanese screens. The cars
will be shown on stone floors instead of carpet or tile usually seen
in dealerships. And there won't be any bright displays.
   ``When you walk into a showroom, you aren't attracted by an
orange backlit thing,'' he said.
   Despite the restrictions, Bruce said the company has been swamped
with applications from potential dealers.
   ``We stopped counting at 1,500 applications'' in the fall of
1987, he said. Between 60 percent and 65 percent of those who have
signed letters of intent are Nissan dealers now, he said.
   And the majority of them are ``megadealers'' _ businesses that
own two or more showrooms. Typically, megadealers have the cash or
the credit needed to finance expensive projects, like an Infiniti
dealership.
   ``The overwhelming majority are megadealers _ in the 80 percent
range,'' he said.
   Part of the reason for requiring that Infiniti dealership
locations be separate from Nissan dealerships, Bruce said, is to
help identify the luxury car division as a different kind of
dealership.
   ``We at Infiniti will differentiate ourselves from Nissan a
lot,'' he said. ``We will not be looked at as an extension'' of
Nissan.
   The cars certainly are different. When the two Infiniti models _
a coupe and a four-door sedan _ are in showrooms in about a year,
they will range in price from about $22,000 to $40,000. Bruce said
firmer prices will be announced later and could change depending on
the relationship of the Japanese yen and the dollar.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heads of the top non-profit science and
higher education associations in the nation's capital make salaries
well into six figures, according to a new report.
   The Science &amp; Government Report, a newsletter, obtained the 1987
salary data from a number of non-profit groups by taking advantage
of new, easier access to the tax returns of tax-exempt organizations.
   It found that the president of the National Academy of Sciences,
Frank Press, drew a salary of $189,969 in 1987, plus $29,612 and a
chauffeur-driven car. The academy is chartered by Congress as an
adviser to the government. Although officially private, more than
three-quarters of its $123 million in income came from government
grants and contracts.
   Two related organizations also pay well: Robert M. White, as
president of the National Academy of Engineering, earned $193,366,
plus $15,406 in benefits, and Samuel Thier, president of the
Institute of Medicine, was paid $167,764, plus $21,021 in benefits.
   The pacesetter among science and higher education groups was the
Association of American Medical Colleges, which paid its president,
Robert Petersdorf, $250,000 plus $25,000 in benefits for fiscal 1988.
   The American Chemical Society paid its executive director, John
A. Krum, $160,400 in 1987, plus $8,501 for pension and $13,196 in
benefits.
   The American Association for the Advancement of Science paid its
executive director, Alvin Trivelpiece, $96,026, plus $11,166 in
benefits, in 1987. Trivilpiece recently left to become director of
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
   The Association of American Universities, which represents 56
major research universities, paid president Robert M. Rosenzweig
$124,000 plus $23,445 in benefits in 1987.
   The American Council on Education, the main higher education
lobby with 1,450 colleges and universities as members, paid
president Robert H. Atwell $115,000 plus $31,092 in benefits for
1987.
   The National Association of State Universities and Land Grant
Colleges paid Robert Clodius, its president@treasurer, $110,000,
plus $16,500 in benefits.
   The data appeared in the Dec. 15 issue of Science &amp; Government
Report.

<TEXT>
   Corporate takeover activity in the United States
hit a record 3,310 completed transactions worth $282.4 billion last
year, a leading financial information service reported Wednesday.
   Statistics compiled by IDD Information Services showed the 1988
level of takeover action rose 28.6 percent over the 1987 level and
14.3 percent over the $247.1 billion in transactions completed in
1986, the previous record year.
   IDD statistics also showed foreign investors, encouraged by a
weaker dollar, snapped up 325 U.S. companies valued at $54.8
billion, a 30 percent increase over the $42.3 billion spent in 1987.
   British companies spent $20.7 billion on American firms, while
Japanese investors increased their buying activity by 1,000 percent,
spending $10.4 billion on 35 acquisitions in the United States.
   Canada was the third most active foreign country in the U.S.
takeover market, buying 50 American companies valued at $9.9 billion.
   Leveraged buyout activity remained strong despite predictions of
a slowdown in this debt-financed takeover tactic, IDD said. In a
leveraged buyout, or LBO, a buyer borrows most of the purchase money
and pledges as collateral the target company's assets, earnings or a
combination of both.
   IDD said 119 LBOs were completed in 1988 with a value of $37.7
billion. In addition, IDD said 165 LBOs worth $80.4 billion,
including the record $25 billion deal for RJR Nabisco Inc., were
announced during the year, suggesting 1989 will be an active year as
well.
   The value of successful tender offers for public companies
increased to $107.2 billion, nearly 70 percent higher than the $63.5
billion in completed tender offers in 1987, IDD said.
   The success rate of hostile takeovers in 1988 also rose, with
30.3 percent of all unfriendly bids announced in 1988 completed. In
1987, 24.8 percent of hostile offers announced in the year were
successful.
   IDD said 32 rejected takeover offers were eventually completed in
1988, valued at $53.3 billion, vs. 22 such offers with a value of
$6.1 billion in 1987.
   Based in New York, IDD is a leading financial information and
publication concern that primarily supplies figures to the
investment banking business.

   Mediated contract talks between Northwest
Airlines and its pilots union began in earnest Wednesday, a company
spokesman said.
   Northwest officials and leaders of the Air Lines Pilots
Association met at an undisclosed location in the Twin Cities with
federal mediator Robert Brown, said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen.
   Whalen said company and union representatives will meet jointly
with the mediator at least two days every week this month. In
addition, he said, both sides will likely meet separately with the
mediator.
   The talks are expected to last several months, Whalen said.
   The union representing 4,800 pilots and the airline were millions
of dollars apart when Northwest requested mediation in mid-November.
The call for mediation temporarily ended the union's strike threat.
The pilots had voted overwhelmingly to walk off their jobs, but said
they would abide by laws that make a strike illegal during mediation.
   The airline and the union are negotiating for a combined contract
covering 2,800 pre-merger Northwest pilots and 2,000 former Republic
Airlines pilots. The two pilot groups have been working under
separate contracts since Northwest's acquisition of Republic in 1986.
   There are differences over wages, work schedules, fringe benefits
and length of contract.

<HEAD>Smith Says GM Will Set Earnings Record in 1988</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Auto Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will set an earnings record
in 1988, surpassing the $4.5 billion the nation's largest automaker
made in 1984, Chairman Roger Smith said Wednesday.
   ``Now, we haven't added up all of the figures, but we've added up
enough of them that I can tell you right now that GM's net income
for the 1988 calendar year is going to be an all-time record,''
Smith said.
   ``And not only that, we are going into 1989 in great shape
because we have the lowest year-end stock levels of passenger cars
on hand in the field since 1984,'' he said. ``So 1988 was a great
year (and) 1989 is going to be another good one.''
   Smith, meeting with reporters during a media preview of the North
American International Auto Show, declined to estimate the
corporation's 1988 earnings. GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
were expected to report their 1988 earnings at the end of January.
   Industry officials and analysts have speculated that 1988
earnings by the Big Three automakers could reach a record total of
about $11 billion.
   Smith also said he expected GM's market share would increase in
1989. But he refused to estimate what portion of the market the
corporation would command.
   GM announced Dec. 12 that its anticipated 1988 earnings would
allow it to make profit sharing payments for the first time since
1985. Profit sharing, estimated at nearly $900 million, would come
out to about $200 for a typical employee who worked the entire year,
the automaker said.
   For the first three quarters of 1988 ending Sept. 30, GM reported
earnings of $3.46 billion on sales and revenues of $81.38 billion
from its worldwide operations.

   A group of Japanese investors announced it had

$50 million investment, intends to make six films over the next
three years.
   The new studio, Apricot Entertainment Inc., has been refurbishing

announced Wednesday.
   Apricot Entertainment is headed by Naofumi Okamoto, a former
director of business development with FujiSankei Communications

television use in Japan.
   Apricot (the name is taken from a feature of Okamoto's family

a World War II drama conceived by Okamoto. The company said it plans
to spend $6 million per movie, a small amount by Hollywood standards.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. announced
Wednesday a $500 million expansion of its paper mill at Ashdown, the
biggest industrial expansion ever announced in Arkansas.
   The expansion will add a fourth paper machine to the mill, which
will be the largest fine paper machine in the world, Nekoosa
executives said at a news conference with Gov. Bill Clinton.
   When the machine is running, it will generate a sheet of paper 30
feet wide and one mile long every 1{ minutes, said Pete Howard, vice
president for manufacturing. The machine will be 125 yards long,
Howard said.
   The machine will have the capacity to produce 325,000 tons of
finished fine paper per year, Nekoosa officials said, raising
Ashdow's capacity to 800,000 tons per year.
   The second-largest fine paper machine will be the Georgia-Pacific
Corp. machine at Port Hudson, La., Nekoosa said.
   Fine paper includes copy machine paper, envelopes, form bond, and
paper for offset printing.
   The company's board of directors unanimously approved the project
at a meeting in New York earlier in the day, the Nekoosa executives
said. It was one of three projects put before the board. The
executives recommended the one the board approved.
   The expansion will result in 2,000 construction jobs to build the
machine, starting this year and completing work by 1991, and 250
permanent jobs, raising the mill's employment to 1,500 by 1991, said
William R. Laidig, chief executive of Nekoosa.
   Nekoosa president Arnold M. Nemirow credited Arkansas' investment
tax credit law, the business climate of Arkansas under Clinton's
leadership, and economic considerations at Nekoosa for the decision
to expand in Arkansas. Nemirow said the company's tax credit will be
$12 million to $14 million for this project.
   That was enough to be one of many factors considered by Nekoosa,
he said, but not enough to be the sole basis for the decision.
   The company also has mills in Maine, Georgia, Mississippi, and
Wisconsin.
   Clinton called it the largest industrial expansion ever announced
in Arkansas and officials of the state Chamber of Commerce agreed
with him.

   Earnings of the S&amp;P 500 companies rose 40 percent
last year, but shareholders got dividend increases of only 11
percent, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Wednesday.
   Companies harbored cash because even though they are racking up
healthy profits, ``they are well aware that the 6-year-old economic
expansion is due for a reverse,'' the credit-rating agency said in a
news release.
   Although though the dividend increase was only a quarter of the
profit increase, the 11 percent increase was still the biggest since
1979, Standard &amp; Poor's said.
   For 1989, Standard &amp; Poor's predicted slower economic growth,
smaller gains in corporate profits and fewer and smaller dividend
increases than last year.
   Among all U.S. companies, a total of 1,705 dividend increases
were reported in 1988 to Standard &amp; Poor's, up 7 percent from the
1,590 reported in 1987.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it will transmit Cable News Network 24 hours a day to
Latin American on Pan American Satellite's new international

   The agreement followed a series of tests that began on Election

   Turner's decision to use Pan American Satellite is a victory for
that private company and a defeat for Intelsat, the international
consortium that operates most communications satellites.
   ``This marks the first time a major television organization has
utilized an international satellite transponder on a
non-Intelsat-operated satellite to distribute programs,'' said
Terence F. McGuirk, president of Turner Cable Network Sales, who
executed the agreement for TBS.
   The PAS 1 satellite provides a wide range of communications
services to all of Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.
   CNN also announced this week it will open its first permanent
South American bureau in Santiago, Chile, during 1989. The network
currently has 20 foreign bureaus and plans to open seven more before
the end of the year, TBS said in the statement.

   Oldsmobile entered the crowded multipurpose
vehicle field Wednesday, rolling out its Silhouette multi-purpose
vehicle at Detroit's annual auto show.
   Two other General Motors Corp. subsidiaries _ Chevrolet and
Pontiac _ also unveiled aerodynamic-styled vans for 1990.
   Chevrolet General Manager Bob Burger said meanwhile that Chevy's
new Lumina sedan, which will go into production this spring for the
1990 model year, will be the car upon which GM's future success
depends.
   ``We know that it's going to be a big hit because we've had it
out there among the people who are going to buy it,'' he said.
   William Lane, Oldsmobile General manager, said the Silhouette
utility vehicle will give Olds the chance to capitalize on the
expansion of the market for minivans, started and led by Chrysler
Corp.
   Burger said Chevrolet's Lumina, Oldsmobile's Silhouette, and the
Pontiac Transport SE, which share frame design and windswept
styling, will be built at the GM plant in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   Production during the 1990 model year of the GM minivans is
expected to reach 100,000, rising to 225,000 a year subsequently as
sales rise toward plant capacity.
   Pontiac General Manager Michael Losh predicted the minivan market
would increase to 1 million units in the early 1990s from the
current industry output of about 750,000 units a year.
   Chevrolet and Pontiac share the GM minivan production on a rough
65 percent to 35 percent basis, Burger said.
   Lane declined to speculate on what percentage Oldsmobile would
garner in the new GM production. Burger said the split among
Oldsmobile, Chevrolet and Pontiac would depend on how many vans each
sells.
   Oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business because 1.1
million customers switched from cars to light trucks in 1988, he
said.
   ``Among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market,
34 percent purchased a mid-sized van,'' he said.
   GM's was one of a host of briefings by the 41 exhibitors at the
North American International Automobile Show, where more than 700
cars and trucks are on display.
   GM featured the three multi-purpose vehicles, or MPVs, the Lumina
sedan, the Corvette ZR-1, the Pontiac Stinger and Oldsmobile
Aerotech II. Like other concept cars, the Stinger, a beach-buggy
type vehicle, and the Aerotech II, a four-passenger sports coupe for
the highway, are exhibited for the manufacturer to measure consumer
interest in design and performance characteristics.

   Quaker Oats Co. said Wednesday it plans to
sell its Ghirardelli Chocolate business, which Quaker acquired in
1986 as part of its purchase of the Golden Grain Co.
   The Chicago-based Quaker said no specific buyer has been
identified for the famous chocolate concern, which is based in San
Leandro.
   But Quaker said it has been approached by many interested
potential buyers of Ghirardelli since it was acquired.
   Ghirardelli, which was founded before the Civil War, is
profitable but is too small for Quaker Oats, said Douglas W. Mills,
executive vice president of Quaker's diversified grocery products
division.
   He said Ghirardelli ``does not ideally fit with our existing
businesses and strategies.''
   ``In our view, Ghirardelli has a great deal of upseide potantial,
but with an owner whose priorities are more focused on the chocolate
business and specialty retailing,'' Mills said.
   He said Quaker was principally interested in the side-dish brands
of Rice-A-Roni and Noodle-Roni when it acquired Golden Grain. He
noted the chocolate company represented only 12 percent of Golden
Grain's sales volume.
   Ghirardelli, founded in 1852, originally made powdered chocolate.
Around the turn of the century, the company bought a square block
above what is now Aquatic Park, on the edge of San Francisco Bay.
   That property became Ghirardelli Square when that tourist
attraction was opened in 1966. The chocolate company operates the
Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop and Soda Fountain, and an ice scream
shop, at the site.

<HEAD>Polish Government Foresees 50 Percent Inflation in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans price increases of 20
percent in 1989 and hopes to hold inflation to just over 50 percent,
compared to 70-80 percent in 1988, Deputy Premier Ireneusz Sekula
announced Wednesday.
   Sekula told a news conference wages will be allowed to rise
generally in relation to rising prices, but the government will use
a penalty tax to discourage pay increases it considers inflationary.
   He said price increases announced last year would produce a basic
inflation of more than 30 percent in 1989 even if the government did
not raise prices this year.
   By adding that figure to the planned 20 percent increase in
prices in 1989, the government sees overall inflation exceeding 50
percent, he said.
   ``This is a clear decrease in inflation, though unfortunately,
still substantial,'' Sekula said.
   Prices for basic foods will rise by 12 percent while other goods
will go up at a steeper pace, he said.
   He said the government plans to stagger the increases throughout
the year. Telephone rates, for example, went up 40 percent on Jan. 1.
   Price increases are a politically sensitive issue in Poland.
Increases set off worker revolts that led to the removal of
governments in 1956, 1970, 1980 and most recently last year, when
Zbigniew Messner stepped down as prime minister under widespread
criticism of his handling of the economy.
   Sekula said the government had to allow for a 1 trillion zloty
($2 billion) budget deficit in 1989 to avoid higher price increases.
He said limiting price rises to 20 percent means the government must
raise subsidies on many goods, adding that such subsidies will
account for more than 30 percent of the budget.

   A Japanese real-estate company is close to buying
the world's tallest building for at least $1.2 billion, a Los
Angeles firm representing the prospective buyer said Wednesday, but
the skyscraper's present owner said it wasn't involved in any sale
negotiations.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., which put the famed 110-story Sears Tower
up for sale on Oct. 31, said speculation that a Japanese buyer was
close to a deal was groundless.
   ``We are compiling a financial analysis, which is the first step
in the offering process,'' Sears said in a statement. ``We are not
involved in any negotiations at this time.''
   The 14-year-old structure, which rises 1,450 feet above the
downtown Loop, is expected to fetch a record price for a U.S.
building, surpassing the $660 million paid by Walter Shorenstein in
1985 for the Bank of America Building in San Francisco.
   Sears has said it is selling the tower as part of the giant
retailer's previously announced restructuring plan, but intends to
keep its corporate headquarters in the building.
   Jack Barthell, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of Los
Angeles, said the prospective buyer was a Japanese real-estate firm
that owns high-profile buildings in other cities and already has ``a
presence in Chicago.''
   His description prompted speculation that the client was Shuwa
Corp., a Japanese real estate developer with more than $2 billion in
U.S. holdings, including ABC's New York headquarters, the Arco Plaza
in downtown Los Angeles and the Quaker Oats Tower in Chicago.
   Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman in Los Angeles for Shuwa Investment
Corp., a Shuwa affiliate, said: ``The company generally doesn't
comment on those things. Essentially, there's no comment.''
   Barthell's statements drew a doubtful reaction from Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc., a New York-based real-estate firm that has
represented Japanese buyers in other large commercial property
transactions.
   ``I find it hard to believe that one client would risk $1.2
billion in one place on one property,'' said John Oharenko, managing
partner of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Chicago office. ``The deal is so
large that you would probably have to have more than one source of
capital.''
   Oharenko said the cash-rich Japanese likely would be involved in
buying the Sears Tower, but probably in conjunction with a U.S. firm.
   Direct Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate in the
past two years has totaled more than $15 billion, said Martin Sawa,
senior investment specialist in Cushman &amp; Wakefield's San Francisco
office.
   The sharp rise in Japanese purchases of top U.S. commercial
property in recent years _ a phenomenon linked partly to the weak
dollar _ has incited a backlash of resentment that most Japanese
firms would prefer to avoid, Oharenko said.
   Barthell said his unidentified client was sensitive to that
situation but undeterred by it.
   ``They are a very good corporate citizen, very philanthropic, and
they are known in the communities in which they do business as an
outstanding community citizen and leader,'' Barthell said., ``I
don't think they're put off by the profile and recognition that
buying the Sears Tower might give them.''

   Venezuelan President-elect Carlos Andres Perez
said Wednesday he is confident there will be increased cooperation
from the United States under George Bush in helping Latin America
overcome its foreign debt burden.
   ``We will have the opportunity for great (American) cooperation
with our countries in Latin America, great opportunities for
development,'' said Perez, who recently had several meetings with
the U.S. President-elect.
   Perez said Wednesday's visit with new Mexican president Carlos
Salinas de Gortari is part of a effort by Latin American leaders to
find a reasonable solution to the debt problem.
   ``We seek agreement among Latin American countries to find
reasonable solutions with our creditors,'' Perez told reporters
before speaking to Salinas. ``We seek agreement in search of an
understanding and not confrontation.''
   Venezuela on Saturday suspended payments on a large chunk of its
$35 billion foreign debt, claiming it was short of money because of
low prices for crude oil. Mexico is trying to renegotiate payments
on its $106 billion debt, the second largest after Brazil among
developing countries.
   Both nations say that debt payments are eating so much money that
they don't have enough left for investment and economic growth.
   Perez and Salinas also discussed oil, a major source of foreign
revenues for both nations.
   ``Our countries have suffered the buffeting of the fall in
prices, but in my meeting with the president of Mexico, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, I expressed to him my optimism about the
possibilities of a stablization of the petroleum market soon,''
Perez told a news conference Wednesday night before leaving the
country.
   He also announced that this week he would travel to Brazil for a
similar meeting with President Jose Sarney.
   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, a 13-nation cartel that has faced trouble in
bolstering prices.
   Mexico, the world's sixth largest exporter, is not a member of
OPEC but follows the cartel's guidelines. About half the oil that
Pemex, the Mexican state petroleum monopoly, sells abroad goes to
the United States.
   Perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem, the
severe economic difficulties currently afflicting Venezuela, Brazil
and Mexico will extend to more countries.
   Perez said debt negotiations ``should be bilateral, but the
countries should seek to strengthen our bargaining power through the
establishment of a single Latin American position.''
   ``I don't want to turn into a lawyer for the banks, but the banks
are tied by the policies established by the (U.S.) Treasury
Department and the Federal Reserve ... and that is why it is
essential that we ask the U.S. government to change its attitude,''
Perez said.
   Perez said he was optimistic OPEC will be able to keep prices
from falling further, but he described the debt as ``a vise on the
economy'' of Venezuela.
