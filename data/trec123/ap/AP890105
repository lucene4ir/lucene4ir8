<HEAD>`Cat Lady' Dies After Being Hospitalized For Hypothermia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   O. Clara Sager, a popular eccentric who
loved cats and insisted on living atop a pile of trash outside her
house, died after being hospitalized for exposure. She was 91.
   Sager, known to her neighbors as the ``Cat Lady,'' was taken by
ambulance to Yolo General Hospital here Tuesday morning. When she
was admitted, her body temperature was 84 degrees and she was
suffering from hypothermia, said Yolo County Deputy Coroner William
Long.
   Overnight temperatures have dropped into the 20s and 30s in
recent weeks. Despite the chill, Sager continued to stay where she
has for decades _ outside the front of her house in nearby Winters
on a tarpaulin-covered pile of trash, protected by an umbrella.
   The Rev. John Reimers, pastor of the Pioneer Presbyterian Church,
said he has known Sager for 25 years.
   ``She chose her lifestyle and lived it to the end,'' Reimers said.
   The minister said Sager had been ill for 10 days and had been
taking medication. He and other neighbors in Winters, a town of
2,650 about 20 miles west of Sacramento, were concerned about her
welfare; they called a doctor Tuesday after she became confused.
   ``She kept telling us she was better. Her hands were not cold,''
he said.
   Now Reimers said he must find homes for Sager's 16 cats. Some
were said to be strays people had abandoned hoping the ``Cat Lady''
would care for them.
   ``We'll have to make some decisions concerning them. Clara won't
be there to feed them twice a day,'' he said.
   Reimers described Sager as a collector and an avid reader of
newspapers who was interested in civic affairs. She sang in his
church's choir and participated in its women's groups until
arthritis made it difficult for her to walk.
   Inside her house were 1,200 books, enough furniture for several
houses and many pretty glass items such as vases, he said.
   ``Many tried to get her to change her style of living. She
pointed out that Indians lived outside all the time,'' Reimers said.

   Director Steven Spielberg, a long-time lover
of animated cartoons, is joining forces with Warner Bros. for a new
television version of Warner's famous ``Merrie Melodies,'' to be
called ``Tiny Tunes.''
   ``These will be offspring of the famous Warner Bros. cartoons,
such as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat,'' Spielberg
said at a news conference Wednesday. ``But I don't know if they will
be actually sons and daughters. I'm not quite sure how reproduction
works in `Tunes.' ''
   ``Tiny Tunes'' will be produced jointly by Spielberg and Warner
Bros. and will be distributed for syndicated television by Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. for the fall season of 1990. The initial order
under the two-year contract is for 65 episodes.
   Terry Semel, president and chief operating officer of Warner
Bros. Inc., said the project had been in development for several
years with Spielberg, who has produced such animated features as
``An American Tail'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   ``We at Warner's had been talking about doing something for a
long time with our animated characters,'' Semel said. ``This young
man kept popping in and out and telling us, `I want to do something
with your cartoons.' That guy was Steven Spielberg.''
   Spielberg said he can't draw or paint, but is a great admirer of
cartoons, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s.
   ``My favorites were those from Warner Bros. because they were
sassy and never took any guff from anybody,'' Spielberg said. ``Our
characters will be derived from those cartoons. They're going to be
tinier versions of Porky Pig and Sylvester and Tweety.''
   Spielberg promised there would be no violence in the half-hour
episodes, and that they wouldn't have the chase scenes that are a
staple of many cartoon shows.

<HEAD>Study Results Say Breast Cancer Risk Increased By Oral Contraceptives</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The study had been embargoed until 5 p.m. today, but that embargo
was broken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study suggests that women under 45 who
use birth control pills face a greater risk of breast cancer _ a
finding that contradicts earlier research.
   The study results were being presented today at a hearing of the
Food and Drug Administration.
   Researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine found
that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the risk of breast
cancer compared to women who have never used the pill.
   For women who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study
found, the risk of breast cancer was four times greater.
   The issue is of particular concern because oral contraceptives
are the most popular form of birth control in the United States, and
breast cancer is the second most common fatal cancer in women.
   An estimated 13.2 million American women take birth control
pills, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which specializes
in reproductive biology.
   About 42,000 women die of breast cancer each year, according to
the American Cancer Society.
   The Boston University findings were based on a study of 407 women
with breast cancer and a cancer-free control group of 424. All were
patients in hospitals in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
Baltimore.
   Dr. Samuel Shapiro, director of the Slone Epidemiology Unit at
Boston University, said in a news release the new study contradicts
findings in earlier studies, which indicated there was no
association between use of the pill and development of breast cancer.
   ``Whereas early studies, including our own, were reassuring about
the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer, recent
studies reopen the question, but do not, by any means, answer it,''
said Shapiro.
   The effect of the new findings, the researchers said, is to show
that further studies are needed ``to reconcile the different
findings and to overcome the methodologic limitations of earlier
ones.''
   A recent study by Dr. Clifford R. Kay and Philip C. Hannaford of
Manchester, England, found no overall increase in breast cancer
among women who had taken birth control pills, but did find a
threefold increase in breast cancers in women 30 to 34 years old who
were former pill users. There was no elevation in breast cancer
rates among women who were younger or older than this group.
   The Boston University researchers said it is possible the results
of their study were biased and the association between oral
contraceptives and breast cancer ``may not be one of cause and
effect.''
   Further details of the study were to be revealed at the FDA
hearing and will be published next month in the American Journal of
Epidemiology.
   Oral contraceptives are pills that generally contain a
combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin. Usually taken
daily for three weeks, the pills prevent conception by inhibiting
ovulation.
   In recent years, the amount of hormone in each pill has generally
been reduced as researchers learned that higher doses were unneeded
to prevent conception.
   Side effects, some of them serious, have been experienced among
some women taking the pill, but the accepted medical practice now is
to prescribe the pill for healthy women until the age of 35. Women
over that age, particularly smokers, who have used the pill for more
than five years are known to be at greater risk for heart attack and
stroke.

   Milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine, New York is
showing what well-dressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and
dozens of other American cities are planning hundreds of events to
celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``Americans love a party, they love a bicentennial and they love
France. The French Revolution is a natural,'' said Christopher
Henze, cultural attache at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Henze is
keeping track of more than 300 concerts, exhibits, symposiums,
festivals, film series and TV shows taking place across the United
States in 1989.
   Birmingham, Ala., alone has an events list nine pages long that
includes ``Marcel Proust at the University of Alabama'' lectures,
wine tastings, productions of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and cooking
classes by a chef from Paris' famed Le Cordon Bleu.
   The French are enthusiastic about the American revolutionary
fervor and have decided to send the original Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizen to an exhibit at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington next spring. It will be the first time
France's most precious document has been on display anywhere since
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to
the French constitution.
   The Declaration was drafted in 1789 by Emmanuel Sieyes, the
French statesman and clergyman, and mirrored the ideas of the
liberal Enlightenment. It spoke of the equality of men and the
inalienable rights to security, liberty and property.
   The founding document of the French Republic will be flown across
the Atlantic on April 18 on another source of French pride, the
supersonic Concorde, which will be on view for a short while at the
Smithsonian's Aerospace Museum.
   ``That a single small country like France can have itself
represented by a beautiful jet like the Concorde and a document like
the Declaration of the Rights of Man is incredible,'' said Sir
Valentine Abdy, the Smithsonian's representative in Europe. He has
arranged for a Concorde plane to be given to the Smithsonian when it
goes out of service.
   French musicians and Americans of French ancestry will play on
the Washington Mall June 30-July 4, at about the time the
Smithsonian's New York branch, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, is
displaying the best objects from two centuries of French decorative
art and design.
   The $2.5 million cost of the ``L'Art de Vivre'' exhibit is being
paid by the French Comite Colbert, a group of luxury goods companies
such as Krug Champagne and Hermes.
   Cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in New Orleans, San Diego
and elsewhere. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will show
fashions from ``The Age of Napolean: Costume From Revolution to
Empire.'' Artist Gustave Corbet will be reconsidered at the Brooklyn
Museum in an exhibit that will later travel to Minneapolis. And, for
lovers of the printed word, The New York Public Library will offer
the ``Revolution in Print,'' a collection of books, broadsides,
prints, posters, manuscripts and periodicals, many on loan from the
Bibliotheque Nationale.
   French dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet and other companies
will pirouette across stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts.
Daniel Barenboim will lead the Orchestre de Paris on a seven-city
tour including stops in Chicago and at New York's Carnegie Hall. And
French arias will resound in opera halls in Texas, California and
Washingon, D.C.
   Keyboardist Ray Charles and saxophonist Dexter Gordon will swing
with French jazzmen Claude Bolling and Claude Nougaro at Carnegie
Hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at
Washington's Kennedy Center for the Arts, Chicago's Orchestra Hall
and the Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheatre.
   What does jazz have to do with the French Revolution?
   ``Nothing. But it's a chance to celebrate the role of the French
over several decades in giving black American musicians the right to
work, the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated
audiences,'' said Edward Tuck, who will produce a television show
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived
and worked in Paris. Such artists have have included the late
composers and pianists Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell.
   Tuck, who is also president of the French-American Foundation,
said the number and variety of U.S. celebrations reflect America's
awareness that the French Revolution was the basis not only for the
Declaration of Human Rights adopted Aug. 26, 1789, but also for the
U.S. Bill of Rights, adopted 30 days later.
   ``And that is no coincidence,'' he said. ``Ideas ricocheted
between the great thinkers of our two countries. It is the
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual
is born with.''
   Celebrations will crescendo on Bastille Day, July 14, when 200
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven
prisoners instead. The day marked the beginning of lower-class
participation in the revolution, which had been led by the
bourgeoisie (middle class) against the aristocrats and the clergy.
   In Milwaukee, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend a
four-day festival where food vendors will cook crepes and frog-legs
kabobs to be washed down with champagne, ``or rather American bubbly
white wine, because it's cheaper,'' said Betsy Kohler, who is
coordinating the event.
   There will be a mock Arc de Triomphe constructed as the finish
line for a midnight run, not to mention the ever-popular guillotine.
   ``We had one last year and everyone liked it,'' Kohler said.
``It's the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and
someone else takes their picture. Also, it's very nicely painted and
has the history of the revolution printed on it.
   ``A lot of people are going to learn about the French Revolution
this year.''

   The family of a Belfast man held
hostage in Beirut marked his 1,000th day in captivity with a vigil
outside city hall.
   Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual British and Irish nationality,
was kidnapped April 11, 1986 on his way to the American University
in Beirut, where he had just begun to work.
   ``If we forget, the world forgets,'' said his sister, Brenda
Gillham, who stood outside the city hall with three other family
members during Wednesday's vigil. ``We must keep the fight going.''
   She said the vigil was both for the family members and to ``ask
governments: How many more days can a normal human being take? Maybe
the governments will start to think about it.''
   Keenan, 38, was using an Irish passport when he was abducted, but
both the Irish and British governments are working toward his
release.
   The British government also seeks the release of Anglican envoy
Terry Waite and journalist John McCarthy. And it seeks word on Alec
Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian
abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.
   In all, 15 foreigners are missing in Lebanon and believed held
hostage. They include nine Americans, among them Associated Press
chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted on
March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   A former janitor serving a 35-year prison
term for a murder that authorities now believe was committed by the
so-called ``Southside Strangler'' was granted executive clemency
Wednesday.
   David Vasquez' pardon was based in part on the recommendation of
Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney Helen Fahey, said Gov.
Gerald L. Baliles.
   Vasquez, 42, pleaded guilty in 1985 to second-degree murder in
the death of Washington lawyer Carolyn Jean Hamm of Arlington.
   Vasquez at first confessed to the killing, but recanted his
confession and said he entered the guilty plea to avoid a possible
capital murder conviction and death sentence.
   Vasquez has been imprisoned at Buckingham Correctional Center in
Dillwyn.
   New evidence, a review of existing evidence, further
investigation and analysis by the Arlington County Police Department
and the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
convinced authorities that the crime was committed by Timothy
Spencer, who has been convicted of capital murder in the deaths of
Susan Tucker of Arlington and Debbie Davis of Richmond.
   Spencer's convictions were based on DNA tests, also known as
``genetic fingerprinting.'' In such tests, the molecular structure
of body fluids and tissues from a crime scene are matched with those
of the suspect. Like fingerprints, each structure is unique to the
individual.
   After the murder of Ms. Tucker, Arlington police reconsidered
whether Vasquez murdered Ms. Hamm.
   ``Every lead and available scientific process was pursued, and
led to the conclusion that Spencer ... was responsible for the Hamm
murder,'' a news release issued by the governor's office said.
   Ms. Fahey's request for a pardon was reviewed by the Virginia
Parole Board, the Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office, the
governor's executive staff and Baliles, the news release said.
   Vasquez received an ``absolute pardon,'' which restores his
constitutional rights and leaves him without a criminal record. Ms.
Fahey had predicted that Vasquez would receive a ``conditional
pardon,'' which is similar to being paroled from prison.

   Car thefts dropped dramatically after
the military drummed out hundreds of sticky-fingered troops, the
country's constabulary chief said today.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano said the rate of car thefts nationwide
dropped from 6.6 per day in March to 1.5 per day in December.
   He linked the plunge to a ``no-nonsense'' campaign in which about
400 soldiers suspected of having links with car theft rings were
dismissed.
   ``We eased them out, and of course the crimes decreased because
of this,'' Montano said in a television interview. ``And I know that
this policy of ours is a very big deterrent for others who may be
prone to commit this crime.''
   He said that the rate of serious offenses _ such as murder, rape
and aggravated assault _ decreased from 17 incidents per 100,000
people in 1987 to 14 per 100,000 last year.
   However, total crime rate, including serious crimes, went up by
1.2 percent from 1987 to 1988, Montano said. He gave no comparative
figures.
   ``We in the Philippine Constabulary are happy because the crime
rate was controllable last year,'' Montano said. He said more police
would help in their drive against criminals.
   ``This, together with getting rid of our own misfits and
scalawags, and increasing our crime solution efficiency, we hope
(would) increase the deterrent effect of our laws.''

   Authorities in Cambodia inaugurated a
memorial near the capital to 20,000 people reportedly massacred at
the site by the ousted Khmer Rouge regime, a news report seen here
said.
   Cambodia's official SPK news agency said authorities dedicated
the 128-foot Buddhist shrine on Sunday at the mass grave at Cheung
Ek district, 13 miles southwest of Phnom Penh.
   Nguon Nhel, a senior official of the ruling Communist Party, said
at the ceremony that the 16-level memorial symbolizes the crimes of
the Khmer Rouge, who he said killed 3,314,770 people during their
1975-78 rule.
   The Khmer Rouge, also Communists, conducted mass killings while
trying to transform Cambodia into a primitive agrarian society.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, driving out the Khmer
Rouge and installing a pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. The Khmer
Rouge is now the largest guerrilla group fighting the Vietnamese.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Urges Independence for FSLIC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top bank official says the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board's dual role as regulator of the savings industry and
promoter of home ownership has contributed to the wave of S&amp;L
failures.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures deposits in commercial banks, said Wednesday
the insurance fund for S&amp;Ls should be independent of the bank board.
   The primary goal of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
which insures deposits up to $100,000, is the safety and soundness
of savings institutions, he said.
   However, the FSLIC's parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is
also charged with creating, or chartering, S&amp;Ls to provide a steady
flow of mortgage money to home buyers.
   ``There's a basic conflict between those two roles and I think
it's very important that they be separated so that the insurer ...
can protect his insurance fund and not allow institutions that
operate in an unsafe and unsound manner to have insurance,'' Seidman
told reporters at a luncheon to release a 408-page FDIC report,
``Deposit Insurance for the Nineties: Meeting the Challenge.''
   He recommended a regulatory structure for S&amp;Ls similar to the
system for banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an
arm of the Treasury Department, charters national banks, while the
FDIC insures their deposits.
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest
trade group, has not taken a position on separating the FSLIC from
the bank board, but its chairman, B.R. Beeksma, said recently the
question should be considered. The bank board's performance as a
chartering agency may be suffering because it is consumed with the
problems of the FSLIC, he said.
   The FDIC, which prepared the report for Congress, also
recommended placing S&amp;L examiners under the FSLIC. Currently, the
examiners work for the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which lend
money to S&amp;Ls, are owned by the industry and are controlled by
boards composed of S&amp;L executives.
   The current system can have the effect of allowing S&amp;Ls with
representatives on the regional bank boards to regulate their
competitors, Seidman said.
   The FDIC made no recommendation on how money should be raised to
pay for the S&amp;L crisis, but said it was clear that the federal
government, rather than the S&amp;L industry or banks, will have to pay
most of the $60 billion to $115 billion needed to restore S&amp;Ls to
health.
   But, it said, ``concerns about the federal budget deficit could
be mitigated by an off-budget financing arrangement'' in which the
Treasury pays the interest on borrowing to finance the industry's
rescue.
   The Treasury Department is preparing a recommendation for
President-elect Bush and the new Congress.
   Meanwhile, the FDIC rejected proposals to curtail or eliminate
federal deposit insurance, arguing that would increase the danger of
bank runs.
   Some scholars say reducing or doing away with the insurance would
force depositors to pay more attention to how well their
institutions are run. The American Bankers Association said in a
statement Wednesday that the current practice of protecting even
depositors with funds in excess of the $100,000 insurance limit
``has become a license for abuse by some financial managers.''
   But, Seidman said, ``In today's complex world, we think the
depositor, both sophisticated and unsophisticated, would have great
difficulty in knowing the condition of their banks on a day-to-day
basis. ... We as bank regulators with thousands of supervisors have
difficulty in keeping control of banks in terms of their exact
financial condition.''

<HEAD>CBS Tops Own Movie High for Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC racked up its 15th consecutive victory, its
longest streak in the Nielsens, but CBS was celebrating by winning
the top four spots in the rankings and the highest-rated TV movie
this season.
   ``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' about the life and death of the
popular singer, followed a big football game Sunday night and ran
against ``A View to a Kill'' on ABC and ``Gremlins'' on NBC. It was
the No. 1 show last week with a rating of 26.3 and a 41 share, the
A.C. Nielsen Co. said.
   That topped the CBS movie of two weeks ago, ``A Very Brady
Christmas,'' which had been the highest-rated movie this season with
a 25.1 and 39.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with television. The share
is a percentage of sets in use during the show's time period.
   Sunday's NFL playoff game between Minnesota and San Francisco
boosted CBS' Sunday night lineup.
   The top 10 shows were: ``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``NFL Playoff Post-Game Show,'' all
CBS; ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers,''
ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' and NBC's ``A Different World'' and
``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   For the week, NBC had a 13.6 rating, and CBS edged ABC for
second, 12.3 to 12.2.
   CBS' ``Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story,'' another
fact-based movie about a football coach who battled Lou Gehrig's
Disease, also scored well and ranked 18th, giving CBS its first
Monday night victory this season.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' rounded out a good-news week for the
network by maintaining its narrow lead in the news race. CBS had a
12.1 rating and a 22 share. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.4
and 21. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.2 and 21.

<HEAD>Official News Agency Workers Set Walkout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions representing editorial and other
employees of the official Sudan News Agency say they will strike for
a week, starting Saturday, to protest what they called deteriorating
standards in the agency.
   The five unions said in a statement Wednesday that the walkout
also is to support demands for a stronger administration and removal
of government control from news story content.
   The government divested itself of newspapers after President
Gaafar Nimeiri was overthrown in April 1985, but kept control of the
news agency under the Ministry of Culture.
   Nimeiri created SUNA in 1972. It was generously funded when it
served as Nimeiri's mouthpiece, but its financing and facilities
were reduced greatly after 1985.
   Sudan's official radio and television and independent newspapers
rely heavily on SUNA for news, especially from outside Khartoum.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Europeans searching each other's
stores for bargains in Soviet caviar, Czech auto parts and Bulgarian
sportswear have set off an unprecedented ``customs war'' in the
communist bloc.
   The new Soviet freedom to travel and relaxations on travel
throughout much of Eastern Europe lie behind the East's trade
skirmishes and new trends in bargain hunting both east and west.
   The first salvo was fired by Czechoslovakia, which on Nov. 15
gave its Warsaw Pact allies only 24 hours notice that it was banning
the export of 80 consumer items, including toilet paper, children's
clothes, cars and car parts, bananas and chocolate.
   Czechoslovak officials explained the sudden action with the need
to protect their own consumers, who are used to a relatively cozy
standard of living that the Prague government is finding harder to
maintain as the economy stagnates.
   East Germany, whose 17 million citizens frequently journey to
Czechoslovakia as the only nation they can visit without a visa,
swiftly fired back a reply.
   On Nov. 18, it banned the export of items ranging from curtains
to maps _ both popular purchases for Czechoslovaks crossing into
East Germany.
   Poland was so enraged by the Czechoslovak restrictions that it
took the unusual step of summoning Czechoslovakia's ranking consular
official to the Foreign Ministry in Warsaw to explain the new
customs restrictions.
   Poles, who have the reputation in Eastern Europe of being the
region's greatest black market traders, grumbled about five-hour
delays at the Czechoslovak border as guards searched trains for
hidden supplies of fruit, meat and tea that can no longer be taken
out of the country.
   Czechoslovakia's Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo
noted, meanwhile, that in the first nine months of 1988, six Poles,
four East Germans and three Hungarians visited Czechoslovakia for
every Czech or Slovak going to those nations.
   The Soviet Union took a little longer to react to
Czechoslovakia's sudden steps, waiting until last weekend to
announce a ban from February on the export of caviar, coffee,
children's clothes and electrical goods.
   Black market dealers in caviar in Vienna say the ban on that
luxury item may be prompted more by heavy pollution killing
caviar-producing fish in the Caspian sea, while Polish dealers in
caviar brought back by Polish workers from the Soviet Union doubt
the ban will affect their supplies.
   The Czechoslovak ban seems to have been the main reason for the
Soviet move.
   ``I hope we are taking retaliatory measures,'' said a senior
Soviet economist visiting Vienna in December. ``We can't let the
Czechoslovaks just behave like that, however much they want to
protect their market.''
   In Vienna and eastern Austria, Hungarians' year-old new freedom
to travel West as often as they like has spawned dozens of new
stores touting the video recorders and sophisticated electronic
goods Hungarians love.
   On Nov. 7, when they were supposed to be celebrating the 71st
anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, 100,000 people from
Hungary brought traffic to a complete standstill in Vienna.
   Hungarians spent the equivalent of $500 million in Austria last
year, while Austrians _ who have long enjoyed the cheap dental
services, salami and other goods available in Hungary _ dumped the
equivalent of $300 million in Hungary.
   Other Westerners enjoying East bloc plenty are Greeks who travel
to neighboring Bulgaria. Apparently anxious to protect its own
consumer market from Greeks, Israeli and Arab tourists who buy cheap
dairy products, bedding, blankets and shoes, Bulgaria in December
clamped an export ban on those items and dozens of others.
   Many of the items that fall under the new East bloc restrictions
may not seem desirable to the Western consumer.
   Bulgarian vacuum cleaners, Soviet refrigerators and tea from
Czechoslovakia may seem unlikely prizes, but they often compensate
for shortages at home, or can be sold to residents of East bloc
nations willing to pay double or more for such a consumer prize.
   Last summer, Austrian border crossings into Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, and Yugoslavia were crowded with East European cars _
mostly East German Trabants driven by enterprising Poles _ weighed
down to the ground with goods to be sold or consumed at home.
   Even before Czechoslovakia formally restricted such traffic, it
drew the ire of the nation's border guards.
   A line of 50 cars, mostly Poles returning from vacations in
Yugoslavia, waited six hours _ until 3 a.m. _ to cross into
Bratislava from Austria last August. When asked why, a Czechoslovak
customs official, muttered, ``The bloody Poles!''
   The new freedom to travel also has strained the East bloc's
transport capacaties.
   Soviets who went on unbridled shopping sprees in Prague's
relatively well-stocked and brightly decorated stores found last
summer that it would take at leat a bottle of Russian vodka to bribe
their way home on hopelessly overbooked trains.
   The daily sleeper between Vienna and Moscow also is overbooked,
with many Soviet travelers returning from the West reserving bunks
simply to take their overweight imports of videocassettes,
televisions and other Western goodies.
   The only nation that so far seems unaffected by the East European
travel boom is Romania, whose 23 million citizens have scarce
opportunity to journey abroad.
   Those who do get out find their extreme shortages at home _ even
bread was unavailable in Bucharest for a week in July _ make them
grateful for the smallest luxury outside.
   ``Mmm, what a beer!'' beamed a contented Romanian visiting
Vienna. ``I'd forgotten the taste.''

<HEAD>FDA Chief Says Agency Swamped With New Drug Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Food and Drug Administration
says the number of applications for new drug approvals is doubling
every year, a pace that threatens to choke the agency's ability to
pass judgment on them.
   ``We cannot do this with smoke and mirrors,'' FDA Commissioner
Frank E. Young on Wednesday told a panel of researchers looking for
ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer and AIDS.
   Young said the FDA is receiving an average of 10 applications
each month requesting permission to begin clinical trials for a new
drug, the first step in getting the drug approved for prescription
use by the public. The monthly total has doubled every year since
1984, he said.
   Unless the agency gets more staff, ``the whole ship is going to
sink,'' Young said after his presentation.
   Young defended his agency's record against criticism from
government cancer researchers that the FDA is slow in approving new
drugs that offer hope of prolonging the lives of cancer and AIDS
sufferers.
   ``Drugs for the desperately ill remain our highest priority,''
Young said.
   ``Certainly, there will be honest disagreements and inadvertent
delays,'' he said. ``But the point I want to make is that we place
the highest priority on the review of drugs for life-threatening
illness.''
   The FDA's review time for 12 important cancer drugs approved in
recent years averaged just over 10 months, he said. The only drug so
far approved for AIDS patients, AZT, was approved in 107 days, he
said.
   New streamlined procedures announced last fall will cut FDA
review time in half, he added.
   But National Cancer Institute officials said the FDA should be
more flexible in its requirements and encourage early testing of new
drugs in children who have cancer and AIDS.
   They also said the FDA is too stringent in the proof it requires
that a proposed new medication extend survival longer than existing
drugs.
   ``You have to stay away from'' insisting on such evidence because
the result is that ``it rations a therapy,'' said Dr. Samuel Broder,
new director of the National Cancer Institute.
   Young said the criticism reflects a ``misperception about FDA
requirements.'' He said effects other than survival are considered
in approval reviews.
   Dr. Louis Lasagna, chairman of the panel studying how to speed up
the process, said his committee hopes to establish ``mechanisms to
mediate'' the fireworks between the FDA and the cancer institute.
   ``Because there is so much public pressure regarding AIDS, about
not wasting time getting treatments to victims ... we might be able
to capitalize on that concern to bring about improvements in the
drug approval process,'' Lasagna said.
   The panel of nine scientists from leading pharmaceutical and
biotechnical companies and major universities and laboratories was
appointed by the President's Cancer Panel, headed by Dr. Armand
Hammer.
   President-elect Bush, as chief of the Presidential Task Force on
Regulatory Relief, last year asked the cancer panel to undertake the
study.
   Hammer said that in a meeting Tuesday, Bush repeated his
commitment to the project.
   ``He was so positive,'' Hammer said. ``I've known him for a great
number of years and I've never known him to be so keen about
something as he is about that.''

   The New York bureau chief and a producer of a French television
station were arrested Wednesday and charged with trying to check
fake bombs at Kennedy Airport, and a Dutch TV station reported
smuggling a phony bomb onto a London-bound flight, authorities said.
   In Amsterdam, TV station Veronica filmed one of its reporters
carrying an attache case containing the imitation bomb through
security checkpoints and onto an aircraft at Schiphol Airport,
considered one of the safest in Europe.
   In the Kennedy Airport incident, three packages containing bogus
bombs were left for shipment on Paris-bound flights at the small
cargo areas of three international airlines, Port Authority police
said.
   The packages also contained a typed message that read in part:
``Congratulations! You have found our phony bomb! (made with molding
clay, one alarm clock and wires),'' said PA spokesman Armando
Arrastia.
   The message was written on the letterhead of the French
television station TF1 and signed by the station's New York bureau
chief, Alain Chaillou, he said.
   Bruce Frankel, 37, a TF1 producer, was arrested at 3:30 p.m.
after a TWA counter employee became suspicious of a 6-inch-by-8-inch
package Frankel wanted to check through to Paris, Arrastia said.
   Inspecting the package, the employee found what appeared to be a
bomb, he said. When PA police arrived, Frankel cried, ``No, no it's
a fake!'' and ``took the bomb apart as the police officer and others
watched,'' Arrastia said.
   Frankel then told police he had delivered two similar packages to
the small cargo areas of Pan American Airlines and Air France,
Arrastia said.
   Chaillou turned himself in to police later, and both men were
charged with violating the federal explosives statute, said FBI
agent Mary Frances Lilly.
   A package had been accepted at Air France at about 2 p.m. by an
employee who knew Frankel because he often used the airlines to send
film to the television station in Paris, said Bruce Haxthausen, an
Air France spokesman.
   Because of Wednesday's incident, Haxthausen said, Air France will
be inspecting every shipment received at a cargo facility, rather
than random inspections of cargoes received from known shippers.
   The Air France cargo area was evacuated for a brief time after
authorities were notified about the suspicious package, said
Haxthausen.
   At the Pan Am small cargo check-in, the package had been accepted
and ``was on its way to the X-ray when the New York Port Authority
police walked in and seized the package,'' said Alan Loflin, an
airline spokesman.
   TWA spokesman Robert Blattner said, ``We are very pleased our
employees were able to use their techniques and just solve the case
on the spot.''
   Frankel and Chaillou were being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Manhattan, Lilly said, and on Thursday were
to appear before a U.S. magistrate.
   Alouane Jeanterne, a documentary producer at TF1, said he learned
of Frankel and Chaillou's arrests late Wednesday when Chaillou's
wife, Cerile, called him at the station's New York bureau.
   He said he didn't know anything about the airport incident before
that.
   ``If you're asking me my ethical judgment about it, I really
don't know,'' said Jeanterne. ``Every reporter has his own way of
getting things, of getting sources, of getting to the news. I have
not come to a private opinion yet. My own thinking now is what is
going to happen to Chaillou.''
   He said he did not know if Chaillou's superiors in Paris knew
anything in advance about the bogus explosives.
   The message contained in each of the packages, also said: ``We
are TF1, the largest television network in France, and it is with
due respect and great pleasure that we will tell our 18 million
viewers who watch our daily newscast at 8, that we found your
company to be keen and consistent with security matters.''
   In Amsterdam, television station Veronica reported Wednesday that
it smuggled its fake bomb onto a London-bound flight to demonstrate
that terrorists can pass security checks with relative ease.
   The imitation bomb consisted of harmless paste made to resemble a
plastic explosive of the type thought responsible for the Dec. 21
bombing of Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people, the report said.
   Reporter Gert Berg carried the briefcase, which also contained a
portable stereo wired to resemble a detonator, onto the aircraft.
   He was filmed putting the fake explosive and detonator into the
case, checking his baggage and opening the attache case on the
aircraft. The case was filmed passing through an X-ray device.
   The airline involved was not identified on the program.
   A written response by airport police read on the program said
they may install more comprehensive scanning equipment when testing
on machines in the United States and Britain is complete. Rick Hirs,
spokesman for Schiphol police, could not be reached for comment
despite several attempts by The Associated Press.

   The Congressional Budget Office says slashing
next year's federal deficit is going to be a more formidable job
than Reagan administration officials and aides to President-elect
Bush realize.
   The budget office, in a report released Wednesday, said the
fiscal 1990 deficit will be $141 billion unless new taxes or
spending cuts are instituted. The Reagan administration has
estimated next year's red ink at a more manageable $127 billion.
   The numbers presented by the non-partisan congressional agency,
if accurate, would make it even more difficult for Bush and Congress
to meet the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's 1990 deficit target
of $100 billion.
   Under that law, if the government fails to come within $10
billion of the deficit target, spending cuts are automatically
triggered in a range of domestic and defense programs until the goal
is achieved. Most lawmakers say the resulting reductions in federal
services would be so unpopular with the public that this path is
politically unfeasible.
   The Gramm-Rudman law states that the administration's deficit
forecast _ not the one made by CB0 _ determines whether the
automatic cuts would be necessary. But Congress relies on the CBO
figures as a guideline in its budget work.
   ``Both the Congress and the president, if those projections were
way off, will face the same consequences,'' new House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said of the
administration's more optimistic forecast.
   If CBO is correct, Bush and lawmakers will have to find $41
billion in deficit reductions to meet the Gramm-Rudman target. Even
if the administration's forecast is accurate, many legislators have
said that Bush's repeated campaign promises to forego new taxes will
make it hard to avoid Gramm-Rudman's automatic cuts.
   On Monday, 11 days before he leaves office, President Reagan will
present Congress with a $1.2 trillion budget for fiscal 1990, which
begins Oct. 1. Administration officials have said Reagan found
enough savings to produce a $92.5 billion deficit, well within the
Gramm-Rudman goal.
   Reagan has said if his cuts are made, the budget will be balanced
by 1993, the same year the Gramm-Rudman law requires the elimination
of the deficit. The CBO report said, however, that without savings,
1993 will see $129 billion in red ink.
   Reagan's spending plan is not binding, and Bush and lawmakers
will virtually have to start all over again in their efforts to
forge a 1990 spending blueprint.
   Last year's deficit was $155 billion, and CBO thinks it will
again be that large for fiscal 1989.
   The CBO raised its deficit projections from a forecast last
August by $7 billion for the current fiscal year and $5 billion for
fiscal 1990. The key reason: the cost of shoring up the ailing
savings and loan industry.
   The CBO deficit report was based on projections that the economy
would continue a slow but steady growth of 2.2 percent in 1990 and
1991 and 2.3 percent in each of the next two years, with
unemployment holding steady, inflation increasing slightly next year
and interest rates gradually declining.

<HEAD>Americans Get Pickier About Their Food</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says Americans seem
to be eating a bit more each year but are choosier about what's on
the menu.
   A 20-year statistical study by the department's Economic Research
Service found that per capita food consumption overall rose 0.7
percent in 1987 to a record level, including a 1.8 percent increase
in foods from crops, while food from animals dropped 0.3 percent.
   Analysts said the decline in animal products occurred as a result
of lower per capita consumption of beef, eggs, whole milk, butter,
lard and edible tallow.
   The agency cautioned in the report about taking the figures too
literally because much of the information is derived from
farm-to-market statistics and other trade information.
   ``Strictly speaking, the food disappearance estimates should be
designated as supplies moving through trade channels for domestic
consumption,'' the report said. ``However, because most foods are
perishable, changes in disappearance presumably are associated with
changes in actual consumption.''
   The information is useful as an indicator of trends, even if ``it
is not a measure of actual consumption or the quantity ingested'' by
consumers, the report added.
   For example, the latest review by USDA economists said that crop
food consumption rose 17 percent from 1967 to 1987, compared with a
3.5 percent increase in the consumption of animal products.
   ``Consumption of foods in most crop categories has risen steadily
in the last 20 years, especially fats and oils, vegetable, grain
products and sweeteners,'' the report said. ``Use of fruit jumped in
the mid-1980s. In contrast, Americans used less red meat, eggs,
fluid milk and cream, and animal fats, moderating the increase for
animal products.''
   Of all the meat consumed by Americans in 1987, 59 percent was red
meat _ mainly beef and pork _ compared with 71 percent in the early
1970s. Instead, people ate more poultry and fish.
   In 1987, for the first time, the per capita consumption of
poultry, on a retail weight basis, was greater than beef _ 78 pounds
per person, compared with 73 pounds, the report said.
   But there's a catch. Measured on the basis of boneless weight,
Americans still ate more beef _ 69 pounds versus 55 pounds.
   ``That is because poultry at the retail level contains relatively
more bone than beef does,'' the report said.
   Per capita consumption of fishery products in 1987 was a record
15.4 pounds, up 45 percent from 1967 and 21 percent more than in
1977.
   Egg consumption in 1987 dropped 23 per cent to a per capita
average of 249 eggs from 322 in 1967. The all-time record was 403
eggs in 1945.
   In the period of 1985-87, the United States led the world by
consuming an average 248 pounds of red meat and poultry per person.
That is a ``carcass weight'' equivalent before a slaughtered animal
is divided into smaller cuts.
   Australia was second at 230 pounds carcass weight per capita,
followed by Argentina and New Zealand, each at 226 pounds. The
Soviet Union, by comparison, averaged 145 pounds per capita.
   Japan and Iceland lead the world in the consumption of fishery
products. In the period of 1982-84, the typical Japanese consumed
annually an average of 190 pounds of fish and shellfish, liveweight
equivalent, more than five times, the consumption of the average
American.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold an additional 440,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat
to China at subsidized prices and more corn to the Soviet Union.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday the wheat was part of 1
million tons authorized Dec. 30 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under the EEP arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   The wheat sales, equal to about 17.3 million bushels, were
handled by five companies: Continental Grain Co., 70,000 tons;
Cargill Inc., 270,000; Tradigrain Inc., 30,000; Tradecom Inc.,
30,000; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 40,000.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for January delivery and will carry
an average subsidy rate of $22.64 per ton, or about 62 cents per
bushel.
   Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
China has 570,000 tons still available under the program.
   The Soviet Union bought an additional 250,000 tons of corn for
delivery under a long-term grain agreement with the United States.
That boosted corn sales to the Soviets in the 1988-89 agreement year
to nearly 10.2 million tons.
   Besides the corn, the Soviets have ordered 370,000 tons of wheat,
450,000 tons of soybeans and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus
500,000 tons of grain sorghum for 1988-89 delivery. Only the wheat
has been subsidized.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 440,000 tons of
wheat would be about 16.1 million bushels. The latest corn sales to
the Soviet Union would be about 9.9 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $64 million. The corn, at $2.60 per bushel, could
have a farm value of about $26 million.

<HEAD>Court Papers Reveal How Ex-Pentagon Official Got Inside Info</HEAD>

   With speculation that the first
indictments could come soon in the Pentagon fraud case, new court
papers provide fresh details on how one private consultant in the
case allegedly trafficked in valuable Department information.
   A federal grand jury is meeting today and Friday outside
Washington, where U.S. attorney Henry Hudson is spearheading the
nationwide investigation that began in September 1986.
   Sharon Dibbley, Hudson's spokeswoman, refused to say whether any
indictments would be handed up this week, but one defense attorney
guessed they could come on Friday. Last November, Hudson predicted
indictments could be in hand that month.
   Dibbley also kept mum about if and when any plea bargaining
arrangements might be revealed. Hazeltine Corp., of Long Island,
N.Y., has said it is cooperating with the government, according to
company attorney, William Cummings.
   Meantime, a search warrant unsealed this week in federal court
painted a vivid picture of the activities of William Parkin, a
consultant who made money obtaining information for large defense
contractors.
   Among the contractors who paid Parkin thousands of dollars were
Hazeltine, Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.; Northrop
Corp., and Unisys.
   Central to the government's case are allegations that consultants
bribed Defense Department employees to secure insider information
about lucrative, multimillion-dollar government contracts.
   Parkin, who was employed by the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile
Project Office from 1977 until 1983, used a variety of means to
obtain information, the search warrant says. Information was
obtained through telephone intercepts and recorded conversations.
   Parkin's attorney, Gerard Treanor, has said that his client is
confident that he had done nothing wrong. ``Parkin is going to be
found not guilty before a jury,'' he said.
   Here, for example, are some of Parkin's methods for obtaining
information, according to the search warrant.
   _ Last February, Parkin, who was paid by Northrop, sought
information about figures on how much the Navy planned to spend on
the medium-range remotely piloted vehicle. Northrop was interested
in the contract.
   A Navy official would not tell Parkin, but ``did leave Parkin
alone in (the) ... office so that Parkin could sneak a look at the
papers on the desk.'' Parkin obtained the numbers.
   _ Parkin paid Jean Uebele, a former contract negotiator at the
cruise missile office where Parkin once worked, $100 a week for
information, the warrant says.
   ``Uebele frequently called for her biweekly checks of $50,'' the
paper said. Sheila Wohlfarth, then Parkin's secretary, once told
Uebele she was making the checks out to ``Smith's Maid Service.''
   Occasionally, Parkin asked Uebele for copies of documents.
   ``In one conversation in March 1987, Uebele called Parkin and
told him that if he parked his car in her place at the Pentagon, she
would put materials in the trunk, including all of her instructions,
cost and pricing lists, reference books, copies of every contract
and information relating to MCDEC,'' the Marine Corps Development
Education Center, the search warrant said.
   Uebele retired from her job at the Navy last week, her office
said. Her office did not have a forwarding telephone number and her
home number was not listed.
   _ Mrs. Wohlfarth, Parkin's secretary, was the wife of Robert
Wohlfarth, a patent attorney with the Navy.
   ``In an April 1987 conversation Wohlfarth complained to his wife
that Parkin promptly paid the other guys he worked with or they
called him. The implication was that Parkin owed Wohlfarth for the
information he had provided,'' the search warrant said.
   Wohlfarth refused to discuss his relationship, referring all
telephone calls to his attorney, Neil Eggleston, who was out of town.
   Prosecutors said last week they no longer need to keep under seal
search warrants and affidavits issued in June because they've
completed the investigative phase of the case. Papers have been
released here and in Brooklyn, N.Y., but remain under seal in St.
Louis, Minneapolis and Los Angeles.

   A health food store manager from
New York said an upset stomach today kept him from trying to beat
his previous world record of walking with a bottle of milk on his
head for 32 miles.
   Ashrita Furman, of Queens, who has more listings in the Guinness

feat on the track at Independence Stadium.
   ``I was throwing up and having diarrhea all night long,'' Furman,
35, told reporters.
   He said he will take another shot at the record later this month
when he travels to Chiangmai, Thailand on a tour by the Queens-based
Sri Chinmoy Center for meditation, yoga exercises and culture.
   Furman, who has rolled, hopped, jumped, rowed, clapped, skipped,
somersaulted and balanced his way to 11 world records, was presented
a ``versatility'' record by the Guinness Book of World Records in
1987 for having records in more categories than anyone else in the
world.

   A libel case brought by Tom Selleck's father
will go to trial against a supermarket tabloid, which claimed Robert
Selleck gave his son's ``love secrets'' to the publication, the
state Supreme Court ruled.
   The court on Wednesday unanimously upheld a lower-court ruling
reinstating Robert Selleck's libel lawsuit against Globe
International and upholding his status as a private figure, which
makes it easier to win a libel case.
   The lawsuit stems from a December 1982 issue of the Globe that
carried the front-page headline, ``Tom Selleck's Love Secrets _ By
His Father.''
   The story, on an inside page, was headlined, ``Why Tom Selleck
Can Never Be a Happy Lover.''
   It said Robert Selleck had described his son as shy and ill at
ease with women, and quoted the elder Selleck as saying, ``Tom's
relationships with women in his life are always disappointing
because he's just not the person they think he should be. He's shy
and sensitive, not rough and rugged.''
   In his lawsuit, Robert Selleck said he had a brief, innocuous
conversation with the writer of the article, but denied saying
anything about his son's relationships with women.
   Stephen Rawson, a Globe lawyer, said, ``We expect to prevail in
the case eventually.'' Robert Selleck's attorney did not immediately
return telephone calls.

   President-elect Bush was urged today to support
development of new types of nuclear power plants as a way of slowing
global warming caused by the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Research on new types of nuclear reactors is one way to develop
energy sources that produce no carbon dioxide, a principal cause of
the atmospheric warming, said a panel convened by the National
Academy of Sciences and two sister organizations.
   The academy, the National Academy of Engineering and the National
Institute of Medicine made a series of recommendations to the
president-elect on the environment, AIDS, space and science policy.
   In a cover letter to Bush, the presidents of the three bodies
said, ``global environmental change must be made more prominent in
the scientific, political and foreign policy agendas of the United
States.''
   The letter concentrated on five other points:
   _Since global warming and acid rain are both produced by use of
fossil fuels, ``efforts to enhance both energy efficiency and
conservation should be strengthened.'' It added that ways to
increase ``use of the `cleanest' fossil fuels, such as natural gas,
should be considered, but in the context of their finite
availability.''
   _Immediate assessment of possible responses to rising sea levels,
drought and the northward migration of agricultural zones.
   _Nations that have signed a treaty to reduce emissions that
destroy the ozone layer should be encouraged to accelerate those
reductions and aim at a ``total phaseout.'' These chemical account
for about a fifth of the expected global warming. The Environmental
Protection Agency already has called for such a phaseout.
   _Strategies are needed to prevent the destruction of tropical
forests. The loss of forests around the world probably adds a fifth
of the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels, the group said. An
area the size of Missouri is lost each year, according to some
estimates, and if nothing is done there could be no tropical forests
left early in the next century, the panel said.
   _A ``substantial investment'' is needed in ground-based and
space-based monitoring of the earth.
   ``Leadership by the United States could be a powerful force for
uniting the nations of the world in a common endeavor vitally
important to all,'' the academy presidents said.
   The report cited predictions of a two-to-nine degrees Fahrenheit
increase in average temperatures sometime in the next century and
said: ``While global environmental change cannot be stopped, the
pace of change can be slowed.''
   ``Production of energy from fossil fuels is the root of several
of the agents of global environmental change,'' the report said.
   The report also recommended re-examining use of wind and solar
energy ``to see if recent progress has improved their economic
feasibility as possible substitutes for fossil fuels in the years
ahead.''

<HEAD>Study May Help Explain Mental Impairment in Some Muscular Dystrophy</HEAD>

   Brain cells produce a modified version of an
important muscle protein, says a study that may help explain why
muscular dystrophy causes mental impairment in some people.
   Scientists have been puzzled about why Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, the most common and severe form of the disease, leads to
mental trouble in some but not all of its victims.
   Duchenne is caused by defects in the gene that tells muscle cells
how to make a protein called dystrophin. The defects can prevent
dystrophin production, leading to progressive weakness and wasting
of voluntary muscles.
   One-third to one-half of Duchenne patients also suffer mild to
moderate mental impairment, according to the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.
   In today's issue of the British journal Nature, Israeli
scientists working with rodent tissue said they found that brain
cells make a modified version of dystrophin.
   That suggests that the protein-making machinery in brain cells
``reads'' the dystrophin gene differently from the machinery in
muscle cells, said Donald Wood of the dystrophy association, which
partially financed the research.
   If so, defects that prevent dystrophin production in muscle may
not necessarily hinder production of the brain's version, he said.
   So a Duchenne patient with normal production of brain dystrophin
may keep normal intellectual capability, while a patient whose
genetic defect hinders the brain's production of dystrophin may
suffer mental impairment, Wood explained.
   The degree of impairment may depend on whether a patient has no
brain dystrophin, too little or an abnormal form of it, Wood said.
   He stressed the overall concept is only speculation. Nobody knows
what role dystrophin plays in the brain, he said.
   While the study will not immediately help in therapy, ``it
represents a step forward in our evolution of understanding
dystrophin,'' he said.

<HEAD>Luzerne County Coroner Rules Starving Death of Teen Homicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NUANGOLA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The starvation death of a 14-year-old boy
has been ruled a homicide, police said Wednesday, after the boy's
father, mother and sisters were hospitalized for malnutrition.
   Eric Charles Cottam's death was ruled a homicide by Dr. George E.
Hudock Jr., the Luzerne County coroner. He said the 5-foot-10
teen-ager had not eaten in at least three weeks and weighed 69
pounds, or 80 pounds less than normal.
   District Attorney Correale F. Stevens said he will meet Thursday
with investigators to decide whether to file charges.
   Police called to the home by the teen's 39-year-old father, Larry
Cottam, an unemployed former minister, and found the body at 11:55
a.m., police said.
   There was no food in the neat, sparsely furnished house,
according to investigators, who spoke on condition of anonynimity.
   A neighbor, James Lauer, said police found the son, his mother,
Leona, 37, and 12-year-old sister, Laura, in their beds.
   Laura and Leona Cottam were hospitalized in serious condition in
Mercy Hospital in Wilkes-Barre. Cottam, a former Seventh-Day
Adventist minister, also was in serious condition, said nursing
supervisor Barb Jones.
   At a news conference after the autopsy Wednesday, Hudock said he
ruled the death a homicide because he could find no disease that
could have caused the teen's emaciation.
   ``A boy that age, of normal mental status, would want to eat,''
Hudock said.
   Investigators told the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader they believed
the family's religion figured in the starvation.
   Larry and Leona Cottam recently won the right to educate their
children at home after a two-year battle with the Crestwood School
District.
   Neighbors said the Cottams were an intensely private couple whose
children rarely, if ever, socialized with other neighborhood
children.
   Neighbors said the family was too proud to ask for public welfare
after Cottam was fired from his job as a truck driver at Norandex
Inc. in Wilkes-Barre in March.
   Cottam was pastor of four Seventh-Day Adventist churches with a
congregration of about 250, until 1984, when he was transferred to
Pittsburgh. The family moved back to Nuangola in 1985 after he lost
his post in Pittsburgh.
   The Cottams were friendly and polite, according to neighbors, but
became even more reclusive after they returned and were rarely seen
outside the home.

   Manicurist Joyce Mays doesn't bite her nails
anymore, and she stopped cutting them three years ago. The result:
twisting, brightly painted, 5-inch-long talons that are her most
prized possessions.
   Mays' clawlike fingernails astonish passersby who often peer
through the window of the salon where she works and watch her give
manicures.
   ``People stare at my nails,'' said Mays, 43. ``When they do, it
doesn't bother me. I try to get closer _ and give them one of my
business cards.''
   To protect her nails, she never uses them in mundane tasks like
dialing the phone. Instead, her knuckles get a lot of wear and tear.
She also can't change the sheets on the bed, relying on her husband,
Bill, to perform that chore.
   Every three weeks, she paints a new acrylic design on her long,
long nails.
   When Pope John Paul II visited New Orleans last year, she painted
a picture of the pontiff, hands clasped in prayer, on a thumbnail.
On the other thumbnail was a likeness of St. Louis Cathedral, blue
sky in the background and a banner with the pope's name flying above
it.
   ``I like doing the different art work on my nails,'' Mays said.
``Besides, I like the attention.''

   It sounded for a moment as though Gov. Rose
Mofford had created the ultimate government agency.
   A news release distributed by her office Wednesday listed
appointees to several state boards and commissions, including the
``Regulation Regulatory Commission.''
   Aides later said the reference was a typographical error; the
governor's office had meant to announce an appointment to the
Radiation Regulatory Commission.

   Shhhhhh. Don't tell the folks. The fall
grades on some report cards at Northwestern University might not be
as good as they look.
   That A, B, C or D might actually be an A-minus, B-minus, C-minus
or D-minus.
   ``The character on the printer that makes the minus sign was worn
down to the point that when it hit the paper, it didn't make an
impression,'' university Registrar Donald Gwinn said Wednesday.
   So no minuses were visible on report cards mailed to
undergraduates.
   Gwinn said his office learned about the problem Tuesday when the
new term started and some students complained that their fall
grade-point averages did not match the grades printed on the report
cards.
   For example, students whose reports cards listed A's for every
fall subject were puzzled when the grade-point average did not read
a perfect 4.0.
   ``They may have had a minus in a class _ but they couldn't see
it,'' Gwinn said.
   New report cards will not be issued, but students can get free
transcripts that show the actual grades, he said.

   Step inside Yogi Ward's taxi and enter a
fantasyland where the driver is king and every day's a holiday.
   Flashing lights rim the ceiling and tinsel brushes a rider's head
as the car rumbles through city streets.
   The decor changes with the season, but Ward, armed with phone,
beeper and taped words of wisdom, remains the same.
   Ward, 44, figures he'll keep the New Year's decorations for a few
weeks, before it's time to bring out the pink paper hearts, arrows
and cupids for Valentine's Day.
   ``It's cheerful, it's an idealistic type of thing, it's a
situation that keeps a lot of stress off of you and it's a happy
cab,'' said Ward, 44, who owns the cab and drives for Checker Taxi
Co.
   Ward said he decided to decorate his taxi a few years ago, when
he was working for another cab company.
   ``I had seen a few cabs around the city that had some ornaments
and they were not displayed correctly, as I would think they should
have been,'' Ward said.
   ``So I decided to display them in the proper way,'' he said while
cruising north on a Chicago expressway.
   Ward serached the city's variety stores, picking up bundles of
tacky decorations for every occasion.
   ``I give away little hearts and candies for Valentine's Day,'' he
said. ``St. Patrick's Day, I mostly have those four-leaf clovers and
have the Irish green different things in the car.''
   ``Everyone loves it and nobody wants me to take the decorations
down,'' he said. ``People are waving at me down the street. I had a
police paddy wagon wave at me. State troopers wave at me. An
ambulance tipped their lights at me.
   ``I had one lady that came to the cab and said, ```Ooh, the
Christmas cab is here!'''
   Another woman took one look at his cab and said, ```That's just
too Christmassy.' She decided that she'd wait for the next cab,'' he
recalled.
   But there's more to Ward's cab than decorations. He plays
cassettes of his own weather reports, news items, and offers words
of wisdom.
   ``If you're out there ... smoking, bebopping or doing something
that you're not supposed to be doing ... the police are out in
droves and they'll be waiting for you,'' says Ward's tape for the
New Year.
   He's working on his Valentine's Day message.
   For those for think one ride with Ward is not enough, he hands
out gold business cards with the number of his car phone, his beeper
number, his home number, and a phone number for an answering service.
   Beverly Morris, a 36-year-old advertising saleswoman, has been a
Ward customer for about five years.
   ``It's a nice refreshing thing ... especially the Christmas
(decorations),'' she said. ``You walk in and it really makes you
feel like Christmas.''
   But even Mrs. Morris gets tired of the hoopla.
   ``Sometimes I have to act like I'm asleep,'' she said. ``He'll
just keep talking.''

   A woman killed her four children and then
fatally shot herself Wednesday at their rural home near the Missouri
border, authorities said.
   ``The bodies were discovered when the father came home from
work,'' Adams County Sheriff Robert Nall said.
   Sheila Epker, 27, apparently drowned her oldest daughter, Casey,
in a bathtub, then shot daughters Shannon and Mandy, son Lance and
herself, Nall said.
   ``I've been in law enforcement for 19 years, and this is the most
gruesome thing I have ever seen,'' the sheriff said.
   The killings apparently occurred between 3:30 p.m. and 5:15 p.m.
Greg Epker, 32, returned home from his job at Century Signs Inc. in
Quincy and found the bodies, the sheriff said.
   Mendon, with a population of nearly 1,000, is about 10 miles
north of Quincy and 135 miles northwest of St. Louis.
   The sheriff said Epker was taken to St. Mary's Hospital in Quincy
for shock.
   ``We're trying to determine the sequence of events and what took
place,'' Nall said. ``At this point, we have found no motive. It was
a spontaneous event, and we don't know what happened.
   ``We may never know exactly,'' he said.
   Neighbors said the family has lived in Mendon for about seven
years. The children apparently ranged in age from 1 to 8.
   Mayor Gene Rogers, an insurance salesman, said the violence is
uncommon for the small town.
   ``We've got a grocery, a gas station, a bank and variety store _
that's pretty much Mendon, except for one oil company that services
the local area,'' Rogers said.
   Ron Durk, owner of the town bowling alley, said he lives only as
few yards from the Epker family.
   ``We didn't know them too much. We'd just see her out there in
the yard with the kids in the summertime. ... Something like this is
unbelievable,'' Durk said.
   ``Something had to snap,'' he said. ``You just can't imagine
anyone doing anything like that.''

   Wives of crewmen aboard the USS John F.
Kennedy said they are worried the carrier's homecoming early next
month might be delayed because the ship's planes shot down two
Libyan jets.
   ``Why did it have to happen now?'' Lesley Friedman, head of a
homecoming committee, wondered after Wednesday's encounter in the
Mediterranean.
   ``My first thought was, `Oh, no, does that mean they're going to
come home later than expected?''' said Connie Derrick, wife of an
aviation maintenance officer aboard the ship.
   ``Everybody's pretty anxious for word, anxious and concerned,''
said Paula Boot, wife of an electronic communications specialist.
``Everybody's banding together, waiting for the next step.''
   Mrs. Boot said she heard news reports about the attack when she
woke up Wednesday.
   ``The alarm clock went off and it was the first thing I heard. It
made me sit up straight in bed,'' she said. ``Not a great way to
start the day.''
   The Kennedy and 11 other ships left Norfolk on Aug. 2 for a
six-month deployment. Family members already have been making plans
to welcome the ships home early next month, although an exact date
will not be announced until about 10 days before arrival.
   On the Kennedy's last cruise to the Mediterranean in 1987, its
return to Norfolk was delayed about two weeks because of tensions in
the Middle East.
   ``I'm so afraid that that's going to happen again,'' said Mrs.
Friedman, whose husband is a weapons officer on the ship.
   After worrying the ship might be delayed, the wives said they got
scared for their husbands' safety in the Middle East.
   ``I don't trust those people. I don't trust the Iranians and the
Libyans. I put them all in one group,'' Mrs. Friedman said.
   ``I've just been praying about it,'' Mrs. Derrick said. ``I think
the men must feel good about what they're doing on the ship because
that's what they're trained to do. It's probably frightening for
them. On the other hand, it must make them feel good.''
   The Navy's newest carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, left Norfolk
last week to replace the Kennedy in the Mediterranean. The wives and
Navy spokesman said they had no indication the Kennedy's return
would be delayed.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said two F-14s from the Kennedy
shot down the Libyan jets because the American aircraft were
threatened while conducting routine operations in international
waters. No Americans were injured.
   The Navy has no plans to release the names of the fliers involved
in the attack, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, a Navy spokesman in
Washington.

<HEAD>60 Years to Clean Up Plants, DOE Says</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ,
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Department of Energy says it may take $91
billion to $200 billion over 60 years to clean up radioactive and
chemical contamination at 45 government civilian and military
nuclear plants.
   In a report to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the department said
Wednesday the work includes cleaning up soil, surface and ground
water, including removal, treatment and disposal of bulk wastes.
   Glenn, chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, said
the situation at 17 nuclear facilities is so serious it represents
``nothing less than an environmental time bomb.''
   ``It's up to the White House to ask for enough money to defuse
that bomb before it explodes,'' Glenn said. ``We've waited too long
already to start this job. We simply cannot afford to wait any
longer.''

<NOTE>World Bank Raises Interest Rate; First Time Since 1982</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank is raising interest rates for
more prosperous Third World countries to 7.65 percent annually, the
first such increase since the bank began lending at variable rates
in 1982.
   The rate will apply during the first six months of this year on
$37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries, Sheldon Rappaport,
a spokesman for the bank, said Wednesday.
   The rate was 7.59 percent for the second half of 1988. The
increase will cost borrowers an additional $11 million, Rappaport
estimated.
   The rate is based on the cost of the bank's own borrowings and
will be recalculated in mid-1989. The bank, the biggest single
source of aid to Third World to help raise their living standards,
gets most of its funds from borrowing on world markets.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds U.S. Government's Right To Prosecute Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors concede they are a long way from
bringing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to trial on drug charges
despite a federal judge's decision to uphold the prosecution of the
Panamanian leader.
   But they called his hold on power tenuous, and expressed hope he
could eventually be overthrown and extradited.
   ``He seized power by the sword, and there is no reason to believe
he might not lose power by the sword,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen. ``We'll try to get Noriega here.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Wednesday rejected a
defense challenge to the charges that accuse Noriega and 15 others
of allowing smugglers to use Panama as a weigh station for
U.S.-bound cocaine.
   Noriega allegedly accepted a $4.6 million bribe from Colombia's
Medellin Cartel to protect the drug traffickers, allow them to
process cocaine and launder their profits, according to the February
indictment. A separate federal grand jury indictment in Tampa
charged Noriega with three marijuana importation counts.
   Defense attorney Neal Sonnett argued that the United States has
recognized Noriega as de facto head of state in Panama, therefore
conferring immunity upon him.
   ``We have this material, this poison, being sent to us,'' the
judge said. ``To countenance sovereign immunity under these
particular circumstances would be a serious error.''
   Hoeveler took note of a U.S. State Department's affidavit saying
the government continues to recognize ousted President Eric Arturo
Delvalle, not Noriega, as legal ruler of Panama.
   The judge added that he himself had come to a similar conclusion
in a civil case disputing control of Panama's national airline
facilities here.
   Sonnett shrugged off the defeat, and indicated he may not even
have standing to appeal the decision.
   ``Motions to dismiss are rarely granted,'' Sonnett said. ``I
certainly recognize the difficult burden of proof we had.''
   The judge refused to rule on two other issues raised by Noriega's
defense. Sonnett had argued Noriega was being selectively prosecuted
to force him into concessions on control of the Panama Canal, which
is to be turned over to the Panamanian government at the end of the
century.
   Sonnett also argued that pretrial publicity would make it
impossible to find an objective jury.
   The judge said Wednesday that those issues would have to wait
until the case was ready to go to trial, which both sides
interpreted to mean when Noriega was extradited to the United States.
   Chief Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, who
presented the case to the grand jury and was making his final
appearance as a prosecutor before going into private practice, said
he was pleased by Hoeveler's ruling.
   ``Now we've got to see who will bring him back,'' Gregorie said.
   About 30 Panamanian exiles in the courtroom audience crowded
around Gregorie to shake his hand after the ruling and later,
outside the courthouse, cheered the announcement of Hoeveler's
decision.
   Following the indictment, the United States declared an economic
blockade of Panama and worked openly with the country's domestic
opposition to depose Noriega, but the effort failed. At one point,
over the objections of Miami prosecutors, the United States offered
to drop the indictment if Noriega would leave power.

<HEAD>Pregnant Woman Perches In Tree To Protest Utility Company Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman's decision to go out on a
limb _ literally _ has prompted utility company officials to
reconsider their program of cutting down and trimming neighborhood
trees.
   ``I don't normally do this kind of thing, but I just wanted to
try to get some attention about this,'' Susie Daugherty said
Wednesday as she sat in a tree near her yard, perched on a limb
already trimmed by the Public Service Co. of Oklahoma.
   ``I just wanted to slow this down. It seems like they were flying
through the neighborhood wiping out trees.''
   The trees, which are on city-owned land, were cut or trimmed only
after receiving permission from adjacent property owners, utility
spokesman Brian Miller said. Other residents, such as Ms. Daugherty,
were not consulted.
   The company decided shortly after noon Wednesday to discontinue
the trimming in Ms. Daugherty's neighborhood until they are able to
meet with residents to discuss the program, Miller said.
   The program targets diseased trees near power lines that likely
would fall in a storm, he said. Six trees already had been cut or
trimmed, he said.
   Ms. Daugherty, who is four months pregnant, said she climbed in
the tree because she noticed so many were being cut down. She ended
her protest about two hours later after hearing of the decision to
halt the trimming.
   ``It takes years and years and years for these trees to grow. If
we just go around chopping them down, what are we going to have?''
she said.

<HEAD>Arabs Denounce Downing of Libyan Jets; Europe ``Concerned''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The shock waves ran from Syria to Switzerland after U.S. Navy
planes shot down two Libyan jet fighters over the Mediterranean,
with only Israel's top leadership cheering the U.S. fliers' feat.
   U.S. allies in Europe for the most part reserved comment after
Wednesday's action, although some expressed ``great concern'' and
regret. Arab nations were unanimous in their denunciation.
   In Zurich, the dollar closed sharply higher in interbank trading
Wednesday. Today, it was up 1.28 yen in Tokyo.
   One dealer in Zurich, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said the rise was in reaction to the U.S.-Libyan
confrontation. He said the dollar always gains strength in times of
international tension.
   A White House spokesman said U.S. F-14s shot down the two
Soviet-built MiG-23s about 40 miles off Libya after the U.S.
warplanes were ``threatened while conducting routine operations.''
The Navy said the U.S. jets returned safely to the aircraft carrier
John F. Kennedy.
   Tensions have heightened between the Tripoli government and
Washington in recent weeks over claims by the Reagan administration
that Col. Moammar Gadhafi's government has built a chemical weapons
plant south of the capital in Rabta. The United States said,
however, that the incident over the Mediterranean had nothing to do
with that issue.
   The Kremlin withheld immediate comment on the incident, but
Soviet news media quickly reported the air action. The official news
agency Tass called it ``U.S. aggression against Libya.''
   In London, Michael Mates, of Britain's governing Conservative
Party and chairman of the parliamentary committee on defense, told
the British Broadcasting Corp.:
   ``If the Libyans have made an offensive gesture toward the United
States, I'm not surprised they've been shot down, because they're
not a friendly nation, they have committed many aggressive acts
against the United States.''
   Washington accuses Libya of sponsoring international terrorism.
   No official British comment was forthcoming and in Bonn, West
German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said in declining
to comment that the Bonn government was not officially informed of
the action.
   Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said, ``It is still
too early to know the exact circumstances of the incident.''
   President Francois Mitterrand of France has called an
international conference for Jan. 7-11 to discuss expanding a 1925
treaty banning chemical weapons use and Dumas said he hoped
Wednesday's episode would not dominate it. President Reagan said
last month his advisors were considering a military strike on the
Rabta plant, but The Washington Post today quoted senior
administration officials as saying he now opposes attacking the
plant because Washington's European allies are against the idea.
   The Italian government expressed ``deep concern'' about
Wednesday's incident.
   ``We believe that the situation in the Mediterranean area imposes
on everybody the obligation to be moderate and to renounce any act
of violence which may cause a further use of military strength,''
said a government spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity.
   In Spain, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juan Lena said: ``The
Spanish government considers with serious concern any kind of
measure that leads to an increase in tension in the Mediterranean.''
   About 3,000 leftist Greek demonstrators marched to the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, shouting anti-U.S. slogans, and a government
spokesman said Greece believes both sides ``at this moment should
cool it and avoid actions that would endanger peace in this
sensitive region.''
   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi demanded Washington
end acts of ``provocation near the Libyan coasts.''
   In Tunisia, which borders Libya, he said the attack amounted to
an ``extremely serious aggression'' dictated by a ``false perception
by the United States of its role in regulating international
problems.'' Klibi said any escalation would have ``negative
consequences'' on U.S.-Arab relations.
   In Syria, state-run television called it ``flagrant U.S.
aggression.''
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
told Cable News Network in an interview from Cairo, Egypt ``It will
affect negatively the Middle East peace process.'' He termed the
incident ``very serious.''
   The few kind words came mainly from Jerusalem.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said, ``We congratulate
the American Navy for shooting down two planes that were threatening
it.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said:
``Based on previous Libyan behavior, we have no reason to doubt the
official American explanation of this incident.''
   Benjamin Netanyahu, the deputy foreign minister, told Parliament
that Israel has evidence Libya is capable of producing chemical arms.

<HEAD>Oil-Soaked Seabirds Get Care At Dirty Bird Hospital</HEAD>

   Welcome to Dirty Bird Hospital. Like
television's St. Elsewhere, the accommodations aren't much, but the
care is great.
   Ocean Shores Convention Center, the seaside hall usually teeming
with conventioneers and banquets, has been redubbed Oil Spill
Command Center in the wake of one of the Pacific Northwest's worst
oil spills.
   The focal point is Dirty Bird Hospital. Thousands of oil-soaked
sea birds get tender loving care and rest in the wards of the
makeshift veterinary hospital complex staffed by hundreds of
volunteers.
   Alice Berkner, a Vancouver, Wash., bird expert who heads the
effort, is a gracious, if exhausted, host to visitors, including
Gov. Booth Gardner, who stopped by Wednesday.
   She said more volunteers are needed to augment the effort and to
relieve some of those now working. More than 1,000 have helped out.
   ``This is not some emotional commitment to help `the poor little
birdies,''' she said. ``It's more a matter of we made the mess and
let's clean it up and develop a technology for heading this off.''
   More than 3,200 birds are known to have died since a tug and a
barge collided Dec. 22 off Grays Harbor near here, causing a spill
estimated at up to 231,000 gallons. Gobs of heavy bunker oil have
dirtied more than 300 miles of coast from Oregon to British Columbia.
   An estimated 5,200 birds wound up at Dirty Bird Hospital, and
2,700 lived, according to Don Kane of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. Smaller cleanup operations were set up at Astoria, Ore.,
and Neah Bay.
   The barge's owners, Sause Bros. Ocean Towing of Coos Bay, Ore.,
has agreed to pay for the cleanup, including the $50,000 spent on
Dirty Bird Hospital and other command center operations. No estimate
has been made on the overall cost.
   Following Berkner's design, the massive convention hall has been
transformed into hospital wards and stations.
   A visitor's first stop is the pens where the newly received birds
are housed. Huddled, black with oily goo, the birds show little
spark of life as they sleep or stare blankly from bedsheets atop
crumpled newspapers.
   Volunteers tube-feed the birds, pass out raw fish four times a
day and try to help the birds regain their strength.
   From the pens, birds are carried to the washing room, where they
get three or four warm, soapy baths. One volunteer holds and the
other scrubs, sometimes using a toothbrush. Most of the oil comes
off with one good washing, but the additional baths are necessary to
take off the rest.
   Then comes a vigorous, long rinse, the process the birds seem to
resent most.
   ``It's all traumatic to these birds,'' said Berkner. Pointing to
one protesting murre, she shook her head and said, ``It probably
thinks it's about to be eaten, that it's under attack. It's all a
shock. Getting oiled was a shock.''
   After drying and recovering a bit, the seabirds are placed in a
flotation pond to check their buoyancy and wing action. If they
sink, they're washed and rinsed again.
   Some of the birds don't make it through the cleaning.
   ``You can't imagine what it feels like to be washing a precious
little bird and then having it die right in your hands,'' one woman
said.
   The survivors will be released far from their normal habitat so
they won't run the risk of being oiled again. Twenty-seven have been
released so far, according to Kane.
   ``That's the best part,'' said Berkner. She said her crews would
try to get the birds through the cleaning process as soon as
possible.
   ``These are wild animials. Certainly the longer they're here, the
harder it is on them,'' she said.

<HEAD>Natural Mother Taking Child Home After Adoptive Parents Slain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young mother given a second chance to
raise her child after the baby's adoptive parents were shot to death
a few feet from his crib says she's now ready for motherhood because
``I've grown up a lot.''
   ``I've been feeding him, changing him, clothing him and bathing
him,'' Tracy Medeiros said Wednesday, a day after she successfully
convinced a Marin County court she was ready for such responsibility
and was awarded custody of the toddler.
   ``I've never been a mom before. I'm getting used to it. He's real
happy,'' she said as she prepared to fly home to Massachusetts today.
   Medeiros gave Travis up for adoption nine months ago in hopes his
new parents would provide the security and comforts she feared she
couldn't after her boyfriend left her. At 17, she felt it was the
right thing to do.
   But that decision was turned upside down last month, when Travis'
adoptive parents, William and Tasia Stephens, were shot to death a
few feet from the baby's crib at their home in Novato, about 25
miles north of San Francisco.
   The Stephenses' housekeeper and her boyfriend were arraigned
Wednesday on charges of murder and pleaded innocent. Yolanda Segura
and Zohelin Diaz, both 25-year-old illegal aliens from Guatemala,
face a possible death sentence if convicted. A preliminary hearing
was set for April 5.
   Novato police believe the shooting occurred after Segura told her
boyfriend she had been sexually assaulted at the home of the slain
couple, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today.
   Segura, however, may have been fired by the couple and
investigators think she may have told Diaz the story to cover up the
loss of the job, the newspaper reported without citing sources.
   On Tuesday, Superior Court Juvenile Commissioner Sylvia Shapiro
ruled that the adoption, arranged before Travis' birth, had not been
legally finalized, thereby paving the way for Medeiros to return
with the baby to her mother's home in Billerica, Mass.
   ``Now I know I'm ready. I've grown up a lot,'' Medeiros, 18, said
afterward.
   Shapiro required Medeiros to take parenting classes and make
monthly reports to the court about the child's welfare. The reports
will be shared with relatives of the slain couple, who also applied
for custody of the child, and the case will be reviewed in six
months.
   But Medeiros isn't worried about that now.
   ``I just care about my son,'' she said. ``Nothing else bothers
me. I'm going to do what's best for him.''

<HEAD>News Program Promotes Story of 17 Survivors, Doesn't Show It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet news program promised viewers a story
about 17 Armenian earthquake victims who survived nearly a month
under a crumbled grain elevator, then mysteriously failed to
broadcast the report.
   The story was promoted at the opening of Wednesday's ``Vremya''
news show.
   ``Seventeen people survived almost a month under the ruins of an
elevator. We expect a report about this,'' announcer Anna Shatilova
said at the beginning of the nightly news program, which is watched
by tens of millions of viewers.
   The story _ apparently the same one denied a day earlier by
Soviet officials _ never materialized.
   But in a report about the visit of Leningrad Communist Party
leader Yuri Solovyev to the earthquake-devastated city of Leninakan,
``Vremya'' showed a brief picture of rescue worker Sasha Ivanov from
Leningrad.
   ``Today, Leningrad resident Sasha Ivanov, who saved the lives of
17 people, as hundreds of his comrades from all corners of the
Soviet Union, was raising a new Leninakan,'' the report said.
   It showed Ivanov only briefly in a report of several minutes and
said nothing about when or how he saved the people.
   Hundreds of people were pulled alive from the wreckage of
Leninakan and other cities following the Dec. 7 quake concentrated
in the southern republic of Armenia that killed tens of thousands of
people.
   On Dec. 23, the republic's deputy prime minister said authorities
were calling off the search for survivors and efforts would now
focus on rebuilding. Over the objections of residents who opposed
abandoning the search, bulldozers began clearing the rubble.
   On Monday, French and British media reported that 17 people had
been found in the remains of a bread factory near Spitak, a village
in northwestern Armenia leveled by the quake.
   In Paris, Europe 1 radio quoted a nurse for the French
humanitarian group Doctors of the World as saying the 17 survivors
were found Dec. 28. The nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
was quoted as saying they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking
melted snow.
   The official Tass news agency on Tuesday denied the report,
saying the last survivor had been rescued Dec. 22.
   ``The Western press reports ... have no foundation,'' Tass quoted
Norik Muradyan, chief of rescue operations in the town, as saying in
a telephone interview.
   ``Vremya'' editors could not explain why the teaser at the
opening of the program was not followed through with a story.
   ``You saw everything on the screen that we received from
Yerevan,'' said the duty editor in charge of the program.
   The editor, who spoke by telephone with The Associated Press on
condition he not be identified, said Ms. Shatilova's announcement at
the beginning of the program could have referred to the report about
Ivanov, or that film crews in Yerevan perhaps had not had enough
time to put together a report.
   Editors at Tass in Moscow and at the official Armenpress news
agency in Armenia said they had no information to verify that 17
people were rescued from a collapsed elevator.
   Telephones at government offices and the Red Cross in Yerevan did
not answer on Wednesday night.

<HEAD>Castro Speech Criticizing U.S. Prompts Diplomat's Walkout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. diplomat in Cuba walked out in
protest over President Fidel Castro's criticism of the Reagan
administration during a three-hour speech honoring the 30th
anniversary of the Cuban revolution.
   In his Wednesday night speech, Castro assailed U.S. threats
against Libya for its alleged chemical weapons plant but, curiously,
omitted any reference to the U.S. downing of two Libyan jet fighters
earlier in the day over the Mediterranean.
   Castro did say, however, that the United States has the ``most
powerful'' chemical weapons arsenal in the world, then asked, ``Why
should it deny it to other countries?'' Cuba is believed not to
possess chemical weapons.
   It was shortly after Castro alluded to this that Jay Taylor, who
has headed the small U.S. mission in Havana for slightly over a
year, rose from his seat in the diplomatic section and strided out.
   There was no immediate comment from Taylor.
   Meanwhile, after months of uncertainty about Soviet-Cuban
relations, Castro offered strong praise for Moscow while bitterly
criticizing U.S. policies toward the Third World.
   Tens of thousands of spectators were present as Castro inagurated
a permanent fair designed to highlight achievements in Cuba's social
and economic development over the past three decades.
   The public was to have access to the pavillions at the fair
starting today.
   In several speeches in recent months, Castro has made clear his
unhappiness with the liberal reform policies of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He has indicated his defiance of Gorbachev by affirming Cuba will
never adopt any policy that ``reeks of capitalism.'' On Sunday,
Castro said Cuba will be guided by a policy of ``socialism or death,
Marxism-Leninism or death.''
   Although there was never any doubt the Soviet-Cuban axis would
continue, Castro's emphasis seemed to undergo a revival.
   ``We will never forget the support received (from the Soviet
Union) in decisive moments,'' Castro said. At another point, he
said, ``We support the policies of peace of the Soviet Union.''
   He also said Moscow and Havana see eye-to-eye on the
international debt issue plaguing many Third World countries. He
said that while the United States subjects its trading partners to
unequal terms of trade, the Soviet Union has treated Cuba fairly on
that same issue.
   This was a reference to the Soviet purchase of Cuban sugar at
prices above those of the world market and Soviet concessions in the
sale of oil to Cuba.
   Among those attending the speech were President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua and Namibian rebel leader Sam Nujoma.
   Castro expressed deep concern over a proposal, apparently
strongly supported by the United States, for a reduction in the U.N.
peacekeeping force that will oversee the pending transition of
Namibia to independence from South African colonial rule.
   According to Nujoma, the proposal entails a reduction from 7,500
to 3,000 in the U.N. troop presence.
   Castro said a reduction of that magnitude would play into South
African hands and jeopardize the possibility of genuine independence
for Namibia.
   He suggested a reduced U.N. force would not be able to adequately
verify the planned withdrawal of South African troops.
   South Africa agreed to allow Namibia's independence as part of a
deal that also calls for the withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops
from Angola.
   Castro said the first Cuban troops will begin leaving Angola next
Tuesday.
   Under a U.S.-brokered treaty signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, Havana must pull out its first 3,000 troops by April
1, half of them by Nov. 1 and the rest within 30 months.

   Contra rebels attacked a Sandinista
army post, killing two brothers and injuring another soldier and a
government official, military sources said.
   Army sources said late Wednesday that about 30 Contra rebels
attacked an 18-man military command in Muan, a town 136 miles east
of the capital.
   The attack Tuesday night was led by rebel commanders known as
``Pipilacha'' and ``Capulina'', the sources said.
   They said the rebel leaders, who entered Nicaragua from Costa
Rica last December with about 200 men, have established themselves
in the country's southeastern region.
   The government and U.S.-supported rebels reached a cease-fire
agreement March 23, but talks on a permanent truce to the 8-year
civil war broke down in September. Each side accuses the other of
frequent cease-fire violations.
   Killed in the attack were soldiers Miguel and Ismael Maltez
Hernandez, whom town residents said were recent draftees.
   The injured were identified as Lt. Roger Miranda Martinez and
Julio Aguilar, a delegate of the governing Sandinista National
Liberation Front.
   No rebel injuries or deaths were reported.
   The Defense Ministry late Tuesday reported that three farmworkers
were killed and another three injured in a similar rebel attack Jan.
2 in La Maranosa, 8 miles south of Wiwili near the Honduran border.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada recently reported that
rebel forces were planning ``sensational attacks'' in hopes of
convincing President-elect Bush to renew military support for the
rebels, which expired last year.

<HEAD>Ambassador Of Laughter Celebrates 30th Year On TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUINN LOTA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wowee, kazowee boys and girls! Bozo the Clown
is 30 today!
   The Ambassador of Laughter, whose infectious guffaws can
transform even the sourest of grouches into the grinningest of
fools, celebrates his 30th year on TV as the longest-running live,
daily children's television show. He was being toasted this
afternoon in an anniversary bash.
   ``Everybody still loves me and still cares about me,'' said the
original Bozo, Larry Harmon, who celebrated his 64th birthday
Monday. ``When you do something good for the world, you do something
good for yourself and it all turns out wowee, oh wow, wow _ so
good!''
   The mirthmaker is truly an international star. He's ``Bozo Le
Clown'' in France, ``Bozo El Payaso,'' in Brazil and His Bozoness to
Americans.
   The live TV shows began Jan. 5, 1959. They've been seen
practically every day since.
   The show is televised to an estimated 28 million homes in 183
cities nationwide where kids can see Bozo or a locally franchised
``clone clown'' as Harmon likes to call them.
   As long as you have the big, red nose, the bright orange hair,
gigantic shoes, appropriate clown suit, ``are an exhibitionist, an
extrovert, sensitive, warm and you've got the laugh and the Bozoisms
down pat, then you're a Bozo,'' Harmon explained.
   Harmon came up with the idea of coast-to-coast Bozos each to be
host of a live, local production.
   The show has produced some 50,000 episodes. Bozo has appeared in
more than 10,000 parades. So far, 200 people have portrayed the
snickering clown, including Willard Scott, the weather man for NBC's
``The Today Show,'' who made his Bozo debut in August 1959.
   ``You know,'' Harmon said, ``Willard called me to congratulate me
on my birthday and he said, `Look at me. I'm Bozo, the warmth, the
attitude, the smile, the projection. All these wonderful things came
30 years ago.'''
   Muppet maker Jim Henson got some air time on Bozo shows, Big Bird
on the educational children's show ``Sesame Street'' is portrayed by
``Bozo Show'' veteran Carroll Spinney, and one-time TV network
president Fred Silverman was once a floor manager for a ``Bozo
Show'' in Chicago.
   Just last year, 500 auditioned at ``Bozo University'' in
Hollywood, where the four-week crash course includes classes on
makeup, tricycle riding, and lots of smile practice. The finalists
were whittled down to 100.
   ``I'm looking for that sparkle in the eyes, that emotion,
feeling, directness, warmth,'' Harmon said. ``That is so important.''
   Although the trend seems to be in maligning the clown, such as
the ``No Bozos Allowed'' bumper stickers and the derogatory use of
the word Bozo as an adjective for dumb or stupid, Harmon believes
there is a place in every person's heart for a Bozo.
   ``Bozo transcends time,'' he said in a telephone interview
Wednesday night. Bozo hasn't changed much over the years, other than
the new clown suit, complete with rhinestones.
   ``The formula is imbedded within me and all my clone clowns,'' he
said. ``What's most important is my theme and the theme of everyone
of my Bozos: ``PULL for Peace, Understanding, Love, Laughter. That
would pull all the people of the world together, wouldn't it?''
   Harmon said he feels gratitude for the love expressed by fans
across the globe. Local fans who congratulated Bozo on his 30th
anniversary with cards and letters include Gene Autry and Betty
White who exclaimed ``You've been in television almost as long as I
have. How come you never change? Keep us smiling for years to come.''
   Comedian Red Buttons wrote, ``You've earned a seat in heaven.
Happy 30 _ 30 more!''
   Harmon believes that the Bozo legacy will endure.
   ``In the year 5000, while Bozo is in his space clown suit he'll
start his show by saying, `I remember way back when in the year 19,
or whatever it was,''' Harmon said. ``There is a special something
in everyone that can associate with Bozo. Everyone can identify and
relate.''

<HEAD>Evidence Spotted for One Supernova Inside Another's Remains, Researchers
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A star may have died its explosive death inside
the remnants of an earlier supernova about 40 centuries ago, a
cosmically rare event, scientists reported today.
   An unusual collection of intertwined filament-like structures
near the center of the older supernova's expanding shell may be
remnants of the second explosion, they said.
   ``This is speculative interpretation of the data,'' cautioned
P.F. Winkler of Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vt.
   ``I'm not persuaded by it,'' said Robert Fesen of the University
of Colorado in Boulder, who was familiar with the study.
   Fesen said it is highly unlikely that two neighboring stars would
explode at what astronomers consider virtually the same time. Nobody
has reported such a double supernova elsewhere, he said.
   The study of the remains from the Puppis A supernova was reported
in today's issue of the British journal Nature. Winkler's co-authors
were scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.
   A similar hypothesis about Puppis A had been raised before, they
wrote.
   The new analysis showed that the filaments were made of different
elements, including oxygen and sulfur that could be ejected by an
exploding star. The appearance of the filaments was consistent with
their being a supernova remnant, and their speed approached that
seen in material ejected from a supernova, Winkler said.
   Although other supernova remnants give off X-rays and radio
waves, none was observed from the filaments. Winkler said that
suggests the filaments could be within the shell of the older
supernova, where the high-pressure, low-density environment would
prevent the emissions.
   Perhaps the double supernova resulted from explosions of two
similar stars that were orbiting each other, he said.
   Fesen said he believes the filaments came from the original
supernova explosion, and that they are a ``curious feature'' that
should be explained in some way.

<HEAD>NASA Sets Feb. 23 Launch For Space Shuttle Discovery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The launch of space shuttle Discovery
and a five-man crew has been rescheduled for Feb. 23, five days
later than planned.
   The schedule change does not reflect any technical problem, only
that extra time is needed to prepare Discovery for flight, Lisa
Malone, a NASA spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
   However, she said that before a launching can occur engineers
must resolve tile and cracked bearing problems that developed during
the December flight of the shuttle Atlantis. Officials have said
they are confident the problems will be resolved in time to meet the
February launch date.
   Atlantis suffered severe damage to nearly 200 of the 28,000
thermal tiles that protect it from atmospheric re-entry heat. And
when engineers inspected the craft's main engines, they found a tiny
crack in a bearing in a liquid hydrogen pump.
   Officials believe the tile damage was caused when insulation
peeled away from the shuttle's external fuel tank and solid fuel
booster rockets during liftoff. They think the bearing damage may be
traced to a flaw in the metal curing process.
   The space agency said the current plan is to move Discovery into
an assembly building on Jan. 19 to be hooked to its fuel tank and
booster rockets, with rollout to the launch pad set for Jan. 26.
   Agency managers will meet here Feb. 8 and 9 to assess the
readiness of the shuttle for flight. Liftoff on Feb. 23 is set for
8:30 a.m. EST.
   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats will command Discovery on the
five-day mission, during which the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite and conduct scientific and technology
experiments. The other crew members are Air Force Col. John E.
Blaha, Marine Cols. Robert C. Springer and James F. Buchli and James
P. Bagian, a doctor.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was
embarking today on a mission to persuade more than 100 nations to
impose sanctions on countries that use poison gas.
   He also planned to urge foreign ministers and ambassadors
assembling for a five-day conference in Paris to strengthen the hand
of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in investigating
allegations of chemical warfare.
   The skirmish Wednesday over the Mediterranean in which U.S. Navy
jet fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23 planes acted as a backdrop
for the conference, which opens Saturday.
   William Burns, director of the U.S. arms control agency,
acknowledged that decisions at the meeting will be by consensus.
This means any nation, including Libya, can block proposals.
   ``I don't know how successful we will be, and I don't know how
much of a resonant chord this will strike in the hearts of other
participants,'' Burns told reporters Wednesday at the State
Department.
   Still, Burns said, Shultz will push for sanctions under the
United Nations charter and for additional powers for the U.N.
Secretary-General.
   The Paris conference was proposed by President Reagan in
September to draw international attention to the spreading use of
chemical weapons. The focus then was on Iraq, which was accused of _
and denied _ devastating Iranian troops and civilians with poison
gas.
   For the last two months, however, the United States has put
special stress on Libya and a plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli, the
State Department claims has recently begun limited production of
chemical weapons.
   Even before U.S. jets shot down the Libyan fighter planes near
Crete on Wednesday, the Reagan administration had served
not-so-subtle notice to the world that it considers Moammar
Gadhafi's drive to produce poison gas _ an allegation the Libyan
leader has consistently denied _ a serious threat to world stability.
   Shultz, in an interview on the eve of his departure, told The
Washington Post the administration was raising ``a big stew'' over
the plant because of Libya's ``known connections to terrorist
groups.''
   After the clash, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other
senior U.S. officials sought to separate the incident from the
drumbeat of alarm the Reagan administration has sounded over the
suspected chemical weapons facility.
   The Libyan plant controversy is bound to have an impact on the
conference. And yet, Burns said ``it is not aimed at bashing a
particular country.''
   Referring to the air clash, Burns added: ``I don't see it as
really germane to the conference. I think that other nations will
not see it as germane as well.''
   Carlucci, at a news conference at the Pentagon, said the Libyan
jets had approached the U.S. F-14 Tomcats at high speed and in ``a
hostile manner'' in international airspace.
   He said the Navy planes acted solely in self-defense. Based on
preliminary reports, the MiGs activated their radar before the
Tomcats opened fire with air-to-air missiles, Carlucci said.
   Congressional leaders said the United States had acted
appropriately, but expressed concern that the incident might portend
further hostilities with Libya.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said ``Congress should
be informed ... if the United States is engaged in a piecemeal
escalation of our conflict with Libya beyond these legitimate acts
of self-defense.''
   Libya, meanwhile, condemned the U.S. firing as a premeditated
attack, and Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declared his North African
nation would ``meet challenge with challenge.''
   ``If America has prevailed because it is a superpower in the air
and the sea, it will inevitably be defeated in Libya,'' Gadhafi
said. ``We, as well as the fish, are awaiting them.''
   European officials reacted cautiously to the incident, while
Israel applauded the U.S. action and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberiation Organization, and the Arab world sharply
criticized the United States.
   The downing of the two Libyan jets kept attention fastened on the
suspected Libyan chemical plant as delegates to the Paris conference
began assembling.
   Shultz, who will be in Paris through Sunday, will urge
industrialized countries to deny technology to other nations bent on
developing chemical weapons. Charles E. Redman, the State Department
spokesman, said the key to the Libyan situation was to deprive
Gadhafi of the equipment, material and expertise to produce poison
gas.
   ``If these kind of things are going to be cut off it's going to
be very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate,'' he said.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol under review in Paris bans the use of
chemical weapons, but does not outlaw their production. Some 20
nations, by U.S. estimate, either have produced chemical weapons or
are capable of manufacturing them.
   The protocol has no enforcement mechanism. Its effectiveness
depends on the self-discipline of the 130 nations that are parties
to the pact.
   To try to stem proliferation, Redman said ``we are prepared to
discuss the strongest possible measures'' against countries that
export sophisticated technology.
   The West European governments have responded with some skepticism
to the U.S. allegations, however. West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Wednesday his government had no evidence
proving West German pharmaceutical firm had helped build the plant
at Rabta. A spokesman for Genscher said, meanwhile, Bonn had accused
Washington for ``additional material'' to back up the allegation.
   But the Reagan administration has not pulled back.
   Robert M. Gates, a former CIA deputy director who was named last
week as deputy director of the National Security Council, said in a
recent speech that the plant was built with the help of ``nearly a
dozen nations, East and West.'' He declined to name them.
   The United States stopped production of chemical weapons in 1969,
then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the Soviet Union and
other potential adversaries had chemical weapons stocks. Currently,
U.S. chemical components and artillery shells to contain them are
being produced but stockpiled separately.
   The Soviet Union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical
weapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministry
spokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed.
   Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in Geneva
to plan ways to restrict proliferation.

<HEAD>Government May Reduce Annual U.S.-South Korean Military Exercises</HEAD>

   The government will scale down annual
U.S.-South Korean military exercises and may end them in 1990 to
help reduce tension with communist North Korea, news reports said
today.
   Yonhap, the semi-official national news agency, and leading
newspapers all carried reports that the government was considering
the future of the ``Team Spirit'' exercises to help promote dialogue
with its northern foe.
   An unidentified government official was quoted by Yonhap as
saying a reduction in the exercise this year would be ``symbolic,''
with troop numbers cut by 10,000 troops.
   The official was quoted as saying that Seoul plans to take up the
question of ending the annual exercices in 1990 in security talks
with the United States later this year. But a Defense Ministry
spokesman, who declined to be named in keeping with official
practice, said the reports ``were not true.''
   He declined to comment further.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Seoul said, ``We are aware of the
press reports but have no information to release at this time.''
   Team Spirit usually involves up to 200,000 troops, including
reinforcements from the United States. One of the exercise's
functions is to practice bringing in reinforcements from the United
States in the event of a North Korean attack.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops based in the south
under a mutual defense pact to help prevent a North Korean attack.
   North Korea repeatedly has charged the exercises are preparation
for war and an obstacle to improving relations between the two
Koreas.
   In a New Year's speech, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung said the
south should show its desire to ease tension by ending the exercises.
   Ho Dam, member of North Korea's political bureau and head of its
reunification committee, urged the south to accept Kim's request to
end the military exercises, the Korean Central News Agency said in a
report monitored in Tokyo today.
   The two Koreas, split in 1945, have often accused each other of
heightening tension and blocking reunification of the divided Korean
peninsula. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the bloody
three-year Korean War.

<HEAD>First Crane Killing Reported in 21 Years, Authorities Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTWELL, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female whooping crane flying through
heavy fog with her mate was shot by a hunter, the first reported
killing of the endangered bird in 21 years, authorities said.
   The crane was killed near the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge
where it makes its winter home, the first such incident anywhere
since 1968, when another hunter was fined for shooting a crane
nearby under nearly identical weather conditions, refuge manager
Brent Giezentanner said Wednesday.
   The investigation will determine whether the hunter, whose name
was not released, shot the crane intentionally or by accident,
Giezentanner said.
   He said the out-of-town hunter and a companion were hunting for
geese and ducks Tuesday in Spalding Cove, state-owned marshland
south of the wildlife refuge, which lies about 45 miles northeast of
Corpus Christ along the Texas coast.
   Giezentanner said the shooting may have been accidental, but
added that ``there's still a lot of difference in a 2-foot goose and
a 5-foot crane.''
   ``A prudent hunter should have known the difference,'' he said.
   The 4-year-old female crane was shot as it flew with its mate
through heavy fog above the cove, Giezentanner said, adding that the
crane had brought her first chick with her on the southerly
migration from the Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Canada.
   The shooting of cranes is not always detected because the
endangered whoopers are not monitored constantly during their annual
migration north or south, he added.
   Wildlife refuge officials learned of the shooting after the
hunter surrendered, as occurred in the earlier incident.
   The hunter involved in the 1968 shooting was fined $500, the
maximum penalty then for killing an endangered species under the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   Under the current Endangered Species Act of 1969, a person
charged with intentionally killing a member of an endangered species
faces a one-year sentence and-or a $20,000 fine. An accidental
killing carries a maximum six-month sentence and-or $10,000 fine.
   Authorities said that apart from the 136 adult cranes and chicks
that made the migration to the Aransas refuge this year, only 25
others are known to exist in New Mexico, and 40 are kept in
captivity at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent,
Md.
   The whooping crane population has steadily increased since the
late 1930s, when fewer than 20 existed.

   An Amish man who pleaded guilty to a sex
charge voluntarily entered the county jail without being sentenced
to have a better chance at being free for the spring planting, a
public defender said.
   Andy A. Slabaugh, 50, of Canton, chose to go to jail Wednesday
after pleading guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct,
rather than wait until after a Feb. 6 sentencing, said the public
defender, Thomas Manion.
   Slabaugh was accused of fondling a woman in his buggy and
threatening to kill her if she told anyone.
   Manion said Slabaugh probably will remain in jail until he is
sentenced by District Court Judge Clement H. Snyder.
   While state sentencing guidelines allow for wide discretion in
sentencing for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, Manion said it
is likely Slabaugh will face some jail time because he has been
convicted of another felony.
   Last year, Slabaugh pleaded guilty to bribing a public official
in a tax incident. Later, citing Amish religious opposition to being
photographed, he refused to let jailers take his picture for
booking. The case is under appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of President Augusto
Pinochet has asked the Supreme Court to appoint a special judge to
investigate a secretive German colony accused of human rights abuses.
   Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, in an unusual request,
personally asked Justice Jose Maria Eyzaguirre on Wednesday to
investigate Colonia Dignidad, a sprawling farm 210 miles south of
Santiago.
   Government sources said Errazuriz made his request after
receiving an appeal from his West German colleague, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
   The sources said Genscher last week requested the Chilean
government's ``cooperation'' after lower Chilean courts turned down
two similar requests filed by private Chilean lawyers.
   The colony, near Parral, was established in the early 1960s by a
group of West Germany Free Baptists led by Paul Schaffer, a World
War II air bomber.
   It has about 300 residents, most of them Germans, and has
developed into a self-sufficient community with modern agricultural
projects, its own hospital and a school that also serves Chilean
peasants in the area.
   Previous investigations by lower courts produced no results to
charges the colony physically and psychologically abused its
residents, and the situation has often strained relations between
Chile and West Germany.
   The colony has been accused by human rights organizations of
abusing its members and keeping many of them against their will.
Several former colony members who fled the enclave have alleged they
were abused.
   Organizations such as Amnesty International also claimed the
colony served as a torture and execution center for the Chilean
security services after the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power.
   Colony spokesmen deny the charges, saying they are part of a
smear campaign.
   About a decade ago, colony leaders filed a slander suit in
Frankfurt, West Germany, against the magazine Stern and the West
German chapter of Amnesty International for charging the colony
engaged in torture and executions.
   Last August, Parral Judge Lidia Villagran inspected the colony
and questioned some of its leaders and members at the request of the
German court handling the suit against Stern and Amnesty
International. Under questioning, Schaffer denied charges of rights
abuses.
   The colony is off-limits to visitors. When reporters attempted to
cover Judge Villagran's inspection, farmers in the area blocked the
road to the enclave. The group, calling themselves ``Friends of
Colonia Dignidad,'' photographed the reporters and argued with them.
   Among officials of the Pinochet government known to have visited
the enclave are Defense Minister Adm. Patricio Carvajal and Gen.
Rodolfo Stange, a member of the four-man military junta and head of
the national police.
   It was not immmediately known when the Supreme Court would act on
the government's request.

   Animal control officer Kim Johnsen has
apprehended this city's first feline felon, but she says publicity
about the Chicago suburb's cat leash law makes her out to be just
what she isn't _ a cat hater.
   Weeks of news reports, interviews and telephone calls _ many of
them hostile _ preceded the first cat-nabbing, which Ms. Johnsen
describes as a pretty routine affair.
   ``The cat was sitting in the street and I almost ran it over,''
Ms. Johnsen said late Wednesday. ``I got out and called to it, and
it came over to me, but then it ran off ... the second time I
called, it came over again, and I just picked it up and put it in a
cage.''
   The arrest last Friday had a happy ending, Ms. Johnsen said.
   ``It was a very clean, pretty, cat _ an orange tabby, 1 to 2
years old and declawed,'' she said. ``It had its shot tag and an
identification tag on its collar, so I got in touch with the owner
right away.''
   ``He was informed that he had the dubious honor of being the
first one caught under the new law. When he stopped laughing, he
came over and picked up his cat,'' she said.
   The owner, who asked not to be identified, paid a $10 fine, a $15
pound fee and an $8 cat license fee, Ms. Johnsen said. Under the new
law, he could have been fined $200 if there had been public
complaints about his cat.
   Publicity was spreading about the Naperville cat control
ordinance even before it took effect Dec. 2.
   ``I understand stories about the cat law appeared in about 65
countries and in every part of the United States,'' Ms. Johnsen
said. ``I was even on a radio talk show from Arizona for about 45
minutes last month. I took a lot of flak and a lot of telephone
calls.''
   Naperville cats must now be inoculated and wear identifying
collars. If they go outdoors and set foot on any street, alley or
other public place, they must be on leash.
   ``Some people have been calling me the queen of the cat-haters,
but that's not at all true,'' said Ms. Johnsen. ``I've got three
cats of my own at home _ all neutered and declawed _ and they don't
go outside. It's too dangerous for a cat out there.''

<TEXT>
   Coping with an economy devastated by
eight years of war, the leftist Sandinista government has sharply
devalued its currency, doubled fuel prices and increased bus fares
200 fold.
   Wednesday's austerity measures were the second instituted since
Saturday, when President Daniel Ortega announced steep cuts in
defense and public works spending.
   The new measures were published Wednesday in the ruling
Sandinista Party's newspaper, Barricada. They included a devaluation
of the cordoba from 920 to 2,000 to the dollar on the official
market, which is used for such essential imports as oil.
   A parallel exchange rate, at which most transactions such as
paying hotel bills are billed, remained 4,500 to the dollar. On the
black market, the dollar fetches about 5,500 cordobas.
   Urban bus fares, mostly used by the working class, soared from
half a cordoba to 100 cordobas, or one 9,000th of a U.S. cent to a
little over 2 cents. The government heavily subsidizes bus fares.
   In addition, gasoline prices jumped 120 percent, from 1,900
cordobas to 4,200 cordobas a gallon, or from about 42 cents to about
95 cents a gallon. Gasoline is rationed, and motorists now receive
17 gallons a month.
   Inflation last year topped 20,000 percent, according to official
figures.
   Ortega on Saturday announced he was cutting the defense budget by
29 percent, including a 40 percent cut for police and other security
forces. He said government spending on public works projects and
other essential investments are being reduced this year by 56
percent.
   The government and U.S.-supported Contra rebels reached a
cease-fire agreement March 23, but talks on a permanent truce broke
down in September. The United States cut off military aid to the
Contras early last year.
   A U.S. trade embargo imposed in 1985 has cost Nicaragua $315
million in income and another $422 million in credits refused the
Sandinistas because of U.S. loan vetoes at world lending
institutions, Ortega claims.
   Nicaragua runs a big deficit with its major trading partners in
the Soviet bloc. Imports last year totaled $800 million, while
exports earned only $200 million.

   Prosecutors dropped an illegal arms case against
a retired Israeli army general and 10 other people after the
defendants argued the United States wouldn't have frowned on $2
billion in U.S. weapons sales to Iran.
   An investigation by the U.S. attorney's office found no evidence
linking the arms transactions charged in the indictment with the
so-called Iran-Contra affair, court papers said.
   However, the defendants argued they had reason to believe their
activities had or would receive U.S. government approval, a
contention that gained credence after the Iran-Contra arms scandal
came to light.
   The defendants said they believed their plan to sell fighter
planes, missiles, tanks and spare parts to Iran was officially
sanctioned by the U.S. government, according to papers filed in U.S.
District Court.
   Prosecutors could not produce witnesses to contradict the
defendants' claim so the conspiracy case was dropped Wednesday.
   Gen. Avraham Bar-Am, who left the Israeli army in 1984 and later
served as an arms consultant for Israel, and Samuel Evans, an
American lawyer based in London, were among the 11 people and four
corporations named in the papers. They were indicted between May and
October 1986.
   Evans also was the lawyer for Adnan Khashoggi, a multibillionaire
Saudi arms dealer who was said to have been involved in some of the
Iran-Contra weapons deals.
   The U.S. Customs Service had set up an elaborate ``sting'' using
a fraudulent bank account in late 1985, about the time Reagan
administration officials were secretly selling arms to Iran and
using the proceeds to finance the Contras fighting to overthrow the
leftist Nicaraguan government.
   The defendants charged that Cyrus Hashemi, an Iranian oilman
identified as the U.S. government's chief operative in the sting,
was at the same time involved in shipping covert arms to Iran for
the administration.
   Prosecutors said that Hashemi would have contradicted the
defendants' claim that they had the government's blessing. However,
Hashemi died in 1986, and the government could not ``procure the
attendance at trial of any (other) such witness,'' court papers said.
   In September and October 1986, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's
office was told by the Department of Defense and the Central
Intelligence Agency that there were no documents to support
allegations that the United States sanctioned the delivery of arms
to Iran by the defendants.
   But it was publicly revealed in November 1986 that members of the
National Security Council had secretly engaged in the sale of arms
to Iran.

   A man who told school children at a
bus stop he would ``get them next'' resembled the kidnapper of
Michaela Garecht, who was abducted in November from a supermarket
parking lot, according to authorities.
   Four elementary school children were at the stop on Wednesday
when the man drove by and warned them through a loudspeaker,
Sheriff's Deputy Gordon Altman said.
   The man did not attempt to grab any of the children.
   ``We're taking it seriously because his description is similar to
the general description of the suspect in the Michaela Garecht
kidnapping case,'' Altman said. ``The kids are about her age, too.''
   Michaela, 9, of Hayward, was abducted Nov. 19 by a man with long
blond hair and acne. The Hayward girl was with a friend when she was
grabbed. The other girl got away.
   Hundreds of volunteers spent hours stuffing envelopes and placing
posters around the San Francisco Bay area to try to find clues. Even
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana went on TV with his wife
and pleaded for girl's return. No demands were made to Michaela's
parents.
   Altman would not describe the vehicle involved in Wednesday's
incident or be specific about the man's description, saying the
information might damage the investigation.
   ``When you're looking for a needle in the haystack, you can't
overlook anything,'' Altman said. ``Anything could be the clue that
leads us to the guy.''

<HEAD>Defense Lawyer Says Steinberg Judge `Tied Both My Hands'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg's lawyer says a judge's rulings
have tied his hands and made an acquittal in the infamous murder
trial nearly impossible.
   The lawyer, Ira London, said Wednesday the best he can hope for
is a conviction of criminally negligent homicide. Steinberg is
charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of his
illegally adopted daughter, Lisa.
   The defense was scheduled to resume its case today by calling
teachers from the school where Lisa was a first-grader. They were
expected to testify that the 6-year-old child appeared healthy,
happy and well cared for.
   London said two rulings by Judge Harold Rothwax were major
setbacks: allowing the jury to see a videotape of Steinberg's
battered live-in companion Hedda Nussbaum, and approving a request
to have Steinberg examined by a prosecution psychiatrist.
   ``My view of the case is that the judge has tied both my hands
behind my back,'' London said. ``He tied one hand when he let in the
Hedda beatings; he tied the other when he took away Joel's Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent.''
   Rothwax had no comment on London's remarks.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified for seven days as a prosecution
witness. She had been charged with murder in Lisa's death along with
Steinberg but the charges were dropped.
   Criminally negligent homicide carries a penalty of up to four
years in prison. London said Steinberg ``won't like'' his prediction.
   ``He wants an acquittal but I don't think that's realistic,''
London said. ``He'll probably do jail time.''
   Arnold Kleinick, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers'
Association, called London's comments during a trial ``unusual. I
never heard a lawyer say such a thing.''
   Stephen Villers, a law professor at New York University, said he
also had never heard a defense lawyer in a prominent murder case
make such a concession, which he termed ``inappropriate.''
   London's co-counsel, Adrian DiLuzio, pointed out that ``We
haven't thrown in the towel at all. We're pursuing this case
vigorously.''
   In granting the prosecution's request to have one of its
psychiatrists examine Steinberg, Rothwax said the defense appeared
to be presenting an insanity defense even though they were not
saying so.
   By allowing the examination, the judge gives the prosecution a
chance to rebut an insanity defense.
   Steinberg may refuse to be examined by the prosecution
psychiatrist, but then the judge may tell the jury the defense has
presented an insanity case and they should consider whether
Steinberg, in effect, has something to hide.
   ``There is nothing in this case other than Hedda that says Joel
committed this crime,'' DiLuzio said. ``The prosecution's whole case
lies in the lap of Hedda and we think the jury will find that Hedda
is not a credible witness.''
   DiLuzio said he believes that at this point ``the best course of
action is for him to submit to the exam.''

<TEXT>
   Conductor Lukas Foss is leaving his post as
Brooklyn Philharmonic music director to devote more time to
composing.
   Foss will continue as music director through the 1989-90 season
and will occasionally conduct the orchestra for the following three
years, said Harvey Lichtenstein, executive director of the Brooklyn
Academy of Music.
   Lichtenstein said Wednesday that orchestra officials are
evaluating prospects ``from all over the world'' but have no
timetable for selecting a new music director.
   Foss has been with the Brooklyn Philharmonic, which plays at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, for 20 years. He has been music director
since 1971.
   In continuing to occasionally perform with the orchestra after
the 1989-90 season, the 66-year-old Foss will be given a
``laureate'' title.

   The tops on bottles in 10 cases of beer
popped during a restaurant fire, sending out a stream of suds that
quenched the blaze before firefighters arrived.
   ``It was the best smelling fire I've ever been at,'' fire
department Lt. Dennis Jennings said of Wednesday's fire at the
Kamakura Restaurant.
   Two or three rags soaked in linseed oil spontaneously ignited
near the beer cases that had been left on a newly laid linoleum
floor to help the adhesive stick, fire officials said.
   When the beer reached the boiling point, the bottles exploded.
   No one was in the restaurant when the fire broke out and no
injuries were reported.
   ``It burned a 1-foot hole in the flooring and went up the wall.
We opened the wall, but the fire hadn't reached it,'' Jennings said.
   Fire officials estimated the loss of contents _ the beer _ at
$300 and the structural damage at $1,000.

<HEAD>Supporters of Vietnam Forest Memorial Raise Funds To Save Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CUSHING, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A forest planted in the nation's heartland
to honor Americans killed in Vietnam was saved from a bank
foreclosure sale by veterans of that war and other supporters around
the country.
   ``What we're trying to do is heal the people,'' said Vietnam
veteran Geoffrey Steiner, 39, who started the project nine years
ago. ``This is a living memorial.''
   Fruth Companies Inc., a Coors beer distributor in Brainerd, gave
$5,400 Wednesday on behalf of Adolph Coors Co. and Coors
distributors in Minnesota toward the $6,033.53 needed to keep the
100-acre forest near Cushing, a tiny town about 120 miles north of
Minneapolis, from being sold.
   The remainder of the money to save the Veterans National Living
Memorial came from Vietnam Veterans of America chapters and
individuals around the country.
   ``I think the good Lord sent them,'' said Steiner, who said he is
more than halfway toward his goal of planting a tree for every one
of the approximately 58,000 Americans who died in Vietnam.
   VVA chapters in Dayton, Ohio, and Junction City, Kan., also have
raised several hundred dollars to pay property taxes on the tract,
said Terry Thompson, legislative coordinator for the Dayton chapter.
   There also are plans to place the property in a trust so it
cannot be encroached upon again, said Thompson, who arrived in
Minnesota earlier this week to help raise money.
   The forest stands on a little hilltop about three miles off a
highway at the dead end of a country road.
   At the center of the stand of small trees that has been planted
over the past eight years is a wooden flagpole flying an American
flag and a stone marker.
   Thompson, who is not a veteran but volunteers in the Dayton
chapter, said she decided to help Steiner after reading a newspaper
article last month on his plight and the unusual memorial.
   She called the memorial ``part of that healing process that will
be beneficial to Vietnam vets and their families.''
   Steiner, a Marine in Vietnam in 1967-68 who now counsels
veterans, said he paid $23,000 in cash for the land in 1980 after
selling his Minneapolis home. Since then, he has planted more than
30,000 trees.
   He was about to lose the land for failing to repay an $8,000 loan
from Randall State Bank that he secured with the property in 1984 to
buy a car for his wife. Had the land been sold, the only way Steiner
could have gotten it back would have been to match the winning bid
within a year.
   With only half an hour before the aucition was to begin
Wednesday, Steiner, along with Thompson, the beer distributor and
two other VVA officials from Ohio, brought the money to a Little
Falls law office to pay the debt.
   Coors, based in Golden, Colo., has a longstanding interest in
helping veterans and their families, said Gary Fruth, co-owner of
Fruth Companies.
   ``They kind of entered this as a white knight,'' Fruth said. ``We
just didn't like the idea of them taking it away from that guy after
all of his work.''

   Showers lingered over the Southwest today after a storm that left
Phoenix cleaning up from a tornado that briefly touched down, while
subzero temperatures prevailed in New England and parts of the
Midwest.
   The tornado touched down briefly Wednesday and did minor damage
to some buildings. No injuries were reported.
   In the Pacific Northwest, a cold front produced rain and snow in
the mountains. A low-pressure system over the Southwest left snow
over parts of the Rocky Mountains.
   In Utah, 12 inches of snow fell in Richfield, 10 inches in Kanosh
and 5 in Price. Snow tapered off in Colorado, where 7 inches were
reported in Silverton. Flagstaff, Ariz., got 9 inches. Hail was
reported in Albuquerque, N.M.
   Snow advisories were posted for the southern Cascade and Siskiyou
mountains of Oregon, California's Sierra Nevada, parts of Nevada and
New Mexico.
   The subzero temperatures in New England combined with strong
winds to produce bone-chilling wind chill factors of minus 30
degrees in much of the region. The wind chill index in Limestone,
Maine, was 50 below.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 86 degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for rain in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee; rain showers and occasional
thunderstorms in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, the lower Mississippi
Valley and Missouri. Rain showers with snow was predicted at higher
elevations. Snow was also forecast in sections of the upper Missouri
Valley, the Rockies, Wyoming and the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the single digits and teens
in northern New England; the 20s and 30s in central New England, the
Virginias, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, the
northern Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies and Wyoming;
60s and 70s in Florida, the Gulf Coast, the lower Mississippi
Valley, Texas, Arizona and California; and 40s and 50s in the rest
of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees below zero at Rome, N.Y., to 72 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

   A parolee whose violent outburst ended in
the deaths of two hostages and himself was anxious about the
possible breakup of his marriage and haunted by his Vietnam War
experiences, say those who knew him. But Wayne Strozzi, 35, also was
remembered as a good father, neighbor and friend in the aftermath of
Tuesday night's bloody drama.
   ``There was something wrong with Wayne last night. Wayne wasn't
Wayne last night,'' said Maryanne Urista, a neighbor who called
Strozzi a good father ``who cared so much about his girls'' and a
horseman who loved his animals and went on family rides.
   Authorities investigating the standoff at the Riverhouse
Restaurant here said they are mainly concerned now with the
accidental killing of a hostage by police.
   ``We are focusing on one question, and that is that matter of the
justification of the police shooting,'' said Larimer County District
Attorney Stu VanMeveren.
   Fenton Crookshank, 45, of Loveland was shot and killed by a
Loveland police officer as he tried to escape through a bathroom
window of the restaurant. Police said Crookshank failed to heed
warnings to stop.
   Strozzi had broken into the restaurant and taken about 20 people
hostage. During the standoff, he threatened he was ``going to waste
everybody'' and intended to burn down the restaurant, and demanded a
getaway car and a plane to Libya.
   At one point, waitress Ann Knight said, Strozzi ordered her to
fetch his boots and a shirt from his pickup truck, saying, ``A good
cowboy dies with his boots on.'' He wounded two officers before he
was gunned down by a sharpshooter.
   After Strozzi was shot, he apparently shot another hostage,
waitress Sally Mills, 40, in a dying reflex, police said. Strozzi
and Mills died later at McKee Medical Center.
   VanMeveren said he was trying to determine whether the officers
were covered by Colorado law when they opened fire. The law mandates
that when police fire at someone they have reasonable fear that they
or a hostage will be hurt or that the person has committed a felony
with a dangerous weapon.
   VanMeveren declined to name the officers who shot Strozzi and the
hostage. He said they were suffering from ``post-traumatic stress''
and were placed on leave with pay until the case is resolved.
   Most people who knew Strozzi were shocked by the news of the
standoff, though some said he had serious emotional problems.
   Strozzi's estranged wife, Bobbi, called him ``a real sweetheart.''
   ``I think he had a lot of emotional problems because of
Vietnam,'' she said. ``It was real hard to feel good about himself
again. He was trying real, real hard to work his problems out. Heck,
he hadn't touched a drink in over a year, or any other kind of
drug.''
   The couple had graduated from a domestic violence class together.
The events Tuesday night began when Bobbi Strozzi told police her
husband had choked and threatened her.
   Strozzi, a Las Vegas native, served one year in Vietnam with the
101st Infantry in the early 1970s and received a general discharge.
He openly discussed his combat experiences, which a halfway house
counselor described as ``pretty heavy.''
   His father, Harry Strozzi of Las Vegas, said his son was ``pretty
stressed out.''
   After moving to Loveland in 1975 with their two daughters, the
couple was separated late last year. Last month, Bobbi and the two
daughters moved out of the trailer where the family had lived.
   Strozzi, a construction worker, was arrested in 1984 and
convicted 1{ years later on charges of possessing and selling
cocaine. He was sentenced to three years in prison. Strozzi was
paroled in 1987 after time in a minimum-security prison and a
halfway house.
   William Fitzgerald, a parole officer in Boulder County, said
parole officers didn't consider Strozzi a threat.
   ``In our records, there is absolutely no indication of him being
violent,'' Fitzgerald said.

   A state judge who wanted a rival's
courtroom so badly he broke into his office and removed his papers
and books was awarded the chambers when El Paso County Commissioners
decided seniority should prevail.
   The commissioners' decision Wednesday in favor of district Judge
Peter Peca Jr. means Judge Jose Troche is a man without a chambers:
El Paso has 11 district judges but only 10 courtrooms.
   The office and courtroom in dispute had been vacated last week by
Ward Koehler, the former 168th district judge who defeated Peca last
November for a spot in the state's 8th Court of Appeals.
   In one of his last acts as district judge, Koehler decreed that
Troche, his appointed successor, should get the sixth-floor office
rather than Peca.
   Peca, who was elected to the 171st district two years ago, had
been the odd judge out in the game of musical benches. He had to
hold court wherever he could find an available courtroom.
   On Sunday, Peca broke into the office and removed papers, books
and other items belonging to Troche, who had moved in Friday and
posted Koehler's decree on the door.
   When Troche went to the office Monday to tidy up, he found Peca's
nameplate in place of Koehler's order. The locks had been changed,
and Troche's property had been moved to a table in a jury room down
the hall.
   Despite Peca's unilateral action, commissioners bought his
argument that he should get a permanent office because he has
seniority over Troche.
   Peca was not present at the commissioners' meeting, but Troche
commented, ``I'd like the court to establish some procedure (for
allocating court space).''

<TEXT>
   Judit Polgar, a 12-year-old
Hungarian, has been ranked No. 1 in the world in women's chess, the
youngest ever to top the list.
   In the men's rankings, World Champion Gary Kasparov continued to
top the list ahead of former title holder Anatoly Karpov.
   Miss Polgar, the youngest of three chess-playing sisters,
overtook World Champion Maya Chiburdanidze in the ratings published
Wednesday by the International Chess Federation.
   ``It's the first time that we have a 12-year-old at the top of
the ratings,'' said Casto Abundo, assistant secretary-general of the
federation.
   Ms. Chiburdanidze is ranked second, and Miss Polgar's 19-year-old
sister, Zsuzsa, is rated third. The third Polgar sister, 15-year-old
Sofia, is ranked 35th on the women's list.
   Kasparov and Karpov, both of the Soviet Union, held the top two
spots, but Britain strenghtened its position. Nigel Short was ranked
third, Jonathan Speelman was fourth and John Nunn was ninth.
   The Netherlands' top hope, grandmaster Jan Timman, who placed
third a year ago and fifth in July, fell to 11th place.
   The ratings are compiled twice annually by the Lucerne-based
chess federation, on the basis of players' performances at
international tournaments.
   The Americans figured lower in the rankings: highest in the men's
field was Yasser Seirawan at 13th, Boris Gulko was 20th, Nick de
Firmian was 45th, Maxim Dlugy was 46th and Lubomir Kavalek was 49th.
   Among the women, Anna Akhcharumova was 9th, but no other U.S.
player listed among the top 50 women.

   ``Working Girl,'' the holiday season
hit about an ambitious secretary's escape from the steno pool,
combined with a dark film about aging '60s radicals to lead
nominations for the 46th annual Golden Globe awards.
   The awards are considered important not only for their use in
newspaper, television and radio ads but also as indicators of
favorites for the Oscars in March.
   Last year's big Golden Globe winners were ``The Last Emperor,''
with four trophies, and ``Moonstruck'' and ``L.A. Law'' with two
statuettes apiece.
   ``Working Girl'' collected six nominations Wednesday, including
best musical or comedy motion picture, best director for Mike
Nichols, best actress for star Melanie Griffith, and best screenplay
for Kevin Wade.
   The Mike Nichols film, which featured Harrison Ford as Griffith's
suitor, was a smart comedy in the tradition of Katherine
Hepburn-Spencer Tracy matchups of the 1940s.
   A darker film, ``Running on Empty'' drew five nominations,
including best drama, best drama actress for Christine Lahti, Sidney
Lumet for best director, and Naomi Foner for best screenplay.
   ``The Accidental Tourist,'' regarded by many critics as one of
the year's best movies, and box-office giant ``Big'' collected only
two nominations apiece.
   The civil-rights film ``Mississippi Burning,'' the autism study
``Rain Man'' and the melodrama ``A Cry in the Dark'' each collected
four nominations.
   In the Golden Globe television competition, NBC's ``L.A. Law''
captured seven nominations, ahead of ABC's epic miniseries ``War and
Remembrance,'' with four.
   The nominations were announced at a news conference at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,
which will present the trophies Jan. 28 at the hotel on a broadcast
carried by cable. The association, composed of 79 writers who cover
entertainment, began the Golden Globes in 1944.
   In this year's Golden Globe contest, films will compete in 13
categories and television shows will oppose each other in 11
divisions.
   Vague awards categories occasionally produce unusual selections.
``Hope and Glory,'' a reminiscence of life in World War II London,
last year was named best comic or musical film.
   Nominated for best dramatic motion picture were ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' ``A Cry In The Dark,'' ``Gorillas In The Mist:The
Adventure of Dian Fossey,'' ``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Rain Man,''
``Running On Empty'' and ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being.''
   Selections for best musical or comedy motion picture were
``Big,'' ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' ``Midnight Run,'' ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit,'' and ``Working Girl.''
   ``Babette's Feast,'' ``Hanussen,'' ``Pelle the Conqueror,''
``Salaam Bombay!'' and ``Women On The Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''
were selected for top foreign language film nominations.
   Nominees for best performance by an actor in a dramatic motion
picture were Gene Hackman (``Mississippi Burning''), Dustin Hoffman
(``Rain Man''), Tom Hulce (``Dominick and Eugene''), Edward James
Olmos (``Stand and Deliver'') and Forest Whitaker (``Bird.'')
   Jodie Foster (``The Accused''), Lahti (``Running On Empty''),
Shirley MacLaine (``Madame Sousatzka''), Meryl Streep, (``A Cry In
The Dark'') and Sigourney Weaver (``Gorillas In The Mist'') were the
actresses nominated for work in a dramatic films.
   For acting in a musical or comic film, the male nominees were
Michael Caine (``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''), John Cleese (``A Fish
Called Wanda''), Tom Hanks (``Big''), Bob Hoskins (``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit'') and Robert De Niro (``Midnight Run'').
   Their female counterparts were Jamie Lee Curtis, (``A Fish Called
Wanda'') Griffith (``Working Girl''), Amy Irving (``Crossing
Delancey'') Michelle Pfeiffer (``Married To The Mob'') and Susan
Sarandon (``Bull Durham'').
   Actresses nominated in supporting roles were Sonia Braga (``Moon
Over Parador''), Barbara Hershey (``The Last Temptation of
Christ''), Lena Olin (``The Unbearable Lightness of Being''), Diane
Venora (``Bird'') and Weaver (``Working Girl'').
   Nominated supporting actors were Alec Guiness (``Little Dorrit,
Parts I and II''), Neil Patrick Harris (``Clara's Heart''), Raul
Julia (``Moon Over Parador''), Martin Landau (``Tucker: The Man and
His Dream''), Lou Diamond Phillips (``Stand and Deliver'') and River
Phoenix (``Running on Empty'').
   Actor Clint Eastwood received a Golden Globe nomination for his
work as director of ``Bird.'' Joining Eastwood in the category are
Barry Levinson (``Rain Man''), Alan Parker (``Mississippi
Burning''), Fred Schepisi (``A Cry in the Dark''), Lumet and Nichols.
   In television competition, best drama series nominees were ``L.A.
Law,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
``thirtysomething,'' and ``Wiseguy.''
   ``Cheers,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Roseanne,''
and ``The Wonder Years'' were the nominated comedy series.

<HEAD>Delvalle Writes Noriega Offering To Negotiate Political Solution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle
has written to the nation's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
offering to negotiate a solution to Panama's political crisis.
   Delvalle asked Noriega in a letter to accept ``this ...
invitation to reach an understanding which will benefit our country
and all Panamanians.''
   A copy of the letter, dated Dec. 27 and written on stationery of
the Panamanian Embassy in Washington, was obtained by The Associated
Press from Noriega opponents who refused to be identified further.
   In February 1988, Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega as commander
of Panama's Defense Forces after two federal grand juries in Florida
indicted the general on drug trafficking and money laundering
charges.
   Noriega orchestrated Delvalle's ouster by the National Assembly
and replaced him with Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma.
   The United States, which continues to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's president, imposed economic sanctions on Panama and brought
diplomatic pressure to bear in an unsuccessful effort to force
Noriega to resign.
   Delvalle signed the letter ``President of the Republic of
Panama.'' The Panamanian Embassy in Washington is in the hands of
Noriega opponents.
   A Defense Forces official in Panama City, who spoke condition of
anonymity, said: ``We have no knowledge'' of Delvalle's letter.
   Delvalle said the nation's political and economic crisis has
created hardships for Panamanians and ``caused the government to be
incapable of providing basic public services due to a drop in
government revenue.''
   He wrote the letter six days after meeting in Washington with
President-elect Bush, who told reporters later his policy will
continue to be ``that Noriega must go.''
   Raul Saint Malo, a counselor at the Panamanian Embassy in
Washington, said in a telephone interview Delvalle's letter was sent
by way of the Vatican Embassy in Washington to the Vatican Embassy
in Panama City.
   Diplomatic sources said Delvalle had returned to Panama and was
in hiding.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Britain has no doubts that Libya is building a
factory to produce chemical weapons, but it would require ``some
convincing'' that the factory should be destroyed, the Foreign
Office said today.
   ``We do not believe that it has gone into production yet,''
Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``It is there. It is defended by missiles.
We are sure of that.''
   The Foreign Office said Wednesday night that the British
government has ``independent information'' confirming that the plant
near Rabta, a desert town 60 miles from Tripoli, is designed to
produce chemical weapons.
   Libya says the factory will produce pharmaceuticals.
   Waldegrave would not elaborate on the nature of information
Britain had obtained but said there is ``no question'' the plant is
designed to produce ``very large quantities of chemical weapons.''
   On Wednesday night, a Foreign Office spokesman said, ``We have
been in contact with a number of countries to make the point that we
have independent information on the Libyan chemical warfare
programs.''
   ``This information shows that the plant is very large and that
there is no doubt it is intended for chemical warfare production,''
the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The announcement came hours after American warplanes shot down
two Libyan jet fighters over the Mediterranean. U.S. officials said
the Libyan jets displayed ``clear hostile intent'' against the
American warplanes.
   The attack occurred after the United States charged that Libya
built the plant near Rabta to produce chemical weapons. However,
U.S. officials said the downing of the Libyan jets was unrelated to
their concerns about the plant.
   Waldegrave added today, ``It (the plant) makes everybody, both in
the region and outside, nervous that this regime, which is the most
unstable, unpredictable and dangerous in the world, has this great
capacity.''
   But he said ``one would need some convincing'' that the plant
should be destroyed by military force.
   ``What we want is a proper worldwide international convention
with proper verification which would be quite difficult and quite
expensive but not impossible,'' Waldegrave said.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell today
joined other top lawmakers in calling the U.S. downing of two Libyan
jets an appropriate act of self-defense.
   ``We regret the tragedy involved but ... I don't think there's
any basis for second-guessing the decision by these pilots,''
Mitchell, D-Maine, said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   He said he believed the action of the American pilots, flying in
international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea, ``was an
appropriate act of self-defense under the rules of engagement and
given the circumstances that existed at the time.''
   Mitchell made similar remarks on ``CBS This Morning'' and ABC's
``Good Morning America.''
   Asked if he would support a U.S. attack on the plant in Libya,
which the administration says is intended to produce chemical
weapons, Mitchell said on CBS that President-elect Bush ``ought to
have the fullest range of options before he makes his decision.''
   Congressional leaders overwhelmingly backed the U.S. downing of
the jets and most took great pains to deny the action was linked to
the allegations concerning the Libyan plant.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said after senators were briefed Wednesday by Defense Department
officials that the shooting down of the Libyan MiG-23s was
appropriate ``under the circumstances.''
   ``It was a justified defensive measure taken by American pilots
who felt they were in jeopardy and were taking sort of evasive
action,'' said Nunn.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Wednesday at a Pentagon
news conference that the commander of the F-14 patrol made the
decision to fire at the Libyan aircraft ``in self-defense'' and
apparently shot down both planes.
   Nunn said Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff assured him there was no connection between the confrontation
and U.S. reaction to the suspected Libyan chemical weapons factory.
   Libya has claimed the plant makes only pharmaceuticals and has
offered to allow a one-time inspection of the facility by
international experts. The United States rejected the offer.
   ``The action took place 45 to 50 miles away from shore. It wasn't
even in the approximate region of that chemical plant,'' Nunn said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the American pilots ``had
reason to believe they were under attack and they were acting in
self-defense.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the incident _ the
first battle between the United States and Libya since American jets
bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 _ appears to be
``self-defense _ pure and simple.''
   ``Gadhafi never learns,'' Dole said. ``Maybe this time he will
finally get it straight: Whenever he threatens American forces, we
will defend ourselves.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of Nunn's panel, declined
comment on the U.S. action. ``The briefing that we got did not cover
some of the things I want to know before I say it was right or
wrong,'' said Glenn.
   Glenn said he is still waiting for ``final information''
following a debriefing of the F-14 pilots who were flown to Naples,
Italy. Glenn said he wants to know about any missiles that might
have been fired, angles of attack, use of radar and justification
for firing.
   He also said he wanted more information about the suspected
chemical weapons plant.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
suggested Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi might have provoked the
U.S. action because he ``is able to take center stage and win public
support only when he is perceived as the victim of superpower
oppression.''

   The United States and Laos have agreed
to conduct year-round joint activities to resolve the fate of
missing American servicemen, according to a U.S. statement.
   In the talks, the Laotians also agreed in principle to cooperate
in anti-narcotics programs, said the statement, dated Wednesday.
   The talks were held Monday and Tuesday in the capital of Laos,
Vientiane, by teams led by Laotian Vice Foreign Minister Soubanh
Srithirath and Richard Childress, director of Asian affairs at the
U.S. National Security Council.
   The U.S. team issued its statement through the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   The statement said the two sides reviewed the issue of missing
Americans, and ``agreed to establish a year-round schedule of joint
activities, including research, further surveys and excavations.''
It said specifics of the plan will be discussed during a meeting of
technical experts later this month.
   The United States wants to account for 547 Americans listed as
missing in action in Laos as a result of the Indochina war, which
ended in 1975. The two sides have conducted four joint excavations
of U.S. warplane crash sites to search for remains.
   The United States also acknowledged Laos' domestic problems,
recently complicated by a poor rice harvest because of drought, and
``renewed its pledge to respond to the extent possible,'' the
statement said.
   It said: ``Following a U.S. expression of concern over narcotics
production and trafficking, the Laos government informed the U.S.
side of its agreement in principle to bilateral cooperation with the
United States on narcotics program activities, a development we
strongly welcome.''
   U.S. officials have accused Laotian government and military
authorities of involvement in the production and trafficking of
large quantities of opium and marijuana. The Laotians deny this and
have protested the charge.
   The two sides also expressed interest in increased commercial
contacts, the statement said. It said representatives of the U.S.
State and Commerce departments also met with Laotian officials to
discuss trade and investment.

<TEXT>
   Whatever touched off the latest violent
confrontation between the United States and Libya, the most
immediate danger is that the incident could undermine U.S. efforts
to mobilize its allies to block the spread of chemical weapons.
   Even before Wednesday's military clash, Europeans were reluctant
to join American concern over a Libyan facility U.S. officials said
was designed to produce chemical weapons.
   Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi is the leader Americans love to
hate. Unfortunately, Gadhafi's ability to provoke strong U.S.
responses had made it tougher for the Reagan administration to
convince its allies to agree to joint action against Libya.
   In part the reason is economic. Libya sells oil to some European
countries, and it is a market for European exports. But the
reluctance also seems based in the belief that the U.S. tends to
overreact to Gadhafi.
   Libya and its allies portray the clash as David versus Goliath
over the Mediterranean, a superpower engaged in military action
against a nation of fewer than 4 million people.
   As they gave details of the air battle 40 miles off the Libyan
coast, U.S. officials appeared clearly worried about the potential
aftershocks.
   Immediately after U.S. jets downed two Libyan MIG-23s described
as on a hostile course, a White House spokesman said President
Reagan ``considers the incident closed.''
   ``We now consider this matter closed,'' echoed Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci at a Pentagon briefing.
   When asked of the possible impact on the meeting this weekend in
Paris to discuss how to halt the proliferation of chemical weaponry,
particularly among Third World countries, William Burns, the U.S.
arms control director, said, ``I don't see it as really germane to
the conference. I think that other nations will not see it as
germane as well.''
   The insistence of U.S. officials that the military clash was an
isolated incident that should have no effect on the conference
seemed the clearest indication they were worried that it would have
a serious impact.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said his country, the host
for the weekend conference, ``hopes that tension in the
Mediterranean does not increase'' as a result of Wednesday's
incident.
   ``It is still too early to know the exact circumstances of the
incident,'' Dumas said. ``France is following with close attention
the consequences that could result from this action.''
   West German officials have rejected U.S. allegations that a
German firm assisted Libya in construction of the chemical plant.
   European nations have never readily accepted in full U.S.
concerns about Gadhafi's actions.
   According to U.S. accounts, the Libyan jets approached the U.S.
planes in a manner that under international rules of engagement was
clearly threatening.
   ``You cannot, in this day and time and modern technology, wait
until another plane has fired in order to defend yourself,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``It's too late then.''
   But military rules of engagement aren't likely to be uppermost in
the minds of the 100 or so foreign ministers who will meet in Paris.
   The United States delegation headed by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz hopes to convince other industrialized nations to deny
chemical weapons technology to Third World countries and unite on
sanctions against countries that use poison gas.
   The Americans also want to strengthen the authority of the U.N.
secretary general to investigate allegations of the use of chemical
weapons.
   If the fears expressed by Dumas and indirectly by U.S. officials
prove correct, it would provide one more case of how fragile the
plans of superpowers can become in that violence-prone region.

   Carolina Prokofiev, widow of the celebrated Russian
composer Serge Prokofiev, has died of cancer in London, her son said
today. She was 91.
   Mrs. Prokofiev, who survived a Soviet prison camp, two years ago
narrated her husband's classic children's work ``Peter and the
Wolf'' at Lincoln Center in New York to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the work.
   She died Tuesday about three months after falling ill and will be
cremated in London on Jan. 11, said her son, Oleg Prokofiev.
   Mrs. Prokofiev was born Carolina Codina in Madrid in 1897 to a
Catalonian father and a Polish-French mother. Later she became
universally known Lina, and unlike the rest of the family, insisted
on transliterating her married name from the Russian as Prokofieff,
her son said.
   Her parents were professional singers, and she trained as a
classical recitalist. The Codinas traveled extensively and settled
in New York, where Carolina met Prokofiev in 1918.
   They were married in Germany in 1923, lived in Paris, then moved
to the Soviet Union in 1934. But they drifted apart in the 1940s.
   In 1948, Prokofiev was one of the composers denounced by the
Stalin government for writing ``bourgeois'' music. Mrs. Prokofiev
was accused of having contact with anti-Soviet elements and was sent
to Ubez prison camp in the northern Urals.
   Prokofiev died in 1953, and his widow was freed three years
later. Her son Oleg, a sculptor, emigrated to England and in 1974
she was allowed to join him.
   She settled in London and traveled extensively.
   Later this month, in accordance with her wishes, her ashes will
placed at her mother-in-law's burialplace in Paris, her son said.
   An older son, architect Sviatoslav Prokofiev, lives in Moscow.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today dismissed two
appeals that a defense lawyer called ``the last legal battle'' to
save two Sikhs condemned to hang for the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.
   A panel of five justices quickly turned down a plea by Satwant
Singh, the lone surviving assassin. Another five-judge panel, acting
almost as swiftly, rejected a petition by Kehar Singh, who allegedly
helped plot the murder.
   ``This is the last legal battle. We can't go anywhere now,'' said
Kehar Singh's attorney, Ram Jethmalani.
   Kehar Singh, 54, and Satwant Singh, 30, are to hang at 8 a.m.
Friday in the refurbished gallows of New Delhi's maximum-security
Tihar Central Jail.
   The two men are not related, but like all members of the Sikh
faith use the name Singh, which means lion.
   Heavily-armed security forces were placed on maximum alert and
checkpoints set up in the capital and in the northern states of
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, where militant Sikhs have been
waging a 6-year-old war for independence. Authorities fear the
executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal violence.
   Jethmalani, one of the country's leading criminal attorneys,
asked the Supreme Court to block the scheduled executions,
challenging President Ramaswamy Venkataraman's refusal of clemency
for Kehar Singh.
   The attorney said the president considered only the government's
case and ignored new evidence, including the arrest of a Sikh
terrorist who allegedly confessed he was the mastermind of Mrs.
Gandhi's murder.
   ``I am arguing in the shadow of the death of Kehar Singh, with
two ready hangmen and a prepared pyre,'' an emotional Jethmalani
told the justices.
   Venkataraman twice rejected the mercy plea, saying he was bound
by the recommendations of the government, headed by the slain prime
minister's son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi.
   The government's chief attorney, G. Ramaswamy, said Kehar Singh's
guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the trial court and
an appeals court as well as the Supreme Court.
   Down the corridor, another court panel rejected an appeal by
Satwant Singh, seeking prosecution of two of Mrs. Gandhi's security
guards. The inmate claimed the two guards shot him after he had been
disarmed and that their actions were tantamount to attempted murder.
   The justices ruled the appeal had no merit.
   Satwant Singh did not file a mercy petition with the president.
But under Indian laws, his death sentence was automatically delayed
when Kehar Singh sought clemency.
   In London, the Amnesty International human rights group and a
leading British jurist, Lord Gifford, appealed today for clemency
for the two Sikhs, and said the evidence against Kehar Singh was too
weak to justify his conviction.
   Two Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot Mrs.
Gandhi in the garden of her New Delhi residence on Oct. 31, 1984.
   Mrs. Gandhi apparently was killed in retaliation for an army raid
she ordered four months earlier to rout Sikh militants from the
Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than 1,200 people
died, most of them Sikhs.
   Beant Singh was killed in a shootout with other security guards
and is revered as a martyr by many militant Sikhs. Satwant Singh was
injured.
   Kehar Singh, Beant's uncle, was arrested a month later and
charged with helping to plot Mrs. Gandhi's assassination, which
triggered anti-Sikh riots across northern India by members of the
majority Hindu religion. More than 2,700 people were killed, nearly
all of them Sikhs.
   Sikh violence since then has escalated. At least 2,440 people
died last year in northern Punjab state alone.
   The eight-month trial, which culminiated in convictions and death
sentences on Jan. 22, 1986, was held in a make-shift courtroom at
the prison.
   A third Sikh, Balbir Singh, also was arrested, tried and
convicted on conspiracy charges and sentenced to death in Mrs.
Gandhi's assassination. The Supreme Court, however, overturned his
conviction and sentence in August for lack of evidence.
   Capital punishment is rare in India. Of 85,000 murder cases
between 1974 and 1984 only 288 death sentences were passed,
government statistics say.
   The last hanging in New Delhi's Tihar prison was in February 1984.

<HEAD>13 Cops Beat Red Light Violator, Complaint Says</HEAD>

   Police officers stomped on a handcuffed suspect for
10 minutes while he lay screaming on the ground, then told him to
wash his face before booking him, Massachusetts' attorney general
has charged.
   In a civil rights complaint filed Wednesday in Superior Court,
Attorney General James Shannon said 13 officers either allowed or
took part in the beating. The man was accused of running a red light
and trying to elude police.
   Shannon accused the officers of using excessive force, conspiring
to keep the incident quiet and depriving the man of his civil rights.
   ``This case is particularly disturbing because of the number of
officers involved and the failure even to conduct an
investigation,'' the attorney general said.
   The suit asks the court to bar the 13 officers from further
violations and prohibit them from handling arrests until they take a
court-approved course in the use of force.
   The officers have 30 days to respond to the complaint. They will
remain on active duty pending any court action, police said.
   Boston Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache is frustrated that
the victim has refused to cooperate with the department, which
contacted him after he wrote to the attorney general, said police
spokesman James Jordan.
   The suit said that John L. Smith Jr., 25, allegedly ran a red
light early on May 12 and sped off when a cruiser tried to pull him
over. More than a dozen cruisers gave chase for about 15 minutes
until Smith's car hit a curb.
   According to the complaint, Smith turned off the engine and sat
in the car, but officers smashed the windows and hauled him out. One
officer then began beating Smith on the back of his head and knees
with his baton, the complant said.
   More officers arrived and Smith was handcuffed. Several officers
surrounded him, delivering kicks and other blows, the complaint
charged. Eventually 13 officers were present, some of whom stood
about chatting during the beating, the suit said.
   Officers took Smith to a police station for booking. He was told
to wash his face for photographing, the complaint said.
   Smith was treated at a hospital for for cuts, bruises, pain and
blurry vision.
   Police charged Smith with such offenses as operating under the
influence of drugs, failing to stop for a red light and assault.

   Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said today he is not
afraid of anything that might come out of the current investigation
into whether he interfered with a police drug probe.
   Barry's telephone records, along with other city records, have
been subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in its investigation.
   ``I'm not afraid of anything that might come out of this,'' Barry
said in an interview on WOL radio.
   Referring to investigations of several years ago by former U.S.
Attorney Joseph DiGenova, Barry said DiGenova ``spent $30 million
investigating my administration and very little came out of that.''
   Barry, who denies having tried to disrupt the drug investigation,
will be questioned about the matter, possibly this week, according
to sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   In a statement issued Wednesday, Barry said: ``We welcome this
investigation. The district government will cooperate fully ... and
will comply with any subpoenas the grand jury may issue.''
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that a federal
grand jury has also subpoenaed thousands of documents relating to a
joint D.C.-Virgin Islands personnel project. The former manager of
the project, Charles Lewis, is a key figure in the current Barry
case.
   Barry, who has faced repeated allegations of personal impropriety
in his 10 years as mayor of the nation's capital, is facing his most
serious political crisis yet following disclosures that he met last
month with a man who was the subject of a city police drug
investigation.
   Sources familiar with the investigation said the records sought
by the U.S. attorney's office cover calls placed from the telephone
in Barry's automobile, as well as calls placed in other ways that
would generate a record. Those would include calls made through
police and city switchboards.
   Barry has acknowledged calling the assistant police chief, Isaac
Fulwood, who is supervising the investigation, but has said he was
trying to speed up the probe and not influence its outcome.
   The records search involves any calls that may have been made
around the time last month when Barry has acknowledged visiting a
Washington hotel room occupied by Lewis.
   District of Columbia police called off an attempt to make an
undercover purchase of drugs from Lewis after two detectives
encountered one of the mayor's security guards while Barry was at
the hotel, authorities have said.
   Police said a later search of the room, after Lewis checked out,
found traces of cocaine, but there was no indication how long they
had been there.
   Barry has denied any drug use but admitted ``poor judgment.''
   Also sought in the federal investigation are records of calls by
Chief of Police Maurice Turner and other city officials, including
tape recordings of calls through the police dispatcher's phone
system.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said last week that his office was
conducting a full investigation of the allegations against Barry,
including whether he used drugs or tried to hinder a police
investigation.
   Meanwhile, the inspector general of the U.S. Interior Department
is conducting a separate investigation into an agreement in which
Barry and other D.C. officials were to provide consulting services
to the Virgin Islands on personnel issues. Lewis was in charge of
that agreement for the Virgin Islands government.
   Stephens, asked about the search for telephone records, said he
could not comment on matters under investigation.
   Police department spokesman Shannon Cockett, spokeswoman for
Turner, said, ``We will not comment while the U.S. attorney's office
is investigating this matter.''
   Barry, elected three times by large majorities, came up through
the ranks of local civil rights leaders in the 1960s to become the
mayor of the heavily black city in 1978.
   Barry, who is married, acknowledged last year he once had a
``personal'' relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer, Karen
Johnson. He denied using drugs or purchasing them from her, however,
and denied allegations she had been paid hush money to prevent her
from talking to federal investigators.
   At the same time, Barry has sought to be a visible leader in the
city's battle against drugs, appearing at anti-drug rallies with
Jesse Jackson and police officials. The city recorded a record 371
homicides last year, more than half of which police said were drug
related.
   Lewis has remained unavailable for comment since the Dec. 22
hotel incident, but sources say he has been in contact with federal
investigators.
   He is a former city government official and a native of the
Virgin Islands who was fired in April from his job as assistant to
the governor of the Virgin Islands.

   Not everything has changed since state
Assemblyman Joseph Lentol's grandfather and father served as
assemblymen here. Two constants are the annual State of the State
address and the Lentol necktie.
   Lentol wore his father's old tie as he listened to Gov. Mario
Cuomo's State of the State address on Wednesday. It's kind of a
tradition for Lentol, but it doesn't date back nearly as far as the
Lentol family ties to the Legislature.
   The tie is navy with a large pink and beige swirl, ``sort of like
a G-clef,'' Lenton said.
   New York state had its first Assemblyman Lentol from Brooklyn in
1919. Joseph Lentol served two, one-year terms. His son, Assemblyman
Edward Lentol, served from 1949 to 1962, when he became state Sen.
Lentol for 10 years.
   His son, the current Assemblyman Lentol, was elected in 1972.
   The 45-year-old assemblyman is the only third-generation member
of the Legislature.
   Wednesday was Lentol's 17th State of the State message. Assuming
he didn't miss any, his father sat through 24 of the gubernatorial
speeches. The first Assemblyman Lentol _ Joseph _ probably witnessed
two of them.
   That means that some Assemblyman Lentol or other has seen 43
State of the State messages. But the current one says he's not bored
yet.
   ``I always look forward to it. It may be the only traditional
thing left,'' said the third-generation legislator.

<HEAD>Investigators: No Proof To Back Up U.S. Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHR, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German financial examiners found
no proof to support U.S. allegations that a West German firm helped
build a plant in Libya designed to produce chemical weapons,
officials said today.
   The announcement ended a probe of the Imhausen-Chemie company in
southwest Baden-Wuerttemberg state. The federal Finance Ministry
ordered the company's records examined in response to the U.S.
claims.
   ``There is no evidence of illegal exports,'' Freiburg district
director Willi Voegele told reporters after delivering results of
the inquiry to the company offices in Lahr, 130 miles south of
Frankfurt.
   Voegele said the inquiry had not found any evidence to show that
``the company or its branches sold pieces of chemical (plant)
equipment to Libya from 1984 until today.''
   ``They also have not helped with plans or with specialized
knowledge,'' he said.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, managing director of the company,
repeated his denials of the U.S. allegations, saying the firm had
``nothing _ absolutely nothing _ to do with this `Libyan tale.'''
   Also today, the West German government said that five other West
German companies ``in all probability'' provided Iraq with materials
that can be used to make chemical weapons.
   No charges have been filed in that case, which came to official
attention before the allegations against Imhausen-Chemie surfaced.
   The government said the companies under investigation are Walter
Engineer Trading of Hamburg, the Karl Kolb company of Dreieich,
Pilot Plant of Dreieich, Preussag of Hanover and Heberberger Bau of
Schifferstadt.
   The British government, meanwhile, joined the United States in
claiming to have proof that the Libyan plant was designed to produce
chemical weapons.
   The statement Wednesday night from the Foreign Office was the
first comment by British officials on U.S. allegations and other
reports that Libya built the plant to make chemical weapons,
including poison gas.
   ``This information shows that the plant is very large and that
there is no doubt it is intended for chemical warfare production,''
a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   So far, companies from West Germany, East Germany, Japan, Italy,
South Korea, Austria and Switzerland have been named in news reports
as being involved with the plant.
   Today's Financial Times said Washington's concerns about the
plant ``center on the involvement by at least a dozen western
European and Japanese companies.''
   The British newspaper also quoted unidentified U.S. officials as
saying the plant is surrounded by Soviet-made SA-6 anti-aircraft
missiles.
   ``It is not customary to defend a pharmaceutical plant with
surface-to-air missiles,'' the Financial Times quoted one U.S.
official as saying.

<HEAD>Export Limits Won't Apply to Hard Currency Purchases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Western travelers, already a privileged class in
the Soviet Union, will gain further favors Feb. 1 because their hard
currency can exempt them from the fallout of a ``customs war'' among
socialist countries.
   The Soviet Union is slapping a 100-ruble, or $165, limit on the
value of consumer goods that travelers may carry out of the country
and a complete ban on exports of caviar and children's shoes from
Feb. 1 until the end of 1990, in attempt to shore up extreme short
supplies at home.
   But the deputy customs chief, Vitaly Boyarov, told a news
briefing today that purchases made with hard currency will be
exempted.
   That will allow the Soviet Union to continue earning scarce hard
currency by selling the best caviar, fur hats and coats, vodka and
souvenirs to foreigners in stores that require dollars, pounds, or
other freely convertible currency.
   The restrictions on export of consumer goods, particularly home
appliances, are directed primarily at citizens of other socialist
countries.
   Since November, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland have
enacted similar laws to stop hordes of shoppers from neighboring
nations from stripping their shelves of items impossible to find at
home.
   None of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe has fully
convertible currencies, and they trade with each other based on
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting country's cost
of production, much less bring a profit.
   Still, Boyarov denied descriptions in both the Soviet and Western
press that the reciprocal restrictions amount to a trade war. ``This
is not so,'' he said, ``because the restrictions do not cover
foreign trade.''
   He indicated the restrictions are aimed at halting the sale in
rubles of Soviet goods that purchasers can then sell for hard
currency.
   ``We are encouraging exports, but not exports at any price and
not those damaging Soviet citizens,'' he said.
   ``Our stores are empty and we have to take steps,'' he said.
   Customs analysis has shown that in the past 10 months, travelers
have left the Soviet Union hauling 200,000 washing machines and half
a million television sets, Boyarov said.
   This despite the fact that Soviet televisions earned a reputation
a few years ago for blowing up and setting apartments on fire.
   The Soviet Union manufactures just 7 million televisions a year
for its 284 million people.
   Boyarov also said foreign embassy workers have been abusing their
diplomatic privileges, with one such person taking ``1,400 irons,
several hundred freezers, 3.5 million bars of soap and an impressive
amount of detergent'' out of the country in nine months.
   Television sets have joined windshield wipers in the last few
months on the long list of ``deficit'' goods in the Soviet Union,
but consumers have been particularly irate over the complete absence
of soap and detergent. One furious consumer signed a letter to a
newspaper, ``the mother of two dirty children.''

<HEAD>Eighteen Los Angeles Police Officers Face Charges Of Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen police officers have been accused of
misconduct for their part in an anti-gang raid in police allegedly
ransacked four apartments, roughed up residents and painted
anti-gang slogans, it was reported today.
   Investigators are also looking into allegations that the officers
were acting under what they assumed were orders from station Capt.
Thomas D. Elfmont to ``render the residences uninhabitable,'' the
Los Angeles Times reported.
   A quarter-gram of crack was seized in the Aug. 1 raid, which also
resulted in one drug charge and 33 people being taken into custody.
   Elfmont and Cmdr. William Booth, a police spokesman, declined to
comment on the case. Booth said the case had not been formally
reviewed by the department administration.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said seven officers
were ordered to appear before department tribunals. They could be
fired or suspended without pay.
   The 11 other officers are subject to lesser suspensions of up to
10 days or letters of reprimand, the newspaper reported.
   All are accused of violating departmental regulations ranging
from lying to investigators to excessive property damage, the Times
said.
   The district attorney's office is also investigating to determine
whether any officers should be prosecuted, the Times reported.
   The raid was carried out by more than 70 officers at four
tenement apartments, which had been targeted by the police anti-gang
task force following a series of gang-related, drive-by shootings.
   Officers obtained a warrant to search for drugs. But during the
raid they ripped plaster off walls, slashed furniture with knives,
destroyed toilets and sinks with sledgehammers and hacked apart
stereos, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court by about 40
people claiming their civil rights were violated.
   The lawsuit alleged that some of the officers spray-painted
anti-gang slogans and ``LAPD Rules'' on walls, and that some
residents taken to the station after the raid were ordered to
whistle the theme from the ``Andy Griffith Show'' and run a gauntlet
of officers beating them with fists.
   Those who didn't whistle were beaten with fists and steel
flashlights, the lawsuit charged.
   Damage to the apartments was so severe that the Red Cross offered
emergency housing to several residents.
   The police Internal Affairs Division, in a 668-page report, said
much of the damage attributed to the officers existed before the
raid or occurred afterward, but it determined that officers had
caused excessive damage.

<HEAD>Afghan Cadets Go on New Year's Rampage; At Least Three Die, Paper
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan military cadets went on a New Year's Day
rampage in Tashkent, burning cars and smashing furniture in a
drunken and drug-fueled brawl that left an infant and two other
people dead, a newspaper said today.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said 30 drunken Afghan cadets went to a
market in Tashkent to sell sunglasses, lighters and other items that
are hard to find in the Soviet Union.
   Soviets objected to Afghans becoming black marketeers and
fighting broke out when the Afghans began insulting the Soviets, the
paper said.
   Police rapidly intervened and sent the Afghans back to
dormitories around Tashkent where they live, it said.
   The Afghans gave their version of events to other Afghans living
in the dormitories, and they began smashing furniture and windows,
according to the newspaper account. Another group of Afghans, many
of whom had been taking drugs, smashed a traffic police post, the
paper said.
   The Afghans jumped on the hoods of passing cars and lay down on
the street, Komsomolskaya Pravda said. Twenty cars were vandalized
and four burned, according to preliminary information, the paper
said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, quoting a report printed in Uzbekistan
newspapers, said a 6-month-old child was killed ``as a result of the
rampages.'' It did not give details. Two people hurt in the rioting
died later of ``heavy trauma'' in the hospital, Komsomolskaya Pravda
said.
   Sixteen people, including seven Afghans, were reported
hospitalized, including one in critical condition.
   Friction has been reported before between Afghans and residents
of Tashkent, a city of 1.8 million that is the capital of the Uzbek
republic.
   Tashkent residents last year told visiting Western journalists
that some goods, such as tea kettles, had been taken off the market
because Afghans were buying them up and selling them for big profits
in their homeland.
   The paper expressed the hope that Soviet-Afghan relationship
would not be damaged by the incident. The Uzbek press report quoted
by Komsomolskaya Pravda said violators ``of Soviet laws and ethical
norms'' would be punished.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has denied that a Japanese
real estate firm is close to buying the Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building.
   ``We are compiling a financial analysis, which is the first step
in the offering process. We are not involved in any negotiations at
this time,'' Sears said in a statement Wednesday.
   But Jack Barthell, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of
Los Angeles, said his client, a Japanese real estate firm he would
not identify, was nearing a deal to buy the 110-story skyscraper for
about $1.2 billion.
   ``Because of the closeness of the deal, it's very sensitive,''
Barthell said.
   He said only that his owned high-profile buildings in other
cities and already has ``a presence in Chicago.''
   Sears announced Oct. 31 that it would sell the tower as part of a
restructuring plan. The giant retailing-and-financial-services
company has said it intends to keep its corporate headquarters in
the 15-year-old building.
   The tower, which rises 1,450 feet above downtown Chicago, is
expected to fetch a record price for a U.S. building, surpassing the
$660 million paid by Walter Shorenstein in 1985 for the Bank of
America Building in San Francisco.
   The building's value on the open market has been estimated at
$1.2 billion to $2 billion.
   Barthell's description prompted speculation that his client was
Shuwa Corp., a Japanese developer with more than $2 billion in U.S.
holdings, including ABC's New York headquarters, Arco Plaza in Los
Angeles and the Quaker Oats Tower in Chicago.
   But Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman in Los Angeles for Shuwa
Investment Corp., a Shuwa affiliate, said the company was not
negotiating to buy the Sears Tower.

<TEXT>
   The five-minute dogfight between U.S. and
Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean Sea climaxed a public drama
that began last October with charges by the CIA that Libya was
building a chemical weapons plant.
   Tension over the facility marks the latest chapter in a long
confrontation between America and Libya, a conflict U.S. officials
are trying to channel into a diplomatic campaign to close the plant,
which Libya denies makes chemical arms.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Wednesday the U.S. F-14
Tomcat fighters shot at the Soviet-made Libyan MiG-23s in ``self
defense,'' and denied that the warplanes or their host aircraft
carrier, the USS John F. Kennedy, intended to attack the suspected
chemical plant.
   Nevertheless, statements by U.S. officials and the history of
U.S.-Libyan conflict triggered concern in Libya. Pentagon sources
said Libyan airplanes have been extremely active in recent days,
flying close to American reconnaissance and patrol planes.
   In the three months since CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates warned
of the Libyan plant, other U.S. officials have made progressively
more ominous noises. President Reagan said in an interview broadcast
last month that he could not rule out a military strike.
   ``That is a decision that has not been made yet,'' Reagan said on
Dec. 22. The next day President-elect Bush said he shared Reagan's
determination to prevent the reported Libyan plant from being used
``to spread further destruction.''
   After the incident, Reagan privately decided against a military
strike on the plant, according to unnamed administration officials
quoted in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Reagan thought an attack could ``cause an international uproar''
and damage U.S. diplomatic efforts, including the campaign to curb
the proliferation of chemical weapons, according to the newspaper's
sources.
   But on the day before the dogfight over the Mediterranean, U.S.
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they believed the
factory had already started production.
   Statements like those, and the announcement that the carrier USS
Teddy Roosevelt was leaving Norfolk, Va., on Dec. 30 on a routine
mission to the Mediterranean, fueled speculation of a possible
strike against the plant similar to the April 1986 bombing raid
against alleged terrorist training centers in Libya.
   Against that tense backdrop, the aircraft carrier Kennedy was
steaming east off the southern coast of Crete, 127 miles north of
Tobruk, Libya, at noon local time Wednesday (about 5 a.m. EST), with
two F-14s flying a routine combat patrol. The planes were
supplemented by an E-2C Hawkeye electronic warfare aircraft,
according to Pentagon officials.
   Carlucci said U.S. forces had conducted 12 similar maneuvers in
that area this year without incident.
   ``The MiG aircraft were detected shortly after they left Al
Bumbah (an airfield in northeast Libya) at 4:50 EST and were tracked
as they closed on the two F-14 aircraft,'' said Carlucci.
   The U.S. pilots, he added, ``maneuvered to avoid the closing
aircraft. They changed speed, altitude and direction.
   ``The Libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner. At
about 14 miles, the U.S. section leader decided his aircraft was in
jeopardy and they could wait no longer. One MiG-23 was shot down
with a Sparrow missile. The second MiG was shot down by a Sidewinder
missile at six miles,'' he said.
   ``Each time, the Libyan aircraft sought to put their nose on our
aircraft. They also accelerated. So the hostile intent seems to be
fairly clear,'' he said.
   Carlucci said there was ``some preliminary information that
radars were turned on,'' indicating the Libyans were preparing to
fire. There was no evidence that the MiG-23s fired their AA-2 Atoll
air-to-air missiles, Pentagon sources said.
   Navy pilots spotted two parachutes in an area, well into
international waters 70 miles north of the Libya coast, and Libyan
ships and helicopters were seen conducting search and rescue
operations, officials said, although they did not know whether the
pilots survived.
   ``The 6th Fleet operation had no connection whatsoever with
Libya's newly constructed chemical facility. These operations were
conducted over 600 miles northeast'' of the facility, Carlucci said
at a Pentagon news briefing.
   ``We now consider this matter closed,'' he said.

   A Marine officer disobeyed orders
during a military exercise Aug. 30 in which a soldier was left
behind in the California desert, where he died of exposure, a
corporal testified.
   The testimony came Wednesday at a hearing for 1st Lt. Allen
Lawson, who is charged with disobeying a logistics officer in
assigning road guides during the exercise.
   The military proceeding, equivalent to a civilian grand jury
hearing, was then recessed.
   The presiding officer, Lt. Col. Michael Reardon, will determine
if Lawson faces court-martial or administrative action or if charges
will be dropped. He will probably make a recommendation next week,
said Maj. Stuart Wagner, Camp Lejeune spokesman.
   Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 19, died after being left behind at the
Twentynine Palms, Calif., Marine base.
   Lance Cpl. Donald Key testified that instead of assigning road
guides in pairs as ordered, Lawson split them and posted Rother
about 300 yards from a checkpoint.
   Key said he and a third road guide protested the split posting,
but Lawson told them, ``Don't worry about that. I know what I'm
doing.''
   Key said he had been at the Mojave Desert checkpoint for about
five hours when the last truck in the convoy he had been guiding
picked him up around midnight.
   He said he told the driver that Rother was still out in the
desert, but the driver told him to ``get on or get left.''
   Rother, who had little water and no map or compass, was not
reported missing for two days. He died while trying to walk out of
the desert, where daytime temperatures reached more than 120 degrees.
   Lawson did not testify Wednesday.
   Two other officers face courts-martial in the case _ Sgt.
Christopher P. Clyde, Rother's platoon sergeant, and Sgt. Thomas B.
Turnell, Rother's squad leader.
   Clyde, who faces court-martial on Tuesday, is charged with
dereliction of duty and disobeying an order in granting Turnell a
three-day pass. Because Turnell went on leave the day the exercise
ended, Rother's absence was not noticed for more than a day.
   Turnell's court-martial on charges of dereliction of duty and
unauthorized absence begins Jan. 24.

   TWA employees' suspicions about a brown parcel
led to the arrest of two French newsmen on charges of trying to
smuggle fake bombs onto flights to test security. Dutch TV reported
a similar attempt overseas succeeded.
   In the incident at Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday,
three packages containing bogus bombs were left for shipment at the
cargo areas of three international airlines: TWA, Pan Am and Air
France, police said.
   The packages also contained a typed message that read in part:
``Congratulations! You have found our phony bomb! (made with molding
clay, one alarm clock and wires),'' said Armando Arrastia, spokesman
for the Port Authority, which operates the airport.
   The message was written on the letterhead of the French TV
station TF1 and signed by the station's New York bureau chief, Alain
Chaillou, Arrastia said.
   Chaillou and producer Bruce Frankel were arrested Wednesday night
and charged with violating federal explosives law after TWA counter
employees detected what appeared to be a bomb, said FBI agent Mary
Frances Lilly.
   The two men were testing the airlines' security, said Lt. Frank
Tabert of Port Authority police.
   They were being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and
were to appear today before a U.S. magistrate.
   In Amsterdam, the TV station Veronica reported Wednesday that it
had smuggled a fake bomb onto a London-bound KLM flight to
demonstrate that terrorists can pass security checks with relative
ease.
   Reporter Gert Berg was filmed by his station carrying a briefcase
containing the imitation bomb through security checkpoints and onto
the aircraft at Schiphol Airport, considered one of Western Europe's
safest.
   KLM spokesman Nico Harmsen today accused the station of
``immature ... marginal journalism.''
   ``They've shown themselves to be really stupid. Bombers don't
have to be real terrorists, but this will always give some crazy
people new ideas,'' he said. He refused to say whether security was
tightened after the incident.
   ``This kind of reporting is not in the interest of aviation and
will harm its security,'' said Dutch National Police spokesman Rick
Hirs.
   The incidents a week after investigators reported that a bomb
blew up a Pan Am jet in Scotland, killing 270 people, drew mixed
reactions from journalism scholars over the ethics of such
news-gathering techniques.
   Joan Konner, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism in New York, said it was a ``particularly worthy
investigation to try to find out how well airport security works,''
but added: ``If that is how they want to test the system, they have
to understand the (legal) risk they are taking.''
   Melvin Mencher, a Columbia professor who has written about
journalism ethics, called the episode ``nickel-and-dime'' reporting.
   ``For some guy to say he got a wad of paper through as a bomb
sounds a little childish,'' he said. ``I don't know if the risk
these guys took proved a thing. They've caused inconvenience.''
   Bruce Haxthausen, an Air France spokesman, said that because of
the incident the airline will now inspect every cargo shipment
received rather than conduct random inspections.
   TWA spokesman Robert Blattner said, ``We are very pleased our
employees were able to use their techniques and just solve the case
on the spot.''
   At the Pan Am small cargo check-in, the package had been accepted
and ``was on its way to the X-ray when the New York Port Authority
police walked in and seized the package,'' said Alan Loflin, an
airline spokesman.
   Alouane Jeanterne, a TF1 documentary producer in New York, said
he knew nothing about his colleagues' alleged actions before their
arrest.
   ``If you're asking me my ethical judgment about it, I really
don't know,'' he said. ``Every reporter has his own way of getting
things, of getting sources, of getting to the news. I have not come
to a private opinion yet.''
   He said he did not know if Chaillou's superiors in Paris knew
anything in advance about the bogus explosives.
   In the message contained in each of the three packages, Chaillou
said: ``We are TF1, the largest television network in France, and it
is with due respect and great pleasure that we will tell our 18
million viewers who watch our daily newscast at 8, that we found
your company to be keen and consistent with security matters.''
   Frankel, 37, was arrested after TWA counter employees became
suspicious of a 6-by-8-inch brown package Frankel wanted to check
through to Paris, said Arrastia.
   Inspecting the package, an employee found what appeared to be a
bomb, he said. When the police arrived, Frankel cried, ``No, no it's
a fake!'' and ``took the bomb apart as the police officer and others
watched,'' Arrastia said.
   Frankel then told police he had delivered two similar packages to
the small cargo areas of Pan Am and Air France, Arrastia said. Those
packages were seized. After Frankel's arrest, Chaillou surrendered
at Kennedy, authorities said.
   On Friday, a reporter and cameraman from New York's WABC-TV were
arrested and charged with trespassing for being in a restricted ramp
area at Kennedy Airport. ``We had given them permission but they
went beyond that,'' Port Authority spokesman Mark Marchese said.
``Security is kind of sensitive today.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Stalin Ordered Trotsky Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper has publicly agreed with Western
historians' longstanding assertion that former Soviet leader Josef
Stalin ordered the assassination of fellow revolutionary and rival
Leon Trotsky.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta on Wednesday published a full-page article
on Trotsky, a leader of the Russian revolution in 1917 who came to
oppose Stalin and Vladimir Lenin.
   Historian N. Vasertzky got to the point five paragraphs from the
end:
   ``Stalin couldn't forget past offenses and outrages. Being
convinced that Trotsky was no longer needed, he apparently either
took the decision himself or let the decision be known to the people
around him: With Trotsky, `it's time to finish him,''' the paper
said.
   Many Soviets are aware of the Western belief that Stalin ordered
his rival's assassination, and a Soviet play and the official
newspaper Pravda have hinted at the same conclusion.
   An article last summer in Pravda titled, ``Demon of the
Revolution'' came closest, saying Stalin's aide Lavrenty Beria
carried out Stalin's wish to kill Trotsky and that he was promoted
to deputy prime minister for security shortly thereafter in 1941.
   The Literaturnaya Gazeta article quoted the original Pravda
account of Trotsky's death from 1940, which called him ``an
imperialist spy'' who was ``killed by his own allies.'' The original
account also named the assassin as Jack Morten Vandendreich, when it
was actually Ramon del Rio Merkader, Literaturnaya Gazeta charged.
   But the newspaper did not say that Merkader, a Spaniard, spent
his old age in Moscow, drawing a Soviet pension. He died in Havana
of cancer in 1978.
   Trotsky started his opposition to Lenin in the early 1900s,
saying Lenin's ideas would result in a one-party dictatorship. But
following the February revolution in 1917, he joined up with Lenin
to take power from the Provisional Government in the October
Revolution. He served as a member of the ruling Politburo from 1919
to 1927, but lost a power struggle with Stalin and was exiled.
   Stalin reviled Trotsky as a traitor and used his alleged
anti-Soviet plot as an excuse for bloody purges.

   A man who stopped to help a driver with a flat
tire was struck and killed by a tire that broke loose from a passing
truck, authorities said.
   Kevin Scott Stratford, a 23-year-old ranch hand from Carlsbad,
died early Wednesday at a ramp on Interstate 5 in Cardiff, where he
had pulled his car behind the disabled vehicle, said California
Highway Patrol spokesman Jerry Bohrer.
   ``The odds of something like this happening are astronomical,''
Bohrer said. ``It's hard to conceive.''
   The driver of the disabled car had told Stratford he didn't have
the tools to change the tire, Bohrer said.
   ``Stratford goes back to the trunk of his car and retrieves a
toolbox when along comes a southbound truck,'' he said. ``It loses
two tires off the rear axle, one of which hits Stratford as he turns
around from the trunk ... and killed him instantly.''
   The other tire went across the freeway, causing a minor three-car
collision. The driver of the tanker truck pulled safely off the
road, Bohrer said.
   Bohrer said it was not clear why the tires broke loose. ``Our
motor carrier people are doing a detailed inspection to establish
the reason, but it's going to be a few days before (their
investigation) is finalized,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two weeks after the crash of
Pan Am Flight 103, Lockerbie today buried two of its own, a
10-year-old girl whose parents are still among the missing and an
81-year-old widow.
   Air security chiefs, meanwhile, held an emergency meeting to
discuss the bombing of the jumbo jet.
   The National Aviation Security Committee, which was to have met
in February, changed schedule and gathered at a secret venue ``to
discuss the implications'' of the Dec. 21 crash, the Transport
Department said.
   The committee is headed by a department official and includes
police, airline and airport representatives. It was expected to
explore ways of tightening security at British airports following
the conclusion that a bomb blew up aboard the Boeing 747, killing
all 259 people aboard.
   Another 11 died on the ground, only three of whom have been
located.
   The first to be buried Thursday was 10-year-old Joanne Flannigan,
whose parents are missing and presumed dead. Her funeral was
followed by that of Mary Lancaster, an 81-year-old widow, at All
Saints Anglican Church.
   Joanne's funeral service at the Holy Trinity Roman Catholic
Church was even simpler than a memorial service held Wednesday for
all the victims.
   Rev. Patrick Keegans told a congregation of several hundred
mourners that death is harsh and bitter ``even in normal
circumstances.''
   ``In these circumstances it is almost unbearable and
unbelievable,'' he said.
   There was no music, except for the unaccompanied singing of two
hymns, ``Abide With Me'' and ``The Lord is My Shepherd.'' Only two
sprays of white flowers adorned the church, although the hearse
carrying the girl's coffin was covered with bright floral bouquets
and wreaths.
   Keegans prayed not only for Joanne, but also for her parents Tom
and Kathleen who are missing and presumed dead.
   Her 14-year-old brother Stephen survived the disaster because he
was at a neighbor's garage repairing his sister's bicycle. An older
brother, David, 20, who was living away from home, returned for the
funeral.
   The Flannigans and all the others who died in Lockerbie lived on
Sherwood Crescent, where the jet's fuel-filled wings landed.
   Officials have said they believe some of the missing passengers
and townspeople might have been cremated in the fiery crash which
left a 30-foot-deep crater in the town.
   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Ambassador
Charles Price and Pan Am executives joined relatives of the dead and
other townspeople in the Dryfesdale Parish Church of the Church of
Scotland.
   No members of Britain's royal family attended the service,
prompting headlines of ``Where Were the Royals?'' in both The Sun
and the Daily Mirror, Britain's two largest circulation newspapers.
   ``Fury as Family Snubs Lockerbie Memorial,'' added The Sun.
   A Daily Express columnist, Jean Rook, wrote: ``At a time of
national mourning, we rightly and naturally turn to our queen for
the lead ... Broken-hearted Britain watching TV needed to see their
equally grieving monarch.''
   Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II does not attend
memorial services or funerals and that it was a personal decision
for other members of the royal family whether to attend. The queen
and others did send representatives to the service.
   After the Dryfesdale church's 700 seats were filled, others stood
outside in the rain-soaked graveyard listening to the prayers on
loudspeakers, and more than 1,000 watched the service on
closed-circuit television in other halls.
   The Right Rev. James Whyte, the moderator or leader of the Church
of Scotland, warned in his sermon against seeking revenge for the
bombing.
   ``Justice yes. Retaliation no,'' Whyte said. ``We may be tempted,
indeed urged by some, to flex our muscles in response, to show that
we are men.''
   ``To show that we are what? To show that we are prepared to let
more young and more innocent die, to let more rescue workers labor
in more wreckage to find the grisly proof, not of our virility, but
of our inhumanity. That is what retaliation means.''
   ``I, for one, will have none of it, and I hope you will not
either,'' Whyte said.
   Searchers have recovered 242 of the dead. As of Wednesday, 149
bodies had been identified _ three of Lockerbie residents _ and
released to relatives for burial.

<TEXT>
   Two Asian women and their two children
apparently drowned in the fast-moving Niagara River while trying to
enter the United States illegally in a rubber raft, federal
authorities said today.
   The four may have been provided with the boat by smugglers, said
Benedict Ferro, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Buffalo.
   ``These people didn't have a chance in the world,'' said Ronald
McNamee of the New York State parks police.
   The body of one of the women, an Asian in her 30s, was recovered
Tuesday afternoon in Youngstown, about 10 miles north of Niagara
Falls.
   The victim was believed to have been accompanied by another woman
and two children, ages 13 and 7, who were missing and presumed
drowned, officials said. Authorities searched the river and Lake
Ontario for the three today.
   McNamee said officials learned of the accident after a tipster
called and said four people he was supposed to meet in the United
States didn't show up.
   ``It's hazardous enough to try to cross the river then (in
summer),'' Ferro said. ``The water out there is cold and the strong
currents are unpredictable.''
   The temperature early Tuesday when the four are believed to have
started their trek was near zero.
   Ferro said all four were believed to be from Malaysia.
   ``We think this may be part of a major alien smuggling ring,'' he
said. Ferro said 11 people were caught trying to use rubber rafts to
cross the Niagara from Ontario to New York state last summer.
   The ring is believed to smuggle illegal aliens from Hong Kong to
Vancouver, and then through Toronto and St. Catharines into the
United States for $2,000 each, McNamee said.
   A purse, two suitcases and the raft were found by the Coast Guard
on Tuesday, McNamee said. The purse contained a Malaysian passport,
he said.

   A man who witnesses said wanted to make
freeway traffic move faster so one of his passengers could get to a
bathroom has been charged in the shooting death Dec. 3 of another
motorist.
   Darryl Ray Poole, 19, was held without bail today on charges of
murder and firing into an occupied vehicle in the slaying of
Lawrence Ellingsen, 53.
   An anonymous tip led to Poole's arrest Dec. 30, police said.
Police initially thought it was a random bullet that pierced the
rear window of Ellingsen's car and hit him in the head.
   Poole had four passengers in his car and was driving behind the
Ellingsen and his wife, Sherri, according to police.
   The passengers said he told them he was ``going to make traffic
speed up'' because one of them had to go to the bathroom, said Sgt.
Dan Voznik.
   Poole fired a single shot from a rifle but did nothing beforehand
to indicate to the Ellingsens that he wanted them to go faster,
Voznik said.
   Mrs. Ellingsen took control of the car and steered it to the side
of the road as her husband slumped over the wheel.
   ``To shoot at someone going 60 to 65 miles an hour because
someone had to go to the bathroom? I just can't imagine what kind of
people we're dealing with,'' she said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union soared to
an eight-year high in 1988, but the number of those opting to go to
Israel continued to decline, an agency which helps resettle them
said today.
   Regina Boucault, spokeswoman for the Geneva-based
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, said 3,510 December
arrivals at the Vienna transit center raised the 1988 total of
Jewish emigrants to 20,082.
   Only 114, or 3.2 percent of the December arrivals, said they
wanted to continue on to Israel, Ms. Boucault said. For all of 1988,
the share was 7.1 percent, she said.
   Between 1971 and 1978, more than three-fourths of all emigrants
settled in Israel. In the past three years, the share had been at
about one-fourth before taking a new plunge in 1988 when Israel had
to cope with growing economic problems and a Palestinian uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In 1987, 24.4 percent of the total of 8,011 chose to go to the
Jewish state. Emigration was at an all-time low in 1984 with only
904 Jews allowed to leave the Soviet Union. In 1980, 21,470
emigrated. In both years, the share of those going on to Israel was
one-third.
   The 1988 arrivals raised to 281,934 the number of Jewish
emigrants since the resettlement program began in 1971. The largest
official exodus, 51,328, was recorded in 1979, before the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.
   Most of the emigrants who do not opt for Israel go to the United
States via another transit camp in Rome, where they receive language
training and undergo other procedures prior to resettlement, Ms.
Boucault said. A small minority choose Australia, Canada and West
European countries as their future homes.

<TEXT>
   A cave-in nearly a half mile inside a
coal mine killed three miners in the nation's worst such accident in
2{ years, authorities said. A fourth miner escaped unharmed.
   The cave-in occurred as the men were removing coal about 2,400
feet into the mine near this southwest Kentucky city Wednesday
afternoon, said Willard Stanley, commissioner of the state
Department of Mines and Minerals.
   Rescue teams began digging toward the men within 20 minutes of
the collapse, said Ronnie McDowell, an instructor with the
department in Harlan.
   By midday today, the last of the bodies had been pulled from the
Cumberland Valley Contractors No. 2 mine. Killed were Steve
Bradburn, 36, of Harrogate, Tenn., Joe Ditty, 32, of Harlan, and
Tony Osborne, 31, of Tazwell, Tenn.
   Ditty was the brother of mine co-owner Stanley Ditty, Stanley
said.
   A fourth miner, Roger Wilder, 36, of Cubbage, escaped unharmed
after the collapse, Stanley said.
   ``The last time there was an accident in which more than one coal
miner was killed occurred'' July 9, 1986, near Waltonville, Ill.,
said Kathy Snyder, a spokeswoman for U.S. Mine Safety and Health
Administration in Arlington, Va.
   ``That was also a roof-fall accident in which three people were
killed.''
   Stanley said his department would begin an investigation Friday
on why the roof collapsed. The Mine Safety and Health Administration
also will send investigators, agency spokesman Sam Stafford said in
Washington.
   A dozen people work per shift, mining a 48-inch seam at the mine,
the agency said.
   The mine had no fatalities or serious injuries in 1988 and no
violations involving roof regulations, officials said.
   Kentucky reported only one roof-fall death last year, down from
15 in 1987. The number nationally declined to eight, down from 19
the year before.
   Officials attributed the improved safety record to greater
awareness by miners of the dangers of roof falls and to the
increased use of automated roof-support systems.

   The government spent $379,000 last year to
subsidize flights between Atlanta and Moultrie that averaged one
passenger.
   The Department of Transportation is trying to stop the subsidy to
Eastern Atlantis Express' service connecting the southern Georgia
city with Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   The flight, with two pilots, makes two trips each way, six days a
week, but sold just 1,301 tickets, at $79 one way, last year.
   David Howard, a vice president of the commuter airline, which is
affiliated with Eastern Airlines, said the route will be eliminated
if the subsidy ends.
   The airline is required by law to maintain the route in exchange
for the subsidy, a carryover from the days when the government
regulated domestic routes.

   A Saudi Arabian tanker caught in a storm
in the southern Persian Gulf was ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz
today with eight of its crewmen missing, shipping executives
reported.
   The executives identified the vessel as the 36,904-ton Saghera,
manned by a 34-member crew of Greek officers and Sri Lankan seamen.
   The Omani navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats but eight
remained unaccounted for, the executives said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors maritime traffic around the world, said the vessel caught
fire just outside Omani territorial waters before the bend of the
Hormuz, gateway to the gulf.
   Lloyd's said the vessel was reported to be abandoned and no
further details were available.
   The shipping executives said winds gusting to 35 mph caused waves
as high as 30 feet in the southern gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.
   It was not immediately known what started the fire aboard the
Sagheera or where the ship was headed.
   Lloyds said a two-mile oil slick had formed, indicating the
vessel may have been carrying a cargo of fuel.
   The shipping executives ruled out the possibility of an attack by
an Iranian speedboat, saying the weather was too bad for speedboats
to operate in the gulf.
   They said high seas had prevented patrol boats and salvage
vessels from approaching the Sagheera to put out the fire.
   The Sagheera is managed by Avin International Bunkers Supply SA,
based in Piraeus, Greece, LLoyd's said.
   On April 4, when the Iran-Iraq war was still raging, Iranian
gunboats attacked the Sagheera, setting it afire near the Strait of
Hormuz.
   On that occasion, the fire was put out and none of the crew was
injured. It was not known whether the same crew was still aboard the
tanker.
   The Strait of Hormuz was a major area for the so-called ``tanker
war,'' an offshoot of the Iran-Iraq war during which 546 commercial
vessels of different nationalities were attacked by either side.
   Iran and Iraq accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August.
   Earlier today, bad weather forced the Moajil-5, a small
Honduran-flagged freighter, to run aground after it broke anchor in
the rough seas, sources in the gulf and in London said. No
casualties were reported.
   A salvage tug, the Smit Sumatera, answered a distress call from
the 9,724-ton freighter as it drifted off Sharjah during the night.
But the tug could not get close enough to help and the Moajil-5
grounded on the jetty of Sharjah harbor, Lloyds said.
   The Moajil-5, one of several ships trapped in Iraq's gulf port of
Umm Qasr during the war, was formerly managed by the Kuwait-based
United Arab Shipping Co.

   Six former city Health Department employees and
three private consultants were convicted today of demanding payoffs
from restaurant owners to overlook health code inspections.
   The federal jury in Brooklyn deliberated over nine days following
six weeks of testimony, which included descriptions of roach- and
rodent-infested restaurants that were allowed to stay open in return
for payoffs to inspectors.
   Each defendant was convicted of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy and numerous counts of extortion. They face up to 20
years in prison on each racketeering count at sentencing later this
year.
   The defendants, who were among 46 people arrested in the scheme,
represented ``a small slice'' of the widespread, systemic corruption
uncovered at the city Department of Health, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Sean O'Shea.
   ``They didn't care about rats or mice in restaurants or about
people getting poisoned or filthy restaurants. They cared about
money,'' O'Shea told the jury.
   More than 40 restaurant owners or managers testified at the
trial. Victims of the extortion, authorities said, ranged from
delicatessens and fast-food restaurants to expensive Manhattan
eateries.
   Thirty-seven of the defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy
before the start of the trial Nov. 14, and about a dozen of them
testified for the prosecution.
   The inspectors kicked back a portion of the money to their
supervisors and used hand signals and special code words in asking
for payoffs, O'Shea said.
   The consultants, who were hired by restaurants to prepare for
inspections, were accused as acting as middlemen who passed payoffs
from restaurants to inspectors.
   Among those on trial was Lawrence DeWindt, a former senior
inspector who was accused of taking payments of $400 to $450 to keep
a restaurant's name off of a list of restaurants with violations
published in the local newspapers.
   The case was the result of a two-year undercover investigation by
the city Department of Investigation and the FBI.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet general today gave his country's first
acknowledgement that Libya may be able to manufacture chemical
weapons, but said they would be in quantities too small for waging
war.
   As recently as Wednesday night, state-run Radio Moscow rejected
as ``groundless'' U.S. charges that Libya has built a chemical
weapons plant south of Tripoli.
   A spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said news
of the confrontation Wednesday in which U.S. Navy jets shot down two
Libyan fighters above the Mediterranean was received with
``indignation'' in Moscow.
   Libya's ambassador to Rome linked the incident to U.S. charges
that his country had built a chemical weapons plant about 60 miles
southwest of Tripoli.
   In an interview last month, President Reagan said he could not
rule out a military strike on the plant, which Libya says makes
pharmaceuticals.
   U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday they believe the Libyan plant has already begun
production.
   Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, deputy chief of Soviet chemical
weapons troops, told reporters in Moscow today that ``Libya doesn't
have the industrial capacity to make toxic agents in sufficient
quantities to conduct warfare.
   ``But as far as a few kilograms of toxic agents goes, any serious
chemical laboratory in the world can make several kilos, say one to
five kilos (2.2 to 11 pounds), of toxic agents.''
   Kuntsevich spoke at a news briefing called to discuss a five-day
international conference on chemical weapons that begins Saturday in
Paris. Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans to use the meeting
to try to persuade more that 100 nations to impose sanctions on
countries that use poison gas.
   Asked if an attack on the Libyan plant at Rabta could pose a
danger to the more than 820,000 residents of Tripoli by releasing
toxic agents, Kuntsevich said, ``As far as I know, this is a
pharmaceutical plant. If there is an attack, there would be much
physical destruction.''
   ``If they use chemical substances, there would be some harm to
the local population,'' the two-star general added. ``But as far as
I know, this is not a large plant, and so there would be no danger
for residents of the capital.''
   The Tass news agency quoted Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov as saying: ``News that Washington's anti-Libyan
campaign had produced an armed clash over the Mediterranean, as a
result of which two Libyan planes were brought down, has been
received with indignation in Moscow.''
   It said Gerasimov called U.S. actions ``a show of political
adventurism and state terrorism.''
   Gerasimov said the Soviet Union was not asked to help Libya and
did not increase its state of military readiness.
   Kuntsevich said Soviet Chemical Weapons Forces, which the
Pentagon says number between 45,000 and 60,000 troops, do not send
advisers to other countries, and thus have none in Libya.
   In 1987, the Soviet Union acknowledged for the first time that it
possesses chemical weapons, and said its stocks of toxic agents do
not exceed 50,000 tons. Western military specialists estimate Soviet
chemical weapons stocks at between 300,000 and 700,000 tons, figures
Kuntsevich called ``a myth.''
   Nikita Smidovich, a Foreign Ministry official, told the briefing
his country will propose in Paris that U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar be empowered to conduct an investigation as soon as
information about the use of chemical weapons is received.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol under review in Paris bans the use of
chemical weapons, but does not outlaw their production, and has no
enforcement mechanism.
   Smidovich indicated the Kremlin will resist any attempt to
transform the Paris meeting into a forum to condemn Libya or any
other single nation.
   The Soviets are seeking an agreement that calls for all nations,
including the superpowers, to liquidate chemical weapons stocks over
a 10-year period.
   The United States ceased manufacture of such weapons in 1969, but
resumed 17 years later on the grounds the Soviets and other
potential adversaries have chemical weapons stocks.

<HEAD>NTSB Blames Shooting for Airliner Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled
officially today that the 1987 crash of a Pacific Southwest Airlines
jet was caused by an attack by a gun-wielding passenger.
   PSA Flight 1771 crashed Dec. 7, l987 about l75 miles northwest of
Los Angeles, killing all 43 people aboard, including a former USAir
employee who had opened fire with a revolver in a revenge attack
aimed at a former supervisor who also was on board.
   Authorities within weeks of the crash disclosed that the former
airline employee, David Burke, had smuggled a .44-caliber Magnum
revolver through a security checkpoint at Los Angeles International
Airport when boarding the flight to San Francisco.
   A cockpit recorder tape from the plane included gunshots in or
near the cockpit, according to the NTSB. The board said in a brief
summary of findings that the tape revealed ``the sounds of a scuffle
and several shots which were apparently fired in or near the
cockpit.''
   It has been presumed that both the pilot and co-pilot likely were
shot.
   According to the NTSB findings, the official probable cause for
the accident were ``interference'' and ``intentional sabotage'' by
an emotionally distraught passenger.
   The safety board cited as contributing factors inadequate
security and inadequate operatoring procedures by the airline that
permitted Burke to bypass security at the Los Angeles airport
because of his previous employment.
   The accident prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to
order a tightening of security measures taken at passenger
checkpoints so that there is a closer scrutiny of airline and
airport employees.
   In an action that grew out of the PSA accident, the FAA on
Wednesday announced a final regulation aimed at tightening access to
restricted areas of an airport by the use of computerized
identification badges. Such badges would make an ID card ineffective
if it is reported stolen or if a person leaves employment without
returning the badge.
   Investigators have said Burke was believed to have still had his
USAir identification badge at the time he boarded Flight 1771.
   According to the PSA investigation, it is believed Burke was able
to avoid detection of his revolver because he bypassed normal
passenger security checks after being recognized as a former airline
employee. PSA was a subsidiary of USAir Corp. at the time of the
accident and since has merged completely into USAir.
   The NTSB confirmed previous reports that Burke had left a
``goodbye'' message with friends and boarded Flight 1771 with the
intention of killing his former supervisor at USAir. The board said
a note written by Burke and found in the wreckage threatened the
supervisor.
   The revolver and six expended rounds were also found in the
wreckage, the board said.

<TEXT>
   The United States today accused Libya of lying
to the world community and said it had photographic evidence that
the two MiG jet fighters shot down Wednesday were armed and
approaching Navy jets with hostile intent.
   A Navy intelligence review of videotape shot by one of the F-14
Tomcat jets ``tells me that the Libyan ambassador to the U.N. is a
liar. That's the first thing it tells me,'' said Dan Howard, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``They've gone out yesterday and said repeatedly that those were
unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. Well, we have the pictures now that
they were not unarmed aircraft,'' Howard told a news briefing.
   ``They were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile intent.
We believe that our aircraft commanders behaved in a prudent manner
in defending themselves, in defending their aircraft and in
defending their ship,'' he said.
   Howard said one of the Navy jets' two-man air crews had been
flown to Washington overnight and brought the video footage shot by
the jet's target camera.
   Debriefing of the two officers and a review of the video footage
shows the MiG-23 Flogger aircraft ignored evasive maneuvers by the
Navy jets five times and kept turning toward the Americans, Howard
said.
   Even after the lead F-14 had fired two Sparrow missiles, the two
MiGs did not break off their approach, he said, but turned and tried
to jump on the second F-14, the spokesman said.
   The first two Sparrows apparently did not strike their target.
But a third Sparrow fired by the second F-14 claimed one of the
MiGs, and the lead F-14 pounced on the rear of the other MiG and
downed it with a heat-seeking Sidewinder missile, Howard said.
   By the time the confrontation was over, the planes had come as
close as 1.5 miles of each other, he said.
   The American pilots did not have any indication that the Libyans
had turned on their attack radars, he said. But intercepted radio
communications show the Libyans had some type of radar on their
planes operating and searching for the F-14s, Howard said.
   Given the manner in which the Libyans were flying, the American
pilots did not need evidence of a radar ``lock-on'' to know that
they were in danger, Howard added.
   In offering other details on the confrontation, Howard said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Wednesday's confrontation was ``peculiar'' in several respects,
not the least being that the two Libyan fighters did not report back
to their ground controllers that the American jets had ``locked on''
them with their own radars at a range of 72 miles.
   That is a normal procedure used by Navy pilots to warn away other
planes. Always in the past, Howard said, when a Libyan pilot knew he
was locked on, he would report that and then be directed to return
home. The closest previous approach by a Libyan fighter was 30 miles.
   _No effort was made by the Americans to communicate by radio with
the Libyans. The F-14s did not have compatible radio equipment, and
the E-2C radar sentry plane that was also airborne did not try.
There was not enough time to make such an attempt, and such tries at
radio communication are not standard procedure when dealing with
Libya.
   From takeoff to shoot down, the entire incident lasted only eight
minutes, Howard said.
   ``Frankly, we're still scratching our heads as to why Libya did
this,'' he said.
   _The Pentagon has not ordered any special alert status for its
forces around the world. The aircraft carrier Kennedy, from which
the F-14s flew, is now long out of range of Libya and proceeding
toward a port call.
   _The Pentagon still has no information on the fate of the two
Libyan pilots. Two parachutes were spotted, as was a Libyan
search-and-rescue helicopter, but there is no confirmation as yet
that the two Libyans were fished from the water.

   Two emergency blood transfusions failed to raise
Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure today, leading to fears that
prolonged internal bleeding may have sapped the ailing monarch's
strength, officials said.
   The 87-year-old emperor was administered 1.72 pints of blood in
two transfusions during the day, but his systolic blood pressure
remained at 74 by evening, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji
Maeda said.
   An average systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading is about
120. Low pressure for sustained periods can lead to permanent damage
of the brain and internal organs.
   The emperor's blood pressure dropped suddenly early today, and he
was immediately given the first transfusion. Maeda said the second
came in the late afternoon.
   The low blood pressure indicates Hirohito continues to lose blood
internally, and although no discharges were reported today.
   Doctors fear the emperor is weakening and are focusing their
efforts on lifting his blood pressure, the official said.
Previously, doctors concentrated on averting large blood losses, but
now ``the emperor might not have enough energy to discharge a large
amount of blood,'' he added.
   Transfusions have been a major treatment since the emperor fell
ill in mid-September, and as of this evening he has received 67.83
pints of blood.
   Failure of transfusions to raise the emperor's blood pressure
could prove ``critical and fatal,'' according to a surgeon at a
private hospital who requested he not be further identified.
   Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has discharged
blood intermittently since Sept. 19. Doctors believe the
hemorrhaging originates in the upper intestinal region, where
Hirohito underwent bypass surgery in September 1987.
   In another development today, police arrested a 25-year-old
rightist armed with a knife as he tried to hand the mayor of
Nagasaki a note protesting his recent comments about the emperor.
   Masato Saito, a member of a rightist organization ``Thunder
Academy,'' tried to hand a note to Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima saying:
``The slander against the emperor violates the constitution and
Motoshima should resign from his post immediately,'' an official of
the Nagasaki municipal police said.
   Motoshima said at a municipal assembly meeting last month that
Hirohito bore responsibility for World War II, triggering a storm of
criticism among right-wing supporters of the ailing monarch.

<TEXT>
   Charges have been dismissed against a blind
man accused of assaulting two police officers during a late-night
walk.
   Municipal Judge Gary P. Ryan on Wednesday granted the
prosecutor's request to dismiss the charges against 27-year-old
Daniel Serrano, saying, ``How can Mr. Serrano assault someone if he
is blind?''
   Serrano spent 16 days in jail before being released last month.
He was charged with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest, both
misdemeanors, after he and a friend were confronted by four officers
on a street Nov. 23.
   The friend, Roy DeHerrera, 26, was wanted on a traffic warrant.
   Serrano, a student the Braille Institute in Anaheim, contended
that police attacked him and DeHerrera without warning. He said he
was knocked to the ground and bitten by a police dog.
   Police said DeHerrera attacked one of the uniformed officers and
Serrano joined in, jumping on one officer's back and throwing
punches at another.
   Deputy District Attorney Sandy Mitchell said the last-minute
request to dismiss charges was based on an ophthalmologist's
verifying that Serrano lost his vision two years ago when he
suffered a gunshot wound.
   Prosecutors also discovered police didn't identify themselves to
the blind man.
   DeHerrera still faces assault charges. His trial began Wednesday.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Granting Custody of Children To Man Who Killed
Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELGIN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Appellate Court has allowed a man
who strangled his wife in front of their two daughters to retain
custody of the children.
   No law or prior case supported overruling a lower-court decision
granting custody to James Lutgen, 34, of East Dubuque, the
three-judge panel said in a decision issued last week.
   ``I'm glad to have my children home for good now,'' Lutgen said
of his daughters, Tracy, 12, and Dana, 10. ``I know that I'm a good
parent.''
   ``Just because somebody does something wrong'' doesn't mean he
should lose custody of his children permanently, he said.
   Lutgen pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the 1984 death of his
26-year-old wife, Carol, and was released in 1986 after serving 13
months of a four-year sentence.
   The sisters witnessed the fight between their parents that
resulted in Mrs. Lutgen's death.
   The appeals court ruled that except for his wife's death, Lutgen
had ``an unblemished record.''
   The victim's brother, Gene Tranel of Eldridge, Iowa, had sought
to prevent the girls from being turned over to their father. Tranel
took them in when Lutgen was arrested.
   Tranel said he is not sure if can afford to appeal the case to
the Illinois Supreme Court.
   ``The court system and now even the appellate system has failed
to protect battered women and innocent victims,'' Tranel said. ``It
appears the courts are not willing to deal with domestic violence.''

   The former director of a food company
who is on trial for issuing promissory notes worth about $1 billion
has gone on a hunger strike to demand his release, it was reported
Thursday.
   Fikret Abdic of Agrokomerc, the food-processing giant that in

letter to the daily newspaper Borba that he will fast until the
``illegal persecution'' of those implicated in the affair is stopped.
   Abdic, who has been jailed in the town of Bihac since September
1987, has denied the charges he plotted to defraud Yugoslav banks
and other financial institutions to obtain investment capital needed
to expand Agrokomerc.
   His requests to be released have been rejected by the authorities.
   Several of Abdic's co-defendents, who have been standing trial
with him for the past four months, were released from prison during
the New Year's holiday, said the daily newspaper Politika.

<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old girl who wanted to see her
grandmother in London got on an airport bus, toddled through Israeli
security and passport checks, and boarded a Europe-bound flight
before being discovered, her father said.
   Graham Hodson confirmed newspaper accounts published Thursday
about the adventure by his daughter, Candy, 10 days ago at the Uvda
Air Force base, which is used for tourist flights between Europe and
the Red Sea resort of Eilat.
   ``We were quite surprised, but not that surprised, because she's
done these kind of things before. She's really quite independent,''
said Hodson, a guitarist from Liverpool, England.
   Candy slipped away from her father in the lobby of a large hotel
where Hodson's rock group ``Shazam'' has been playing.
   She boarded a charter bus with a group of departing tourists, and
the English-language Jerusalem Post said she did not attract
attention because she was one of many blond children.
   ``Apparently she was befriended by a woman on the bus who gave
her some chewing gum. Everybody stuffed her with sweets,'' Hodson
said.
   At the airport, ``she got by all the security checks, because we
travel a lot and she's familiar with airports, and she finds it a
lot of fun,'' he said.
   Candy wound up on a charter flight bound for Copenhagen, Denmark.
Her presence was discovered only after the plane was readying for
takeoff.
   ``There was a passenger screaming to get on the plane, and they
started checking whether there was someone aboard without a
ticket,'' Hodson said.
   Candy said nothing. She was seated between two strangers and each
thought she belonged to the other. The Jerusalem Post said she was
picked up and taken from passenger to passenger. No one claimed her.
   ``They took her off the plane crying,'' Hodson said.
   Candy was asleep by the time a taxi brought her back to the hotel
five hours after she disappeared.
   The next morning ``she mumbled to us that she (had) wanted to
visit her grandmother. We told her off, but we couldn't really
discipline her,'' Hodson said, adding he and his wife searched the
resort grounds and a nearby beach for three hours before airport
security officials called the hotel.
   After initially being upset by lax security, Hodson decided to
take the incident with a sense of humor.
   It wasn't her first sign of wanderlust. When she was two, Candy,
wandered without clothes about a mile away from her home in Tenerife
in the Canary Islands.
   ``She reached the supermarket. She took a baby bottle with
chocolate and a bag of crisps (potato chips). She's getting to be
famous for her independence,'' said Hodson.

   A passenger threw a hand grenade into a crowded
railway car in southwest China on Thursday and injured 23 people,
the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Three of the injured were in serious condition, it said. The door
of the car was blown off and a hole was blasted in the floor.
   Police detained two brothers from Hekou, Yunnan province, for
questioning but did not charge either immediately, Xinhua said. It
said the grenade apparently was thrown deliberately, but the reason
was not known.
   The explosion took place aboard the No. 366 train traveling from
Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, to Chongqing in Sichuan
province, it said. The train had just left Shimenkan station in
Sichuan's Qijiang County.
   The wounded were taken from the train at the next station, and
the train continued on to its destination, Xinhua said.
   The state-run railway system has slightly increased its security
since January 1988, when a flammable liquid carried on a train in
violation of regulations caused a fire that killed 34 people.
   Rail employees conduct spot checks of luggage for explosives and
flammable materials, but most passengers are not checked.

   British Rail will pay about $18,000 in immediate
compensation to relatives of the 34 people killed in last month's
Clapham rail crash, officials said Thursday.
   The sum would be given in advance of consideration for other
possible compensation awards following the Dec. 12 disaster, said a
spokesman for the state-run rail service.
   ``In many cases, this payment for bereavement will be only part
of the overall compensation paid,'' said the spokesman.
   British Rail also offered families $3,600 in hardship
compensation immediately following the triple-train crash in south
London.
   The morning rush-hour crash injured more than 100 people and
killed 33 others outright. Another victim died later of injuries.
   British Rail said that improperly installed signal equipment
during a modernization of signals probably caused the accident, but
is still investigating.

   Attorney General Cary Edwards resigned today
to consider whether to seek the Republican nomination for governor.
   Edwards, 44, said that he will announce later this month or in
early February whether he will run but that ``every single indicator

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced
today he had approved a recommendation to close dozens of military
bases across the country, calling the action ``long overdue.''
   Carlucci declared at a Pentagon briefing, ``The department has
wanted to close bases for many years. ... I would like to reiterate
that this is a unique opportunity to make significant changes to
(the department's) base structure which will not only save taxpayer
dollars but also improve our nation's defense.''
   He said he would ask Congress for $500 million in the fiscal 1990
budget and another $500 million in the 1991 budget to help cover
expenses of closing military bases.
   Carlucci also said he would like to see even more bases closed
but wasn't about to tamper with the political compromise that
produced the current closing list. He added that the Defense
Department might be able to close some of the bases even more
quickly than envisioned by the special commission that prepared the
list.
   ``Base closings are long overdue,'' Carlucci said.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told reporters that he and the other leaders of the armed services
supported the closures.
   ``It is our view as a body that this action would not adversely
affect military operations or the ability to carry out the national
military strategy,'' Crowe said.
   Carlucci's decision, which was expected, sets the stage for one
final debate on the matter on Capitol Hill.
   Under a law passed last year, a special government commission was
given the authority to review all military facilities and to prepare
a hit list of those considered obsolete or unnecessary.
   Now that Carlucci has endorsed the panel's recommendations,
Congress must either accept or reject the list of bases proposed for
closure in its entirety. It cannot pick and choose or bargain over
the fate of individual bases on the list.
   The commission _ known formally as the Base Realignment and
Closure Commission _ has recommended that 34 military installations
and 52 military housing complexes be closed; that five other
installations be partially closed, and that 54 others get new
missions or additional personnel.
   All told, the panel has estimated the actions would save $693
million a year.

<HEAD>African Students Reportedly Confess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three African students held by police in
connection with a brawl that triggered racial unrest in four cities
have admitted they broke the law, an official report said Thursday.
   One of the three remained under arrest in the eastern city of
Nanking, apparently facing trial, while two others were being
punished with 15 days of ``disciplinary detention,'' the Xinhua News
Agency said.
   A fourth African was released and returned to his school Thursday
night, the report said.
   In related developments, about 45 African students held 10 days
at a guesthouse following the brawl returned to their university in
Nanking on Thursday.
   In Hangzhou, about 150 miles to the southeast, African students
ended a 10-day class boycott after their college's president agreed
to give them a direct telephone line and write an open letter saying
none had AIDS.
   One African country warned it might recall its students because
of the treatment of African students.
   Besides Hangzhou and Nanking, racial incidents have occurred in
Beijing and Wuhan, an industrial city in central China.
   The incidents began Dec. 24 in Nanking, when African students
refused to register their Chinese girlfriends to attend a dance at
Hehai University. The disagreement led to a fight and nearly a week
of anti-African protests by Chinese youths.
   Xinhua said Alex Dosoo of Ghana beat and seriously hurt a
university worker during the brawl. He was the only African to be
arrested.
   The news agency said Alpha Robinson of Gambia and Dossoumou Boni
Lodovic of Benin ``tried to stir up trouble'' during the fight and
were being given 15 days detention under China's public order
regulations. All three admitted they broke the law, it said without
elaborating.
   The four were among about 140 students, most from Africa, who
tried to flee to Beijing in the face of the Chinese protests but
were taken by police to a guest house outside Nanking and held
incommunicado.
   The four were taken into custody Saturday at the guest house by
about 400 police who, according to fellow students and African
diplomats, used electric cattle prods and wooden clubs. Chinese
officials deny any violence was used.
   Police brought most of the other students back to Nanking but 45
remained at the guest house until Thursday, when they returned to
school voluntarily in order to meet with a group of African
diplomats.
   Hehai students said Thursday that hundreds more paramilitary
police had flooded the guest house Sunday.
   ``Police were everywhere, in the building, in the corridors, on
the landings, in the lounges and on some balconies,'' said Carl
Ameho of Ghana.
   He said students were prohibited from making telephone calls and
could only go outside to walk to the dining hall.
   ``It was a real jail,'' Ameho said.
   Some students said that on their first day back at Hehai
University, Chinese students yelled: ``Black devil, you've
returned!'' and ``Black devil, get lost!''
   ``We are still very scared here,'' said a student from Gambia.
``Today I rode outside the university and came home quickly because
so many people were calling me a `black devil,''' he said.
   Ameho said Liang Ruiju, Hehai's president, met with African
students and told them that under the university's new regulations,
Africans must introduce their Chinese girlfriends to university
officials.
   Chinese women can lose their jobs or be subjected to ridicule if
they openly have relationships with foreign men.
   In Hangzhou, a conflict at Zhejiang Agricultural College was
resolved with authorities making concessions to the African students
for the first time.
   African students said the trouble in Hangzhou began when Chinese
telephone operators told Chinese callers that all the Africans had
AIDS. The university has denied the allegation.
   In Beijing on Thursday, African students at the Beijing Languages
Institute continued a class boycott triggered by Chinese allegations
that a black student accosted a Chinese woman in her room.
   In Wuhan, the Hubei province foreign affairs office acknowledged
that Chinese students threw rocks at foreign student dormitories
last week. It said a Sri Lankan student at Central China
Polytechnical College was injured by glass from a broken window Dec.
29.
   In Ghana, the state-run radio station reported that the
government may recall the 26 Ghanian students soudying in China.
   Diplomats from Ghana and Benin said China's handling of the
incidents could damage Sino-African ties.
   ``The way this is going this could lead to something very
nasty,'' said a diplomat from Benin.
   China denies all charges of racial prejudice, and expresses pride
at its long-established policy of showing solidarity with the Third
World by giving scholarships to African students. There are about
1,500 African students from 40 nations now in China.
   Africans complain that they are subject to racial discrimination,
and social contacts between African men and Chinese women are a
frequent source of tension.
   Chinese also resent the fact that Africans, many from countries
as poor as China, receive far better food and lodging than Chinese
students.

   A woman drowned her oldest daughter in a
bathtub, shot her three other children to death, then killed
herself, authorities said.
   ``I've been in law enforcement for 19 years and this is the most
gruesome thing I have ever seen,'' Sheriff Robert Nall said after
Wednesday's grim events in this tiny town near the Missouri border.
   The bodies were discovered when the father, Greg Epker, returned
home from work at a sign company in nearby Quincy, authorities said.
   Epker, 32, found that his oldest daughter, 8-year-old Casey, had
been drowned; that daughters Shannon, 5, and Mandy, 2, and his son,
Lance, 1, had been shot, and that his wife, Sheila, 27, had shot
herself, Nall said.
   Epker was being treated for shock at St. Mary's Hospital in
Quincy, Nall said.
   The killings apparently occurred Wednesday afternon, Nall said.
All but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle, he said.
   ``At this point, we have found no motive,'' Nall said. ``It was a
spontaneous event, and we don't know what happened. We may never
know, exactly.'' The sheriff said Epker is ``completely mystified''
as well.
   Mrs. Epker apparently first tried to strangle her oldest daughter
before drowning the child, Nall said.
   Authorities believe the woman then took her other children into
the kitchen, where she laid out pillows and blankets and turned on a
gas stove in an attempt to asphyxiate the family.
   ``We believe that because that didn't work quickly enough,
because of despair, she took them into the living room, one by one,
and shot them'' with a handgun their father kept on a closet shelf
out of their reach, Nall said.
   Mendon, with a population of nearly 1,000, is nearly 140 miles
northwest of St. Louis.
   ``We've got a grocery, a gas station, a bank and variety store _
that's pretty much Mendon, except for one oil company that services
the local area,'' said Mayor Gene Rogers.
   ``It's just a small town, where everything's based on agriculture
and everybody pretty much knows everybody else.''
   ``You just can't imagine anyone doing anything like that,'' said
Ron Durk, who owns the town's bowling alley and lives a few yards
from the Epkers. ``Something had to snap.
   ``We didn't know them too much,'' Durk said. ``We'd just see her
out there in the yard with the kids in the summertime. ... Something
like this is unbelievable.''
   Neighbors said the family had lived in Mendon for about seven
years.
   ``They were sweet little children,'' said Durk's wife, Doris. ``I
used to see the little girls out in the yard, and they would wave at
me.''

   The Northeast Louisiana University vice
president for business affairs hasn't let a broken back spoil his
record of 35 years without missing work because of illness.
   Robert Robinson moved his bed into the financial affairs office
at the university, where he can follow doctor's orders to remain
flat on his back until the fracture heals.
   ``He told me to stay in bed, but he didn't say where,'' said
Robinson.
   Robinson broke his back during the Christmas holidays. While he
was doing carpentry work, a scaffold collapsed, dropping him 12 feet
to the ground. The fall caused a compression fracture of the second
lumbar vertebra, one of the bones in the spinal column.

   Skating on Houston streets can be expensive: It
cost one Urban Animals club member $50 in fines, and officials said
more busts of skateboarders and roller skaters are planned.
   ``It's a dumb law,'' said Alex Siegel, foreman of the Municipal
Court jury that on Wednesday convicted Kenneth William Hessler for
illegal skating. ``We found him guilty because that's what the law
says.''
   The maximum fine for skating on city streets is $200 under a
20-year-old ordinance.
   ``I think our police officers have more important things to do
than enforce this law,'' said Councilman Dale Gorczynski. ``I'd
rather see them busting crack houses.''
   But city officials say this was the first in what is expected to
be a flurry of such trials, including another one for Hessler for
allegedly skating in the street on Halloween.
   Most defendants are part of a loose-knit group called the Urban
Animals, who have skated on downtown streets since 1978.
   John McKay, owner of the Montrose Skate Shop and a member of the
Urban Animals, said the group will continue skating downtown and
hopes any future confrontations will help result in a change in the
ordinance. The group skates mostly downtown, but it is illegal to
skate on streets any place in the city.
   Hundreds of the skaters petitioned City Council in 1987 to let
them ride on streets similar to bicyclists. Council, however, said
skaters pose a threat to themselves on the streets.

   When a traveling salesman parked his camper
at a restaurant overnight, he had no idea it would keep police up
all night worrying it was filled with explosives.
   Police got a call Tuesday night from someone who said the camper
``had enough explosives to blow away a whole city block,'' Police
Chief Dick Roe said. ``This is small-town America. We don't get
calls like that here.''
   The parking lot was emptied and blocked off. Two airmen from
Grissom Air Force Base arrived with a dog trained to sniff for
explosives. State police, Carroll County sheriff's deputies and the
Porter County Sheriff's Department bomb squad also arrived to help.
   Donald Wright of Traverse City, Mich., had gotten approval from
an assistant manager at the Hardee's restaurant to leave the
Airstream camper overnight and then drove his truck into Lafayette
to visit friends.
   As the dog tried to get a scent for explosives, police finally
tracked Wright through his home to his friends in Lafayette. He
returned to Hardee's about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``I couldn't believe it. The only thing I could think of was that
it must be some misidentification. I fully expected to see my
trailer blown apart, the way the Traverse police described it to
me,'' he said.
   ``When I got here, someone told me the police had thought about
drilling a hole to unlock it. I started to give my keys to the
police, but they said, `No, you do it.'''
   The bomb hoax canceled breakfast at Hardee's. Usually open at
5:30 a.m., the restaurant didn't serve its first customer until 10
a.m. Wednesday.
   ``We don't have any suspects,'' Roe said.

   The government announced Thursday it
will restrict the sales of riot guns, sawed-off shotguns and other
modified guns it said are ``too dangerous, too widely sold and cause
too many deaths.''
   A decree to be published Friday will submit the sales of these
weapons to a police authorization.
   Another decree, also to be published Friday, will make it
compulsory for people who already own these weapons to register them
with police before May 1.
   Penalties for ignoring the restrictions will range from one month
to one year jail or a fine from about $162 to $8,100.
   Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet, while announcing the new
regulations, said they would not solve all problems, but he said he
would propose to the government very soon an additional restriction
in the arms trade.
   A spokeswoman for Wathelet said this would apply to .22-caliber
rifles, sports guns held responsible for many deadly accidents.
   So far, only the sales and possession of war guns and handguns
were restricted in Belgium. When all regulations will have been
changed, only the sales of shotguns will be left unrestricted.

<HEAD>Libya Turns Back Nearly 30 Journalists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 30 journalists who flew to Libya
after U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the
Mediterranean Sea were detained at Tripoli airport today, then sent
back to Rome.
   Earlier today, residents fleeing Tripoli reportedly jammed gas
stations and troops fortified the home of Col. Moammar Gadhafi after
his government claimed the downing of the Libyan jets on Wednesday
was a prelude to a major attack.
   U.S. officials said two armed Libyan jets were downed after they
approached two Navy fighters with hostile intent. The Libyans said
its planes were unarmed and on a reconnaissance flight when they
were fired upon for no reason.
   At least one of reporters turned back at Tripoli airport today
had been invited to Libya by a government official.
   The journalists, who arrived from Rome, spent about 1{ hours
inside the airport terminal before being put back on the flight.
   The regularly scheduled Alitalia flight carried about 30
journalists, mostly Europeans, and other passengers, including
businessmen and Libyan citizens. The flight left Rome at 12:05 p.m.,
two hours behind schedule, and landed in Tripoli at 1:45 p.m.
   Libyan officials gathered the passports of all the journalists
and led them into a room in the arrival area.
   About 15 or 20 minutes later, the journalists were told they were
being sent back to Rome and they were asked to present their baggage
checks so their luggage could be identified and put back on the
flight.
   One Libyan in civilian clothes who wouldn't identify himself said
repeatedly in Italian, ``If you don't have a visa, you can't stay.
You must go back to Rome.''
   The only reporter allowed in was a correspondent for the Italian
news agency ANSA. The agency has an arrangement with Libya which
allows its correspondent to enter the country whenever he wants, and
the reporter visits Libya several times a year.
   Libya officially requires a visa from Americans and Western
Europeans, but sometimes journalists have been allowed in without
visas, including an Associated Press reporter in April 1988.
   On Wednesday, the Associated Press office in Rome received a
telex from Ali Maria, the head of the Information Ministry division
which deals with foreign press, telling the news agency its reporter
was welcome to come to Libya.
   The AP reporter showed the telex, written in English, to at least
half a dozen Libyans in civilian clothes at the airport but to no
avail.
   One official agreed to telephone Ali Maria, but the man came back
a short time later and said, ``There's nothing to be done.''
   Alitalia officials and Libyans ordered the journalists to get
back on the plane, but the reporters protested for about 45 minutes.
   Finally, with the help of two unarmed Libyans in army fatigues,
the journalists were led back onto the plane. An Italian newspaper
reporter, who has been to Libya before and was particularly
insistent about entering the country, was pushed by Libyan airport
officials.
   The plane returned to Rome and landed at about 5 p.m.
   An aide to Ali Maria, contacted by phone from Rome at the
ministry office, said, ``We have stopped letting in journalists. We
have 200 journalists now.''
   He indicated that they, too, would be sent back soon.
   A spokesman for the Libyan Embassy in Rome, asked about the
journalists being turned back, said the embassy received a telex
today from Ali Maria saying not to issue any more visas. The telex,
according to the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
said that Libya would not let in any more journalists because ``all
the hotels are full.''

   President Reagan's commerce secretary and the
Soviet ambassador spoke glowingly of cooperation between the two
nations Thursday as honors were handed out to people who helped in
the whale rescue off the coast of Alaska last October.
   Those honored with ``Operation Breakthrough'' plaques and hats
included businesses and government bodies that provided equipment
and assistance, and the officers and crews of two Soviet icebreakers
that helped clear a path to open water.
   ``The most important thing that came out of this whole event was
what can happen when the Soviet Union and the United States
cooperate together to make something happen,'' said Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity.
   Accepting plaques on behalf of the Soviet icebreakers was
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who called the rescue effort ``an
extraordinary event of the year.''
   ``It was the easiest Soviet-American negotiations because from
both sides, immediately it was `yes' to organizing this
cooperation,'' Dubinin said. ``Now we can see that ... this type of
icebreaker diplomacy is useful for all relationships between the
Soviet Union and the United States and for the whole world.''
   One of the three trapped gray whales died, but after nearly two
weeks of rescue efforts, two others apparently swam free of the ice
on Oct. 28. The rescue was coordinated by the Commerce Department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Those honored by the department were: ARCO Alaska Inc.,
Anchorage; North Slope Borough; North Slope Borough Search and
Rescue; Barrow Whaling Captains' Association; OMARK Industries,
Portland, Ore.; Kasco De-Icing Systems, Lakeland, Minn.; Standard
Alaska Production Co., Anchorage; Alaska National Guard; VECO Corp.,
Anchorage; MARK AIR, Anchorage; Navy-NOAA Joint Ice Center; U.S.
Coast Guard; Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; the state of Alaska;
Greenpeace and the crews of the two Soviet icebreakers, the Admiral
Makarov and the Vladimir Arseniev.

<HEAD>Church Raises Issue of Rehabilitating Believers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russian Orthodox Church, for decades
subservient to a hostile Soviet government, said on the eve of its
Christmas celebration Thursday it is seeking rehabilitation of
priests and lay believers persecuted since the Bolshevik Revolution.
   Church officials told the official news agency Tass that they had
decided to form a commission to gather material on persecuted
believers.
   The action signaled another cautious move by church leaders to
take advantage of the freer atmosphere presented by the reforms of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who met in April 1988 with Patriarch
Pimen to ask the church's support for his reforms and promise legal
changes reflecting a new attitude toward religion.
   Orthodox Christians mark Christmas on Jan. 7, but religious
celebrations begin on Christmas Eve and last through the night.
   A commission of the Communist Party Politburo is reviewing cases
of Soviet citizens who were killed or imprisoned under Josef Stalin,
and secular scholars and artists are leading an effort to build a
monument to Stalin's millions of victims.
   But the Tass announcement said the church's Holy Synod, or ruling
council ``has raised the issue of rehabilitating clergy and laymen
repressed after the 1917 revolution, and decided to form a special
commission to study related material.''
   That takes the church's review back to the rule of Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin, who unlike Stalin still is regarded in the Soviet
Union with near-religious reverence.
   It was in the first years of the revolution, prior to the advent
of Stalin's rule in 1924 that some of the most severe repression
against the church took place.
   Writer Vladimir Soloukhin, in a letter published in the December
issue of the monthly Nash Sovremenik said the number of priests
dropped from 360,000 before the revolution to 40,000 at the end of
1919, two years later.
   Most of the 54,000 churches that existed before the revolution
were torn down or coverted into warehouses, factories or turned to
other uses.
   Tass said the question of rehabilitation had been discussed by
the Holy Synod on Nov. 30 and Dec. 27. It said the commission would
begin its work immediately after being formally approved at the next
Synod meeting. It did not say when that would be.
   It said the Russian Orthodox Church was inviting anyone with
material that should be considered to send it to church headquarters
in Moscow.
   Stalin had thousands of the remaining priests shot or sent to
labor camps or exile and in 1929 imposed strict laws that requires
all religious groups be registered by the government, and prohibits
religious organizations from educating the young or conducting
charitable activities.
   Religious dissidents have demanded the Russian Orthodox Church
recognize the injustice of the purges and canonize some of those
killed in purges after the revolution. But a list of new saints
approved by the church for festivities marking its 1,000th
anniversary, which was celebrated in June, refrained from that.
   Neither the church nor the government releases figures on the
number of Russian Orthdox believers among the more than 280 million
people in the Soviet Union, but the figure is believed to be in the
tens of millions.
   For more than a year Gorbachev, whose mother is reported to be a
regular church-goer, and Soviet officials have been promising a new
law on ``freedom of conscience'' that they say will ease many of the
restrictions on religious activity. Russian Orthodox Church
officials say they are helping prepare the law, tacitly
acknowledging they consider many of the restrictions unfair.
   In recent months, officials have been allowing religious
organizations to conduct some minor charity work. Sisters of Nobel
Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity were
permitted to come to the Soviet Union to care for those injured in
the Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake.
   The weekly Moscow News reported in its latest edition released
Thursday that Seventh Day Adventists were helping repair a school in
the village of Zaoksky, south of Moscow.

   The Soviet ambassador said today that
Moscow had warned the United States to show restraint and ``not to
raise the tension'' with Libya before U.S. jet fighters shot down
two Libyan aircraft.
   The United States told the Security Council its planes opened
fire on the Libyan jets in reaction to hostile actions that
``constituted an armed attack'' on American forces.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun made the statement in a letter to
the 15-member council, which held private consultations on Libya's
protest of the U.S. downing of the jets over the Mediterranean Sea
on Wednesday.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser requested the meeting,
saying: ``Without a doubt, we will ask for condemnation of this
premeditated act of aggression.'' The two Libyan Mig-23s, he said,
were ``unarmed, on routine reconnaissance, ordinary flying. It was
an innocent flight.''
   In Washington, U.S. officials accused Libya of lying and said it
had photographic evidence the jet fighters were armed and
approaching Navy jets with hostile intent.
   A Navy intelligence review of videotape shot by one of the F-14
Tomcat jets ``tells me that the Libyan ambassador to the U.N. is a
liar. That's the first thing it tells me,'' Dan Howard, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman, told a news briefing.
   The United Nations' Soviet ambassador, Alexander M. Belonogov,
told reporters after the Security Council consultations that the
Soviet Union was worried about tension in the region over U.S.
allegations that Libya is building a chemical weapons plant.
   ``But before that (Wednesday's) incident, we gave a warning
signal to Washington to show restraint in that area, not to raise
the tension in the area,'' Belonogov said, refusing to elaborate.
   ``We deplore this accident,'' Belonogov added. ``It shows the
seriousness of the situation and that all military personnel should
be under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the
trigger.''
   When asked about his use of the word accident, he said, ``Well,
everything that has a tragic ending is an accident.''
   Earlier, he told reporters the U.S. attack ``could provoke very
grave consequences.''
   But Okun, speaking as he entered the consultations, said the
event is ``a closed incident.''
   The session considered Libya's request for a condemnation of the
U.S. action. A formal session of the council, the most powerful U.N.
body, was scheduled later.
   ``U.S. forces have exercised their inherent right of self-defense
under international law by taking defensive action in response to
hostile actions constituting an armed attack by the military forces
(of Libya) against U.S. forces,'' said the letter from Okun.
   It said the U.S. aircraft were engaged in a routine training
operation when two Libyan aircraft ``without provocation approached
them in a hostile manner.
   ``After repeatedly attempting to disengage by taking evasive
measures,'' the letter said, ``the American aircraft, acting in
self-defense, fired upon and shot down the two Libyan aircraft.''
   It said the council should be aware of ``the gravity of Libya's
action.''
   Belonogov said the incident was the result of ``the
overconcentration of American forces in the Mediterranean on one
hand and the enemy image of Libya that exists in this country on the
other.''
   He also said there was no proof a Libyan chemical plant was being
built to manufacture chemical weapons and that a Libyan invitation
to the United States to inspect the plant ``should be taken
seriously.'' The United States rejected the Libyan offer.
   In Moscow today, a Soviet general, Anatoly Kuntsevich, said Libya
may be able to manufacture chemical weapons, but they would be in
quantities too small for waging war.
   Any Security Council resolution critical of the United States was
expected to be vetoed by the U.S. delegation and possibly by its
allies Britain and France _ all permanent members with veto power on
the council.
   The Soviet Union and China also can kill resolutions.
   In 1986, when the United States attacked Libya with air strikes
to punish it for allegedly providing logistical support for
terrorist attacks, many U.N. members protested and Libya went to the
Security Council.
   But a resolution of condemnation was blocked then by vetos from
the United States, Britain and France.

   Soldiers today forced
residents to paint over graffiti threatening the life of Mayor Elias
Freij, whose proposal for a U.N.-sponsored truce in the Palestinian
uprising was rejected by the PLO.
   Freij denied reports he was in hiding following PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat's statement that anyone trying to stop the uprising
``exposes himself to the bullets of our people.'' Arafat made the
comment at a rally Jan. 1 in Saudi Arabia marking the anniversary of
his Fatah movement.
   ``I cannot believe he (Arafat) said that,'' Freij said in a
telephone interview from his office.
   Also today, 15 Palestinians, ranging in age from 15 to 37, were
wounded in clashes with troops in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of
Shati, Arab hospital officials said.
   Palestinians in the West Bank town of Jericho said a 25-year-old
resident gunned down near his house Wednesday was suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   Army officials confirmed the death of Bassam Barahmeh, who died
in a hospital, but said they had no information on his activities.
The officials said they were checking reports that 15 Palestinians
were wounded.
   Leaders of the uprising have repeatedly threatened Palestinians
who cooperate with Israel, and more than a dozen alleged
collaborators have been killed since the unrest began in December
1987.
   Barahmeh's death brought to 347 the number of Palestinians killed
in the uprising. Fourteen Israelis have died.
   Near Bethlehem's Manger Square, dozens of armed Israeli soldiers
took identity cards from shopkeepers and Palestinian youths and
ordered them to paint over anti-Freij slogans.
   The threats were signed by the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO, and included, ``Shame on
all traitors'' and ``Death to all those who forsake the cause.''
   Freij today denied as ``absolutely groundless'' reports that he
went into hiding or hired bodyguards after the threats appeared
early in the week.
   ``I have been in my office working normally yesterday (Wednesday)
and today and will be tomorrow, too,'' he said.
   Efforts to reach Freij on Tuesday night and Wednesday were not
successful. His aides said he was not in his office Wednesday
afternoon, and Freij changed his home telephone number. An
Associated Press reporter was turned away from the Freij home
Wednesday evening.
   Freij, who returned an AP call today, said the death threats
against him are ``absolutely meaningless.''
   He claimed they were signed by Hamas, an anti-PLO Moslem
fundamentalist group, but an Arabic-speaking reporter clearly saw
the signature of the front, a PLO faction.
   Freij said he accepted the PLO's rejection of his truce proposal,
which he linked to Israel releasing 5,000 Arab prisoners and
reopening universities, but said he was not withdrawing the idea.
   ``I have the right to make suggestions, and the PLO has the right
as our representatives to make decisions. They made such a decision
(and) I fully respect that,'' he said.
   Freij said he never supported a unilateral cease-fire and
supports continued anti-Israeli protests until occupation ends or
peace talks start.
   Also today, Finance Minister Shimon Peres presented an economic
austerity plan to the Cabinet to cut $611 million from the nation's
$52 billion budget, including $67 million from the defense budget.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the army will have to shift
about $83 million from existing military programs to cover expenses
stemming from the uprising. He said he was agreeing to the plan
because he couldn't ignore Israel's economic problems.
   The Arabic-language newspaper Al Shaab said a joint PLO-Jordanian
committee would meet in Amman on Saturday to discuss emergency
payments to thousands of former Palestinian employees of Jordan in
the West Bank.
   The three-day meeting was to be attended by Arafat and Jordanian
Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, said the newspaper, published in Arab
east Jerusalem.
   The employees, including teachers and civil servants, lost their
salaries after Jordan's King Hussein announced July 31 that he would
sever all administrative ties with the West Bank.
   Mohammed Milhem, a PLO member of the committee, told the AP in
Amman that funds for the project had not yet been secured, and that
no firm date for the meeting had been set.

   A legion of Hollywood glitterati
feted President Reagan at a $1 million homecoming gala, singing
``Camp David is rare, but it ain't Bel-Air'' and tantalizing the
former actor with a TV offer.
   Reagan, for his part, said he was eager to return to the state
where he began his dual careers in film and politics.
   ``Every time I come home, I say to myself, `Why did I ever
leave?'' Reagan remarked at Wednesday night's dinner. ``I'm not
saying I can hardly wait, but in 15 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and
14 seconds, I will be on my way.''
   Merv Griffin, who escorted Eva Gabor to the gala to raise money
for Nancy Reagan's anti-drug program, replied ``Isn't it
wonderful?'' when asked about the Reagans' imminent return to
California.
   ``Maybe we'll all make a movie together. I'm sure they'll be the
leaders of everything that happens here,'' he said.
   Dinner guests included Griffin and Marvin Davis, the Reagans' new
neighbors in posh Bel-Air, along with Charlton Heston, Lucille Ball,
Aaron Spelling, Angie Dickinson and Burt Bacharach. The menu
featured caviar, truffles and lobster.
   As the president and his party arrived, limousines at the Beverly
Hilton unloaded such passengers as Phyllis Diller, Armand Hammer,
Shelley Duvall, Charles Bronson and his wife, actress Jill Ireland,
the first lady's friend Betsy Bloomingdale and Mr. T.
   Dynasty star Joan Collins invited the president to play a role on
her nighttime soap. ``He could be my ex-husband or something,'' she
quipped.
   ``I'm delighted to have him back,'' said Heston. ``We'll miss him
in Washington, but I'm glad he's back here.''
   To attend the dinner and a reception, the only welcome home party
for the Reagans before they leave Washington on inauguration day
Jan. 20, about 65 people paid $25,000 each for a table of 10. About
950 people paid $1,000 each for single seats.
   Reagan used the gala as a forum to praise the first lady's
anti-drug crusade, saying his wife used the White House ``bully
pulpit'' for the good of America.
   Presentation of a $1 million check by Barron Hilton, whose hotel
chain paid the cost of the ceremony, highlighted the fund-raiser for
the planned Los Angeles home of the Nancy Reagan Center for drug
rehabilitation.
   The center, for those ages 12 to 18, is to be established in a
former hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Organizers say they need
$10 million to buy and renovate the structure.
   At the dinner, Don Rickles delivered his rapid-fire brand of
caustic comedy. In a five-minute routine, he opened saying, ``Mr.
President and Mrs. Reagan, for $25,000, this meal was lousy.''
   In an evening that also featured a Nancy Reagan singing duet with
Mary Martin, Griffin filled in for Frank Sinatra, who was ill with a
cold. Griffin sang a personalized version of Sinatra's signature
song, ``My Way.''
   ``Camp David is rare, but it ain't Bel-Air. Bel-Air is my way,''
Griffin crooned.
   The usually staid and stoic Gov. George Deukmejian told Reagan,
``I hope it won't bother you to be the second-most charismatic
person in California.''
   Reagan's eyes stayed on his wife.
   Nodding at the first lady, Reagan said, ``Nancy, I knew from the
first moment I laid eyes on you, that you were the greatest. Now,
the whole world knows.''
   Reagan said he took pride in the achievements of his eight years
as president, but at the top of the list was Mrs. Reagan's battle
``long before it was fashionable to get America's young people to
just say no to drugs.''
   Some Southern Californians, however, are less than enthusiastic
about the prospect of having the drug rehabilitation center in their
neighborhood.
   A dozen homeowners from the Lake View Terrace area, where the
Nancy Reagan center is slated to be located, demonstrated outside
the hotel, chanting, ``If you really care, put it in Bel-Air.''
   The Reagans spent the Christmas holidays at their $2.5 million
Bel-Air home for the first time.

<HEAD>Neutrality Defendants: U.S., Nicaragua Were at War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Six men accused of funneling
mercenaries and supplies to the Contra rebels argued before a judge
Thursday they are innocent of Neutrality Act charges because the
United States was waging war with Nicaragua.
   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger, who also heard testimony on
the so-called ``at peace'' issue Dec. 2 as part of a defense motion
to dismiss the indictment, said he expected decide the matter within
days.
   In the first half of the continuing pretrial hearing last month,
the defendants argued that the Neutrality Act applies only to
nations with which the United States is at peace. They contend the
Reagan administration was running a de facto war against Nicaragua's
Sandinista government at the time of their activities.
   Thursday's first defense witness was former top CIA analyst David
MacMichael, who testified that during his 1981-83 tenure the agency
organized and directed the Contras against Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   ``I would say they (the CIA) had a military mission,'' MacMichael
said. ``Not only combat, but support, supplies, transportation.''
   MacMichael testified over prosecution objections. They said they
feared he would disclose CIA secrets. The judge ruled he could speak
on matters already in the public record.
   Outside court, defendant Mario Calero, brother of Contra leader
Adolfo Calero, angrily accused the govenrment of harassing the
indicted men while they await trial. He ridiculed the government's
contention that the United States was at peace with the Sandinistas.
   ``When you mine harbors and run the show ... you are really not
just de facto at war _ you're at war,'' Calero told reporters.
``Perhaps the United States has not been honest enough with itself
to up and admit it.''
   MacMichaels' testimony Thursday sought to back up Adolfo Calero's
testimony last month that former national security adviser Oliver
North was providing the rebels with $32 million at the same time the
defendants were training anti-Sandinista mercenaries.
   The defendants also have submitted volumes of the Tower Report on
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Dubelier argued that no declared war
existed and that North and others are facing indictment for their
allegedly illegal activities.
   In Washington, Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, citing
``difficult classified information problems,'' moved Thursday to
dismiss the two central charges against North. Walsh said the move
was prompted because the Reagan administration was refusing to allow
the release of numerous classified documents North wants to
introduce in his defense.
   The Miami group was indicted in June after charges of Reagan
administration foot-dragging during the highly publicized
investigation, which at one point became the focal point of
congressional hearings.
   Opponents of aid to the Contras accused then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III of stalling the case because it threatened to
uncover illegal activities by North.
   The Miami indictment accuses the group of violating the
Neutrality Act by launching operations against the Sandinista
government from U.S. soil from October 1984 to March 1985.
   The indictment accuses them of recruiting and training
mercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying the rebels with
equipment, leading them on expeditions, including one aimed at
blowing up a Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws.
   The seven original defentants were Thomas Posey, head of the
Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance group; Mario Calero, a
former supply manager for the rebels; Joe Adams, Adolfo Calero's
former bodyguard; Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who turned
against the effort and went to authorities; Maco Stewart, a wealthy
former Texas businessman and state official who now lives in France;
Jose Coutin, a Miami Cuban and former CMA liaison in Florida, and
Alex Martinez, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker.
   Adams pleaded guilty, and Roettger fined him $50 and sentenced
him to a day of probation. The other six defendants continue to
fight the charges, which could result in federal prison sentences of
up to eight years on the Neutrality Act violations.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents fleeing Tripoli jammed gas
stations and troops fortified the home of Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
whose government claimed the U.S. downing of two Libyan jet fighters
was a prelude to a major attack, news reports said.
   The Foreign Ministry summoned heads of West European diplomatic
missions after Wednesday's incident over the Mediterranean, asking
them to condemn the U.S. ``aggression'' and prevent an escalation in
tensions, the official news agency JANA reported.
   Gadhafi branded the U.S. action an example of increased
``official American terrorism, which is backed by brute force,'' the
agency said.
   The Libyan leader, whom Washington accuses of sponsoring
international terrorism, was quoted as declaring the
``revolutionaries of great Libya'' would ``meet challenge with
challenge.''
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from Tripoli that
residents were packing filling stations as they fled the capital
after learning two Libyan fighters had been shot down by U.S.
warplanes.
   Gadhafi's home was turned into a ``fortress,'' with anti-aircraft
missiles mounted on its roof, Tanjug said.
   Nearly 30 journalists flying from Italy to Libya were turned back
at the Tripoli airport today and sent back to Rome.
   A spokesman for the Libyan Embassy in Rome, asked about the
journalists being turned back, said the embassy received
instructions not to issue any more visas. The telex said Libya would
not let in any more journalists because ``all the hotels are full,''
said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   Gadhafi's compound was a target of the last U.S. military strike
on Libya when aircraft bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986,
killing more than 100 people. President Reagan described the raids
as retaliation for the bombing of a West Berlin disco frequented by
American servicemen, which the United States blamed on terrorists
sponsored by Libya.
   Two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman died in the disco bombing.
   Libya claimed the downing of its fighters Wednesday was a
premeditated attack and a potential precursor to a major assault.
   The Foreign Ministry summoned Arab ambassadors in Tripoli to ask
for a ``unified Arab stance'' against the United States, JANA said.
   The ministry called for an emergency meeting of Arab League
foreign ministers to adopt ``collective measures for defense and to
participate with the Libyan Arab people in the defense of its land
and existence,'' the agency said.
   Gadhafi also sent a message to the head of the non-aligned
movement, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, asking the group to help stop
the U.S. ``aggression'' and warning of the ``threat'' to world
security posed by American military moves in the Mediterranean, it
said.
   The Reagan administration said the two U.S. fighters acted in
self-defense while on routine patrol over international waters, but
the Libyan ambassador to Rome linked the event to U.S. allegations
Libya has built a chemical weapons factory in Rabta, 60 miles
outside Tripoli.
   The State Department denied there was a connection.
   Gadhafi has said the plant's function is to produce medicine, and
JANA reported in recent days that Libyan doctors and nurses were
conducting a sit-in at the factory in hopes of deterring a U.S.
attack.
   Most West European governments have responded with some
skepticism to allegations the plant is to manufacture chemical
weapons. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Wednesday his government had no evidence proving a West German
pharmaceutical firm had helped build it.
   Britain's Foreign Office said it had independent information
confirming the Rabta plant was constructed to produce chemical
weapons.
   President Reagan said last month his advisers were considering
attacking the plant. But The Washington Post today quoted
unidentified senior officials in the Reagan administration as saying
the president now opposes a strike because Washington's European
allies are against the idea.
   After the Libyan jets were destroyed Wednesday, Gadhafi asked the
Soviet Union to move some of its warships in the Mediterranean to
the area in which U.S. vessels are operating near Libya, Tanjug
reported.
   The agency's correspondent, one of the few non-Arab journalists
with an office in Tripoli, has had access to high Libyan sources and
his reports often prove reliable.
   A reporter for Italian TV said Gadhafi's residence-headquarters
in Tripoli, already equipped with watchtowers and tanks parked in
camouflaged garages, had been even more heavily fortified.
   The Italian correspondent said anti-missile batteries had been
placed in key areas. He said the government television station was
one point at which security was notably greater.
   He described the reaction as ``first incredulity, then anger''
when word arrived in Tripoli that fighters from the U.S. 6th Fleet
had shot down two Libyan MiG-23 jets.
   In New York on Wednesday, Libya's U.N. ambassador, Ali Sunni
Muntasser, requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to
condemn the U.S. action.
   JANA quoted the Foreign Ministry as describing the U.S. naval
presence in the Mediterranean as ``a smokescreen'' for a
``large-scale aggression to be launched'' against Libyan military
and economic installations.

   A man who allegedly suffered from
psychosis triggered by cough medicine addiction and a fall from bed
was convicted of second-degree murder in the shooting death of his
best friend.
   James George Sussman, 39, faces 15 years to life in prison for
the slaying last year of 50-year-old George Moore at Sussman's Los
Gatos home. He was convicted Wednesday.
   The sanity phase of Sussman's trial in Santa Clara County
Superior Court begins Monday.
   The prosecution contended Sussman killed Moore during a lover's
quarrel.
   But defense attorney Pat Tondreau said the men weren't lovers,
and that Sussman had a ``psychotic delusional episode'' in which he
thought he had to kill Moore to prevent the world from ending.
   Tondreau said the episode was brought on by a high level of
dextromethorphan, an active ingredient in some cough syrups, and a
blow to the head when Sussman fell out of bed shortly before the
shooting.

   Ronald Reagan and his wife have two more weeks
of living in government quarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington before setting up California housekeeping in a $2.5
million ranch-style house _ modest by neighborhood standards _ that
was purchased for them by friends.
   During their two-week Christmas-New Year's vacation which ended
Thursday, the president and Nancy Reagan slept nine nights in the
house. Aides said they unpacked boxes, hung pictures and drank juice
squeezed from oranges off their own trees. It was their first stay.
   The 35-year-old single-story, three-bedroom, six-bathroom,
four-fireplace flagstone house stands behind a wall and security
fence on a hillside dotted with orange, palm and other trees.
   It was purchased by a group of 20 friends from whom the Reagans
will lease it for a reported $15,000 a month, with an option to buy.
   At the Reagans' request, its address, on the mailbox in front,
was changed last summer from 666 Saint Cloud Drive to 668 because of
connotations surrounding the number 666. Some people believe 666 is
the symbol of the devil.
   Despite the seven-figure price of the Reagans' new home, it is
overshadowed by others in the posh Bel Air neighborhood.
   The house is ``the low-man-on-the-totem-pole house'' in a
neighborhood where the neighbors include Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa
Zsa Gabor, said neighbor Jeffrey Hyland, president of the real
estate firm Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young.
   ``The house to the west sold for $13.5 million and the house to
the east sold for $14.5 million,'' he said.
   He said Reagan ``is following out the real estate rule that you
always want to buy into a neighborhood on the bottom end,'' adding:
``You want to be the cheapest man on the block so every other house
pulls you up.''
   Unlike houses farther up the hill, the new Reagan home doesn't
have much of a view.
   ``All the trees across the way have in the past 25 to 35 years
blocked it,'' Hyland said. ``It's amazing. Every 25 feet you go the
view is bigger and better. There's a house up above them where you
can see the ocean as well as downtown Los Angeles.''
   The Reagans' house has an outdoor heated swimming pool, but the
weather during their vacation was a bit chilly for swimming.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, said the first
lady told her that Reagan thought ``that it was a real treat for him
that he had orange juice from the oranges off their own trees.''
   Mrs. Reagan told Mrs. Crispen that the president ``was pleased to
see that she had been able to get so much done'' in making the house
a home, even though she was 3,000 miles away in Washington most of
the time.
   Mrs. Reagan made several visits to the house before their current
stay.
   ``She would spend an afternoon or so looking at things and
deciding what she needed and what would have to be done and sort of
some mental placement of furniture,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Reagan got his first look inside the house on an earlier trip
when, Mrs. Reagan has said, she sneaked him past reporters by having
him crouch in the back seat of a White House car.
   On Dec. 23, when he rode to the house for the first time sitting
straight up, he was quoted by aide Mark Weinberg as saying, ``I'm
awed, and I love it.''
   The Reagans have not allowed reporters into the 6,500-square-foot
house. Hyland said his listings showed it has a drawing room and
library, a dining room, a patio with a heated floor, a kitchen with
a walk-in cooler and a two-bedroom servants' wing above a three-car
garage.
   Security gear has been installed, with television cameras mounted
on the chimneys and the street blocked off and lined with vans,
trucks and trailers.
   ``I live a block up the street and every time I drive up and
down, it's just a mess,'' Hyland said this week.
   Information made available in 1986 to the Office of Government
Ethics showed that among the friends who bought the house for the
Reagans are Holmes Tuttle, a California automobile dealer and
industrialist, and Earle Jorgensen, chairman of a steel and aluminum
distribution company. Both are long-time unofficial advisers of
Reagan. Each paid at least $156,000, the documents showed.
   Hyland also said he believed the buyers got a bargain. He
estimated the land alone was worth $3 million when they bought it
and the property is probably worth $5 million now with the
improvements that have been made. The house stands on a lot of just
over an acre.

   President-elect Bush is nearing a decision on
his two remaining Cabinet-level selections but apparently has ruled
out James Schlesinger for energy secretary, sources said.
   Meanwhile, sources close to Bush who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that two top contenders for the other unfilled spot,
the newly created job of drug czar, are former education secretary
William J. Bennett and Texas industrialist Ross Perot.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said today Bush had offered him
the drug post on Tuesday, but he turned it down in a half-hour
meeting this morning with the president-elect. DeConcini was elected
in November to a third six-year term and said he did not want to
leave the Senate so soon after the election.
   ``I am very flattered and humbled by his confidence,'' DeConcini
said at a news conference. ``It was very tempting to me, based on my
interests.''
   DeConcini, who was critical of Bush's role overseeing anti-drug
efforts for the Reagan administration, today praised his grasp of
the issue.
   When reminded of his opinions during the presidential campaign,
DeConcini replied: ``Time has a lot to do with one's attitudes.''
   DeConcini said Bush offered him the post Tuesday morning before
Capitol Hill ceremonies marking the opening of the new Congress and
asked him to keep it confidential. The senator said Bush released
him from that pledge this morning.
   DeConcini suggested a couple of people for the post, including
Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., but Bush made no commitment, saying he
had no one else in mind for the job.
   Schlesinger, energy secretary under President Carter and defense
secretary under President Ford, had earlier been mentioned as a
leading candidate for the energy post.
   The vice president and Schlesinger met last week to discuss
energy issues but ``the job was not offered,'' said a senior Bush
transition official who insisted upon not being identified.
   Schlesinger reportedly ran into opposition among influential
Republicans for his ties to the Carter administration and an
abrasive style, the sources said.
   Sources said that former Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore remained a
top contender on Bush's short list for the energy post.
   Aides to Bush said that while he would like to wrap up his
Cabinet selection as soon as possible, it was unlikely any
additional announcements would come as early as today.
   Bush on Wednesday took obvious delight in his last official duty
as presiding officer of the Senate. Ruling over a joint session of
Congress convened to count electoral votes, the vice president was
able to formally announce his own presidential victory.
   He declared the final tally from the Electoral College ballots
cast last month, giving ``George Bush of the state of Texas'' 426
votes to Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis' 111 and a maverick
electoral vote cast in West Virginia for Lloyd Bentsen for
president. The final tally reflected Bush's 40-state sweep in the
November election.
   It had been 152 years since a vice president had been able to
perform such a task. Grinning broadly, Bush rapped the gavel and
declared ``the joint session dissolved.'' Congress will not
reconvene until Jan. 20, when Bush and Vice President-elect Dan
Quayle are inaugurated.
   The last vice president to preside over his own presidential
election certification was Martin Van Buren in 1837. This is only
the fourth time a sitting vice president has been elected president
in history. The others were John Adams (George Washington's vice
president) and James Madison (Thomas Jefferson's).
   The stray vote for Bentsen came from West Virginia, where one
Dukakis elector flipped her ballot, putting the Texas senator first
and the Massachusetts governor second.
   Bush injected a note of humor in the roll call when Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., one of four official vote counters, announced only
that Arkansas had cast six votes for president.
   ``The chair wonders who won that one,'' Bush observed dryly.
   As the chamber erupted in laughter and applause, Annunzio
responded, ``It's obvious that they all know the answer to that
one.''
   While on Capitol Hill, Bush met privately with Sens. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and had lunch with Rep. Robert
Dornan, R-Calif.
   Dornan, an early Bush supporter, said they discussed both the
energy and drug posts over turkey sandwiches in the Senate dining
room, but that Bush did not indicate whom he might select for either.
   Dornan said he told Bush his own choice for drug czar was Bennett.
   Dornan said Bush likely invited him to lunch because ``I was the
first member of either the House or the Senate to endorse him. We've
developed a good relationship.''

   The International Ladies' Garment Workers'
Union today asked a federal court to prohibit the Labor Department
from implementing regulations that would allow homework in five
apparel-related industries.
   The suit, filed in federal district court here, argues that Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin acted arbitrarily in approving the
regulations and that she ignored evidence that there were not
adequate safeguards in the rules to prevent violations of labor and
worker-safety laws.
   The regulations are scheduled to take effect Jan. 9. It was not
immediately clear whether there would be a hearing on the complaint
before then.
   The suit also asked that the Labor Department be ordered to
reconsider its 1984 decision allowing homework in the knitted
outerwear industry. The department said its success in monitoring
that industry led it to draft the new regulations, but the suit
contended there has been inadequate monitoring and enforcement of
homework in the industry.
   The five manufacturing industries covered by the new rules are:
gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideries
and, to a limited extent, jewelry.
   About 167,000 workers are employed by the affected industries,
which generated $10 billion worth of production in 1986, according
to Susan Cowell, vice president of the ILGWU.
   Joining the garment workers' union in filing the suit were two
other national unions, Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union and Service Employees International Union, two New-York based
locals, three apparel-industry groups and the states of New York and
Pennsylvania.
   Named as defendants were McLaughlin and Paula V. Smith,
administrator of the department's wage and hour division, which
enforces many of the laws the suit contends would be violated if the
homework regulations are allowed to take effect.
   Bans on homework in the apparel and related industries date back
to the 1940s, when they were adopted to prevent exploitations of
low-wage workers, predominantly immigrants. The Reagan
administration for the past several years has attempted to eliminate
the restrictions.

   The Supreme Court rejected appeals by the
two Sikhs condemned for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, and ordered that they be hanged Friday in the central
prison's courtyard.
   Panels of five justices each turned down pleas Thursday by
Satwant Singh, the only assassin who survived, and Kehar Singh,
convicted of helping plot the murder.
   ``This is the last legal battle. We can't go anywhere now,'' said
Kehar Singh's lawyer, Ram Jethmalani.
   The condemned were ordered executed at the maximum-security Tihar
Central Jail, where the last hanging was in 1984. They are not
related; all members of the Sikh faith have Singh, which means lion,
as part of their names.
   A third Sikh, Balbir Singh, also was arrested, tried and
convicted on conspiracy charges and sentenced to death, but the
court overturned the conviction in August for lack of evidence.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot down by members of her personal guard Oct.
31, 1984, in the garden of her home in New Delhi. Other members of
the guard then fired on the assassins, but Satwant Singh survived.
   Police and soldiers were put on maximum alert Thursday in New
Delhi and in the northern states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and
Punjab, where Sikh militants are waging a 6-year-old separatist war,
in case violence accompanied the hangings.
   Security was increased at bus and railway stations, often targets
of Sikh extremists, at government offices and other locations. Many
schools were ordered closed.
   Preparations for the executions were completed last October after
the first death warrants were issued. The manila ropes, an inch
thick and nearly 20 feet long, were stretched, tested and locked in
a vault. The country's only two hangmen have been kept under guard
inside the prison for the past three months.
   Lawyers and relatives went to the prison Thursday for final
visits.
   Attorney R.S. Sodhi emerged after a 45-minute meeting with
Satwant Singh, 54, one of two Sikh bodyguards accused of killing
Mrs. Gandhi. He described his client as calm and composed, then read
handwritten statement by the condemned man.
   ``There is no greater privilege for a Sikh to lay down his life
for the protection'' of his faith, it said. ``I wish I could be born
again and again and each time lay down my life for this.''
   Jasbir Kaur, Kehar Singh's wife, said after visiting him: ``He's
happy and laughing. He told me to take care of the family.''
   Defense lawyers had filed several appeals this week in a third
attempt to block the executions.
   Jethmalani, a leading criminal lawyer, challenged President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman's refusal of clemency for Kehar Singh, 54.
   He said the president considered only the government case and
ignored new evidence that might prove his client's innocence,
including the arrest of a Sikh terrorist who allegedly said he
planned the assassination.
   Venkataraman rejected the mercy plea twice. He said he was bound
by the recommendations of the government, which is led by the
victim's son, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Satwant Singh's appeal sought prosecution of two of Mrs. Gandhi's
security guards. He claimed the guards shot him after he was
disarmed and said their actions amounted to attempted murder.
   He did not appeal for clemency, but under Indian law his death
sentence was delayed automatically Kehar Singh did so.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed in apparent retaliation for an army raid
she ordered four months earlier to rout Sikh militants from the
Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of Sikhism. More than
1,200 people were killed, most of them Sikhs.
   As Mrs. Gandhi lay dying, a guard named Beant Singh threw down
his gun and shouted: ``I have done what I had to do! Now, you do
what you must do!''
   Other guards opened fire, killing Beant Singh and wounding
Satwant Singh. Beant Singh is revered as a matryr by many Sikh
militants.
   Kehar Singh, a government clerk who was Beant's uncle, was
arrested a month later and charged with helping plot the
assassination, whih caused anti-Sikh riots in northern India by
members of the Hindu majority. More than 2,700 people were killed,
nearly all of them Sikhs.
   Sikh violence has increased since, and at least 2,440 people were
killed last year in Punjab, the only Indian state in which Sikhs are
the majority. That was more than double the 1,032 victims in 1987.
   Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in
Punjab. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more than
80 percent of India's 880 million people.

alcoholism treatment center at age 13, says she got into trouble
with drinking because she wanted to imitate relatives in the
legendary Barrymore theater family, some of whom drank heavily.
   ``I wanted to be just like them so badly for so long,'' she said
in an interview to be shown on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
next Monday. A transcript was made available to The Associated Press
on Thursday.
   ``They were all famous people of the theater and they were
respected and they were talented and, you know, they drank,'' she
said. ``Little did I know that it was cool not to do it. ... It
became like a fashion and that's what I wanted to be part of.''
   Miss Barrymore, who was a seasoned actress at age 6 when she
played the impetuous Gertie in the hit movie ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' was released just before Christmas from an
unidentified rehabilitation center in California, where she was
treated for alcohol abuse.
   She said she started drinking at age 8, when she downed a glass
of champagne on a dare. She said she started using drugs at age 11.
   It was easy to sneak out to night clubs and drink with friends,
she said. ``I really was a party girl.''
   Miss Barrymore is the granddaughter of the late movie and theater
actor John Barrymore, himself a notoriously heavy drinker, and is
the daughter of a Hungarian-born actress who is the third wife of
reclusive John Barrymore Jr.
   The girl said her mother didn't notice her alcohol problems
partly because she used her acting talents to hide it, and because
her mother ``didn't want to believe that I was doing it, either.''
   She said she hated her first experience with alcohol, but ``like
if you can't control it, it progressively gets worse, you know, an
unfortunately I was one of those people.''
   Asked what advice she had for other children tempted to
experiment with drugs and alcohol, Miss Barrymore replied:
   ``No matter how many times people would tell me or my friends, no
matter what, I did not want to believe it until I had hit my bottom,
which I did. But I think the best advice I can give anyone is to
just listen to other people because I didn't and those people, a lot
of those people, were right.''

<TEXT>
   American classics like ``Blue Moon'' and ``Singing
in the Rain'' will become British property under a $336 million
purchase announced Thursday by the entertainment conglomerate Thorn
EMI PLC.
   Thorn EMI said it was buying SBK Entertainment World Inc., a
major U.S. music publishing company that owns more than 250,000
individual copyrights, mainly of songs commissioned by big U.S.
movie producers.
   Thorn EMI's chief executive, Colin Southgate, called it ``a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Thorn-EMI'' that would create ``a
worldwide music publishing business of immense potential.''
   Income from the portfolio is expected to be about $37 million for
1988, mainly in the United States and Europe.
   Southgate said the deal included setting up a joint record
production venture with two of the selling shareholders. He gave no
details.
   The purchase takes effect in April, pending shareholder and
regulatory approval.

<HEAD>Bush Urged To Support Steps On AIDS, Environment, Space Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists, engineers and physicians urged
President-elect Bush on Thursday to support their recommendations in
the battle against AIDS, to take steps to improve the global
environment, and to establish goals for the space program.
   Recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and its
affiliated National Academy of Engineering and National Institute of
Medicine, in the form of white papers commissioned by the presidents
of the organizations, included:
   _Development of a comprehensive plan to finance care for those
suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and legislation
to ban discrimination against them. The contagious disease attacks
the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other
diseases and infections.
   _Reduction in use of fossil fuels, to slow the ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of the planet. They also advocated stepped-up
research into non-fossil energy sources such as a ``publicly
acceptable'' nuclear reactor, and urged increased energy efficiency
throughout the economy.
   _Swift selection of a chief for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, coupled with making the space effort a $10
billion-a-year base operation augmented by separately financed
special efforts, such as the space station, which might add $3
billion to $4 billion in peak years.
   _Early naming of a science adviser to help select dozens of key
scientific executives throughout the government, sort out
controversy among competiting weapons systems, rebuild
competitiveness of the nation's technologies and reverse declining
scientific and technical education.
   In a cover letter to Bush, the presidents of the three
organizations said that ``global environmental change must be made
more prominent in the scientific, political and foreign policy
agendas of the United States.''
   The groups released white papers in the areas of the environment,
AIDS, space and science policy by special study panels.
   Regarding space research, the panel told Bush the United States
cannot take a leading position without his help.
   ``To give visibility to the importance of his space program, the
president must establish his goals early in his administration. He
should then support them strongly with the public and the Congress
to help ensure their achievement,'' the experts said.
   On AIDS, the panel urged the Bush administration to protect those
infected with the deadly virus from discrimination and ensure that
screening tests for the disease be employed ``only when their
purposes are clear and their results productive.''
   The AIDS study also said Bush should continue aggressive
educational programs and develop a plan for financing care of AIDS
victims. It urged the United States to be a leader in the
international battle against AIDS and increase contributions to the
global program to $50 million a year by 1990 from the current $15
million.
   The space panel said it believed a space station ``is essential
to establish the feasibility of extended human space flight'' if the
nation wants to pursue it. But the concept of a space station ``will
require revalidation to ensure that it fully supports the goals
established by the president.''
   Bush has said he favors the space station.
   The space panel also urged a study of turning over to private
operators more of NASA's field activities such as the Marshall Space
Flight Center at Huntsville, Ala., perhaps along the lines of the
NASA-owned Jet Propulsion Laboratory operated by the California
Institute of Technology.
   The environment panel said natural gas should be favored over
other fossil fuels in the short run because it releases less carbon
dioxide than other fuels, but ``we should explore means for reducing
energy demand without impeding economic growth, for example, by
using fossil fuels with greater efficiency.''
   Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere at about 0.3
percent per year and accounts for about half the expected warming of
two degrees Fahrenheit to nine degrees the academy expects in the
next century.
   Provisions of the treaty reducing emissions of chemicals that
destroy the ozone layer should be accelerated and a complete ban on
those chemicals sought, the panel said. These chlorofluorocarbon
compounds also worsen the greenhouse effect. The Environmental
Protection Agency already has called for such a ban.

<HEAD>Former Dictator Idi Amin to be Expelled From Zaire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin has been
questioned by Zairean officials who say he entered on a false
passport and may be expelled at the end of the week.
   Idi Amin arrived Tuesday on a regular Air Zaire flight from Saudi
Arabia, where he lives in exile.
   He was accompanied by one of his sons and entered on a false
Zairean passport, said sources at Ndjili airport, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   However, the 300-pound Amin was recognized as he tried to enter
Zaire, and was arrested and taken to a military airport. Officials
have been holding him until they can determine where he should be
sent, airport officials said.
   Zairean authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
was not invited and had not been issued a visa.
   The false passport was one of a several documents recently
reported stolen, an unidentified spokesman in the president's office
told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   Amin ruled the East African country of Uganda from 1971 until he
was deposed by a combined Ugandan rebel and Tanzanian force in 1979.
His rule was punctuated by charges of human rights abuses, mass
depotation of Asians and civil war.

<HEAD>Federal Board Gives Final Ruling: Onboard Shooting Caused PSA Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled
in a final report Thursday that the l987 crash of a Pacific
Southwest Airlines jet was caused by a gunman seeking revenge on a
former supervisor.
   PSA Flight 1771 crashed Dec. 7, l987, about l75 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, killing all 43 people aboard including a former
USAir employee who apparently had opened fire with a revolver during
the flight.
   The safety board said a note written by the man, David Burke,
threatened his former supervisor, who also was aboard the flight.
The note was found in the wreckage as were the revolver and six
spent cartridges.
   The final two-page federal report on the accident included no
information that had not previously been disclosed by investigators
in general terms.
   Authorities within weeks of the accident said Burke had taken a
.44-caliber Magnum revolver aboard the San Francisco-bound flight.
According to the PSA investigation, it is believed that Burke was
able to avoid detection of his revolver because he bypassed normal
passenger security checks at the Los Angeles airport after being
recognized as a former airline employee.
   A cockpit recorder tape from the plane included gunshots in or
near the cockpit, according to the federal board. The board said in
a brief summary of findings released Thursday that the tape revealed
``the sounds of a scuffle and several shots which were apparently
fired in or near the cockpit.''
   It has been presumed that both the pilot and co-pilot were shot,
but the federal board's summary does not specifically say the two
pilots had been hit by gunfire.
   According to the findings, the official probable cause for the
accident was ``interference'' and ``intentional sabotage'' by an
emotionally distraught passenger. The safety board cited as
contributing factors inadequate security and inadequate operatoring
procedures by the airline that permitted Burke to bypass security.
   The crash prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to order
tighter security measures at passenger checkpoints, especially in
regard to airline and airport employees.
   In an action that grew out of the PSA crash, the FAA on Wednesday
announced a final regulation aimed at tightening access to
restricted areas of an airport by using computerized identification
badges. Such badges would make an ID card ineffective if it is
reported stolen or if a person leaves his job without returning the
badge.
   Investigators have said that Burke was believed to have still had
his USAir identification badge at the time he boarded Flight 1771.
USAir was a subsidiary of USAir Corp. at the time of the crash and
since has merged completely into USAir.
   The accident report said, as has been disclosed previously, that
Burke had left a ``goodbye'' message with friends and boarded PSA
Flight 1771 with the intention of killing his former supervisor at
USAir.

<HEAD>600 Inmates Released In Louisiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 600 inmates were put on the
streets today under pressure from a federal court to relieve prison
overcrowding.
   The inmates were the first to be released under a 1986 state law,
expanded in 1988, alowing well-behaved prisoners to leave after
serving half their sentences rather than two-thirds. Some 300 more
are to be freed later this month.
   Hilton Butler, warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, said inmates were taken to the gates if they had family
waiting, while vans took the rest to a bus terminal in Baton Rouge.
   Several of the 30 inmates awaiting buses at the terminal
complained that the Corrections Department could have handled the
release better.
   Robert Dennis Hage complained there was ``no organization in all
of this. You get $20 and they say, `There's the door.' I've already
spent $5 here for a skimpy breakfast.'' Department records showed
that Hage was convicted of rape.
   Between the mid-1970s and 1982, every state, parish and city jail
in Louisiana came under federal court orders to relieve overcrowding.
   The court set a maximum allowable population in the state's nine
prisons of 12,330 inmates, and also set ceilings in local jails.
   Of the inmates released today, about half were from state
prisons; the rest were inmates being held in parish jails until room
could be found for them in the state prisons, which are at the
population limit set by the court.
   Overcrowding has been blamed primarily on the enactment in recent
years of mandatory sentences for various crimes. Lawmakers approved
construction of two prisons, but work has come almost to a
standstill because of financial problems.
   The Legislature rejected most of former Gov. Edwin Edwards'
efforts to lessen penalties for various non-violent crimes and
create programs such as home imprisonment.
   ``I'm not happy with our criminal justice system,'' Gov. Buddy
Roemer said Wednesday, adding that a task force will study the
criminal justice system ``all the way from sentencing to
rehabilitation'' to determine how to ease overcrowding.
   Although the inmates will be under parole supervision, the
releases will cause problems for the officers in charge of watching
them, officials said.
   Over the past three years, the number of field parole agents has
fallen from 365 to 252, said Charles Adams, assistant director of
parole services.
   Adams said statistics show that prisoners with early releases are
more likely to run into trouble than regular probation and parole
cases.

   The Reagan administration has made no final
decision about whether to attack a Libyan plant it claims is
producing chemical weapons, but Pentagon contingency plans suggest
the first-ever use of cruise missiles, sources say.
   Such a strike would use a land-attack variant of the Navy's
Tomahawk cruise missile, equipped with a non-nuclear warhead, that
was first declared fit for use in war in March 1986.
   Use of the unmanned Tomahawk is ``a preferred contingency''
because of the missile's accuracy and the fact that no pilots would
be endangered in bombing runs, the sources added.
   The sources, who insisted on anonymity, agreed to discuss the
Libyan situation after two Navy F-14 Tomcat jets shot down two
Libyan jet fighters Wednesday in a confrontation over the
Mediterranean Sea.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in discussing the conflict
at a Pentagon briefing, flatly dismissed suggestions the F-14s were
airborne as part of U.S. preparation for mounting an attack on the
suspected chemical weapons plant. Libya says the plant makes
pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.
   President Reagan said last month his advisers were considering
such a military strike.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Reagan now
opposes a U.S. military strike against the plant because it would
cause an international furor that might harm other U.S. interests.
The Post cited an unnamed senior administration official who said
Reagan was heeding the advice of European allies, particularly
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that a military response
would be unhelpful.
   The British government said Wednesday night, meanwhile, that it
has confirmed beyond doubt that the plant in dispute was built to
produce chemical weapons.
   ``We have been in contact with a number of countries to make the
point that we have independent information on the Libyan chemical
warfare programs,'' said a British Foreign Ministry spokesman who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``This information shows that the
plant is very large and that there is no doubt it is intended for
chemical warfare production.''
   Meanwhile today, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
confirmed a Los Angeles Times report that Libya has attempted some
back-channel contacts with the United States recently, but she
refused to define the substance of the messages or say how they were
transmitted.
   The Times, quoting unidentified officials, said the overtures
were rejected because they failed to address U.S. complaints that
Gadhafi's regime supports terrorism. It said the most recent Libyan
contact came less than 24 hours before the fighters clashed over the
Mediterranean.
   Mrs. Oakley stressed that Libya is well aware that Belgium
represents U.S. interests in Tripoli, and should use that channel if
it has any messages to send to the administration.
   ``There have been several efforts by Libya over the past year to
send messages to the U.S. government through various
intermediaries,'' she said. ``... The problem is not one of
communication; the problem is the policy and the conduct of the
government of Libya, their policy particularly in support of
terrorism.
   Carlucci said the F-14s were on a routine training flight, more
than 600 miles from the Libyan plant and 70 miles off Libya's coast,
when they were approached ``in a hostile manner'' and fired in self
defense.
   ``What he didn't say was that if orders came to attack that
plant, we probably wouldn't use airplanes,'' said one defense
official. ``We can use the Tomahawk now.''
   The United States wants to prevent Libyan strongman Moammar
Gadhafi from starting large-scale production of chemical weapons,
particularly given Libya's past support of terrorist organizations,
the sources said.
   The administration is now trying to isolate Libya diplomatically
and gain the cooperation of allies in denying Libya access to
Western supplies and technology said to be needed for the plant.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans to address the issue
during an international conference on chemical weapons that opens
Saturday in Paris.
   ``There won't be any military action before then,'' said one
official.
   ``But the contingency planning no longer focuses on bombing
runs,'' said another source. ``The Tomahawk is mission-capable and
we have the digitized navigation data (for the missile) needed to
fly a strike.''
   The new plant is situated about 35 miles inland from the coastal
capital of Tripoli. The conventional land-attack model of the
Tomahawk has a range of 700-plus miles, meaning cruise missiles
could easily be launched by either submarine or surface ship against
the Libyan facility.
   When the United States staged a bombing raid over two Libyan
cities in 1986, it did not have enough conventional Tomahawks
available to mount the attack. One Air Force F-111 bomber and two
aviators were lost in those bombing runs, which were in retaliation
for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West Berlin
discotheque frequented by American servicemen.
   The Tomahawk is a flying torpedo with short stubby wings and a
small tail fin. Powered by a jet engine, it can fly at extremely low
altitude just below the speed of sound and is almost impervious to
air defenses on the ground.
   The missile finds its way with an advanced navigation system and
sensors that allow it to follow a pre-programmed computerized map in
its memory.
   he conventional variant of the Tomahawk costs roughly $1.5
million and has never been fired in a conflict. The Navy to date has
certified 35 of its submarines and 23 surface ships to deploy with
the Tomahawk; eventually 100 submarines and 91 surface ships are to
carry the weapon.
   According to one Pentagon source, ``the accuracy is such that we
can put a Tomahawk through the goal posts on a football field after
a flight of 500 to 700 miles.''

   A woman who killed her three young
daughters fatally shot herself at their graves 32 years later,
authorities said.
   Lorene Calbeck, 67, shot herself in the chest Tuesday night at
Lake Wales Cemetery, then drove home and called the 911 emergency
number, Polk County sheriff's Detective Richard Land said. She died
in an ambulance.
   A neighbor said the woman was depressed since the loss in June of
her husband, Mark, of 45 years. She left detailed notes to
authorities telling them to contact a friend and giving instructions
on how to care for her oven.
   Authorities said Mrs. Calbeck had tried to commit suicide shortly
after the deaths in May 1956 of her daughters, ages 1 through 5.
   Then 34, Mrs. Calbeck took her children on a moonlight ride to a
deserted area, stripped them to their panties and shot each in the
heart with a $22-caliber target pistol, police reported.
   Then she drove them back home to the Lake Wales Trailer Park,
placed them on a bed in order of their size and covered them with
cellophane.
   She left three suicide notes then _ one to authorities on how to
reach her husband, who was working in Michigan at the time; one to
her husband; and one to the trailer park's manager on how to care
for her gardenias.
   She then fired a pistol into the left side of her chest, but she
survived. She never told authorities why she shot the girls.
   A grand jury took no action against Mrs. Calbeck. She was sent to
the Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee and was hospitalized for
12 years, said Hilda Barnhardt, a Lake Wales resident who knew Mrs.
Calbeck since 1982 but had not known about the daughters.
   ``It was such a shock to learn she had children,'' Mrs. Barnhardt
said. ``She had never mentioned the children or why she had been
institutionalized. She just didn't talk about it.''
   She said Mrs. Calbeck had been depressed since the death last
June of her husband.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state, exercising its powers under a
1984 ``academic bankruptcy'' law for the first time, plans to seize
control of two troubled school districts, a newspaper reported today.
   Superintendent of Public Instruction John Brock will recommend
taking control of the Floyd and Whitley districts to the state
school board next week, The Lexington Herald-Leader said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Brock refused to comment on the report.
   The school districts in rural eastern Kentucky have been the
focus of state investigations and parents' complaints. Both are
receiving state help with management and academic problems.
   Floyd County Superintendent Ron Hager said Brock telephoned him
to say the action was based on low attendance and test scores. The
school system is expecting to complete the fiscal year with a
deficit of more than $300,000.
   Floyd and Whitley have a combined enrollment of about 12,900
students.
   A month ago, Brock issued a study of Floyd County's 22 schools
that turned up reports of rampant patronage and nepotism, wide
disparities in what is taught from school to school and other
academic shortcomings.
   A 1987 consultant's report on the Whitley district said it lacked
sound purchasing procedures, had attendance problems, spent too much
time embroiled in politics and legal action and lacked high-quality
teaching in areas.

<HEAD>Walsh Asks Dismissal of Conspiracy Charge Against North</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new grafs 8-9 with Justice Department statement, lift

<TEXT>
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, citing
``difficult classified information problems,'' moved today to
dismiss the two central charges against fired National Security
Council aide Oliver L. North in the Iran-Contra case.
   Walsh said he sought to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges
because of North's insistence on disclosing large amounts of secret
information and the Reagan administration's refusal to declassify
many documents.
   In resisting North's disclosure request, intelligence officials
have cited concerns over national security.
   ``Efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the risk
that a quantity of classified national security information would be
compromised by a public trial'' on the conspiracy and theft charges,
Walsh said in the brief motion.
   Trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 31.
   If U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell approves Walsh's motion,
there still would be a dozen criminal charges remaining against
North, including allegations that he obstructed inquiries and made
false statements in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh's move came a day after he met with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to discuss the continuing problems posed by classified
documents both sides want to use in the case.
   It was at that meeting that Walsh told the attorney general he
planned to seek dismissal of the two charges, the Justice Department
said in a statement.
   ``The Department of Justice believes that the motion is a
constructive step in the handling of very sensitive national
security issues,'' the statement said.
   The White House, facing a new round of lobbying for a
presidential pardon for North, had no immediate comment.
   Walsh cited the judge's refusal to allow further censorship of
300 prosecution exhibits as another reason for seeking dismissal of
the two main charges. The independent counsel had sought a
modification of guidelines Gesell laid down last month to accomodate
continuing objections of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the attorney
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security.
   The conspiracy and theft of government property charges were the
main counts against North for selling missiles to Iran and diverting
some of the profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   In the initial indictment, former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter and middlemen Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim were
named in these two counts. Their trials were severed from North's
and have not been scheduled yet and today's motion will likely
result in dismissal of the same charges against Poindexter, Hakim
and Secord.
   In his motion to dismiss the two central counts, Walsh said that
because of several factors, including ``the position of the nation's
intelligence agencies on maintaining the classified status of
certain information,'' the conspiracy and theft counts ``cannot be
tried in a manner that protects that information.''
   Walsh said there were other factors leading him to seek
abandonment of the two charges.
   One was North's continued insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense. Another was Gesell's Dec. 12 order
directing that classified information not be purged from the
documents that Walsh planned to introduce as part of the prosecution.
   Walsh also cited Gesell's refusal on Tuesday to reconsider part
of that order.
   Walsh said he hoped ``the dismissal will enable the trial to
commence on Jan. 31, 1989.''
   Walsh said that ``by far the most difficult classified
information problems stem from'' the conspiracy and theft of
government property charges. They allege North's ``interaction with
a number of intelligence agencies and touch upon a number of highly
classified covert programs.''
   The remaining charges include obstruction of Congress in 1985 and
1986, concealing and destroying documents in connection with a 1986
inquiry into the affair by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   North also is charged with converting travelers' checks to his
own use, and accepting a free security system installed at his home.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Court of Appeals on Wednesday dissolved a
temporary stay it issued the day before and denied a motion to bar
Gesell permanently from giving Walsh's office a classified summary
of proposed defense testimony.
   The request could have forced a delay in the trial.
   North's lawyers have said providing the 162-page summary to
prosecutors would give them an unfair, early idea of North's defense.
   But a three-judge appeals court panel said its intervention was
warranted ``only in extraordinary situations.''
   ``This court will not interrupt a criminal proceeding and invade
the province of the district court when petitioner has an effective
remedy through direct appeal from a final judgment of conviction,''
the judges said in a two-page order.
   At the White House, deputy press secretary B. Jay Cooper said he
would have no immediate comment on Walsh's motion. Reagan was
returning from a California vacation later in the day.
   Reagan has repeatedly said that he is not considering a pardon
for North, and that he believes the legal process should go forward.
   But the president has come under increasing lobbying pressure to
grant a pardon, and the Conservative Future Political Action
Committee ran a full-page advertisement in Thursday's editions of
The Washington Times urging a pardon.
   ``Mr. President. The time has come to end the personal suffering
and torment of your special hero, Col. Oliver North, who has endured
vicious media attack for over two years,'' it said.
   Cooper said some 300 pro-North calls had been received at the
White House switchboard by midday.

   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey, actress Ann Archer
and gun control advocate Sarah Brady are among Ms. magazine's Women
of the Year.
   The magazine, citing their ``determination, grit and guts,'' said
Thursday that the winners ``share one overwhelming characteristic:
They are all fighters, women determined to make a difference.''
   Ms. Archer was named for ``courageous pro-choice advocacy,'' and
Ms. Winfrey for ``her mission to expose black talent.''
   Ms. Brady, wife of former Reagan press secretary James Brady, was
honored for her stand against the powerful gun lobby. Her husband
was critically wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Reagan.
   The other honorees: Marjory Stoneman Douglas, for a 60-year
battle to protect the Florida Everglades; ``Sweet Alice'' Harris,
for helping poverty-stricken children in Los Angeles' Watts section,
and Yolanda Serrano, for fighting AIDS among New York's drug addicts
and prostitutes.

   Is the world ready for Bugs Bunny's kindler,
gentler offspring? Director Steven Spielberg hopes so.
   Spielberg, a long-time lover of animated cartoons, is joining
forces with Warner Bros. for a new television version of Warner's
famous ``Merrie Melodies,'' to be called ``Tiny Tunes.''
   ``These will be offspring of the famous Warner Bros. cartoons,
such as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat,'' Spielberg
said at a news conference Wednesday. ``But I don't know if they will
be actually sons and daughters. I'm not quite sure how reproduction
works in `toons.' ''
   Spielberg promised there would be no violence in the new
half-hour episodes, and that they wouldn't have the chase scenes
that are a staple of many cartoon shows.
   ``Tiny Tunes'' will be produced jointly by Spielberg and Warner
Bros. and will be distributed for syndicated television by Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. for the fall season of 1990.

   When it comes to riveting plots, Hollywood should
take a look at teen-age actor River Phoenix's life. It has it all:
religious cults, hard times and his break into movies _ all before
age 12.
   Phoenix, now 18, has appeared in such films as ``Stand By Me,''
``Mosquito Coast,'' and, most recently, ``Running on Empty.''
   The latter earned him a Golden Globe nomination for best
supporting actor, and his backers are hoping an Academy Award
nomination is not out of his reach.
   But glitz and glitter is not what River Phoenix is all about.
   An anti-fur activist, he doesn't wear animal skin and has been a
vegeterian since he was 8.
   ``When I was old enough to realize all meat was killed, I saw it
as an irrational way of using our power, to take a weaker thing and
mutilate it,'' he said in an interview in Thursday's New York Times.
   Phoenix's parents joined the Children of God religious cult when
he was 2; by the time he was 5, he was playing his guitar in the
streets, accompanied by his sister, Rainbow, now 16. The family left
the cult in 1977.
   The other children include Leaf, 14, who is also an actor;
Liberty, 12; and Summer, 11.

<HEAD>Terrorism Experts: Many Explosives Not Detectable by X-Ray</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many explosives cannot be detected by
conventional technology and only intensive questioning of passengers
can prevent bombings of commerical airliners, Israeli terrorism
experts said Thursday.
   The experts displayed a replica of an explosive-laden suitcase
believed similar to one suspected in the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   They said the hard-sided bag could hold two to 44 pounds of
plastic explosive concealed in a false bottom.
   ``This kind of device is very hard to detect. By relying on the
traditional kind of X-raying used in Europe and the United States,
it is almost impossible,'' said Menachem Bacharach of International
Consultants on Targeted Security, an Israeli company specializing in
aviation security.
   ``It is better to concentrate on the passenger and whether he
exhibits suspicious behavior during questioning,'' Bacharach said.
   The suitcase and a replica of a radio-cassette tape player fitted
with about one pound of explosives seized from Palestinian
guerrillas in Frankfurt in October are among the devices to be
displayed at an international seminar on aviation security to be
held Feb. 5-9 in Tel Aviv.
   Civil aviation authorities and security heads of airports and
airlines from 25 countries will attend the conference, aimed at
improving air security worldwide.
   The replica of the radio displayed Thursday contained coils of
brown clay instead of plastic explosives.
   Bacharach said his company planted the dummy radio on a woman
employee to try to test security in six European airports in
November and early December.
   He said the radio was discovered by security officials in five of
the airports after the woman was subjected to intensive questioning.
In one airport, the officials identified the woman as suspicious but
did not find the radio hidden in her hand luggage.
   ``In each case, the X-ray monitor ... failed to detect the radio.
Only when the security officials emptied the suitcase and went
through it item by item, did they discover something was wrong,''
Bacharach said.
   He said the task of detecting hidden explosives was made more
difficult by the fact that electrical appliances containing the
devices often operate normally.
   Many devices also are detonated by timers that cannot be detected
by immersion in decompression chambers frequently used by airlines
to test for explosives, Bacharach said.

<HEAD>France Elevates Status of PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand said Thursday that
France plans to elevate the status of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Paris to a ``general delegation.''
   The president, speaking to reporters at the Elysee Palace, said
France recognized only states possessing a territory and thus was
unable to accord the PLO representation diplomatic status and
privileges. But he said Paris had to take into account the recent
decisions of the PLO in Algiers.
   Mitterrand did not indicate when the change would be made.
   There are two ``general delegations'' in Paris, representing
North Korea and Quebec. The PLO currently operates an ``office of
liaison and information,'' directed by Ibrahim Souss.
   A French Foreign Ministry official said a ``general delegation''
was a title that did not carry the same status and privileges as a
diplomatic mission. The official was unable to specify exactly what
the change would mean, but said the move clearly was a ``significant
and symbolic gesture toward the PLO.''
   On Nov. 15, the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament
in exile, declared an independent Palestine, without specifying its
borders, accepted unequivocally U.N. Resolution 242, implicitly
recognizing Israel, and renounced terrorism.
   Even more explicit statements on recognition of Israel and
denunciation of terrorism were pronounced by PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat in Geneva last month, prompting the United States to make its
first official contact with the guerrilla organization.
   Dozens of countries have recognized the state of Palestine, as
represented by the PLO.
   Mitterrand said the declarations by the PLO at Algiers
``unquestionably advanced things.''
   ``If there is no Palestinian country today, there is a
renaissance of the Palestinian nation,'' the president said.
   Asked about an eventual meeting with Arafat, Mitterrand said: ``I
certainly would not refuse, under conditions that I would define.''

   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard gave this
second-by-second chronology Thursday of the incident in which two
U.S. Navy jets shot down two Libyan MiG-23 fighters over the
Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday.
   All times are local time, which is seven hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time.
   11:55 a.m. _ A U.S. E-2 electronic surveillance plane reported
spotting two MiG-23 Floggers airborne from Al Bumbah, passing from
land over the sea.
   11:57 a.m. _ The Navy F-14s report radar contact with the MiGs at
a range of 72 nautical miles and an altitude of 10,000 feet, moving
to 8,000 feet, and traveling at a speed of 430 knots.
   11:57 a.m. _ The MiGs are reported on a bearing of 180 degrees at
a range of 61 nautical miles, on a course of 330, northeast, at
8,000 feet; the bearing, 180 degrees from the F-14s, or straight at
them.
   11:58 a.m., 17 seconds _ The F-14s turn left 20 degrees at 20,000
feet in order to avoid the approaching MiGs. ``This is the first
avoidance maneuver,'' Howard said.
   11:58 a.m. and 24 seconds _ The MiGs turn right, descend to 5,000
feet, still at 430 knots. ``This is their first turn toward the
F-14s,'' Howard said.
   11:58 and 43 seconds _ The F-14s descend to 3,000 feet. The MiGs
are now at 53 nautical miles, coming head on. The F-14s turn left to
course 140 in the second avoidance maneuver.
   11:59 a.m. _ The MiGs are at 49 nautical miles.
   11:59 a.m. and 16 seconds _ The MiGs change course to 340 and
increase speed to 500 knots to come back into head-on position
toward the F-14s.
   11:59 a.m. and 26 seconds _ The F-14s accelerate and turn right
in their third avoidance maneuver.
   11:59 a.m. and 38 seconds _ The commander of the F-14 patrol
takes the first step in preparing his weapons for firing.
   11:59 and 49 seconds _ The MiGs are at 35 nautical miles and they
turn again directly toward the F-14s, for the third time, and the
MiGs are at an altitude of about 7,000 feet.
   Noon and eight seconds _ The F-14s turned right to 210 degrees in
their fourth maneuver to avoid the MiGs.
   Noon and 15 seconds _ The number two F-14 aircraft reports that
its weapon-firing radar has a fix on the second MiG.
   Noon and 20 seconds _ The MiGs turn into a head-on position for
the fourth time.
   Noon and 26 seconds _ The F-14s turn left in their fifth
avoidance maneuver.
   Noon and 53 seconds _ The MiGs turn back into the F-14s for the
fifth time.
   Noon and 57 seconds, the lead F-14 reports that a MiG is again on
a collision course, and the airborne warfare officer, assisting the
pilot on the two-man plane, prepares the weapons for immediate
firing.
   12:01 p..m. and 20 seconds, the first Sparrow missile is fired by
the lead F-14 at a MiG at a distance of 12 nautical miles. The MiGs
are now traveling at 550 knots and accelerating.
   12:01 p.m. and 32 seconds _ The second Sparrow missile is fired
at 10 nautical miles. The second F-14 reports the MiGs in sight at
five to six nautical miles.
   12:01 p.m. and 45 seconds _ The MiGs turn sharply toward the
second F-14.
   12:01 p.m. and 53 seconds _ The second F-14 visually identifies
the two MiG-23s at five nautical miles.
   12:01 p.m. and 57 seconds _ The second F-14 fires a Sparrow
missile at the No. 2 MiG.
   12:02 p.m. and six seconds _ The second F-14 breaks away to the
right and reports a good hit on the second MiG.
   12:02 p.m. and 36 seconds _ The lead F-14 fires a Sidewinder
missile at the lead MiG. The pilot of the lead F-14, the commander,
reports sighting both of the hits, sighting the ejection seats
firing on both of the MiGs and reports two seeing two parachutes
coming down.
   12:03 p.m. and two seconds _ Both F-14s turned north back towards
the carrier.

   Every day's a holiday in Yogi Ward's taxi.
   ``It's a happy cab,'' says Ward, who decks out his cab according
to the season of the year. This being the New Year's season, the cab
is decked out with flashing light and tinsel that brushes
passengers' heads as they parade through the city.
   But that's not all. Ward plays cassettes of his own weather
reports, news items, and offers words of wisdom.
   ``If you're out there ... smoking, bebopping or doing something
that you're not supposed to be doing ... the police are out in
droves and they'll be waiting for you,'' says Ward's tape for the
New Year.
   Ward, 44, figures he'll keep the New Year's decorations for a few
weeks, before it's time to bring out the pink paper hearts, arrows
and cupids for Valentine's Day.
   ``Everyone loves it and nobody wants me to take the decorations
down,'' he said. ``People are waving at me down the street. I had a
police paddy wagon wave at me. State troopers wave at me. An
ambulance tipped their lights at me.''
   Beverly Morris, a 36-year-old advertising saleswoman, has been a
Ward customer for about five years.
   ``It's a nice refreshing thing,'' she said. But even Mrs. Morris
admitted that she occasionally gets tired of the hoopla.
   ``Sometimes I have to act like I'm asleep,'' she said. ``He'll

   Luckily for the Howard family, Christmas
only comes once a year.
   The Howards awoke last weekend to dozens of telephone calls from
people eager to sell their Christmas trees. The Howards were
somewhat surprised, since they had no interest in buying Christmas
trees, even ones that were only used once.
   The family soon tracked down the source of the calls: a
classified ad in the Tribune-Review of Greensburg. It read:
``Wanted: used Christmas trees. Will pay $5-$10 ea.'' The ad
included the Howards' telephone number and Hempfield Township
address.
   Family members said they didn't place the ad.
   ``The first callers were nice when we explained the mistake,''
said Mrs. Howard, who declined to give her first name. ``But others
have called and gotten quite angry when we tell them we ... don't
want their trees.''
   She said one man demanded payment after telling her he had
collected more than 150 trees on a flatbed truck.
   ``He was one of the more angry ones,'' she said Thursday.
   The family has not yet discovered who placed the ad.

<HEAD>Central Committee Urges Mass Rehabiliation of `Troika' Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Thursday urged mass
rehabiliation of victims of the feared ``troikas'' _ the summary
courts that carried out Josef Stalin's bloody purges.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee, saying progress
depends on rectifying the past, recommended that top government
bodies pass a law ``to consider rehabilitated all citizens repressed
by decisions of these organs.''
   Such a recommendation from a top party body is certain to be
approved by the government.
   It was not clear how many cases among the millions of people
killed, imprisoned or exiled by Stalin would be affected by the
action, which was announced on the evening TV news program
``Vremya'' and carried by the Tass news agency.
   But it was apparent the party believes consideration of Stalin's
repression is keeping the country from focusing on its future, and
that it was seeking quick resolution of as many cases as possible.
   The ``troikas'' were so named because they consisted of three
local officials: the head of the secret police, the Communist Party
leader and prosecutor. Western historians say they had the power to
inflict death penalities, often without any reference to the Soviet
penal code.
   The Central Committee said their decisions must be overturned
because the troikas had no legal standing.
   It said the work of special boards formed under a corrective
labor law that usually consisting of secret police, police and
government officials who often passed hundreds of sentences a day
also must be undone by the same government directive.
   ``Restoration of historical, legal justice now has taken on a
huge political meaning,'' the Central Committee statement said.
``Much of our movement on the road to forming a government of
socialist law, social consciousness, depends on it.''
   ``Society, relatives and those close to the victims are awaiting
full rehabiliation of all the innocent and perpetuation of their
memory,'' it said.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Soviet society has reopened
the wounds of Stalin's purges, and the dictator himself is regularly
and bitterly criticized both in private and public. Gorbachev has
endorsed an initiative to build a monument to the victims of Stalin.
   Western references say the Cheka, the forerunner of today's KGB,
set up ``troika'' courts as early as April 1918, less than a year
after the Bolshevik Revolution and during the time of Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin. But the Central Committee directive specifically
limited the scope of the rehabiliation to the period of Stalin's
absolute power, from 1930 until his death in 1953.
   The Central Committee statement said it is essential to speed up
the work of legally rectifying the standing of those who were
killed, imprisoned, or exiled by Stalin.
   Thousands of Stalin's victims were given back their good names
after Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced the dictator in a secret speech
to the party in 1956, three years after Stalin died.
   The work stalled under Leonid I. Brezhnev, but picked up again
under Gorbachev. In February, prominent Bolshevik leader Nikolai I.
Bukharin, who was convicted in a 1937 show trial and executed, was
cleared by the Soviet Supreme Court of any wrongdoing.
   The court in 1988 also cleared many other prominent leaders
purged by Stalin, but the cases of thousands of little-known people
remain untouched.
   Politburo member Mikhail Solomentsev told the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda in August that a special Politburo commission he
headed had cleared the names of 636 people. Solomentsev was
dismissed by Gorbachev at the end of September.
   The directive said the mass rehabilitation should not apply to
war criminals or those who committed treason during World War II.

   A federal appeals court, ruling in a
trademark-infringement case, today spared Toyota Motor Corp. from an
embarrassing scramble to mask the nameplates on its Lexus luxury
cars premiering at a major auto show.
   But the court said the Japanese automaker cannot advertise the
brand nationally until the trademark dispute is settled.
   The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
came as Toyota unveiled its Lexus line at the North American Auto
Show here.
   Mead Data Central Inc., which provides a computerized legal
information service called Lexis, has sued Toyota over its use of
the name Lexus.
   Mead won a lower-court order barring use of the name, but Toyota
received a stay last week. Today's ruling by Circuit Judge Emilia
Kearse extends the stay at least until Jan. 30, when the court will
hear arguments in the case.
   Kearse ruled that Toyota may continue to use the Lexus name at
the auto show and at other expositions but cannot advertise the name
nationally in the meantime.
   Before the ruling, Toyota officials had nervously wondered
whether they would have to cover up the names of the cars at their
swank display booth.
   ``Essentially, they have given each side part of what it
wanted,'' said Charles J. Farouki, a Mead attorney.
   Arthur D. Gray, a Toyota attorney, said, ``We're pleased with the
result.''
   Reporters got a preview of the auto show in Detroit's Cobo Hall.
The opens to the public Saturday and runs through Jan. 15.
   ``Our most immediate job is to earn name recognition for Lexus,''
said Jim Perkins, senior vice president for Toyota Motor Sales USA,
the American subsidiary of the automaker. ``Unfortunately, we're
doing it the hard way.''
   The Lexus booth features two four-door sedans, the LS400 and
ES250, which cost from $20,000 to $40,000.

<HEAD>Jet Training Move Being Explored to Ease Strains over West Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Air Force is considering
moving some jet fighter training missions to Morocco as a way to
ease the burden over densely populated West Germany, the Air Force's
European chief said Thursday.
   Gen. William L. Kirk, in an interview with The Associated Press,
also staunchly defended the need to keep up low-level training
missions to have a ``mission ready'' force in central Europe.
   The training missions have caused controversy in West Germany
because of military jet crashes in the country.
   The Air Force announced Kirk will retire in April. The
56-year-old Louisiana native will be replaced by Lt. Gen. Michael J.
Dugan, now based in Washington.
   ``We're looking at the possibility of moving some training
missions to Morocco,'' Kirk said in his office at the U.S. Air Base
in Ramstein. The base was the site of a fiery crash of an Italian
air force stunt team that killed 70 people at an air show in August.
   Kirk, the Air Force's commander in chief in Europe, said talks
between U.S. and Moroccan officials are at a ``very preliminary
stage.''
   ``We have on previous occasions deployed U.S. aircraft to Morocco
for joint training with the Moroccan air force,'' he said.
   Morocco, an Arab nation in northern Africa, is known for its
generally moderate, pro-Western stance. Kirk would not give any
other information about the possibility of moving training missions
there.
   The general said an ``export'' of low-flying fighter training to
other countries was one way to ease the burden on West Germany, but
he acknowledged that finding countries willing to accept more
training missions would be difficult.
   On Tuesday, NATO pilots resumed tactical flights over West
Germany after a three-week moratorium sparked by the Dec. 8 crash of
a U.S. military jet in the northern city of Remscheid. The crash
killed five West Germans and the U.S. pilot.
   Low-level flights are defined as those involving dives below 250
feet, but in the public debate the term has been blurred to the
extent that it sometimes includes flights below 10,000 feet.
   The U.S. Air Force reduced low-flying missions by about 40
percent from 1981 to 1987 and has reached ``the point beyond which
we can't reduce any further and still maintain mission-ready
status,'' Kirk said.
   He added, ``I can understand the burden on the people.''
   However, Kirk said the recent flying moratorium had seriously
hurt the five fighter wings comprising 350 jets in West Germany.
   ``You can't just not fly for three to four weeks and then all of
a sudden turn it back on,'' Kirk said. ``We are at a point where the
civilian leadership within the NATO alliance needs to say one way or
the other whether or not we're going to maintain mission-ready
status in the Federal Republic (West Germany).''

<HEAD>Man Jailed For Making Bomb Hoax So Friend Could Catch Plane</HEAD>

   A man was sentenced to a year in jail
Thursday for making a bomb threat against an airline so that his
girlfriend could catch her flight.
   Naveed Aslam admitted to giving false information that delayed a
British Airways flight from London to Casablanca for almost four
hours in August.
   Chichester Crown Court judge Peter Crocker said he sentenced
Aslam ``so that people will know if bomb threats are made in respect
of aircraft that (jail) is going to be the result.''
   British Airways asked for $38,000 in compensation.
   The incident occurred after a three-day visit by Aslam's
29-year-old girlfriend from Morocco. She overslept, and they were
hurrying to London's Gatwick Airport, when he pulled over to make
the call.
   Aslam, a 22-year-old store manager from southwest London, said
there was a bomb aboard Boeing 737, which had 89 people aboard.
   The flight was delayed 3 hours, 55 minutes as a result, but Aslam
was arrested at the airport when ticket office staff became
suspicious. It was not known if his girlfriend made her flight.
   Defending attorney Diana Ellis, said: ``If Mr. Aslam had been
aware of matters today back in August, his offense would never have
occurred.''
   She referred to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21,
which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in
Scotland.

<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff-designate John
Sununu had other matters on his mind Thursday, his last day as
governor, namely a $5 claim against the state and security at a pig
farm.
   During their last meeting under his administration, Sununu and
the Executive Council approved paying Kenneth Kaslow of Jackson
$5.22 for damage to his car from a bottle that fell off a state
garbage truck.
   Though an auto-body shop estimated the repairs at $100, Kaslow
said that a can of touch-up paint would suffice.
   Sununu and the council also approved spending $2,500 for the
state police to protect Department of Environmental Services workers
at a pig farm in Mason. The department ordered tests to determine
the impact of a manure storage lagoon at the farm.
   But the farm's owner ``at times has been unreasonable and
threatening,'' said Alden Howard, environmental services
commissioner.

<HEAD>Quayle Tours Inaugural Headquarters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle toured the
Inaugural Committee headquarters Thursday, picked up his
personalized ``QUAYLE'' license plate and deflected queries about
his role in the Bush-Quayle administration.
   ``You're asking the wrong question,'' Quayle said the third time
he was asked by reporters following him on his tour.
   The job, he explained, is ``vice president of the United States
of America. There are a lot of tasks, a lot of responsibilities and
a lot of serious challenges that I'll be working with George Bush
on. You'll see after I become vice president.''
   Taking his cue from a Bush line, Quayle said, ``Tune in and watch
exactly what we do. I am going to work as hard as possible to become
a very effective vice president, and I think that I'll be able to
meet that challenge.''
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn picked up tickets for the Inaugural
galas and thanked hundreds of volunteers during their tour of the
remote federal facility serving as the nerve center for the
inaugural events starting in a fortnight.
   The envelope-stuffers paused to greet the Quayles, but not all
work stopped.
   ``We have not closed down telemarketing,'' John Gartland,
director of tickets, confided to Inaugural co-chairmen Bobby Holt
and Penne Percy Korth as they escorted the Quayles on their rounds.
   Gartland's operation, selling tickets to all inaugural events
including coveted $175 tickets to the official Inaugural balls, will
bring in most of the $20 million needed to pay for all the pomp,
parades and other trappings of inauguration week.
   The red-white-and-blue Inaugural license plates are expected to
raise another $2.5 million. As the Quayles affixed their new plate
to the family van _ supplanting an ordinary Indiana plate with the
numbers ``35 x 60'' _ aides were distributing news releases on how
the public can buy Inaugural plates for $50. They can be used on any
road in America until March 31.
   There are also red Inaugural Christmas tree balls for $7.50,
bronze medallions for $29.95, neck ties for $30, cufflinks for $25,
a $30 frame for the Inaugural Invitation, and umbrellas for $20 _ or
$30 to fit golfers.
   ``It's people like you that make the clock go round,'' Quayle
told a roomful of envelope-stuffers at the start of the 75-minute
tour. ``You will have a small but very important part in that
historic occasion.''
   Elsewhere, he met 75 military volunteers, from major generals to
privates, all part of the 916-strong Armed Forces Inaugural
Committee. ``Am I back in the Senate Armed Services Committee?'' the
former Indiana senator quipped.
   Quayle said he had been briefed by Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci about the downing of two Libyan jet fighters in
Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday.
   ``I believe that our pilots took the responsive and defensive
action. It was fully justified. ... They were, in their judgment,
under hostile attack by the Libyan planes. They took appropriate
defensive measures,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Pork Producers Seek Import Duties on Canadian Pork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Pork Producers Council said
Thursday it has formally asked the U.S. government to impose import
duties on pork products from Canada, claiming that the Canadian meat
is subsidized and competes unfairly with American hog farmers.
   Council President Ray Hankes said a petition was filed Jan. 4
with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Commerce
Department asking that countervailing duties be imposed on fresh,
chilled and frozen pork products from Canada.
   State pork associations and a number of U.S. meat packing
companies also signed the petition. A ruling on the council's
petition is expected in about six months, he said.
   ``A countervailing duty would eliminate the unfair advantage
Canadian farmers have over U.S. pork producers because the Canadian
government subsidizes its hog production,'' Hankes said in a
statement released here. ``Canadian pork producers can benefit from
more than 20 potential subsidy programs.''
   There has been an import duty on live hogs from Canada since July
1985, a move that was upheld by the U.S. Court of International
Trade during a lengthy appeals process.
   But the American producers contend that the import duty on live
hogs doesn't prevent Canada from slaughtering its hogs and shipping
the pork to U.S. markets. The Commerce Department ruled in 1985 that
the import duties on pork products were justified.
   The U.S. Court of International Trade, acting on an appeal by the
Canadian Meat Council, overruled the Commerce decision.
   As a result, Canada has increased its shipments of pork into the
United States by more than 52 percent since 1984, Hankes said.
   The council also said that imports of Canadian pork have reduced
the revenues of U.S. hog producers by as much as $3.37 per 100
pounds of hogs marketed in the first nine months of 1988, according
to a study by economist Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's oldest astronomical
treasures, the mothballed 100-inch telescope at the Mount Wilson
Observatory in California, will be recommissioned under a new
ownership plan for the facility, the Carnegie Institution announced
Thursday.
   The institution, which built the observatory in 1904 and has
operated it since, retired the big Hooker telescope in 1985 as it
shifted its priorities to development of more powerful instruments
at its new observatory in Las Campanas, Chile.
   For three decades, the Hooker telescope, completed in 1917, was
the world's largest, and the prototype for all modern-day reflecting
telescopes. Its 100-inch mirror, weighing 4{ tons, was cast by a
French bottle-making company.
   Despite mothballing the Hooker, the Carnegie Institution has
continued to operate three other research telescopes at Mount
Wilson. Under the plan announced Thursday, the entire observatory
will be transferred to the new Mount Wilson Institution, headed by
Carnegie veterans, over the next two years and will be independently
financed, largely from government grants.
   The arrangement was worked out primarily by George Preston,
former observatory director and now a chief scientist there. Preston
called the plan ``a rebirth for the observatory, and one that will
make the best use of the facilities.''
   Not only will the Hooker telescope be recommissioned within a
year, he said, but it will be fitted with high-tech computer
controls and instruments over two to three years. He said also that
overall research at the observatory will be expanded under plans to
double the operating budget, to $750,000, and to add several more
scientists to the five teams already at work there.
   During the 1920s, Carnegie astronomers Edwin Hubble and Milton
Humason, using the Hooker telescope, established that the ``spiral
nebulae'' in the night sky were other galaxies, made up of billions
of stars and located far outside the Milky Way, the galaxy that
contains the Earth. Thus, the size of the universe then known by
astronomers expanded almost a thousand-fold overnight.
   But growing light pollution from nearby Los Angeles has in recent
years virtually destroyed Hooker's biggest claim to fame _ that
ability to study faint, distant galaxies _ and was a major factor in
Carnegie's decision to focus its efforts in Chile.
   However, Preston and Arthur Vaughn said the Hooker telescope, at
5,700 feet altitude, remains an ideal tool for studying the sun and
for detecting planets around stars in the Milky Way. It also will be
used to study ``starspots,'' similar to the sunspot activity once
thought to be unique to the sun.

   The Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee will hold a plenary meeting Jan. 10 to set the slate of
party candidates for spring elections to a new government body, news
reports said Thursday.
   The ruling 13-member party Politburo set the date for the meeting
of the approximately 300 members of the Central Committee at a
session in Moscow on Thursday. A report on the Politburo meeting was
carried on the nightly TV news program ``Vremya'' and distributed by
the Tass news agency.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's governmental reform
approved by the Supreme Soviet parliament last month,
multicandidates elections March 26 will choose 2,250 members of the
new Congress of People's Deputies.
   The congress, in turn, will choose the president and a smaller,
more active Supreme Soviet.
   A third of the congress members will be elected from geographical
districts formed on the basis of equal population. Another third
will be chosen from districts based on their ethnic group. The final
third will be chosen from the Communist Party, Young Communist
League, trade unions, and other social and professional
organizations.
   Under the law the Communist Party is entitled to 100 deputies.
   The Politburo said it received recommendations for candidates
from individual party members and local party organizations as well
as the parties of the 15 Soviet republics, and expressed
satisfaction with how the nominations were made.
   ``It is noted that the selection of candidates has a democratic
nature, proceeds from below, that many party organizations have
taken an active party in it,'' the report said.
   ``It has been decided to submit the proposals for the
consideration of the plenum of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee to be held on Jan. 10, 1989,'' the report said.
   The report did not say whether any other issues will be discussed
at the plenum. Top-level personnel changes and major party policy
decisions must go to such a meeting of the Central Committee for
approval.
   Soviet officials already have said two other plenary meetings are
likely this year, one on agriculture and one on ethnic relations.
   The campaign for seats in the Congress of People's Deputies began
Dec. 26.

<TEXT>
   A Senate chairman on Thursday asked
President-elect Bush to direct the FBI to investigate a newspaper's
allegations that a Bush Cabinet nominee served in a GOP unit
``riddled with former Nazi collaborators.''
   A California paper, the Oakland Tribune, raised questions in an
editorial Dec. 28 about Edward Derwinski, Bush's choice to be the
first head of the newly created Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Through a spokesman, Derwinski said the charges amounted to
``guilt by association.''
   The editorial said that in 1972 Derwinski, a former Republican
congressman from Cook County, Ill., headed the executive board of
the Heritage Groups for Re-election of the President, active in
Richard Nixon's re-election campaign, and this year co-chaired
Bush's Coalition of American Nationalities.
   Several members of the coalition resigned last summer after the
Washington Jewish Week said they had pro-fasict or anti-Semitic
records during World War II.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who will preside over the Senate
Veterans Affairs Committee's confirmation hearings on Derwinski's
nomination, asked Bush in a letter to direct the FBI to look into
the editorial's charges in the course of ``its customary background
investigation.''
   Cranston asked to see the FBI's findings before the Senate
hearings are conducted this month or in February.
   Derwinski has served in the State Department since 1983. He
became undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and
technology last year.
   Derwinski was not available for comment, but a spokesman, Bill
Anderson, said of the editorial: ``It is guilt by association. He
has had nothing to do with the hiring or the service of those
mentioned in this article. Anyone who examines his record in
support, for example, of Jewish organizations, or as a diplomat in
Israel, can categorically rule out any anti-Semitism on his part.''
   Anderson said Derwinski had lent his name to Republican ethnic
committees in every presidential election campaign since 1960.
   Cranston, in his letter, said he had talked about the editorial
with Derwinski on Wednesday during ``a nice meeting with him to
discuss the forthcoming nomination.''
   He sent Bush a copy of the editorial and wrote, ``As you can see
the editorial raises serious charges about his (Derwinski's) `record
of service in an organization riddled with former Nazi
collaborators' and `his alleged role in passing U.S. secrets to the
South Korean CIA in the late 1970s.''
   The editorial said those questions should be answered before
Derwinski is approved by the Senate.
   ``Those questions are apt, given Derwinski's record of service in
an organization riddled with former Nazi collaborators and his
alleged role in passing U.S. secrets to the South Korean CIA in the
late 1970s,'' the editorial said.
   ``The record certainly doesn't prove that Derwinski is a closet
Nazi sympathizer or a foe of democracy,'' the editorial said. ``But
it does call into profound question his judgment, in particular his
willingness to turn a blind eye to the background and beliefs of
notorious colleagues if they share his anti-communism.''
   The paper quoted Russ Bellant, author of a study published by
Political Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., as saying that
``at least four people charged with war crimes were in leadership
positions'' of the 1972 Republican group Derwinski headed.
   The editorial also said that during a 1977 House investigation of
alleged South Korean influence peddling on Capitol Hill, Derwinski
appeared to be responsible for leaking to the Korean government the
defection of an official of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.
   But Anderson said the House Ethics Committee investigated and
cleared Derwinski of tipping off the South Korean government.
   ``It's a non-event,'' Anderson said.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's outgoing government has
ordered the cancellation of sharp price increases of electricity and
rail transport, newspapers reported Thursday.
   A wave of steep price increases on other essential services and
foodstuffs hit Yugoslavs when shops opened after the New Year's
holiday.
   Yugoslavia's government resigned Dec. 30 following its failure to
curb a 250 percent annual inflation rate and solve the country's
other economic and social problems. It was the first federal cabinet
to step down since the communists took power after World War II.
   Branko Mikulic will stay in office as a caretaker premier until
the nine-member federal presidency names a new premier, expected by
the end of January. Mikulic then will appoint his new Cabinet by the
end of February, the state Tanjug news agency said Thursday.
   Early speculation in the state-run press on who will become
Yugoslavia's new premier centered on Ante Markovic, former head of
the Croatian government and a supporter of radical market-oriented
reforms, and Oskar Kovac, a prominent Belgrade economist and former
Cabinet minister who resigned over disagreements with Mikulic.
   Also mentioned was Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's ambitious
hardline Communist Party chief, but it is considered highly unlikely
that he would get support from Yugoslavia's other five republics and
two provinces.
   The outgoing government has canceled a 70 percent price increase
of electricity originally due to take effect on Thursday after
widespread protests by consumers all over the country.
   Yugoslavia's state-run railroad companies, however, defied the
government's order to freeze their prices temporarily, charging 34.7
percent higher rates for passengers and 51.6 percent more for cargo
as of Jan. 1.
   ``As soon as they heard that the government had fallen, the
railroad companies decided to ignore the order to cancel the price
hikes,'' the Vecernje Novosti newspaper said.
   The price increases would boost the country's rampant inflation
and lead to further drop in living standards, which have already
fallen to the level of the mid-1960s, according to official
statistics.
   The last time the prices of electricity and rail transport were
considerably increased was in October.
   The new price increases ranged form 30 percent to 500 percent on
food, drinks, cars, newspapers and nearly all services.
   Nearly 1,400 strikes took place last year amid public calls for
the introduction of a multiparty system as a solution to the
protracted Yugoslav crisis.

<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what may be the ultimate no-win
battle among environmentalists, a wildflower preserve has been
killing muskrats that eat its rare flora, drawing the wrath of
animal rights activists.
   ``The muskrat is a very common animal, and some of the plants we
grow are very uncommon,'' David R. Longland, director of the
preserve, said Thursday. ``We have to manage for the best overall
conservation, and sometimes that favors plants over animals.''
   But the Framingham Humane Society contends there ought to be a
little more muskrat love at the 45-acre Garden in the Woods
preserve. It says that trapping muskrats merely encourages the
remaining ones to reproduce faster, providing little more than a
quick fix to the delicate problem of balance between flora and fauna.
   The society also maintains the underwater Conibear traps, which
break the muskrats' necks, pose a danger to humans and pets. It is
lobbying for a ban on the use of those and all steel-jaw, leg-hold
traps in Framingham, a suburb of 45,000 people about 20 miles west
of Boston.
   ``These are dangerous things. They don't belong in a civilized
urban environment,'' said society member Mary Anne Wyatt.
   Garden in the Woods was founded in 1931 and has been owned by the
3,400-member New England Wildflower Society since 1965. An island of
calm in the middle of Framingham, it contains 1,400 plant species in
a natural setting interwoven with three miles of footpaths.
   Longland, 37, said Garden in the Woods has been trapping muskrats
for at least five years, catching an average of one a year in its
lily pond. He said the preserve uses the spring-loaded, underwater
Conibear traps because they snap the animals' necks, killing them
instantly.
   ``The traps kill very humanely. We made sure of that,'' he said.
   Ms. Wyatt argued that the traps work correctly only if the prey
is the right size.
   ``They're totally non-specific _ they will catch anything that
comes to the water line,'' she said. ``Dogs, cats, waterfowl,
children.''
   Longland said Garden in the Woods decided to trap the muskrats
because they are voracious eaters of aquatic vegetation. Left
unchecked, he said, the furry, web-footed rodents threatened to wipe
out some of the colorful and unusual species _ like albino pickerel
weed, blue iris hookeri and pink pygmy water lilies _ that attract
20,000 visitors to the preserve each year.
   Carol A. Marchione, president of the humane society, said Garden
in the Woods should switch to using box traps, which capture
muskrats alive for relocating.
   But Longland said the preserve has already tried that _ as well
as chemical repellants, lining the banks of the lily pond with
stones, and covering rare plants with wire mesh.
   The muskrats spurned the box traps, even though the bait was a
tantalizing combination of apples scented with water lily extract.
Rain washed away the repellant, forcing repeated applications. When
the banks of the pond were packed with stones, the resourceful
creatures merely dug in from higher ground. And when the plants were
covered with mesh, the muskrats found a way to get through it.
   ``Nothing worked,'' Longland said. ``We've found that muskrats
will do whatever they have to do to eat.''
   Marchione said she believes that Garden in the Woods simply
misunderstands the problem with traps and has requested a meeting
next week to try to reach a solution.
   ``We're both conservationist-type societies, and we should be
able to work something out,'' she said.

death after beaching itself on a sand bar six weeks ago was returned
Thursday to its natural habitat far out in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Researchers say it is the first whale in the baleen family known
to have recovered and returned to the ocean.
   The 2-year-old Bryde's whale, nicknamed ``Brydie'' by its
rescuers, was trucked to St. Petersburg from Orlando on Wednesday in
a special water-filled container. From there, the whale and its
handlers sailed 120 miles southwest of Tampa beyond the continental
shelf aboard a Coast Guard cutter.
   The animal was hoisted overboard into the water with a crane
Thursday morning, Sea World spokesman Nick Gollattscheck said.
   Brydie was outfitted with a radio transmitter attached to her
dorsal fin so scientists can track her progress for about two months
when the transmitter is expected to slough off.
   Radio signals began almost immediately after Brydie was placed in
the water and swam away, said Jack Pearson, Sea World's curator of
marine mammals. Pearson, speaking by radio from the release vessel,
said the whale ``was doing fine.''
   The whale was emaciated and dehydrated and had bacterial
infections when she was discovered Nov. 25 near Honeymoon Island off
Clearwater.
   She was brought to Orlando and treated with antibiotics and a
rich high-calorie diet of smelt, krill and other fish.
   Brydie was released because ``we had reached a plateau in its
treatment,'' said another Sea World spokesman, Brad Andrews. ``You
stabilize the animal medically and feed it so many calories
artificially that you reach a point where you determine you've done
all you can. It's up to the animal then to start feeding itself a
more natural diet and get back to its natural habitat.''
   Baleen whales, one of two major groups of the mammals, include
the Bryde's humpback, pygmy right, gray and blue whales.
   Most of the whales that beach themselves die despite medical
treatment. They are usually fatally ill or diseased, suffer severe
trauma and other problems. But a small percentage can survive with
proper treatment, Sea World scientists say.

<HEAD>American Linguist Battles Dutch Defense Minister On Op-Ed Page</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American linguist Noam Chomsky has
accused the defense minister of being an ``apologist for serious
crimes'' during a months-long battle in a Dutch newspaper over human
rights abuses by dictatorships.
   In a feud that began in October, Defense Minister Frits
Bolkestein and the academician have traded verbal barbs via lengthy
contributions to the NRC Handelsblad, the Netherlands' newspaper of
record.
   In his most recent rejoinder, published in Wednesday's edition,
Bolkestein wrote that Chomsky, an outspoken critic of the U.S.
political establishment, ``has placed himself outside reality by
airing his extreme views.''
   Contacted by telephone in Cambridge, Mass., where he teaches
linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky
told The Associated Press Thursday that ``Bolkestein has been
telling outrageous lies.''
   ``Apparently, he doesn't believe in free speech,'' said the
outspoken Chomsky, who referred to Bolkestein as a ``fascist.''
   The controversy began when in October, when the newspaper printed
a page-long review by Bolkestein of two recent Chomsky books, ``The
Culture of Terrorism'' and ``The Chomsky Reader.''
   Bolkestein was a prominent legislator for the right-wing Liberal
party before being named to his current post in August, and his
review was accecpted before his cabinet nomination, according to
Paulus Smit, the newspaper editor handling the Chomsky-Bolkestein
exchange.
   In his review, headlined ``A Linguist's Grim Version Of
Reality,'' Bolkestein accused Chomsky of trivializing the mass
murders by the Cambodian Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
   ``For Chomsky, the genocide in Cambodia ... was a deliberate lie
(spread by the mass media) to cover up the real mass murders'' in
Central America perpetrated or supported by successive U.S.
governments, Bolkestein wrote.
   He also criticized Chomsky's defense of Robert Faurisson, a
French historian who has denied the existence of Nazi extermination
camps.
   Faurisson, a professor of literature, caused public outrage in
France 11 years ago by claiming that no Jews had ever been killed in
Nazi death camp gas chambers. The claim, published in French
newspapers, led to Faurisson's suspension from the University of
Lyon.
   In his October article, Bolkestein noted that Chomsky was one of
500 intellectuals who signed a petition defending Faurisson's
freedom of speech, and that the American linguist wrote a preface in
a Faurisson book in which Chomsky said he had found no traces of
anti-semitism in the French professor's work.
   ``To call Faurisson an apolitical kind of liberal is naive or
worse,'' Bolkestein wrote.
   In an extensive rejoinder published by NRC Handelsblad on Dec.
29, Chomsky accused the defense minister of ``trivializing cruelties
perpetrated by governments dependent of the United States and, as a
result, he is an apologist for serious crimes.''
   That was an apparent reference to Bolkestein's remark that human
rights abuses were not only committed by right-wing death squads in
Central America, but also by Sandinista government troops in
Nicaragua.
   On the Faurisson issue, Chomsky said that ``I have taken even
more extreme stands in the struggle to defend human liberties _ in
the 1960s, I have urged that American war criminals be allowed to
teach and do research, even if their work would lead to death and
destruction.''
   ``Faurisson was not even accused of war crimes,'' Chomsky wrote.

<HEAD>Bush Challenged to Spend Money for Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The education community on Thursday challenged
President-elect Bush to back up his promise to be the education
president by spending $10 billion more, including a down payment of
$2.5 billion.
   ``During the 1980s, education declined as a proportion and hence
as a priority in the federal budget,'' said Gerald Morris, president
of a 100-group coalition called the Committee for Education Funding.
``A four-year, $10 billion effort is needed to make education a
priority.''
   The committee said Bush should start by proposing $2.5 billion in
extra federal education spending for fiscal 1990.
   In the committee blueprint, most of the money _ $1.6 billion _
would go to programs for disadvantaged students of all ages, from
remedial tutoring to college tuition grants. Another $768 million
would cover the cost of inflation for all federal education
programs, while $150 million would be reserved for presidential
initiatives and modest increases in small existing programs.
   In addition, the committee said Bush should earmark an extra $500
million for Head Start, the preschool program for disadvantaged
children that is administered by the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The committee plan comes amid congressional complaints over the
federal deficit and reports President Reagan will propose $35
billion in cuts in the budget he sends to Congress on Monday.
   The current Education Department budget is $21.9 billion _ $1.6
billion higher than fiscal 1988. The $2.5 billion increase sought by
the committee, to $24.4 billion, would be an 11 percent boost.
   ``We don't see that it's unrealistic or unattainable,'' said
Becky Timmons, vice president of the committee.
   Morris said reaction on Capitol Hill has been mixed. ``The coin's
still up in the air,'' he said. ``We'll see how it lands when it
falls.''
   Morris declined to comment on Bush's vow not to raise taxes or to
suggest where Bush should cut spending to finance the education
hikes. But he and others stressed they are encouraged by Bush's
campaign promises, his ``tone of moderation'' and his appointments
so far.
   ``We haven't had the luxury of working with the administration in
the last seven years because we've been on opposite sides of the
fence,'' Morris said. With Bush, ``we may have a very different and
warmer _ and certainly welcome _ environment.''
   Bush's priorities will become clear as he and his aides rework
Reagan's lame-duck document, and Education Department officials have
indicated changes will be made. Whether they will be substantial
enough to satisfy the education community is an open question.
   ``There's an education deficit analogous to the Grand Canyon,''
Morris said. ``To have someone throw in a shovel of dirt is not
going to solve the problem.''
   According to the committee, education spending accounted for 2.5
percent of the federal budget in fiscal 1979 but only 1.7 percent in
fiscal 1988. In the same time period, Pell grants to needy college
students went from covering 50 percent of all college expenses to 29
percent while the buying power of the maximum award declined 13
percent.
   Citing other aspects of what the ``education deficit,'' officials
said Head Start serves less than 20 percent of the children who
qualify for it; Chapter 1, the major federal program for
disadvantaged elementary and secondary school children, serves less
than half those eligible.
   In addition, they said federal money for educating handicapped
children now covers only 8 percent of per-pupil expenditures as
opposed to 12.5 percent in 1979.
   The committee is a non-profit, non-partisan coalition of groups
that represent more than 50 million students, parents, teachers,
administrators, presidents, librarians, counselors, trustees and
school board members. Virtually every major education group in the
country is a member.

<HEAD>US Gets Support, Condemnation for Chemical Weapons Claims</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Libya Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States got support Thursday from an ally and an
adversary for its claim that Libya is capable of producing chemical
weapons.
   The United States has alleged that Libya has a chemical weapons
plant at Rabta, south of the capital, Tripoli. Libya claims the
plant is for manufacturing pharmaceuticals.
   British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, visiting Abu Dhabi, lent
support to the U.S. claim when he told a news conference: ``We do
have independent information on Libya's chemical weapons program
showing their plant as a very large one and it is no doubt intended
for chemical weapons production.''
   In Washington, the State Department welcomed Britain's
announcement.
   ``We certainly feel gratified that the British have talked about
evidence that supports the allegations that we have made on this
question,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters. She declined
to say whether British officials had shared their information with
the U.S. government.
   In Moscow, a Soviet general gave his country's first
acknowledgement that Libya may be able to manufacture chemical
weapons, but he said such weapons would be in quantities too small
to wage war.
   As recently as Wednesday night, state-run Radio Moscow was
rejecting as ``groundless'' U.S. charges that Libya had developed a
chemical weapons plant.
   Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, deputy chief of Soviet chemical
weapons troops, told reporters in Moscow that ``Libya doesn't have
the industrial capacity to make toxic agents in sufficient
quantities to conduct warfare. But as far as a few kilograms
(pounds) of toxic agents goes, any serious chemical laboratory in
the world can make several kilos, say one to five kilos (five to 11
pounds) of toxic agents.''
   Kuntsevich spoke at a news briefing the Soviet government news
agency Novosti had called to discuss a five-day international
conference on chemical weapons that begins Saturday in Paris.
   Secretary of State George Shultz plans to use the meeting to
persuade more that 100 nations to impose sanctions on countries that
use poison gas.
   President Reagan has refused to rule out military action against
the plant, and Howe indicated Britain might not support such action.
   Asked if Britain would support a U.S. attack, the foreign
secretary declined to give a direct reply but noted: ``It must be
emphasized that chemical weapons capability is quite different from
the circumstances which we thought justified the action taken some
time ago.''
   He was referring to the April 1986 U.S. air raids on Tripoli and
Benghazi following charges of Libyan involvement in the bombing of a
West Berlin disco. Some of the U.S. bombers flew from bases in
Britain.
   Howe justified the downing of the two Libyan MiG-23 fighters by
U.S. Navy jets Wednesday as self-defense, and said the incident had
nothing to do with the Libyan plant.
   ``We've been given an account by the United States on what has
happened, from which it is clear that they acted in self-defense,''
he said.
   The Soviet Union denounced the action involving the Libyan
fighters. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov was quoted
by Tass as calling the act ``a show of political adventurism and
state terrorism.''
   In Rome, Italian government leaders appealed for restraint by
both sides.
   In a statement issued at the United Nations, the 101-nation
Non-Aligned Movement condemned the U.S. act as unprovoked aggression
and ``state terrorism'' and called on the United States to withdraw
its naval forces. Libya is a member of the movement.
   Kuwait and North Yemen condemned the U.S. action, and Persian
Gulf newspapers called for action against the United States for
``enforcing the law of the jungle.''
   Iraq, Syria and Iran denounced the action in statements
Wednesday. But moderate Arab governments, which have long kept their
distance from Libya's leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, avoided outright
attacks on the United States.
   Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Arab world, only voiced
``deep concern'' at the U.S. action and urged ``self-control and
wisdom'' to prevent a further crisis.

<HEAD>Marcos Released From Hospital; Lawyers Work On Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
released from a hospital before dawn Thursday, after a week's stay
for treatment of congestive heart failure.
   Marcos, 71, left by ambulance, accompanied by his wife, Imelda,
and several physicians, said St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman
Norma Kop.
   In previous hospital stays, newspapers, television and radio
stations were given notice of Marcos' arrivals and departures from
the hospital.
   Apparently stung by criticism that he sought media attention to
help his legal cause, Marcos was whisked from the hospital with no
fanfare Thursday. A Marcos employee contacted three hours after the
release claimed Marcos was still in the hospital.
   However, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad later confirmed that the
former president was resting at his Makiki Heights home. Trinidad
said he did not know why the move was made in secret.
   Kop said Marcos' doctors would issue no statement. ``He's gone,
that's all I can say and I don't think there will be any updates,''
Kop said.
   Marcos spent a week at St. Francis after suffering his ``second
severe case of congestive heart failure in a month,'' according to
Kop. He was hospitalized for nine days early last month suffering
the same symptoms.
   Congestive heart failure means the heart is too weak to pump the
amount of blood required by the body, causing chest pain, shortness
of breath and fatigue. It can be fatal.
   Tomas Gomez, the Philippine Consul General here, repeated his
assertions Thursday that Marcos exaggerated his medical plight.
   ``There is no doubt the guy is ill, but he already has a
mini-hospital at his home, so his hospitalization, and the media
hoopla that surrounds it, is a little fishy,'' Gomez said.
   Marcos' lawyers worked in Honolulu on Thursday on their strategy
for a Jan. 19 hearing in New York to determine whether Marcos is
healthy enough to be arraigned there.
   U. S. District Judge John Keenan is to base his decision on
medical evidence presented by the U.S. Attorney's Office, which
contends Marcos is healthy enough to travel, and testimony for the
defense, which says he's not.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Oct. 21 on federal
racketeering charges accusing them of plundering the Philippines'
economy and stashing much of the money in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5
million bail, but Marcos has not been arraigned because of ill
health.
   The Marcoses have lived in exile here since they were ousted in a
February 1986 popular uprising.

   Her joy tempered by bitterness, the mother
of a pardoned prison inmate said Thursday that her son was
``railroaded'' into serving nearly four years for a murder he never
committed.
   ``I think we have every right to be bitter,'' said Mel Shapiro,
the mother of David Vasquez. ``The system is too political. If we
had been wealthy, we could have bought our way out of it like a lot
of other people do.''
   Vasquez, 42, was released Wednesday from the Buckingham
Correctional Center in Dillwyn, where he was serving a 35-year
sentence for second-degree murder, after Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
signed an order granting him executive clemency.
   Baliles granted the full pardon after new evidence surfaced
indicating that Timothy Spencer, convicted of murdering two other
women, also killed the woman Vasquez was accused of murdering _
Carolyn Jean Hamm, a 35-year-old Washington lawyer.
   Ms. Shapiro said both she and her son were too excited to sleep
on his first night at home, and Vasquez ``was too excited to open
his Christmas presents. They're still under the tree.''
   ``Every once in a while, I'd just reach out and touch him and be
glad he's at home where he belongs,'' Ms. Shapiro said in a
telephone interview from her Manassas home.
   Vasquez finally went to sleep about 6 a.m. and was still asleep
at midday.
   Ms. Shapiro said the family may take legal action, either against
the state or against the defense counsel who encouraged Vasquez to
plead guilty to second-degree murder to avoid a possible death
sentence.
   ``But no amount of money can ever erase the bitterness and
heartache we've been put through,'' she said.
   Ms. Shapiro said police and prosecutors ``railroaded and
brainwashed'' Vasquez. ``They told him they had his fingerprints,
and they didn't. They told him he was seen at the scene of the
crime, but he wasn't. He was at home with me.''
   Ms. Hamm was raped and hanged from a pipe in the basement of her
Arlington home in January 1984.
   ``The crime occurred 35 miles from where we live,'' Ms. Shapiro
said. ``David doesn't drive. How was he supposed to get over there?
That's a question they never did answer.''
   Ms. Shapiro said she is thankful that Baliles granted the pardon,
but is upset with him for not acting sooner. She had hoped her son
would be home for Christmas.
   ``He went on vacations and sort of put this under the rug,'' Ms.
Shapiro said. ``I tried to call him a number of times, but he was
never available. I never talked to anyone but his secretaries.''
   The pardon, recommended by Arlington Commonwealth's Attorney
Helen Fahey, was reviewed by the Virginia Parole Board, the
Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office and the governor's executive
staff. It was placed on Baliles' desk in October.
   The new evidence that led to the pardon involved DNA testing,
also known as ``genetic fingerprinting.'' In such tests, the
molecular structure of body fluds and tissues from a crime scene is
matched with that of the suspect.
   DNA tests were used for the first time to convict Spencer of the
murders of Susan Tucker of Arlington and Debbie Davis of Richmond.
Such evidence indicated that Spencer also killed Ms. Hamm.
   Spencer, who faces two death sentences, is scheduled to go to
trial Jan. 17 in Richmond Circuit Court for the murder of Dr. Susan
Elizabeth Hellams, 32.

<HEAD>US Banks Still Troubled By Third World Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although loans to Third World countries won't
cause U.S. banks to fail, the banks will still need to absorb
billions of dollars in losses, the House Banking Committee was told
Thursday.
   The major money center banks, responsible for 85 percent of the
outstanding loans to the six biggest Third World borrowers, should
double the reserves they set aside to cover their exposure, said
Kenneth Pinkes, a vice president of Moody's credit rating service.
   ``The debtor countries, which have born a significant share of
adjustment costs, appear less willing to continue the rescheduling
process,'' Pinkes said.
   ``More importantly,'' he said, ``as the possibility of a major
financial crisis appears less likely, the priority of the U.S.
government seems to have shifted from the need to help the major
money center banks to the need to maintain political stability in
Latin America.''
   The major banks, which saw their credit rating plummet after the
Third World debt crisis appeared in 1982, have set aside reserves
equal to about 25 percent of their exposure to cover losses on the
loans in the past two years.
   But they haven't written the loans off and are still trying to
collect interest or swap them for equity shares in companies in the
lesser developed countries.
   ``Prices in the secondary market and the magnitude of the
single-risk exposures suggest a reserve level of at least 50
percent,'' Pinkes said. ``If the loans are only worth 40 cents on
the dollar, ultimately the accounting is going to have to catch up
with that.''
   Federal banking regulators acknowledged the exposure of the nine
money center banks is still too large, but said they no longer face
the danger of failing if the borrowers default.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said most of the regional banks have put the LDC (Less
Developed Countries) debt problem behind them.
   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
said U.S. bank exposure to the 15 major Third World debtors declined
by $8.6 billion between July 1987 and the same month last year to
$76 billion.
   ``A disproportionate share of this reduction was accounted for by
large regional banks, as distinct from the largest multinational
banks,'' he said. ``Nonetheless, the top nine banks reduced their
total exposure over the year by $2.6 billion (to $53 billion).''
   Meanwhile, the debt servicing capacity of the six largest
borrowers _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines and
Venezuela _ well exceeds the 40 percent value the secondary market
is now putting on the loans, Seidman said.
   Those countries account for $47 billion, or 85 percent, of the
Third World debt exposure of the nine money center banks _ Bank of
America, Manufacturers Hanover, Continental Illinois, Bankers Trust,
J.P. Morgan, First Chicago, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Citicorp.
   ``Even in what surely could be considered a worst-case scenario,
each of the nine money center banks could write off 100 percent of
their outstanding loans to these six countries and, on an after-tax
basis, each of these banks would remain solvent,'' Seidman said.

<HEAD>Town Prepares for Mass Funeral After House Fire Kills Ten</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REMER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools will close Friday as residents of
this tiny northern Minnesota town hold a mass funeral for six
victims of a New Year's Day house fire that also killed four other
people.
   Services will be held in the Northland High School gymnasium for
the four children of John and Nancy Watson and a neighbor's two
children, Robin and Michelle Bastle.
   John and Nancy Watson were away and the victims were asleep when
the fire broke out around 2 a.m. Sunday.
   The service will be televised by closed circuit to the elementary
school gym if there is an overflow crowd at the high school,
according to Mike Doro, principal of Remer Elementary School.
   Services for the other victims, Mrs. Watson's sister and
brother-in-law, Jean and Becky Smischney, and their two children,
Jay and Kimberly, will be held Saturday in Bemidji, where the family
is from.
   Doro said the mood at the elementary school is ``still quiet,
quieter than it has been at some times. Otherwise, things are pretty
much back to normal.''
   But members of the clergy and therapists trying to ease the pain
and bewilderment of the families and the town's 400 residents say
effects probably will linger long after the funerals.
   ``It left a big gap in this community,'' said the Rev. Jon
Erickson, pastor of Bethany Evangelical Lutheran Church. ``For the
first couple of days, people just kind of walked around speechless.''
   Investigators have ruled out a basement wood furnace as the
source of the blaze. Elmer H. Baltes, a deputy state fire marshal,
said faulty wiring still is considered a possibility, but the cause
may never be known conclusively because the intense fire destroyed
clues.

<HEAD>North Still Faces Tough Charges Over Cover-Up Of Iran-Contra Diversion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The narrow case that Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh has carved out against Oliver North targets the
cover-up of the Iran-Contra money diversion and contains the charges
even Walsh's critics thought were most likely to succeed.
   But the former White House aide would no longer be charged with a
direct crime for diverting money from Iranian arms sales to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   Walsh proposed Thursday to skirt a raging dispute over what
classified documents can be introduced by defense and prosecution by
dropping charges of conspiracy and theft of government property.
Those were the only remaining counts which charged a crime in
diverting the money.
   But if U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell accepts Walsh's motion,
North would still face 12 charges.
   Those 12 carry a cumulative, maximum penalty of 60 years in
prison and $3 million in fines, although federal judges simply do
not sentence first offenders to consecutive, maximum penalties on
all counts which produce guilty verdicts.
   Nine of these counts charge North with trying to prevent
discovery of his activities on behalf of the Contras, including
misleading Congress and Attorney General Edwin Meese and shredding
and altering government documents.
   The three other counts charge North with accepting a gratuity,
converting money to personal use and scheming to defraud the
Treasury of tax revenue.
   Of the nine cover-up-based counts, four relate directly to
concealing the diversion of arms sale money.
   It is these four that longtime government prosecutors, speaking
privately, always thought were Walsh's strongest charges.
   From the outset, Walsh confronted some legal problems. The Boland
amendment barring aid to the Contras did not carry its own criminal
penalties; some had argued it did not apply to the National Security
Council where North worked.
   The conspiracy charge that Walsh fashioned to embrace the entire
diversion effort was by no means unprecedented but it was an
aggressive use of the law to deal with these legal problems. Even
former top Justice Department officials were more comfortable with
the theft of government property charge which was based on the
diversion of the arm sale money.
   But Walsh's allies and critics alike were most impressed with
four cover-up charges based on North's actions after the sale of
U.S.-built missiles to Iran was disclosed in early November 1986.
   These counts charge North with obstructing Congress, obstructing
a presidential inquiry by Meese, false statements and removing,
falsifying and destroying official documents.
   The obstruction of Congress count charges North helped draft a
false chronology to guide testimony by administration officials to
Congress. Walsh charges he did this by having the document falsely
claim that no U.S. official learned before January 1986 that Hawk
missiles had been sold to Iran in November 1985. This count also
charges him with altering, destroying and removing National Security
Council documents between Nov. 21-25, 1986, that discussed the arms
sales and aid to the Contras.
   The count of obstructing Meese's fact-finding inquiry for
President Reagan charges North with falsely telling Meese in the
attorney general's office on Nov. 23 that the National Security
Council had no involvement in the diversion. This count also
mentions the document destruction and removal.
   The false statements count charges North with falsely telling
Meese at the same meeting that the Israelis determined how much of
the arms sale proceeds went to the Contras. This count also charges
that North falsely advised Meese that he had told Contra leader
Adolfo Calero to open Swiss accounts to receive that money when he
knew that the money had gone in accounts controlled by the
Secord-Hakim enterprise.
   The document destruction count says that from mid-November until
North's office was sealed by security agents on Nov. 25, 1986, he
altered, destroyed and removed documents about the arms sales and
aid to the Contras.
   For the document case, Walsh gave immunity early on to North's
secretary Fawn Hall in return for her description. Later, the public
heard her describe the shredding for Congress. To document the money
flow, Walsh has Swiss bank records and the cooperation of Hakim's
associate Willard Zucker.
   Meese testified at length to Walsh's grand jury, surely including
what North told him. Other participants in drafting the phony
chronology have recounted North's role.
   The other five cover-up-based accounts charge North with falsely
denying or causing others to falsely deny to Congress that North was
using other means to help the Contras with cash and military advice
besides the arms sale diversion. These counts are all based on
events before the arms sale was disclosed.
   The final three counts charge North with:
   _Taking a $13,800 security system for his home from Secord in
returning for steering the Iran-Contra business to Secord.
   _Paying personal expenses out of $4,300 in traveler's checks
given to him by Calero to help free U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   _And conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue on $3.2
million donated to the right-wing National Endowment for the
Preservation of Liberty by telling donors gifts were tax-exempt when
they were actually used for the non-tax-exempt purpose of military
aid to the Contras.

   States are making little headway meeting the
growing need for child care services, according to the Children's
Defense Fund's annual survey on child care funding released Thursday.
   With increasing numbers of women working, the number of children
needing child care also is growing, yet states have received little
help from the federal government, the children's advocacy group said.
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of working mothers with
children younger than 6 rose by 23 percent, said the sixth annual
survey, ``State Child Care Fact Book 1988.''
   Yet during that period, 26 states spent less in fiscal year 1988
for child care funded through the Title XX Social Services Block
Grant, the largest federal source of direct child care assistance to
poor families, than they did in fiscal 1981, when the dollars are
adjusted for inflation, the report said.
   In addition, 23 states are serving fewer children now than they
did in seven years ago, the group said.
   ``State child care efforts are too few, scattered and underfunded
to do the job,'' the report said. ``States alone will not be able or
willing to help the large number of low-income families needing
child care assistance. Nor will the states alone build a child care
system that ensures that all families have access to quality care.''
   The group called on Congress to approve the Act for Better Child
Care Services, which would authorize $2.5 billion to help low- and
moderate-income families pay for child care, to help states and the
private sector increase the supply of child care services and to
assure a minimum of safe child care.

<HEAD>State Investigating Death Of Retarded Woman Who Strangled On Bed
Railing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials and police are investigating the
death of a retarded woman who strangled on a bedrail at a state
school where workers were supposed to check on residents every 15
minutes, authorities said Thursday.
   Esther Franson, 64, who had lived at the Fernald State School for
36 years, died Nov. 21 when her head got caught between one of the
bed's side rails and the mattress, said the state medical examiner,
Dr. Michael Blackbourne.
   Since her death, a direct care worker was fired, a night nurse
was suspended and remodeling was ordered for the bedrails. A state
Department of Mental Retardation report is due Friday or early next
week on the incident, agency spokeswoman Maureen Sullivan said
Thursday.
   The suspended nurse, Esther Olofson, said she complained
repeatedly about workers sleeping on the job in the past and is now
at risk of being fired because she didn't awaken the workers that
night.
   ``We have very stringent rules that residents are checked every
15 minutes by the direct care staff,'' Ms. Sullivan said. Such
checks, she said, include looking in on residents at night to be
sure their breathing is regular and that they are adequately covered
with bedclothes.
   State police also are investigating.
   The death was ruled accidental, Blackbourne said. He said
strangulations from bedrails is ``not an infrequent situation. We do
see it periodically.''
   Ms. Sullivan said the bed was a new model and that since Ms.
Franson's death such beds were ordered modified at state schools for
the retarded. She knew of no similar incidents.
   The spokeswoman said nurses who see direct care workers sleeping
are obligated to inform the workers' supervisors immediately.
   Ms. Olofson had been hired in September and was still on
probation when the death occurred, Ms. Sullivan said.
   Ms. Olofson said she was giving tube feedings to patients Nov. 21
when a worker came to her about Ms. Franson.
   ``I fully expected to find a woman who was having seizures,'' the
nurse said. ``But when I got there, it was the most horrible
nightmare. Her head got caught in the bedrail, and she strangled to
death.''
   Ms. Olofson said that when she walked through the building the
morning of Nov. 21 dispensing medicine and setting up intravenous
feedings, she saw several staff members asleep in chairs and covered
with sheets.
   She said she didn't awaken them because she was not authorized to
do so and in the past had been threatened by some workers.

   Afghan guerrillas agreed to meet with
a Soviet diplomat after receiving assurances Moscow will not insist
on a postwar role for Afghanistan's Communist Party, a rebel source
said Thursday.
   The source said the meeting Friday with Soviety Deputy Foreign
Minister Yuli Vorontsov is expected to focus on the transfer of
power from the Soviet-backed People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan to a broad-based government.
   The composition of the government and how and when it will be set
up in Kabul also will be discussed, the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   The sides held their first round of direct talks last month in
Saudi Arabia.
   Before agreeing to the second meeting, the loose and quarrelsome
alliance of seven Pakistan-based Afghan guerrilla parties listed
five conditions that Vorontsov must meet before talks could begin.
   The source said the Soviets have agreed not to insist on a role
for the Communist Party in a broad-based government, but guerrilla
sources would not say whether the other conditions had been met.
   Those conditions are the unconditional withdrawal of Soviet
forces; the right of self-determination; a commitment not to hold
separate meetings with Afghan groups or individuals; and ``honesty,
sincerity and refraining from hypocrisy.''
   The list of conditions was released by the guerrilla-run Afghan
News Agency in Islamabad.
   A Pakistan Foreign Ministry said on condition of anonymity that
Vorontsov was given the list of conditions but refused comment.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the Pakistan-based Afghan
rebels, is to head the guerrilla delegation. Mojaddidi belongs to
the moderate National Liberation Front of Afghanistan.
   Mojaddidi took over the chairmanship Jan. 1. The guerrilla
chairmanship rotates among faction leaders every three months.
   Pakistan and the United States have been among the staunchest
allies of Afghanistan's Moslem insurgents, embroiled in a
10-year-old civil war with the communist government.
   In December 1979, the Soviet Union moved more than 100,000
soldiers into Afghanistan to back the Afghan troops. In April, the
Kremlin agreed to withdraw its forces by Feb. 15. Half had left by
August.
   Vorontsov said Wednesday the deadline could be pushed back if the
guerrillas continue to fight.
   He met the guerrillas in Saudi Arabia last month in a first round
of direct talks. The sides agreed to meet again in Islamabad.

<HEAD>Soviets Buy More US Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought another 390,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 2 million
tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the
United States, now in its sixth year.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment in January and February.
Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the
Soviets have about 1.2 million tons still available under the
program.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under
EEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The
pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31,
1990.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 760,000 tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 390,000 tons of
wheat would be about 14.3 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $57 million.
   Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the
Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of
grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized.
   Sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of
$22.83 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on
the 390,000 tons of wheat will be paid to five companies: Cargill
Inc., 100,000 tons; Toepfer International Inc., 50,000; Ferruzzi USA
Inc., 150,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000; and Peavy Co., 40,000.

<TEXT>
   The wheels of a man's misfortune began turning
about a year ago when someone knocked down a fence on a vacant piece
of his property and dumped a truckload of old tires.
   Others _ many others _ must have figured that's what the lot was
for.
   Now there are 5,000 old tires on A.B. Kupperman's lot and the New
Orleans lawyer is faced with more than just an eyesore. The city
landfill can't accommodate the tires and no one has a solution.
   ``I certainly didn't put the tires there,'' said Kupperman. ``And
I feel terrible about the neighborhood. It's an eyesore and a
problem for some of the neighbors.''
   A private company told him that it would take the tires away _
but he would have to pay $2 to $5 a tire. A collector in suburban
New Orleans said he would take them if a court hadn't ruled he can't
add to the 100,000 tires he already has, Kupperman said.
   City Health Director Dr. Brobson Lutz is sympathetic _ he's
agreed to delay any fines until February. But he said Kupperman has
to get rid of the tire pile, which is a haven for rats and
mosquitoes.
   If the tires caught fire, he said, it would cause a pollution
problem.

   The Bible used for George Washington's
swearing-in 200 years ago was put aboard a train Thursday for
Washington, where George Bush will use it for his oath of office.
   A four-member honor guard of Free and Accepted Masons carried the
King James Bible printed in 1767.
   The Masons of St. John's Lodge lent the Bible to Presidents
Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter for their
inaugurations, said Allan Boudreau, director of the lodge-sponsored
Livingston Library and Museum.
   New York City was the capital of the new nation when George
Washington, a member of a Masonic lodge in Virginia, was inaugurated
here April 30, 1789. His oath was administered by Robert R.
Livingston, chancellor of New York state and the Masonic grand
master.
   The Bible originally contained a portrait of England's King
George II. A picture of Washington was added in the mid-1800's, said
Boudreau.
   ``It's in pretty good shape. It's been restored and carefully
tended to over the years,'' he said.
   The Bible will be on exhibit in the White House until Jan. 20,
then escorted by Masonic honor guard to the inauguration ceremonies.

   More than two years after federal agents
launched an investigation into Pentagon fraud, a federal grand jury
is poised to return the first indictment, a prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
   Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney in nearby Alexandria, Va., has
scheduled a news conference for Friday in the expectation the grand
jury will return an indictment, according to his spokeswoman, Sharon
Dibbley.
   Defense attorneys, none of whom wanted their names used, have
speculated that indictments in ``Operation Ill Wind'' could come
this week. Some companies and employees named in the investigation
are known to be trying to work out a plea bargaining arrangement.
   The nationwide defense probe, started in the fall of 1986,
revolves around allegations that defense contractors and consultants
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details vital to winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The Pentagon purchasing system lets about $150 billion dollars in
contracts annually.

Mediterranean Sea:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOTS' REPORT</NOTE>

   Thr Reagan Administration said photographic evidence shows Libya
lied when it claimed the two planes shot down were unarmed
reconnaissance aircraft.
   Citing video footage from one of two U.S. Navy F-14 jet fighters
involved, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said photos showed one of
the Libyan fighters carrying four missiles.
   Debriefing of the Navy officers and a review of the footage shows
the Libyan aircraft five times ignored evasive maneuvers by the Navy
jets and did not break off even after the lead F-14 fired two
missiles, Howard said.

   Soviet ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov said Moscow ``gave a
warning signal to Washington,'' before the shooting incident to show
restraint and ``not to raise the tension in the area.''
   The United States told the U.N. Security Council the U.S. planes
fired in reaction to hostile actions that ``constituted an armed
attack.''
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser called the incident a
``premeditated act of aggression'' and said the Libyan fighters were
``unarmed, on routine reconnaissance, ordinary flying.''

<NOTE>LIBYA REACTION</NOTE>

   Libya put machine gun nests around public buildings and moved
fighter jets to safer desert areas, saying the downing of the two
Libyan planes was a prelude to a U.S. attack.
   Nearly 30 journalists who flew to Libya after the shooting were
detained at Tripoli airport, then sent back to Rome.

   British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe indicated the account of
the shooting given by the United States showed ``it is clear that
they acted in self-defense.''
   The Soviet Union's Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov called the act ``a show of political adventurism and state
terrorism.''
   The 101-nation Non-Aligned Movement condemned the U.S. act as
unprovoked aggression and ``state terrorism'' and called on the
United States to withdraw its naval forces.

   British Foreign Secretary Howe lent support to the U.S. claim
that Libya has a chemical weapons plant saying: ``We do have
independent information on Libya's chemical weapons program showing
their plant as a very large one and it is no doubt intended for
chemical weapons production.''
   In Moscow, the deputy chief of Soviet chemical weapons troops,
Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, acknowledged that Libya may be able to
manufacture chemical weapons, but he said such weapons would be in
quantities too small to wage war.

<HEAD>Candidates For Top DNC Post Seek Labor Backing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The five candidates to succeed Paul Kirk as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee met with labor leaders
Thursday in hopes of winning union backing.
   The meetings were at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, with a
number of political directors from the organization's member unions
meeting with each of the candidates.
   The political directors each will report back to their union's
president. The presidents in turn plan to meet next week with
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland to determine whether labor will
issue an endorsement.
   Thursday's meetings were the official forum to seek labor's
backing but the candidates in the past few weeks have met regularly
with union leaders, according to AFL-CIO officials.
   Washington attorney Ron Brown, a veteran party activist who was
Jesse Jackson's 1988 convention manager and has worked for Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, and Michigan state chairman Richard Weiner are
considered the front-runners to succeed Kirk.
   Three former Democratic representatives are the other candidates.
They are Jim Jones of Oklahoma, Michael Barnes of Maryland and James
Stanton of Ohio.
   Although the AFL-CIO has not decided as yet whether to endorse, a
number its building trades unions have endorsed Stanton.
   Brown, who also worked on Michael Dukakis' unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign, has won the backing of several prominent
Democrats, including labor favorites Kennedy and New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   The AFL-CIO endorsed Dukakis in the presidential race, although
the Teamsters union, an AFL-CIO affiliate, later backed Republican
George Bush.
   When the union presidents meet with Kirkland, no endorsement is
likely to follow unless they agree to present it as unanimous,
regardless of any debate in their closed session.
   The Democratic National Committee will meet on Feb. 9-10 to
choose Kirk's replacement. Union's delegates hold 46 of the 404
national committee votes but labor's influence is far greater than
those number would suggest.

   Farmers have signed enough fragile land into a
long-range conservation program to reduce annual soil losses by
nearly 600 million tons, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said about 28 million acres have been contracted under the
Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP. The goal is to retire 40
million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop
production by 1990.
   An agency spokeswoman, Leslie Wilder, said the 600 million tons
of soil saved each year would be enough to cover one square mile, or
640 acres, to a depth of 429 feet.
   Scaling said the average annual erosion rate on CRP land declines
to less than 2 tons per acre after being planted in grass or trees
from 22 tons per acre before.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take qualified land from crop
production for 10 years. In return, they get federal assistance to
plant the land in protective grass or trees and then draw annual
rental payments. Those average around $49 per acre each year.

<TEXT>
   Anguished residents of this small farming
community struggled Thursday to understand why a 27-year-old mother
drowned her 8-year-old daughter in a bathtub and then shot her three
younger children and herself.
   ``People keep asking me why, like I know the answer, and I don't.
And everyone is asking themselves, `What if we had ... known? We
could have tried to help,''' said Karen Dingerson, who lived nearby.
   The bodies of Sheila Epker and the four children were found by
the woman's husband, Greg Epker, 32, when he returned home Wednesday
from work, authorities said.
   The couple's eldest child, 8-year-old Casey, was drowned. Mrs.
Epker and the three other chidren _ daughters Shannon, 5, and Mandy,
2, and 1-year-son Lance _ were shot in the head with a .22-caliber
revolver, said Adams County Sheriff Robert Nall.
   The children were ``sweet, cute, just as cute as buttons. The
oldest one was always ushering the others around,'' Mrs. Dingerson
said.
   Epker was being treated for shock at St. Mary's Hospital in the
county seat of Quincy 10 miles to the south. Mendon is about 140
miles northwest of St. Louis.
   ``He's completely mystified,'' Nall said. ``He can't understand
it, either.''
   There were few clues to a motive for the five deaths, he said.
Mrs. Epker had no known history of mental problems and the family
apparently had only minor financial problems.
   But the Quincy Herald-Whig reported Thursday that St. Mary's
Hospital had sued the Epkers over $3,900 in bills accumulated since
1980. The hospital won the judgment and Epker's wages were
garnisheed Dec. 28, the newspaper said.
   Neighbors said the family had lived for about seven years in
their modest one-story house on the outskirts of this town of nearly
1,000 residents. They described Mrs. Epker as a slender blonde
woman, outwardly cheerful but having little contact with neighbors.
   Vera Oenning said Mrs. Epker had spoken to her only once in seven
years, although the two families lived about 50 yards apart.
   ``She would wave or smile, but she never came over or had any
conversations with me,'' Mrs. Oenning said. ``They never did too
much visiting and you'd never see too many people over there.''
   All but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle, the
sheriff said. Mrs. Epker apparently tried to strangle Casey before
drowning the child in the bathtub, Nall said.
   Authorities believe she then took her three younger children into
the kitchen, where she laid out pillows and blankets and turned on a
gas stove in an apparent attempt to asphyxiate the family.
   ``We believe that because that didn't work quickly enough,
because of despair, she took them into the living room, one by one,
and shot them,'' Nall told reporters.
   Casey's classmates at at Mendon Elementary School were
bewildered, said Principal Dean Herring, adding a psychologist was
standing by.
   ``I don't see something as tragic as this passing over in a
couple of days. It's something we will be dealing with for a
while,'' Herring said.

<TEXT>
   A grocery clerk who was fired for helping a
stray dog when she was supposed to be working got her job back and
several other offers of work.
   Kathryn Westling, 20, of Glendale said newspaper and radio
reports Wednesday generated about 20 offers of possible jobs.
   ``I'm thinking of something like an animal hospital,'' she said.
   And the owners offered her her old job back at Sentry Foods
store, despite the dispute Tuesday with the store manager, whom the
owners said they plan to reprimand.
   ``I called Kathryn on the telephone this morning and told her we
wanted her to come back to work because she's a good cashier,'' said
Doreen Serio, co-owner of the store with her husband, Frank.
   Westling, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater
who worked part-time at the store, said she was fired for taking too
long a break while she waited for the Humane Society to pick up a
stray, shivering German Shepherd she spotted outside the store.
   ``I told my manager I had a moral problem leaving the dog in the
parking lot,'' she said. ``And my boss said, `I have a moral problem
with you staying out with the dog and not checking.'''
   After a radio program focused on the situation, about 20 job
offers were called in, she said. ``They're sending me the list.''
Also, someone called her about the possible employment at an animal
hospital, she said.
   Westling said she would have liked to adopt the stray dog, but
``with three cats and a bird, there was no way.''

<HEAD>Needle Exchange to Combat AIDS Approved in Tacoma</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `Another needle...' to UPDATE with Portland
program revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first full-scale,
government-sponsored hypodermic needle exchange program to combat
the spread of AIDS has been approved by the Tacoma-Pierce County
Board of Health.
   The panel voted 4-1 Wednesday to spend $43,165 this year on the
program begun in August by David Purchase, a former drug counselor
who began with a card table and a box of donated syringes.
   Purchase estimated Wednesday that he has distributed more than
11,000 clean needles in an attempt to reduce the spread of AIDS
among addicts who commonly share syringes while injecting themselves
with drugs. Police and other officials estimate the city has about
3,000 intravenous drug users.
   ``That's history, that really is history,'' Purchase said after
the vote.
   ``We have the most successful program in the U.S. _ the first and
the most successful,'' said Pierce County Executive Joe Stortini, a
member of the board.
   ``I'm not convinced that the needle exchange, by itself, has done
a thing to stop the spread of AIDS,'' said Greg Mykland, a city
councilman who is a member of the health board and cast the lone
dissenting vote.
   ``I've never heard of anything I could have supported less a year
or two ago,'' said County Council member Barbara Skinner, another
board member, ``but I've heard that it costs $100,000 to treat
someone with AIDS and a needle costs 35 cents. That sounds like a
pretty good deal to me.''
   The money was designated for paying Purchase to spend five
afternoons a week running two mobile clinics that provide needles,
AIDS information and drug treatment coupons.
   A smaller needle exchange project, modeled partly on Purchase's
example, was started recently by health officials in New York but
has enrolled only 34 of the city's 250,000 addicts and and is
designed primarily as a research effort.
   A private, non-profit organization in Portland, Ore., announced
Thursday that it had hired a nurse to begin a needle distribution
program there. The program was first announced last June, but was
stalled for months when the clinic was unable to find an insurance
company to cover the program.
   In Boston, Mayor Raymond Flynn backed a needle exchange program,
but it was rejected by the City Council.
   An organization headquartered in Boston called the AIDS Brigade,
which includes Yale graduate students as well as former addicts and
convicts, distributes AIDS education materials, bleach and needles
in New Haven, Conn., New York City, New Jersey and Boston.
   ``Tacoma is really leading the way nationally on this,'' said Don
Des Jarlais, director of the New York state Division of Substance
Abuse Services.
   One-fifth of the nation's 80,000 reported cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome have been in intravenous drug users, and
the fatal disease is spreading in that population faster than any
other, health officials say.
   Studies of European needle exchange programs show no increase in
drug use and a sharp decrease in needle-sharing habits, said Terry
Reid, manager of the the health department's drug abuse and AIDS
programs.

<HEAD>Motorcycle-Riding Celebrities Support Compromise Safety Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorcycle-riding celebrities including
comedian Jay Leno, actor Fred Dryer and country singer Dwight Yoakam
are supporting a proposed law that would put helmets on riders under
the age of 21.
   ``It is a compromise bill,'' Assemblywoman Bev Hansen said
Wednesday at a news conference also attended by Leno, Dryer and
Yoakam. ``It is an attempt to prevent motorcycle accidents in the
first place. It is not a Band-Aid attempt to put a helmet on
somebody's head.''
   Ms. Hansen's proposal would increase penalties for riding a
motorcycle without a proper license as well as require helmets for
people under 21 and extend California's Motorcyclist Safety Program
past its scheduled 1991 expiration date.
   The safety program requires motorcyclists under 21 to take
special training and driving tests. The tests include zig-zagging
between cones, going through special turns, making quick stops and
parking.
   California Highway Patrol Deputy Commissioner Maurice Hannigan
credits the safety program with cutting motorcycle deaths by 12.9
percent last year. He called Ms. Hansen's proposal ``a good,
comprehensive bill.''
   A mandatory helmet bill introduced by Assemblyman Richard Floyd
was passed during the last legislative session but vetoed by Gov.
George Deukmejian.
   Floyd introduced it again last month after actor Gary Busey was
severely injured when he fell from his motorcycle and his head
struck a curb.
   Busey, an opponent of motorcycle helmet laws, remains
hospitalized in fair condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where
he underwent emergency surgery after the accident.

   A strong aftershock struck Spitak, the Armenian
town leveled by a killer earthquake Dec. 7, Tass said Thursday.
There were no immediate reports of further injuries or damage.
   The official Soviet news agency said the quake, registering 7 on
the 12-point Soviet scale, struck the previous day at noon.
   It said the quake's epicenter was 25 miles from Leninakan and 8.5
miles southwest of Kirovakan, between Spitak and the village of
Alavar.
   The Soviet scale registers earthquakes on the basis of observable
effects, and a quake registering 7 is regarded as very strong and
capable of causing cracks in the walls of stone buildings.
   Tass said nothing about injuries or deaths from the new quake,
and calls to government agencies and news organizations in the
Armenian capital Yerevan did not go through.
   However, most buildings in Spitak were destroyed by the Dec. 7
quake. Survivors have been evacuated and rescue workers are the only
ones remaining in the area.
   Officials say they have recovered about 25,000 bodies from the
wreckage of buildings in the earthquake area.
   Tass said four minor tremors were reported on the night of Jan.
3-4 and quoted seismologists as saying the tremors were part of a
normal pattern after the Dec. 7 temblor.
   Officials said the Dec. 7 quake had a force at its epicenter of
more than 10 on the Soviet scale. It registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, a measure of ground motion on seismographs.

   The U.S. government said sday it was looking
into reports Burmese students have died in custody since the
military seized control in Burma last September.
   ``We have received credible reports that a number of returned
Burmese students, who had fled Rangoon after the Sept. 18th military
takeover, were subsequently arrested and died while in the military
regime's custody,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``We do not have hard information on the precise numbers involved
nor actual evidence of deaths, but we're sufficiently concerned
about the reports ... that we will continue efforts to learn the
facts of the matter,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   She said she thought 50 or fewer students had been killed, but
that she would have to check before she could even give an estimate
of the number.
   Mrs. Oakley didn't disclose when the students to whom she was
referring had returned.
   Thousands of students fled to the Thai-Burma border after the
military suppressed a pro-democracy uprising following the coup.
   Some 80 students returned home Dec. 26 aboard two Burmese air
force planes after receiving government assurances that they would
not be harmed.
   Unconfirmed reports earlier said students who returned on their
own had disappeared and were presumed killed by the authorities.
   About 7,000 students and others remain along the border with
Burmese rebels, spurning the repatriation offer.

<HEAD>Explosion, Fire Hit Saudi Tanker in Strait of Hormuz</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Saudi Arabian tanker was rocked by an
explosion and then caught fire in the storm-lashed Strait of Hormuz
on Thursday, with six crewmen killed and two missing, Lloyd's
Shipping Intelligence reported.
   Shipping executives said the 36,904-ton Sagheera may have hit a
drifting mine.
   London-based LLoyd's said the vessel, identified as a bunkering
oil tanker manned by Greek officers and Sri Lankan seamen, carried
34 crew.
   The Omani navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats, the shipping
executives said on condition of anonymity.
   They said winds gusting to just under 35 mph lashed waves as high
as 30 feet in the southern Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz,
the gateway into the gulf.
   Despite the storm, two salvage tugboats reached the blazing
tanker and were trying to keep it afloat, the executives said. At
nightfall it was listing heavily and still burning, they reported.
   Last April 4, when the Iran-Iraq war was still raging, Iranian
gunboats attacked the Sagheera, setting it afire near the Strait of
Hormuz. The fire was put out and no one was hurt.
   Lloyd's, which monitors shipping traffic around the world, said
on Thursday that the vessel was reported to be abandoned and no
further details were available.
   An explosion tore through the tanker's pump room before the ship
caught fire, Lloyd's reported, but it did not say what might have
caused the blast.
   Executives theorized that a mine from the Iran-Iraq war may have
been whipped loose from its mooring by fierce winds.
   ``It could be the work of a mine, but it could also be an
internal explosion, one of the oil tanks catching fire and
exploding,'' one said.
   Scores of mines are believed spread about the gulf and the
Arabian Sea more than four months after a cease-fire took effect in
the gulf war.
   The empty tanker was steaming from Fujairah on the Arabian Sea to
the loading port in Saudi Arabia, Mina Saud, Lloyds said.
   It said the Sagheera caught fire just outside Omani territorial
waters before the bend of the V-shaped Hormuz Strait.
   Lloyd's said a big oil slick formed.
   The shipping executives ruled out the possibility of an attack by
an Iranian speedboat, saying the weather was too bad for such
vessels to operate. approaching the Sagheera to quench the fire.
   Lloyd's said the Sagheera is owned by the Dammam-based General
Contracting Importing and Service Enterprises (General Bunkering
Services, Dammam) and managed by the Avin International Bunkers
Supply SA, based in Piraeus, Greece.
   Early Thursday, bad weather caused the 9,724-ton, Honduran-flag
freighter Moajil-5 to run aground after it broke anchor in rough
seas, according to gulf and London shipping sources, who spoke on
condition of anonytmiy.
   No casualties were reported when the Moajil-5 grounded on the
jetty of Sharjah harbor.

<HEAD>Agency Issues Sun Scald Alert For Trees In Midwest, Northeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has issued a sun
scald alert for trees, particularly in the upper Midwest and
Northeast, an agency official said Thursday.
   ``It's possible that some damage may have already occurred from
what we call sun scald,'' said horticulturist Mark P. Widrlechner of
the department's Agricultural Research Service. ``But if you act
fairly soon, chances are very good that you can protect your trees.''
   Sun scald is caused by a rapid fluctuation of temperatures in
winter, he said. The sun warms tree bark to above freezing, allowing
water to flow freely up and down inside the trunk and branches. When
it is cold at night, the water freezes, cracking the bark and
injuring the tree.
   Widrlechner said tree trunks in many Midwestern apple orchards
are painted white to reflect heat away from the bark. Homeowners,
though, can simply wrap tree trunks with paper coverings available
at garden and hardware stores.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Ban on Granular Pesticide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it plans to forbid use of granular carbofuran, a pesticide
used mostly to protect corn and sorghum from worms and insects,
because it is killing too many birds.
   The agency said it knew of more than 40 incidents where birds had
mistaken the pesticide granules on the ground for food, with up to
1,000 bird deaths in a single incident.
   In addition, eagles, hawks, harriers and other birds of prey have
been killed from eating the carcasses of smaller birds that died
after eating carbofuran granules, EPA said.
   At least 20 species of birds legally protected under various
federal laws have been killed by carbofuran, the agency concluded.
   About 6 million to 9 million pounds of granular carbofuran are
sold each year. Another 1 million to 3 million pounds are sold as
liquids or powders used in different applications and are not
involved in Thursday's announcement.
   About two-thirds of the granular form is used on corn, that form
of use less common than it was 10 years ago, EPA said. The main form
of granular carbofuran is sold as Furadan by FMC Corp.
   It is only the second time EPA has acted to ban a pesticide
solely because it was killing birds, though harm to birds was a
major reason for the ban on DDT in 1972. The other banned chemical
was diazinon.
   The agency said it did not appear that carbofuran posed any
chronic threat to humans, though like other pesticides, high
concentrations could make it a short-term poison.
   EPA began a special study of carbofuran in 1985, but that review
was slowed by the agency's conclusion that it needed to study all
granulated pesticides _ more than 100 chemicals _ for their effect
on birds to set priorities for further work.
   Field tests were recently completed and will be reviewed by the
agency's outside science advisers next month.
   ``Carbofuran was orders of magnitude (several factors of 10)
greater in toxicity than any other'' pesticide, said Al Heier, EPA's
pesticide spokesman. ``On a toxicity scale to birds of one to 10, it
was the only one rated a 10, and the next most toxic was a five.''
   The Fish and Wildlife Service advised EPA that carbofuran posed a
threat to three endangered species, the Aplomado falcon, Attwater's
greater prairie chicken and the Aleutian Canada goose, and could
harm the bald eagle, the whooping crane and the Mississippi sandhill
crane. The chemical should be banned in areas used by those species,
the service recommended.
   EPA said it knew of population declines in the red-shouldered
hawk, the loggerhead shrike, the field sparrow, Henslow's sparrow
and other species. ``Given its high toxicity and its widespread use
in agriculture, carbofuran is likely to be responsible for bird
deaths in those species'' and therefore ``can be an important
additive factor in the declines.''
   In Chicago, FMC Corp. spokeswoman Patricia Brozowski said
``natrually we're disappointed,'' but ``at the same time we are
confident ... that comprehensive and well-documented information
from the scientific and agricultural communities will support our
position that Furadan does not present an unreasonable risk to avian
species.''
   The agency said it had considered tightening the current use
restrictions on carbofuran but concluded such actions as additional
label warnings, limits on use to certain months or geographic
restrictions ``would not adequately mitigate the risk.''
   Growers who use carbofuran on their crops should incur higher
annual costs of $23 million to $33 million through increased crop
damage and higher costs for other pesticides, EPA said. But there
are so many choices for corn the carbofuran ban should have no major
effect on corn farmers, EPA said.
   The biggest single loss would be to rice growers, $12 million a
year in losses to the rice water weevil for which no other control
chemicals are available.
   EPA said it would receive public comment on its plans for 60
days. If it orders a ban, the manufacturer and other holders of
federal pesticide licenses may pursue administrative appeals. If
they do so, sales of the pesticide may continue.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz sharply
criticized on Thursday a reported death threat by Yasser Arafat
against Palestinian Arabs who advocate an end to the uprising on the
Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza.
   ``We will observe behavior as the process proceeds,'' Shultz said.
   Last month, acting on the secretary's recommendation, President
Reagan ended a 13-year ban on U.S. talks with Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The decision was suggested by the State Department and taken on
the basis of statements by the PLO chairman that he had renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Shultz said in a news conference aboard the U.S. Air Force jet
that brought him to Paris for a chemical warfare conference that not
all violence is an act of terrorism.
   But ``threats against people who try to move in a calmer and more
peaceful direction are acts of intimidation and fall much more into
the terrorism category,'' he said.
   Shultz stressed he had not seen the reported statement by Arafat.
But he criticized it, nonetheless.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, one of the West Bank's best-known
moderates, proposed just before Christmas a one-year truce in the
Palestian uprising in the occupied territories as a step toward
peace.
   Freij told reporters this week he was withdrawing the proposal
after Arafat said in Saudi Arabia on Sunday that anyone trying to
stop the revolt ``exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''
   Shultz referred to a U.S. session with a PLO delegation in
Carthage, Tunisia, on Dec. 16.
   ``We have emphasized the importance of stopping terrorism. Now we
have to keep working on it to see that their behavior measures up,''
he said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy and other senior
U.S. officials have warned that the ``substantive dialogue'' with
the PLO would be cut off if terrorism recurred.
   Meanwhile, the State Department disclosed on Thursday that U.S.
diplomats were given the green light to exchange social pleasantries
with PLO representatives if they should meet them at parties.
   Arafat's comment came at a rally Sunday marking the anniversary
of his Fatah movement.
   Freij said he could not believe Arafat made such a threatening
statement.
   In Bethlehem on Thursday, soldiers ordered residents to paint
over graffiti threatening Freij with death.
   The slogans, signed by the radical PLO faction Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, included ``Shame on all the traitors''
and ``The fate of Freij will not be better than that of Zafer Al
Masri.''
   Masri, mayor of Nablus, was killed in 1986 after indications he
might play a role in the peace process with Israel. The Popular
Front claimed responsibility for his slaying.
   Freij maintained that city workers and some shopkeepers
voluntarily painted over the graffiti. He denied reports he had been
in hiding.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Begin Withdrawal; Schools Reopen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian peacekeeping troops have begun
leaving this troubled island at the end of an 18-month mission to
disarm Tamil rebels and enforce a cease-fire, officials said
Thursday.
   Also Thursday, officials reopened more than 10,000 schools
nationwide that were closed two months ago after a wave of student
unrest.
   Officials confirmed that India has begun its long-awaited
withdrawal from the country.
   ``Some Indian troops have already left Sri Lanka during the past
two days, and another battalion is scheduled to leave Sunday,'' said
Gurjit Singh, a spokeman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy.
   India, the regional superpower, sent its troops to Sri Lanka in
July 1987, hours after the two countries signed an accord to end the
Tamil separarist war for an independent homeland in the north and
east provinces. More than 8,500 people have died since the fighting
began in 1983.
   But the biggest and most militant Tamil group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected the accord, saying that it failed to
meet their demands for self-rule.
   The presence of about 47,000 Indian troops in Sri Lanka triggered
resentment among Tamils and Sinhalese, the country's ethnic majority.
   The Indian troops soon became caught in the fighting, and more
than 625 soldiers have been killed.
   Shortly after his election last month, President Ranasinghe
Premadasa asked the Indian government to start pulling its troops
out of Sri Lanka.
   India announced on Sunday that between 2,000 and 3,000 troops
would leave the Indian Ocean island this week. It said the remaining
soldiers would be gradually withdrawn, but gave no timetable.
   Premadasa had opposed the accord, which was signed by his
predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene. Both are Sinhalese.
   An extremist Sinhalese group, the People's Liberation Front, also
objects to the peace accord, saying it grants too many concessions
to the mostly Hindu Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's
16 million people.
   The Tamils contend the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese denies
them jobs, education and money for development. The Sinhalese
account for over 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.
   Meanwhile, principals reported satisfactory to good attendance at
the country's 10,400 schools, closed by the government on Nov. 10
after widespread student unrest, rioting and police action that left
at least 20 students dead.
   Police and troops were ordered to stay away from schools
Thursday, and there were no indications of trouble, said Elmo
Gooneratne, an Education Ministry official.
   Sri Lanka has a literacy rate of 86 percent, the highest in Asia.
   There was no indication when seven of Sri Lanka's eight
universities would reopen. The colleges closed in mid-1987 because
of student unrest.
   Schools and college campuses have been used by the People's
Liberation Front as recruiting centers for its cause.

<HEAD>Reagan Backs US Pilots in Libyan Shootdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, back from California for the
final two weeks of his presidency, said Thursday that U.S. pilots
did the right thing in downing two Libyan jets over the
Mediterranean.
   ``Our pilots acted completely in self-defense,'' Reagan said as
he boarded Air Force One in Los Angeles after spending two weeks
trying out his new home there and visiting friends in Palm Springs,
Calif.
   The president's remarks were his first public statements on the
downing of the Libyan planes since he was awakened early Wednesday
morning at his Bel Air home to be told they had been shot down.
   Asked whether the pilots acted correctly, he replied, ``Yes,''
and added that the situation they faced was ``very obviously a
hostile threat.''
   As for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's charge that the United
States was engaged in terrorism, he said, ``I haven't believed what
he said for a long time.''
   In the 14 days remaining between now and the inauguration of
President-elect Bush as his successor, Reagan faces minor surgery,
will submit a fiscal 1990 budget and will deliver a farewell address
to the nation.
   The White House said he would enter Walter Reed Army Hospital for
surgery Saturday to correct a condition that causes his left ring
finger to bend inward.
   Dr. John Hutton, the White House physician, said the president
would return to the hospital on Sunday after resting overnight from
the operation, which is usually performed on an outpatient basis.
   Hutton said the operation should not cause any curtailment of the
Reagan's work schedule, although the president will wear a large
bandage on his hand and lower arm.
   Because recovery usually takes no fewer than two to three weeks,
Reagan was expected to be wearing the bandage when he joins Bush at
the West Front of the Capitol for the swearing-in of the new
president.
   The president's final budget, covering the fiscal year beginning
next Oct. 1, is to be submitted to Congress on Monday.
   Reagan has said that his budget will call for no new taxes, meet
the congressional goal of reducing the budget deficit to $100
million and aim for a balanced budget by fiscal year 1993.
   Bush is expected to submit amendments to the budget, embodying
his own deficit reduction plan, after he takes office. He also has
said he will not propose tax increases.
   Reagan will deliver his televised farewell address at 9 p.m. EST
Wednesday from the Oval Office.
   The president has spent at least part of 458 days in California,
including 345 at his ranch north of Santa Barbara, during his eight
years in office.

   The Security Council convened in an
emergency session Thursday and heard Libya and the United States
trade blame for the downing of two Libyan jets by U.S. warplanes.
   Libya's Ambassador Ali Suni Muntasser told the council that the
United States is pursuing a policy of ``blatant aggression'' against
his country.
   Libya repeated Thursday that the jets were unarmed reconnaissance
planes. Washington disputed that, contending two U.S. Navy fighter
jets acted in self-defense when they shot down the Libyan MiG jets
on Wednesday.
   ``Our actions were fully consistent with accepted international
norms of self-defense and my government considers this matter
closed,'' U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun told the council.
   U.S. planes were ``faced by growing and imminent threat of being
shot down by intercepting Libyan aircraft,'' he said. ``We have
photographic evidence that clearly shows the Libyan aircraft were
carrying air-to-air missiles.''
   Libya sought the urgent council session and urged the 15-member
body to condemn the U.S. action as premeditated aggression. But the
United States, one of five permanent members with veto power, would
kill any resolution of condemnation.
   The session was adjourned after remarks by eight speakers made
comments, most of them Arab represenatives who condemned the U.S.
military action. Speakers included the Arab League, Bahrain, Burkina
Faso, Tunisia, Syria and Cuba.
   The session will reconvene Friday at 10:30 a.m. EST for further
debate, including comments from Britain and the Soviet Union. The
council is expected to consider a resolution of condemnaion being
drafted by Libya and the Non-Aligned Movement.
   At the meeting, Muntasser accused the United States of
``premeditated, deliberate aggression, a prelude to large-scale act
of aggression aimed at sriking the economic and military
installations in my country.''
   He protested the ``shooting down of two unarmed, reconaissance
planes on routine patrol near the Libyan coast. They were
intercepted by U.S. military aircraft which shot them down without
any justification.''
   Muntasser, responding to U.S. charges that Libya is about to
produce chemical weapons, said: ``Libya has no intention of
producing chemical weapons.'' He said Libya scrupulously abides by
all international bans and conventions against the use of outlawed
poison gasses.
   Before the meeting, Muntasser called the chief Pentagon spokesman
``a liar'' and rejected U.S. claims that videotapes show two Libyan
jets were armed and hostile before they were shot down over the
Mediterranean.
   ``I would say that he is a liar, not me. The man who said I am a
liar, he is a liar, because we are sure that our planes were not
armed,'' he told reporters.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard had said Thursday that the Libyan
envoy was ``a liar'' by asserting that the MiG-23s were unarmed and
on reconnaissance.
   Muntasser suggested the United States had doctored the videotapes
or had fraudulently used film of other, armed Libyan fighters.
   ``We can as well bring pictures that our plane has no missiles,''
he said. Also Thursday, Soviet U.N. Ambassador Alexander M.
Belonogov suggested to reporters the two U.S. F-14 pilots were
trigger-happy and said the Kremlin warned the United States before
the event to exercise restraint with Libya.
   ``We deplore this accident,'' Belonogov said. ``Everything that
has a tragic ending is an accident.''
   He said it demonstrated that ``all military personnel should be
under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the trigger.''
   ``Before that incident, we gave a warning signal to Washington to
show restraint in that area ... not to raise tension in the area,''
he said. ``We were concerned by this (U.S. anti-Libyan) campaign in
connection with the so-called chemical (weapons) plant.''
   The ambassador urged the United States to consider Libya's offer
of inspection of a plant 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, the Libyan
capital, that Washington says produces chemical weapons. Libya says
it manufactures medicines.
   U.S. officials have denied any connection between the air action
and allegations about the chemical plant.
   Meanwhile, Arab League sources in Tunis, Tunisia, said Libya also
made a formal request Thursday for a meeting of the league's Council
of Ministers.

   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland urged
President-elect Bush on Thursday to use a new U.S. trade law
aggressively to punish nations considered to be violating workers'
rights.
   ``As good as it looks on paper, the reality remains elusive,''
Kirkland said in a speech to an international labor conference. He
was referring to provisions of the law that allow the United States
to close its markets to nations engaging in unfair trade practices,
including denial of workers' rights.
   ``The translation of principle into fact will require on our part
relentless work for a long time yet,'' Kirkland said. ``What we have
gained amounts to little more than words if not aggressively pursued
by an administration whose appointees really believe in these
things. Words, gestures, promises and formal procedures in and of
themselves do not bring relief to exploited workers nor freedom to
anyone.''
   Kirkland reiterated labor's request that the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade be amended to include ``a social clause'' defining
denial of workers' rights as an unfair trade practice. He said he
hoped that could be accomplished during the current ``Uruguay
round'' of trade talks but conceded past efforts have fallen far
short of success.
   In broader terms, he said, ``As we embark upon a new presidential
administration in Washington, a new opportunity emerges to frame a
foreign policy worthy of the purposes for which democratic
government was brought forth on this continent.
   ``There can be no bigger test of that policy than the extent of
its commitment to the advancement of human rights, beginning with
the basic rights of working people,'' Kirkland said. ``The
enforcement of the workers' rights provision of our trade laws will
and ought to be the crucible of that test.''

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The population of the tri-state Chesapeake
Bay area will increase by 2.6 million people by the year 2020 and
could threaten efforts to clean up the Bay unless there is strict
controls by the states involved, a report said Thursday.
   The report on the consequences of population growth and
development in the Bay's watershed was presented to the governors of
Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania at a meeting of the Chesapeake
Executive Council.
   The council, which also includes officials from the District of
Columbia and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, has been
coordinating broad efforts to environmentally restore Chesapeake Bay
and its tributaries after years of neglect.
   The governors reserved detailed judgement on the report, pending
closer study.
   But Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania said he had ``serious
reservations'' about the ``draconian state planning measures''
suggested by the report, which was prepared at the request of the
executive council.
   He said Pennsylvania need not become ``a super planner'' to deal
with future growth in the Bay region and cited programs the state
already has underway to deal with improved sewage treatment, waste
recycling and control of toxic wastes.
   Govs. Gerald Baliles of Virginia and Donald Schaefer of Maryland
said they plan to establish advisory groups to analyze the
recommendations.
   ``It's too early to make judgements about application (of the
report's findings),'' said Baliles, who is chairman of the executive
council.
   The study panel cited statistics that showed an expected 2.6
million additional residents in the Chesapeake Bay region by the
year 2020, a 20 percent increase in population growth in an area
that currently is to a great extent rural.
   And, the study concluded, the states are not prepared for such
growth. ``Procedures currently being used throughout the Bay region
for managing and providing for growth and development are inadequate
and must quickly be changed if current trends are to be reversed,''
it declared.
   ``Better stewardship and management of the land and better
direction and incentives for appropriate growth are needed,'' the
panel continued, adding it was ``dismayed by the lack of growth
management and planning'' on a state and regional level.
   The report concluded the states must take ``a much more active
and central role'' to ``define and map'' the upcoming population
growth so that certain lands such as watersheds, forests and
agricultural areas are protected.
   Each state, it continued ``should expand public park and
recreational systems'' through distribution of money for green belts
around urbanized areas and public access to waterways.
   Although the panel gave no estimates on the cost of such a
program, it suggested some money sources.
   The panel said the states could establish special trust funds to
finance capital projects such as the purchase of open lands and
construction of essential infrastructure.
   Such a trust fund could be funded by an increase in fuel taxes,
taxes on profits from land sales, utility surcharges, property
transfer fees, voluntary state income tax check-off, or fees on
using public recreational lands.

   Mount Etna, an active volcano in eastern
Sicily, was shaken by two light earthquakes on Thursday, the Italian
news agency ANSA reported.
   It said a seismographic center in Erice, in northwestern Sicily,
recorded two quakes in the afternoon but that the tremors were so
light people in villages on the mountains slopes did not feel them.
   No immediate sign of eruption was reported.
   In 1986, Etna spewed ash, clouds of flaming material and lava
after a small eruption. It is considered Europe's most active
volcano.
   Another active volcano forms the basis of Stromboli, a tiny
island in the Aeolian chain off Sicily's northern coast.

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian announced Thursday he
will not seek a third term as governor, saying that he wants to
return to private life for ``additional new challenges.''
   The Republican governor, first elected in 1982 after narrowly
defeating Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, made the announcement at a
news conference at the state Capitol, ending months of speculation
about his political future.
   ``Now I want to rack up two more years of accomplishments before
I leave office,'' he said. ``The best way for me to do that is by
not running for a third term.''
   If he ran again, he said, the Democrat-controlled Legislature
might be ``reluctant to cooperate'' with him.
   There was no immediate response from Democratic leaders about
Deukmejian's decision.
   ``I didn't come to public office to set some record of
longevity,'' he said. ``I came to office to make the state a safer
place to live.''
   Deukmejian, a lawyer, did not say whether he hoped to return to
private law practice, but ruled out accepting any federal position
in Washington, D.C.
   ``I expect to do something in the private sector. At this point,
I don't know exactly what it will be,'' he said.
   Deukmejian, 60, was urged by fellow Republicans to run a third
time in order to protect GOP lawmakers in the scheduled 1990
reapportionment process.
   Reapportionment, the redrawing of legislative and congressional
districts to reflect changes in population, is determined by the
Legislature and the governor.
   Currently, Democrats dominate both houses and Republicans asked
Deukmejian to seek a third term in hopes that his gubernatorial veto
would shield GOP lawmakers from the creation of heavily
pro-Democratic districts.
   Deukmejian, who has been in public life for 27 years, was
considered a potential vice presidential contender by George Bush
during Bush's successful presidential campaign.
   Deukmejian, of Long Beach, was elected to the Assembly in 1962,
then won election to the state Senate in 1966. Deukmejian was
elected attorney general in 1978, and served one term before running
successfully against Bradley for governor four years later.
   In 1986, Deukmejian was re-elected governor, again defeating
Bradley.

   Residents of this close-knit town on
Thursday buried two of their own _ a 10-year-old girl and an
81-year-old widow killed when the flaming wreckage of sabotaged Pan
Am Flight 103 came crashing down.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon, meanwhile, announced tighter
security measures for cargo and baggage mainly for U.S. airlines at
airports in Britain.
   Investigators were reportedly focusing on a dozen passengers from
airports in the Middle East believed to have boarded the New
York-bound Boeing 747 on Dec. 21, when a bomb killed all 259 people
aboard and 11 on the ground in the village of Lockerbie.
   On Thursday, several hundred mourners attended a Requiem Mass for
10-year-old Joanne Flannigan, whose parents are still missing and
presumed dead. The girl was the first of Lockerbie's victims to be
buried.
   Death, always harsh, is ``almost unbearable and unbelievable'' in
these circumstances, Rev. Patrick Keegans told the mourners at the
Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church.
   The service was simple. Only two sprays of white flowers adorned
the church, and the only music was the unaccompanied singing of
``Abide With Me'' and ``The Lord is My Shepherd.''
   But the hearse that carried the girl's small coffin to the
graveyard was covered with wreaths and bouquets of bright flowers.
As it slowly pulled away from the church, three women comforted a
sobbing young girl about Joanne's age.
   A few hours later, mourners gathered again at the All Saints
Episcopal Church for the funeral of 81-year-old Mary Lancaster, a
widow for 26 years.
   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Ambassador
Charles Price and Pan Am executives were among 700 people who packed
into the Dryfesdale Parish Church of the Church of Scotland to mourn
all the crash victims.
   Channon announced the tighter security measures after a
closed-door meeting of the National Aviation Security Committee.
   ``As a result of the meeting this afternoon I have decided
immediately to take further steps to increase safety of the security
of cargo, also mislaid luggage and also to take further steps to
tighten up the existing regulations on cabin bags,'' he said.
   ``There will be more rigorous searching on American airlines, and
on any airline where we think the threat is commensurate but at the
moment it will be American airlines,'' he said.
   He gave no other details about the measures or the committee
meeting, but said he would soon take further measures which he would
not specify.
   London's Evening Standard newspaper reported experts probing the
disaster were concentrating on the 12 passengers of the plane who
began their trips from airports in the Middle East.
   ``The fear is that their baggage, checked in as destined for New
York at airports with much less stringent checks than London, may
have been put on to the doomed jet without further security tests,''
the report said.
   It said one may have been a suicide bomber or someone duped to
carry a bomb, the report said.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said it was
told by an unidentified FBI spokesman in Washington: ``We are aware
of this report but we are not in a position to discuss our
investigation publicly.''
   Pan Am had no comment on the report.
   The government also announced Thursday a $1.8 million rebuilding
program in the Scottish town, where buildings were destroyed by
falling wreckage.
   Searchers so far have recovered 242 bodies from the crash and
have released 164 of them for burial.
   Officials say they believe some of the 28 still missing may have
been cremated in the crash that left a 30-foot-deep crater in the
town.

   Moslem police facing murder
charges seized the police chief of the western island of Mindanao
and his chief of staff Thursday and threatened to burn down the
city, officials said.
   Negotiations for the release of Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla,
regional Philippine Constabulary commander, and Col. Romeo Abendan
continued until dawn Friday.
   There was no official word to indicate when the hostages might be
released. Heavily armed troops surrounded the headquarters building
where the hostages were being held.
   Conflicting reports said one and possibly two people were killed
when the Moslem police attacked about noon Thursday in Batalla's
office at a seaside military compound in this city, 560 miles south
of Manila.
   In Manila, the radio station DZRH said the estimated 15 policemen
and their supporters, led by Patrolman Rizal Alih, accepted an offer
by Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, to be flown
to Palawan island, 350 miles west of here. The report could not be
confirmed.
   Alih was ordered to surrender to Batalla as part of an
investigation into the 1984 killings of seven people, including four
marines and an army nurse, during a siege of his home here, said Lt.
Col. Jovencio Gongora, city police commander.
   That incident followed an attempt to arrest Alih in the November
1984 slaying of Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco. Alih was
acquitted in the Climaco killing but faced other murder charges,
officials said.
   When Alih entered Batalla's office, he drew his weapon and
shooting broke out, said Lt. Col. Anthony Elias, spokesman for the
military's Southern Command. Several other officers managed to flee,
but Batalla and Abendan, the chief of staff, were taken prisoner, he
said.
   Four Filipino reporters also were in the office at the time of
the shooting but were later released, Elias said.
   Officials said Alih's brother-in-law was killed and his wife
seriously wounded. Others said the wife later died.
   Sen. Santanina Rasul, a relative of Alih and one of the
negotiators, said the gunmen demanded to be flown out of the camp to
an undisclosed location along with their hostages.
   Alih threatened to burn Zamboanga, the major city of western
Mindanao, if his demand was not met, she said, adding that he also
demanded that all charges against him be dropped.
   Mrs. Rasul, one of two Moslems in the 23-member Senate, said
Mitra offered a plane to fly the gunmen to his home island of
Palawan.

   Photographic evidence shows Libya lied when it
claimed the two planes that the United States shot down over the
Mediterranean Sea were unarmed reconnaissance aircraft, the Reagan
administration said Thursday.
   Citing video footage from one of two U.S. Navy F-14 jet fighters
involved in the confrontation Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard said photos of one of the Libyan fighters showed it carrying
four missiles on its fuselage and wings.
   ``It tells me that the Libyan ambassador to the U.N. is a liar.
That's the first thing it tells me,'' Howard told a packed Pentagon
news briefing.
   ``They've gone out yesterday and said repeatedly that those were
unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. Well, we have the pictures now that
they were not unarmed aircraft.
   ``They were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile intent.
We believe that our aircraft commanders behaved in a prudent manner
in defending themselves, in defending their aircraft and in
defending their ship,'' he said.
   The United States sent a ``straightforward message'' to Libya
``through diplomatic channels to let them know our point of view''
on the events over the Mediterranean Sea, a State Department
official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No response from the Libyans has been received, the official
added. The official said the substance of the message, sent
Wednesday, paralleled information in Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci's public briefing on the incident and included the
asserting that the U.S. action was taken in self-defense.
   The official said the message was sent through the normal
chennels used by the United States to contact the Libyans _ the
Belgian Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in Tripoli, and the
United Arab Emirates Embassy in Washington, which represents Libyan
interests in the United States.
   At the United Nations, the Soviet ambassador, Alexander M.
Belonogov, told reporters Thursday that Moscow ``gave a warning
signal to Washington,'' before the American jet fighters shot down
the Libyan planes, to show restraint and ``not to raise the tension
in the area.'' He refused to elaborate.
   ``We deplore this accident,'' Belonogov said. ``It shows the
seriousness of the situation and that all military personnel should
be under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the
trigger.''
   The United States told the U.N. Security Council that the U.S.
planes fired on the Libyan aircraft in reaction to hostile actions
that ``constituted an armed attack'' on American forces.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun made the statement in a letter to
the 15-member council, which held private consultations on Libya's
protest of the incident. But Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser
called the incident a ``premeditated act of aggression'' and said
the Libyan fighters were ``unarmed, on routine reconnaissance,
ordinary flying.''
   President Reagan, boarding his plane in Los Angeles to return to
Washington following a vacation, told reporters, ``Our pilots acted
completely in self-defense.''
   Asked about Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's statement accusing
the United States of terrorist actions, Reagan sad: ``I haven't
believed what he said for a long time.''
   Meantime, the State Department on Thursday welcomed Britain's
announcement that it had independent confirmation that Libya is
building a plant to produce chemical weapons, as the United States
has alleged. Libya contends the factory will produce pharmaceuticals.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley also confirmed that Libya
has attempted some back-channel contacts with the United States
recently, but she refused to define the substance of the messages or
how they were transmitted.
   ``The problem is not one of communication, the problem is the
policy and the conduct of the government of Libya, their policy
particularly in support of terrorism,'' she said.
   Speaking to reporters on a flight Thursday from Washington to
Paris for an international conference, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz hinted the United States may be willing to work out a deal
with Libya that would not require the plant to be destroyed.
   ``Obviously, if the facility were destroyed that would take care
of the problem, so that's our posture,'' Shultz said. But, he added,
``whether there is something else that can be done, we'll see.''
   He said the United States was not talking directly to the Libyans
about the plant but that the two sides were able to communicate
through intermediaries.
   Shultz also reiterated that the air incident was unrelated to the
plant dispute. He said the Libyan planes engaged in ``aggressive
behavior'' toward the American planes. But, he said, the incident
``must show Libya's uneasiness about the fact that they have
constructed this chemical weapons complex.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that Libya had initiated
secret overtures to the United States in recent months in hopes of
avoiding an armed confrontation, with the most recent contact coming
less than 24 hours before the U.S. Navy planes downed the Libyan
aircraft.
   The Times, quoting unidentified officials, said the overtures
were rejected because they failed to address U.S. complaints that
Gadhafi's regime supports terrorism.
   At the Pentagon, Howard declined to make the Navy aviators
available, but the video footage was released, along with a longer
audio tape. Howard also released a blown-up still photo taken from
the videotape which shows missiles hanging from one of the MiGs.
   He said the crew of one of the Navy jets involved was flown to
Washington Wednesday night and had briefed both himself and top
military leaders Thursday.
   Carlucci said on Wednesday, just hours after the incident, that
two F-14 Tomcats had been flying a routine protective patrol for the
U.S. aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy well off the Libyan coast when
they were approached ``in a hostile manner'' by two MiG-23 fighters.
   The two American planes ultimately fired four missiles and shot
down both of the Soviet-made aircraft, Carlucci said, dismissing
suggestions the F-14s might have been preparing for an attack on a
chemical weapons plant now nearing completion inside Libya.
   On Thursday, Howard offered new details to bolster the American
account of the event. He said the F-14s picked up the Libyan planes
on their radar at a range of 72 nautical miles at 11:57 a.m. local
time.
   The incident was over by 12:03 p.m. local time, with the two MiGs
shot down and two parachutes sighted floating to the water, Howard
said.
   The Pentagon still has no information on the fate of the two
Libyan pilots, Howard said.
   Extensive debriefing of the Navy officers and a review of the
video footage shows the MiG-23 Flogger aircraft five times ignored
evasive maneuvers by the Navy jets and kept turning toward the
Americans ``on a collision course,'' Howard said.
   Even after the lead F-14 fired two Sparrow missiles, the two MiGs
did not break off their approach and instead turned and tried to
jump on the second F-14, the spokesman said.
   Those first two Sparrows apparently did not strike their target.
But a third Sparrow fired by the second F-14 claimed one of the
MiGs, and the lead F-14 was able to pounce on the rear of the other
MiG and down it with a heat-seeking Sidewinder missile, Howard said.
   Howard said the American pilots did not have any indication the
Libyans had turned on their attack radars, as had earlier been
supposed. But intercepted radio communications show the Libyans had
some type of radar on their planes operating and searching for the
F-14s, Howard said.

   Afghan military cadets burned cars and smashed
furniture during a drunken New Year's Day rampage that left three
people dead, including an infant, in the city of Tashkent, a Soviet
newspaper said Thursday.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said the violence began in Tashkent when 30
drunken Afghan cadets went to a market in the capital of Soviet
Uzbekistan to sell sunglasses, lighters and other hard-to-find items
on the black market.
   Soviets objected to Afghans becoming black marketeers during
these ``difficult days,'' the paper said.
   Fighting broke out at the Tashkent market when the Afghans began
insulting Soviets, the paper said. Police intervened and sent the
Afghans back to their dormitories around Tashkent, it said.
   The Afghans gave their version of events to other Afghans living
in the dormitories, and they began smashing furniture and windows,
the paper said. Another group of students, many of whom had smoked
``anasha,'' a narcotic, smashed a traffic police post, the paper
said.
   The Afghans jumped on the hoods of passing cars and lay down on
the street, Komsomolskaya Pravda said. Twenty cars were vandalized
and four burned, the paper said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, quoting a report on the ``debauchery''
printed in Uzbekistan newspapers, said a 6-month-old child was
killed ``as a result of the rampages.'' Two adults died of ``heavy
trauma,'' it said.
   Sixteen people, including seven Afghans, were hospitalized,
including one in critical condition, the paper said.
   The Soviets have been helping the communist Afghan government
battle U.S.-backed guerrillas for nearly a decade. Under a
U.N.-brokered deadline, the Soviets are to withdraw their troops
from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Frictions have been reported before between Afghans and residents
of the Central Asian city of 1.8 million. Tashkent residents last
year told visiting Western journalists that some goods, such as tea
kettles, were taken off the market because Afghans were buying them
up and selling them for big profits in their homeland.

<HEAD>Program For Needy Goes Awry As County Workers Receive Gifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A justice of the peace, a deputy
constable and five Tarrant County workers said they thought they
were winners in a drawing when they received toys and clothing at
Christmas.
   But officials in charge of a giveaway program for the needy had
the employees investigated for fraud after their names showed up on
a list of recipients.
   District Attorney Tim Curry ultimately concluded that no crimes
were committed, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Thursday. But
the district attorney said he was outraged by the bizarre events
that unfolded at the Polytechnic Subcourthouse and an adjacent
welfare agency.
   ``It looks like a comedy of errors and a case of really bad
judgment by a number of people,'' Curry said.
   The Christmas giveaway program, sponsored by Overton Park
National Bank, was administered by the Tarrant County Department of
Human Services.
   The problems apparently began when a receptionist at the
Department of Human Services, asked to find families to submit
applications for the toys, distributed request forms to workers at
the subcourthouse.
   The receptionist said she was never told only needy families
qualified.
   Applicants were asked the ages and clothing sizes of their
children and were asked to list their gift requests on a form
titled, ``Overton Park National Bank Christmas Wish List.''
   One worker said she asked for two pairs of snakeskin boots,
Barbie Dolls, a Lazer Tag game and a Big Wheel. She got the Big
Wheel.
   ``Our fear at this point is that it will leave a bad taste in
people's mouths about helping other people at Christmas,'' Human
Services Director Ann Hamilton said.

<HEAD>Lockheed Awarded Contract To Build Prototypes Of New Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Thursday awarded the Lockheed Corp.
a $52 million contract to build two prototypes of a new
submarine-hunting patrol plane, indicating the project cleared an
internal Pentagon review.
   Last October, after a spirited competition, the Navy selected
Lockheed to develop a modernized version of its P-3C Orion
sub-hunter.
   At the time, however, the Navy said it would not award a contract
for full-scale engineering development until ``after formal review
of the program by the Department of Defense.''
   That review by the Defense Acquisition Board occurred last month.
Thursday's award of the contract means the board, comprised of the
Pentagon's highest ranking acquisition executives, approved the
project as ready to proceed despite a grim financial outlook on
Capitol Hill.
   The Navy said the $52 million was being awarded under a
``fixed-price, incentive contract'' and covered ``the design,
development, fabrication, assembly and testing of two prototype''
planes.
   ``Work will be performed in Palmdale, Calif., and is expected to
be completed in March 1993,'' the Navy added.
   The Navy expects the first prototype to fly in September 1991
with production deliveries beginning in 1994. The ``fly-away cost
estimate'' for each plane is $39.1 million.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A story of robbery and bad blood between drug
dealers was recounted Thursday in a preliminary hearing in a
7-year-old murder case in which the late sex-film star John Holmes
once was prosecuted.
   David Lind, a convicted drug dealer, told how he and Holmes and
two subsequent murder victims planned and carried out a robbery at
the home of Adel Nasrallah two days before a quadruple murder in
Laurel Canyon.
   Nasrallah, 59, a convicted drug dealer who goes by the name Eddie
Nash, is charged along with his bodyguard Gregory Diles, 40, in the
July 1981 slayings. The prosecution claims the bludgeon murders were
carried out in retaliation for the robbery.
   The case had been dormant since Holmes was acquitted of murder
charges in 1982. It was resurrected this year when Scott Thorson, a
former companion of Liberace, was said to have given authorities
information linking Nasrallah to the killings.
   Nasrallah's attorneys said Thursday they have been told that
Thorson will testify as the last witness in the preliminary hearing
which is expected to last seven to 10 days.
   Lind testified that Holmes, who was involved in drug activities
with Nasrallah, suggested the robbery, left a door open for the
robbers to enter and called to alert them when the time was right.
   ``We had been told by Holmes there would be a large amount of
cash and narcotics and jewelry,'' said Lind. Lind said he was the
first to enter the home, confronting Diles, who was serving
breakfast to Nasrallah.
   ``I believe I yelled, `Freeze! Police! You're under arrest!'''
said Lind who recalled carrying a San Francisco policeman's badge.
   ``I take it you were not a police officer at that time,'' asked
Deputy District Attorney Dale Davidson.
   ``Nor have I ever been,'' said Lind, who acknowledged numerous
arrests for robbery as well as drugs.
   Lind said he was handcuffing Diles when, accidentally, Lind's gun
discharged, wounding Diles. He said Nasrallah panicked.
   ``He asked permission to say a prayer for him or his children,''
he recalled. ``He was on his knees.''
   Lind said he and his accomplices, Ronald Launius and Roy
DeVerell, then forced Nasrallah to lead them to a floor safe in a
closet where they found heroin, cocaine, jewelry and ``tens of
thousands'' of dollars in cash which they stole.
   ``How did Mr. Nash appear?'' asked Davidson.
   ``A little upset,'' said the witness.
   Lind said he and the others returned to the Laurel Canyon house
and gave Holmes a share of their proceeds.
   Lind said he left town the next day and never again saw Launius,
37, or DeVerell, 42, alive. They were bludgeoned to death the night
of July 1, 1981, along with Lind's girlfriend, Barbara Richardson,
22, and another resident of the house, Joy Audrey Miller, 46.
   Launius' wife, Susan, survived the attack but was never able to
identify her attacker.
   Holmes, a top pornographic film star of the 1970s, died of AIDS
last March. He reportedly gave death-bed interviews to police who
were investigating the killings. However, Davidson said his
statements were not the basis of the new charges.
   Thorson, who was Liberace's companion from 1977 to 1982, made
headlines when he sued the entertainer for $12 million, claiming he
had reneged on a promise to support Thorson for the rest of his life.
   Liberace died of AIDs in 1987.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday accused five
firms of helping Iraq produce chemical weapons, but in a separate
inquiry cleared another firm of alleged involvement with a suspected
chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   Officials in Bonn, including Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, had stated throughout a weeklong investigation of
Imhausen-Chemie that no evidence had been found to back up U.S.
claims the firm helped Libya build or outfit the Libyan plant.
   But the government's announcement of its findings involving five
other firms dealing with Iraq may have been intended to show
Washington that Bonn takes the issue of chemical weapons seriously.
   U.S. officials say the plant at Rabta, south of the Libyan
capital of Tripoli, is intended to produce chemical weapons. Recent
publicity surrounding Washington's allegations of West German
involvement have strained relations between the two NATO allies.
   A senior official of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Party, Volker Ruehe, appeared on a nationally televised
news show late Thursday to reject U.S. allegations that Bonn ignored
claims of West German shipments of dangerous chemicals.
   ``We have nothing to hide and we are ready to clear up
everything,'' Ruehe, deputy chief of the party's parliamentary
delegation, said on ZDF network. ``But what is especially bad is
that our political will is being doubted.''
   Government spokesman Norbert Schaefer told a news conference on
Wednesday that Bonn officials were not upset by the U.S. charges and
had investigated them with all seriousness.
   The Imhausen inquiry has been top news in West Germany this week,
even more so following Wednesday's U.S. downing of two Libyan jets
over the Mediterranean. Libya and other Arab nations have accused
the United States of provoking the dogfight in anger over the plant.
   West German officials have refrained from commenting on the U.S.
action as well as on the subject of the Libyan plant and its
purposes.
   On Monday, Schaefer confirmed that Kohl had been informed of
Washington's suspicion of West German involvement during his visit
there in November.
   Official inquiries were made, Schaefer said, although Bonn had no
concrete information to work with at the time, such as the names of
the firms alleged to have been involved.
   The Finance Ministry began its investigation of Imhausen's export
records Dec. 30, when the government first learned the company was
implicated by U.S. officials, Schaefer said.
   ``There is no evidence of illegal exports,'' the official in
charge of the Finance Ministry investigation, Freiburg district
director Willi Voegele, told reporters at the Imhausen firm on
Thursday.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, managing director of the company,
repeated his denials of the U.S. allegations, saying the firm had
``nothing, absolutely nothing to do with this `Libyan tale.'''
   The government made public Thursday the text of a Dec. 20 report
to Parliament on the investigation of similar allegations of illegal
exports against five West German firms accused of aiding Iraq in
chemical weapons production.
   From analysis of the materials shipped to Iraq, the report
concluded ``that in all probability, there is evidence that the
equipment in question can be used in production of materials for
chemical weapons.''
   The government said the companies under investigation are Water,
Engineer, Trading of Hamburg; the Karl Kolb company of Dreieich;
Pilot Plant of Dreieich; Preussag of Hanover and Heberger Bau of
Schifferstadt.
   No one answered the telephone at Heberger Bau on Thursday, and
lines to WET of Hamburg were constantly busy. Spokesmen for the
other three firms denied any wrongdoing.
   A spokesman for Preussag, Frederick Meyer, restated his firm's
position that no wrongdoing had been committed. He also questioned
the government's motives in making public the report amid the furor
over U.S. allegations that West German firms were involved in the
construction of a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya.

   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin became the first woman governor to
serve three terms when she took office Thursday and a former
governor in New Hampshire collapsed during inaugural activities and
was hospitalized.
   In Concord, N.H., former Gov. John King was reported in guarded
condition after collapsing hospital during the inauguration of
Republican Gov. Judd Gregg.
   About an hour after Gregg's inaugural speech, King ``slumped to
one side'' in a chair, said Mert Mann, an aide to Rep. Chuck
Douglas. King, 72, was given oxygen as he was taken from the
Statehouse on a stretcher.
   King was governor from 1963 to 1969 and chief justice of the
state Supreme Court from 1981 to 1986.
   Greg Kraft, a nursing supervisor at Concord Hospital, said King
was being evaluated by doctors, who released no information on his
ailment.
   In Vermont, Kunin, 55, asked residents of her state to think
globally to help quell the threats of nuclear war and environmental
destruction.
   ``Increasingly we find Vermont's triumphs and Vermont's problems
linked with those of people around the globe,'' Kunin said in her
inaugural address.
   The Democratic governor also announced the creation of a
six-member panel to strengthen ties with Vermont's northern
neighbor, Quebec.
   Kunin's address came after she was sworn in to a third two-year
term, becoming the first woman governor in the nation to serve three
terms.
   ``Two hundred years ago the threats to our existence were easily
identifiable _ Yorkers to the west and New Hampshirites to the east.
Today's dangers are more elusive, but no less lethal,'' she said.
   ``The greatest threats to life in the 21st century are twofold:
Nuclear war and environmental destruction, either of which would
make our planet uninhabitable.
   ``It will require both political will and moral force to achieve
global agreement that the possibility of nuclear war is obsolete and
that continued environmental degradation is intolerable,'' Kunin
said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Allows Wife's Killer to Retain Custody of Daughters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST DUBUQUE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of strangling his wife
during an argument while their daughters watched said Thursday he is
a good parent, and is happy an appeals court has given him custody
of the girls.
   ``I'm pretty pleased to have the girls back,'' said James Lutgen,
34, of East Dubuque. ``I don't know what happens next. As far as I'm
concerned, this is over and done with now.''
   In a decision made public earlier this week, the Illinois
Appellate Court in Elgin ruled that Lutgen could retain custody of
his daughters, Tracy, 12, and Dana, 10.
   Gene Tranel, of Eldridge, Iowa, the victim's brother, was shocked
at the ruling.
   ``It's really hard to believe,'' Tranel said Thursday. ``It sends
a sad message to society _ that we live in a day and age where this
kind of thing can happen.''
   Lutgen said the ruling ends a four-year nightmare of prison and
court battles that began the night of Dec. 21, 1984, when an
argument with his wife Carol, 26, ended in her death as their
daughters looked on.
   Lutgen was charged with two counts of murder, but later pleaded
guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Prosecutors agreed to the reduced
charge after a court ruling that the girls were too young to testify
as witnesses.
   ``I know I'm a good parent,'' Lutgen said Thursday, adding that
``just because somebody does something wrong'' doesn't mean he
should lose custody of his children permanently.
   ``You have to learn to live and forget,'' he said.
   The appeals court rejected Tranel's appeal of a decision by Jo
Daviess County Judge Eric DeMar of Galena on Dec. 29, 1987, giving
Lutgen custody.
   ``Other than the tragic circumstances which resulted in the death
of Carol, James had an unblemished record,'' the three-member
appeals panel said in its ruling.
   ``Neither our Legislature nor our case law in Illinois has seen
fit to set forth a rule that the killing of one parent by the other
in the presence of the children, no matter what the circumstances,
is sufficient to deprive that parent of his or her children on the
basis of unfitness.''
   Tranel and his wife Deb cared for the Lutgen girls while Lutgen
was on trial and in prison.
   He was released in October 1986, after serving a total 20 months
of a four-year minimum sentence. He regained custody of his
daughters 14 months later.
   ``This case is a family tragedy that is over and it's best it be
put to rest,'' said Lutgen's attorney, William Schirger of Rockford.
   He said the girls are not in any danger living with their father
and noted they told the judge they wanted to live with him.
   Tranel, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lutgen,
said he did not know whether he and his wife would appeal to the
Illinois Supreme Court.
   ``The court system and now even the appellate system has failed
to protect battered women and innocent victims,'' Tranel said. ``It
appears the courts are not willing to deal with domestic violence.''

<HEAD>Number Of Elderly Migrating South Is Declining, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The longstanding flow of retirees from
the Northeast and Midwest to the South's balmier climes is on the
decline, says a University of Florida professor chronicling the
trend.
   ``We've come to expect that there will be a continually large
flow of older people moving from the Northeast and Midwest states to
the South. That's become part of our conventional wisdom,'' says
Stephen Golant, a University of Florida geography professor. But
that's starting to change.
   Golant, whose study is based on U.S. Census data from 1955 to
1985, says that while the 15-state Southern region had a net
migration gain of 280,000 elderly people between 1975-80, the number
of immigrants declined to 208,000 between 1980-85.
   Golant, author of ``A Place to Grow Old: The Meaning of
Environment in Old Age,'' says one reason for the migration shift is
that the number of ``young-old'' _ people ages 65-74 _ is declining
at a faster rate than their ``old-old'' counterparts.
   ``The growth rates for the 65-74 age group in the Northeast and
Midwest, which began declining in the mid-1980s, will continue to
decline substantially throughout the 1990s and into the first part
of the 21st century,'' he said. ``This will reduce the pool of
potential migrants who might relocate to the South.''
   While the 75-plus population will grow at a faster rate than the
young-old, these rates will still be lower than in the 1970s and
early 1980s.
   ``More importantly, the age-75 group has consistently been less
likely to move from state to state or from region to region,'' he
said.
   One consequence of this graying of the population, Golant said,
is that scarce resources may be taxed even further.
   ``Since the old-old will represent an increasingly higher
proportion of the total elderly population in Florida and other
Southern states, it's likely that there will be an increased need
for long-term care facilities, home-care facilities, skilled nursing
and the like.''
   He said there may even be some reverse migration: from the South
back to the Midwest and Northeast.
   ``To the extent that states like Florida are not increasing their
health care and long-term care facilities, it's reasonable to
predict that the more dependent and frail elderly population in the
South will return to their home states, where they would be closer
to their families and to service opportunities,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Asks Dismissal of Two Major Charges Against North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra prosecutor sought dismissal
Thursday of the two major charges against former White House aide
Oliver L. North, giving up a struggle with the Reagan administration
over disclosure of some of the nation's best-kept secrets.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh moved to dismiss conspiracy
and theft charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing
classified information in his defense'' and the Reagan
administration's refusal to release material the judge ruled North
would need at trial.
   North is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carry
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years.
   These include obstructing various congressional and presidential
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statements
and destroying documents.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled a hearing for
Monday to consider Walsh's request, but the judge is expected to
dismiss the charges.
   President Reagan, returning to the White House from a California
vacation, said of Walsh's motion, ``It satisfies our problem, which
has been ... concern about national security ... but of course the
judge has not responded yet. We're waiting to see what the future is
going to be.''
   Asked whether he was going to pardon North, Reagan said, ``We're
waiting for the judicial process to go forward.''
   The president has repeatedly said he has no plans to pardon his
former aide. But the head of the liberal group People for the
American Way criticized the administration's stance on the
classified documents and said Walsh's ``efforts appear to have been
sandbagged.''
   The group's president, Arthur Kropp, said ``the Reagan
administration appears determined to give Ollie North a `pocket'
pardon as a reward for his Iran-Contra activities.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denied such contentions, telling
reporters outside the Justice Department, ``On the contrary, the
assurance that was given to me by Judge Walsh was that he had been
dealt with in good faith, that every line of inquiry that he pursued
he received the fullest cooperation from the executive branch.''
   Walsh had informed Thornburgh of his decision to seek dismissal
at a meeting Wednesday.
   Reagan and Vice President Bush have been subpoenaed by North to
testify at the trial, but dropping the two major charges could make
it harder to show why their testimony would be needed, perhaps
defusing a legal issue that has threatened to delay the trial now
scheduled to begin Jan. 31.
   However, defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., said in an
angrily worded statement that he would continue to seek to use
classified documents to defend the remaining charges against North.
   ``Although the heart of its case is destroyed, the independent
counsel continues to toy with Colonel North and apparently refuses
to recognize that classified information pervades the remaining
charges as well,'' Sullivan said.
   In his motion, Walsh said the conspiracy and theft charges that
North and three co-defendants illegally diverted more than $14
million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels
posed ``the most difficult classified information problems'' in the
case.
   ``These counts allege broad-reaching activities... that include
North's interaction with a number of intelligence agencies and touch
upon a number of highly classified covert programs,'' Walsh said in
a brief motion filed with Gesell.
   ``Efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the risk
that a quantity of classified national security information would be
compromised by a public trial'' on the two charges, Walsh said.
   Among other allegations, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel
and former National Security Council aide is still charged with
illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to help finance the
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras, making personal use of at least
$4,300 in travelers checks he received from the anti-Sandinista
movement and accepting an illegal gift in the form of a $14,000
security fence at his suburban Virginia home.
   But if Gesell grants Thursday's dismissal motion, North would no
longer be accused of illegally diverting arms-for-hostage proceeds
to secretly finance the Contras at a time Congress had banned such
aid.
   Walsh's move also suggests that the two major charges could also
be dismissed later against North's co-defendants, former National
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   That would depend, however, on how much classified information
might be deemed necessary for their defense efforts. Poindexter's
access to secret documents when he worked at the White House would
probably put him in the best position of the three to gain dismissal
on such grounds.
   Walsh's motion was triggered by Gesell's refusal to allow more
censoring of 300 prosecution exhibits to meet administration
concerns about disclosing in court sensitive information about
covert intelligence operations.
   The prosecutor concluded that the two charges ``cannot be tried
in a manner that protects that information.''
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the court is
powerless to order disclosure of secret evidence needed in the case.
But the judge can dismiss certain criminal charges if the government
refuses to make the classified information available for use at a
public trial.
   Gesell had said that if the prosecution were to follow through on
plans to use exhibits covering some 3,000 pages of documents, it had
to include verbatim quotations from intelligence reports and
references to foreign officials by their general importance and
function. The judge also insisted on including references to CIA
officials, sources and propriety companies.
   North had initially sought to disclose several thousand
government documents, covering extremely sensitive information
including efforts to locate U.S. hostages in the Middle East.
   In a tartly worded opinion issued last month, Gesell accused the
defense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitive
information to scuttle the case.

<HEAD>Senior Politician Hits U.S. `Doubts' About Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chemical-Germans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior official of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's political party lashed out on national TV on Thursday at U.S.
suggestions that West Germany has a habit of ignoring exports of
dangerous cargo.
   Volker Ruehe, vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's
parliamentary delegation, rejected the accusations he said were made
by both U.S. news media and officials.
   Ruehe was introduced on ZDF network's ``Today's Journal'' program
by moderator Peter Voss, who said the harshest allegations were
published in The New York Times, which he described as a
``traditional defender of Jewish interests.''
   Ruehe did not comment on or suggest any support for Voss'
description of the newspaper.
   The New York Times on Sunday reported from Washington that U.S.
officials suspected the West German firm Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, in
the Black Forest area, of having supplied materials or assistance to
Libya in building what Washington believes to be a chemical weapons
plant.
   Times columnist William Safire later likened Bonn's claims that
it found no immediate evidence of wrongdoing to the professed
ignorance of ``good Germans'' about Adolf Hitler's Final Solution _
to kill all Jews.
   A University of Wisconsin law professor, Gary Milhollin, also
wrote for the Times that ``it should come as no surprise that a West
German company has been accused of helping Libya'' with the plant
and said the Bonn government has ``rarely done much to discover or
stop dangerous exports.''
   Ruehe said at the start of his five-minute exchange with Voss:
``We must put all the facts on the table. We have nothing to hide
and we are ready to clear up everything.
   ``But what is especially bad is that our political will is being
doubted.'' He said West Germans strongly favor a worldwide ban on
chemical weapons and this position is well known to U.S. authorities.
   ``We are an important allied partner,'' Ruehe said, adding that
trust among the NATO allies is a basic.
   He said he planned a trip to Washington next week to meet members
of Congress to learn what information they have in the Libyan case
and clear up any questions.
   Bonn on Thursday announced it had found no evidence that
Imhausen-Chemie helped build or outfit the Libyan plant in question.

<HEAD>Party Candidates To Be Announced Tuesday; Sakharov Gets More Backing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party will draw up a slate of its
candidates next week for the first multicandidate national election,
and activist Andrei Sakharov received more support for his
candidacy, Soviet news reports said Thursday.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform approved last year
by the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, the election March 26 will
choose the 2,250 members of the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   The ruling 13-member party Politburo on Thursday said the
policy-making Central Committee of about 300 members will meet
Tuesday to list the party nominations, according to the nightly TV
news program ``Vremya'' and the official Tass news agency.
   The Politburo said it received recommendations for candidates
from individual party members and local party organizations as well
as the Communist parties of the 15 Soviet republics. The campaign
began Dec. 26.
   A third of the Congress members will be elected from geographical
districts formed on the basis of equal population. Another third
will be chosen from districts based on their ethnic group. The final
third will be chosen from the Communist Party, Young Communist
League, trade unions, and other social and professional
organizations.
   Under the law the Communist Party is entitled to 100 deputies.
   The Communist Party still is enshrined in the Soviet Constitution
as the guiding force of Soviet society, and the law specifically
prohibits candidates from advocating any unconstitutional action.
   The Congress, in turn, will choose the president and a smaller,
more active Supreme Soviet.
   Tass also reported that Sakharov, dean of the Soviet dissident
movement and the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was nominated for
the Congress of People's Deputies by Leningrad's Ivan Pavlov
Institute of Physiology.
   It was at least the second institute under the Soviet Academy of
Sciences to put Sakharov's name forward as a candidate.
   Officials said last week that Sakharov also had been nominated by
the academy's Institute of the World Economy. Both nominations will
be forwarded to the academy at large for consideration.
   The country's scientific workers, under the new law, can elect 75
members of the Congress.

<HEAD>Pro-Israeli Militia Expels Lebanese From Security Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli-backed Christian militia on
Thursday expelled 31 Lebanese from the strip of land used by Israel
as a buffer zone with Lebanon, police said.
   The South Lebanon Army expelled the Lebanese for ``disrupting
security'' and for being members of the pro-Soviet Lebanese
Communist Party, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Israel has reported a rash of attempted infiltrations into Israel
from Lebanon by Palestinian terrorists. Israel and the South Lebanon
Army patrol the Israeli-designated ``security zone'' in south
Lebanon at the Israeli border.
   Police said those expelled included Najat Bishara, the mother of
a woman who allegedly shot and wounded Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander
of the South Lebanon Army, at his residence in the southern town of
Marjayoun on Nov.8.
   Lahd's reputed assailant, Souha Bishara, 21, is a member of the
Lebanese Communist Party.
   The police spokesman said the expulsions included seven families
from the villages of Kfar Hamam, Ibl el-Saki and Deir Mimas in the
six-to-10-mile-wide zone.
   Israel set up the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its
occupation army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985 to curb
cross-border guerrilla raids.
   Mrs. Bishara, talking to reporters in the southern port of Sidon,
said Christian militiamen ``came to my house in Deir Mimas at 5 a.m.
and told me that I'll have to leave the village.''
   She said she was driven in a jeep to the village of Kfar Tibnit
on the northern edge of the security zone, where she joined the
other deportees.
   The group walked to the nearby market town of Nabatiyeh, where
Moslem militiamen provided them with transport, she said.
   In another development, the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal
militia said Thursday it has banned using its Soviet-made Katyusha
rockets against Israel or in the security zone.
   ``Such action is incompatible with Amal's strategy in its
struggle with the occupier (Israel),'' said an Amal statement issued
in this southern Lebanon port city.
   The mainstream Amal, Arabic for ``hope'', which is at loggerheads
with the fundamentalist pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
long tried to shield the predominantly Shiite population of south
Lebanon from Israeli reprisals for Katyusha attacks.
   ``Firing Katyushas from liberated areas into occupied land is
totally forbidden,'' the Amal statement said.
   The ban followed an Israeli air raid earlier Thursday on an Amal
command post in south Lebanon in which eight Amal militiamen were
wounded.
   The Israeli army command said the post was used the day before
the attack by Syrian-backed Palestinian guerrillas in an abortive
raid on northern Israel. It said all three guerrillas were killed by
Israeli troops.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said in an interview published
Thursday that his country's jamming of Western radio broadcasts was
dangerous because of high levels of electromagnetic radiation it
produced.
   It apparently was the first time a Soviet official made such an
admission about the jamming, which went on for years before
gradually being phased out over the past several years.
   Deputy Communications Minister Gennady Kudryavtsev noted the
Soviets last fall stopped jamming the U.S. Radio Liberty, West
Germany's Deutch Welle and the Voice of Israel.
   ``The jamming stations were usually placed in the center of town;
the electromagnetic radiation in adjacent areas exceeded the safety
norms,'' Kudryavtsev said in an interview carried by the Tass news
agency.
   He did not say what the levels were or explain the effects of
prolonged exposure to high levels.
   ``We will dismantle the outdated jamming stations and use the
modern stations for broadcasting local, republic, and regional
programs,'' he said.
   He said the power of the stations will be lowered, therefore
lowering the electromagnetic emissions.
   If at lower output they still exceed safety norms, they will be
closed, he said.
   The Soviet Union for years jammed broadcasts by stations such as
the British Broadcasting Corp., Voice of America, Radio Liberty and
other Western broadcasters. Jamming of Voice of America broadcasts
in Russian and other languages of the Soviet Union was halted in May
1987.

<HEAD>1988's Top Movies: `Roger Rabbit,' `Coming to America' and `Big'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedy was the big box office draw in 1988, with
a cartoon rabbit, an African prince and a kid trapped in a man's
body leading the ticket sales.
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' grossed $150 million to finish at No.
1, according to year-end figures released Wednesday by Exhibitor
Relations Co., which tracks movie successes and failures.
   The movie, co-produced by Walt Disney and Steven Spielberg's
Amblin Productions, mixed live action and animation.
   ``Roger Rabbit'' was followed by Eddie Murphy's ``Coming to
America,'' the tale of an African prince who goes to New York in
search of a bride, which netted $128.1 million. The No. 3 movie,
with revenues of $112 million, was ``Big,'' Tom Hanks' depiction of
a young boy trapped in a man's body.
   ``Nothing was actually predominant except comedy,'' Exhibitor
Relations chief John Krier said Thursday. There were six comedies in
the Top 10 list.
   ``There was some thought the (interest) for action-adventure
films had fallen off, but there were just less of them this year,''
he added.
   Two such films, ``Rambo III'' and ``Die Hard,'' were among the
top movies, although the high cost of producing ``Rambo'' meant
domestic distribution was unprofitable.
   Box-office receipts for 1988's top three titles were down from
1987, as no film surpassed the $150 million mark this year. A year
ago, three films _ ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Fatal Attraction''
and ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' _ all collected more than $150 million.
   Krier warned moviemakers could face problems in 1989 from
``overscreening'' _ too many theaters built too close together
during a recent boom in movie house construction.
   ``That can result in shorter play times for movies in invividual
theaters, meaning more product is needed,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the holiday film season was down more than $5 million
from a year ago. Grosses from Nov. 29 to this Wednesday were $564
million, off from $569.8 million during the corresponding weeks in
1987. The last two weeks of 1988, with revenues of $221.6 million,
were off from the same period in 1987, with revenues of $257.8
million.
   Here is a list of the top films released in the 1988 calendar
year, followed by the amount they grossed. Hits released in late
1987 were not eligible. Box-office receipts for 1988 ended on Dec.
29, the last full week of the year.
   A complete comparison of 1988 box-office grosses compared with a
year ago would be released in mid-January, officials said.
   1. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a Disney film directed by Robert
Zemeckis and starring Bob Hoskins and a host of animated characters.
$150 million.
   2. ``Coming to America,'' a Paramount film directed by John
Landis and starring Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. $128.1 million.
   3. ``Big,'' a 20th Century Fox film directed by Penny Marshall
and starring Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins. $112 million.
   4. ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' a Paramount picture directed by
John Cornell and starring Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski. $109.2
million.
   5. ``Die Hard,'' a 20th Century Fox film directed by John
McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. $79.7 million.
   6. ``Cocktail,'' a Disney film directed by Roger Donaldson and
starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown. $76.8 million.
   7. ``Beetlejuice,'' a Warner Bros. release directed by Tim Burton
and starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis. $73.3 million.
   8. ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' an MGM-UA film directed by Charles
Crichton and starring John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline.
$60 million.
   9. ``Willow,'' an MGM-UA film directed by Ron Howard and starring
Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley. $55.8 million.
   10. ``Rambo III,'' a Tri-Star release directed by Peter Macdonald
and starring Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna. $53.7 million.

   The Ambassador of Laughter, Bozo the Clown,
celebrated on Thursday his 30th year on television.
   The anniversary makes Bozo's show the longest-running live, daily
children's television program. A party to mark the occassion was
held at the Century Plaza Hotel.
   ``Everybody still loves me and still cares about me,'' said the
original Bozo, Larry Harmon, in a telephone interview. ``When you do
something good for the world, you do something good for yourself and
it all turns out wowee, oh wow, wow _ so good!''
   The Ambassador of Laughter, as Harmon likes to call Bozo, is
known around the world. In France, he's called ``Bozo Le Clown'' and
in Brazil he's known as ``Bozo El Payaso.''
   The daily, half-hour ``Bozos Show'' made its debut on Jan. 5,
1959. The show is televised to an estimated 28 million homes in 183
cities nationwide where kids can see Bozo, or a locally-franchised
version of the show.
   Harmon, who celebrated his own 64th birthday on Monday, came up
with the idea of having local actors portray Bozo in live shows
around the country. Harmon himself does not appear on television but
said he trains most of the actors on Bozo nuances.
   The show has produced 50,000 episodes; Bozo has appeared in more
than 10,000 parades; and so far, 200 people have portrayed the
snickering clown, including Willard Scott, the weather man for NBC's
``The Today Show,'' who started out as a Bozo in August 1959.
   Although the trend lately seems to be in maligning the clown,
such as the ``No Bozos Allowed'' bumper stickers and the derogatory
use of the word Bozo as an adjective for dumb or stupid, Harmon
believes there is a place in every person's heart for a Bozo.
   ``Bozo transcends time,'' Harmon said. ``Whatever the time Bozo
is with it. I've gone underwater, I've fought fire and flown way
above the Earth with NASA astronauts.''

   An Israeli man was killed in the West Bank, and
Jewish settlers tried to raid nearby Arab villages in revenge about
midnight Thursday, but troops ejected them and blocked roads into
Arab areas, Israel radio said.
   Earlier Thursday, 17 Palestinians were reported wounded by army
gunfire in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and West Bank
residents said an Arab slain by gunmen was suspected of
collaborating with Israel.
   In Bethlehem, soldiers ordered residents to paint over graffiti
threatening death to Elias Freij, mayor of the West Bank city. The
slogans appeared after Freij proposed a truce in the Palestinian
uprising.
   The Israeli civilian's body was found Thursday night by the road
leading into the Jewish settlement of Yakir, and it appeared he had
been shot, a military spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, who under regulations was not identified, said
the army and police were investigating all possibilities and had not
ruled out a guerrilla attack. Israel radio said the man had ``a
criminal past.''
   The man was a resident of the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva. He
was apparently shot as he waited for a ride at an isolated
crossroads leading from a main road into Yakir, 24 miles north of
Jerusalem. The time of the shooting was not known.
   The army closed off surrounding areas and searched for suspects,
the spokeswoman said. Army radio said troops imposed curfews on two
nearby Arab villages, Kifl Harith and Dir Istiya.
   If the man were killed as part of the 13-month Palestinian
uprising, he would be the 15th Israeli fatality. At least 347
Palestinians have been killed.
   Residents of Ariel, a neighboring Jewish settlement, took to the
streets at around midnight, Army radio said. They tried to block a
main road and threw rocks at Arab cars in anger over the killing,
the radio said.
   Israel's state radio said troops ousted settlers who entered an
Arab village and smashed windshields of cars.
   Thursday's shooting injuries occurred during two clashes in the
West Bank and during rioting in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City,
according to Arab reports and hospital officials.
   In Shati, soldiers fired when they were stoned while trying to
drive through streets youths had blocked with rocks and burning
tires, Arab reporters said. Officials at the Shifa and Ahli Arab
hospitals said 15 Palestinians aged 15 to 37 were shot.
   An army official said on condition of anonymity that soldiers
fired in self-defense. ``They were in danger,'' he said.
   He said he had reports of 11 Palestinians wounded and did not
know of any soldiers being hurt.
   Two more Palestinians were shot in clashes between youths and
soldiers near the West Bank cities of Nablus and Tulkarem, hospital
officials said.
   Palestinian residents of Jericho in the West Bank said
25-year-old Bassam Barahmeh, who was shot to death Wednesday, was
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   Army officials confirmed the death but said they knew nothing of
Barahmeh's activities.
   In Bethlehem, soldiers rounded up youths and some shopkeepers and
ordered them to paint over slogans threatening Freij, one of the
West Bank's best-known moderates.
   Just before Christmas, Freij proposed a one-year truce in the
uprising.
   He told reporters this week he was withdrawing the offer after
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said in Saudi Arabia that anyone trying
to stop the revolt ``exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''
   Arafat made the comment during a rally Jan. 1 marking the
anniversary of his Fatah movement, part of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Freij said he could not believe Arafat had made such a
threatening statement. He denied reports he had been in hiding.
   The slogans, signed by the radical PLO faction Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, included ``Shame on all the traitors''
and ``The fate of Freij will not be better than that of Zafer Al
Masri.''
   Masri, the pro-Jordanian mayor of Nablus, was slain in 1986 after
indications he might play a role in the peace process with Israel.
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press, Freij called the
threats ``absolutely meaningless.''
   Freij's offer was linked to Israel releasing 5,000 prisoners and
opening universities it closed nearly a year ago. The PLO rejected
the idea, and Israel made no formal response.

<NOTE>^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A surge of warm air raised temperatures across the Plains states
into the unseasonal 60s Thursday as far north as Kansas, while more
seasonal temperatures chilled both coasts.
   The low pressure system that brought warmer air also put
widespread rain and a few thunderstorms in the central Plains and
mid-Mississippi Valley from central Nebraska through eastern Kansas,
Missouri and southern Iowa into northeast Texas.
   A storm system that brought freezing rain to north central
Nebraska was moving northeast, extending advisories for freezing
rain from northern and central Iowa into southwest and south-central
Wisconsin.
   Winter storm watches were posted for the southern half of Lower
Michigan and for much of Ohio.
   A cold front across the Northwest spread rain across the central
Pacific Coast, with snow in higher elevations of southern Oregon and
California _ as much as a foot possible in the high Sierra Nevada.
   Up to 8 inches of new snow fell at Lake Tahoe as a winter storm
warning was posted for central Nevada for 6 to 10 inches of snow in
the valleys and up to 18 inches in the higher elevations.
   Winter storm warnings were also in effect throughout north
central Montana, where wind gusts to 45 mph were reported at
Livingston and up to 6 inches of snow was expected by Friday morning.
   High pressure from southwest Quebec into the Carolinas brought
ver cold air to New England, with readings in single digits and
teens Thursday afternoon and winds up to 30 mph producing wind
chills of 25 below to 40 degrees below zero.
   Lake Charles, La., reached 73 degrees, tying the record high
temperature for the date of 1956.
   The low in the nation was 16 degrees below zero at Caribou,
Maine, while temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged
from 4 degrees above zero at Limestone, Maine, to 86 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.
   The national forecast for Friday called for snow likely across
the northern Plains and from southern New York and northern
Pennsylvania into Long Island, with freezing rain from western and
southern Pennsylvania through Maryland and into southern New Jersey.
Rain will be likely from northern Ohio through the central
Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic Coast.
   Rainshowers will be scattered along the Northern Pacific Coast,
with snowshowers from the northern Rockies through the upper Great
Lakes into southern New england. Rainshowers will be scattered from
the lower Great Lakes to the Carolinas, with a few thunderstorms
from northern Georgia into much of Alabama.
   High temperatures will be in the 20s, 30s or 40s across much of
the nation; in the single digits and teens from the northern Rockies
through the northern Plains and across northern Maine; in the 50s
from the central and southern California coast into southwest
Arizona; in the 50s and 60s from southwest Texas through the
southern Plains, Arkansas and the Tennessee Valley to the Carolina
coast; the 70s from southern and central Texas through the lower
Mississippi Valley and northern Florida; and the 80s over extreme
southern Texas and southern Florida.

<HEAD>Two Groups Claim Killing Of Saudi Diplomat in Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two extremist groups Thursday claimed
responsibility for the assassination of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in
Thailand on Wednesday.
   The two Arabic-language statements came from the Soldiers of
Justice and the Islamic Jihad in Hijaz and were delivered to the
offices of a Western news agency in west Beirut.
   Both groups in the past have claimed killings of Saudi diplomats.
   Saleh Abdullah Maliki, 35, was gunned down as he walked down a
side street near the Saudi Embassy in Bangkok on the way home to
host a party.
   ``The Soldiers of Justice declares responsibility for the
assassination of Satan Saleh Maliki in a commercial neighborhood in
Bangkok on Wednesday,'' said one statement.
   Police in Bangkok have said they were seeking a young
``Arab-looking'' gunman. They said no arrests have been made and no
motive firmly established.
   The statement said the Saudi third secretary was killed ``on his
way back after arranging some deals that serve the Great Satan
America and its protege Israel.
   ``Little did this Satan know that our heroic mujahedeen (holy
warriors) had been watching him,'' it said.
   The statement warned Saudi officials to stop ``tracking down our
mujahedeen and serving the hypocrites. Otherwise, you will be justly
punished.''
   Last week, the Soldiers of Justice claimed responsibility for the
attempted assassination of Saudi Arabia's consul in Karachi,
Pakistan.
   The group also claimed responsibility in early December for
kidnapping Belgian physician Jan Cools, who disappeared in south
Lebanon on May 21.
   It also claimed an arson attack on a Jewish club in Copenhagen,
Denmark, on Dec. 11.
   The Islamic Jihad in Hijaz said in its statement the group had
killed ``one of Saudi Arabia's secret service agents, the third
secretary at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Bangkok, Salah Maliki'' to
avenge the killing of four of its followers in Saudi Arabia.
   On Oct. 26, the same group claimed responsibility for the
assassination of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in Ankara, Turkey, saying
it was taking revenge for the deaths of the same four members.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa played down a
split in the independent labor movement on Thursday after a longtime
rival appeared uninivited at a news conference to press his
differences.
   Andrzej Gwiazda showed up at the Walesa news conference with a
copy of a statement from the ``Working Group of the National
Commission,'' a hard-line splinter group seeking less conciliation
with the government.
   According to a witness, Walesa appeared agitated when presented
with the group's document at his weekly news conference in Gdansk,
but did not address Gwiazda directly.
   ``What is happening now in Solidarity _ and some people call it a
split _ seems to me to be harmful to Solidarity but it is not really
dangerous and is only marginal,'' Walesa told reporters. ``I will
tolerate it as long as it does not pose a danger to Poland and to
the union.
   ``Today we are fighting for implementation of pluralism in
Poland. Later, after winning pluralism, all those groups will have a
place for themselves. But they should not disturb us in regaining
(legal status for) Solidarity, in reforms and in the struggle ... to
achieve one thing: pluralism for all.''
   Solidarity, which Walesa founded in 1980, is the Soviet bloc's
first independent labor movement.
   Gwiazda was an early colleage of Walesa but split with him and
unsuccessfully sought the union's top post before the government's
1981 crackdown on the union, when martial law was declared.
   The splinter group's name refers to the Solidarity National
Commission, which last met in 1981. It was a nationwide elected
assembly of local union representatives.
   Gwiazda organized the group at a Dec. 18 meeting in Gdansk with
40 people, including 16 former commission members. It advocates that
Solidarity become more confrontational.
   The group passed a resolution urging that the 200-plus commission
members be reassembled, a step that Walesa has dismissed as
unrealistic because many of them have emigrated or drifted away from
Solidarity.
   Solidarity is now governed by a National Executive Commission of
about 20 members called together by Walesa and representing regions.
Each region has its own executive commission.
   Gwiazda could not immediately be reached for comment, and no one
answered the phone at his home. But Gdansk Solidarity activist
Joanna Wojciechowicz read a portion of a statement co-authored by
Gwiazda that was among the papers given to Walesa.
   The statement says Solidarity is in danger of adopting a policy
of reconciliation that inhibits its ability to fight for workers,
and that some Solidarity activists are becoming private business
owners hostile to unions.
   ``Solidarity has become split into activists who trust Lech
Walesa ... and those who remain faithful to Solidarity,'' the
statement said.
   ``We are of the opinion that it is necessary for the good of the
working people and Solidarity's credibility to concentrate all
forces in defense of the economic interests of employees. We propose
a fight for maximum levels of pay increase wherever possible,'' the
statement said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban and the official PAP news agency
have called attention to the split.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski last month asked the
Communist Party Central Committee to reconsider the party's stance
toward Solidarity and said Walesa was a reliable partner for talks.
The committee members are to meet this month and give a response.

   Nearly 600 state prison inmates were
given their freedom just early Thursday under pressure from the
federal courts to ease overcrowding in Louisiana's lockups.
   Most inmates appeared happy to be free, but some complained about
the way they were released and about the midnight hour.
   Robert Dennis Hage, a convicted rapist, said he was taken to a
Baton Rouge Greyhound terminal after getting $20 by the corrections
department.
   ``There was no organization in all of this,'' said Hage. ``You
get $20 and they say `There's the door.' I've already spent $5 here
for a skimpy breakfast.''
   He was in the first contingent of 900 to be released this month
under an updated law that allows early freedom for inmates with good
behavior records.
   The law is one of the few approved by a reluctant Legislature to
ease overcrowding in a system that has more than 12,000 people in
nine institutions, with 4,000 held temporarily in parish jails
awaiting space in state lockups.
   Limits were placed on each state prison by the federal courts in
1975. By 1982 every lockup in Louisiana, incuding 178 local jails,
was under federal court order that prohibited overcrowding and
required better living conditions.
   Under the law, prisoners who have served half their sentences are
eligible for early release for ``good time,'' or exemplary behavior.
Wardens and other penal officials make the final decision on who is
released early.
   The early release law initially was passed in 1986, but it only
affected inmates held in state-operated prisons. That law was
amended in 1988 to cover all state prisoners regardless of where
they were held.
   Red tape and paperwork delayed the first early releases under the
law until Thursday, prison officials said.
   The gates were opened for the inmates at 12:01 a.m. and those
with no family waiting were taken to the Greyhound terminal in Baton
Rouge.
   Martha Jumonville, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections,
said that the official release date was Jan. 5, which means 12:01
a.m.
   ``I think you'll find most of them wanted to get out as fast as
possible,'' she said. Some inmates disagreed.
   ``A lot of these guys are going to be back because they're going
home with nothing,'' said Hage. ``We were paid 4 cents an hour for
our labor. If they'd pay a little more, maybe they could give each
inmate $1,000.
   ``Sure, some would spend it all on hookers, drugs or booze. But a
lot of them would see that as a start. They wouldn't have to go home
and beg from a little sister for pennies.''
   ``We're up almost all night, get dumped here at 4:30 and there's
no overnight shelters open at this time,'' said another inmate, who
did not identify himself. ``We wait here and spend money we can't
spare.''
   ``I'm not happy with our criminal justice system,'' Gov. Buddy
Roemer said earlier at a news conference, adding that his executive
counsel will head a task force to study it ``all the way from
sentencing to rehabilitation.''
   Of the 575 released Thursday, 270 state prisoners were freed from
parish jails and the rest from the state-operated prisons.

<HEAD>King Hassan Has Second Meeting With Polisario Guerrilla Delegation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation from the Polisario
guerrilla movement, which has been fighting Morocco for 13 years
seeking independence for the Western Sahara, met with King Hassan II
Thursday, official sources said.
   A near total blackout has surrounded the talks since the
Polisario delegation arrived Tuesday from its headquarters in
Algiers, Algeria. Thursday's meeting was the second between the
Polisario and the monarch.
   A brief statement put out by the Information Ministry Wednesday
after the first meeting said only that the discussions involved the
situation in the former Spanish colony ``in the perspective of the
decided referendum.''
   Both Morocco and the guerrilla movement have accepted the
principle of a referendum on the future of the northwest African
territory, annexed by Morocco after the Spanish withdrew at the end
of 1975. But the Polisario has demanded a pullout of Moroccan troops
first, followed by direct negotiations, refused by Morocco.
   The members of the Polisario delegation meeting the king included
Bechir Mustapha Sayed, foreign minister of the Saharan Arab
Democratic Republic declared by the Polisario in 1976. The
delegation also included Mahfoud Ali Beiba, prime minister, and
Brahim Ghali, defense minister.
   On Wednesday, the three Polisario delegates met with Moroccan
Foreign Minister Abdellatif Fillali, Interior Minister Driss Basri,
and Ahmed Reda Guedira, counsellor to the king.
   During their stay in Morocco, the sources said, the Polisario
delegation met with a group of Sahara natives who remain loyal to
the Moroccan monarchy, several of whom occupy official positions.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Officials in Marrakech did not say when the Polisario delegation
departed. But the Algerian news agency Algerie Presse Service
reported from Algiers that the delegation left at the end of the
afternoon.

   An express train traveling from West
Germany collided with a truck Thursday and derailed, killing at
least seven people and injuring about 100, the Tanjug news agency
said.
   Earlier in the day, five people were injured when another train
crashed into a bus along the same line, Tanjug said.
   The Munich-to-Belgrade train hit the truck about 25 miles west of
the capital at about 2:25 p.m., Tanjug said. The engine and six of
the 11 cars left the track, it said.
   Tanjug reported seven deaths and at least 100 injuries. Thirty
people were seriously hurt and had to be hospitalized, it said.
   Witnesses said the train was carrying about 400 people when the
crash occurred. Workers trying to recover casualties from the
tangled wreckage were hampered by thick fog and sub-freezing
temperatures.
   Cynthia Davis of Louisville, Ky., who works as a cook at a
Frankfurt, West Germany, hotel, suffered a broken arm in the crash.
   ``There were two sudden stops and then the crash,'' Davis, 24,
said by telephone from the Sremska Mitrovica hospital.
   Tanjug said the collision took place between the towns of
Golubinci and Putinci in Vojvodina.
   The truck's driver, Jure Gaspar, was arrested on suspicion of
having been responsible for the accident, Tanjug said.

<HEAD>Madonna, Sean Penn to Divorce</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with further quotes, details, background; no

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Sean Penn and singer Madonna have
separated and are planning to end their turbulent, three-year
marriage, a spokesman for the pugnacious actor said Thursday.
   The announcement follows a nullified divorce filing from late
1987 and several well-publicized fights between the hot-tempered
Penn and photographers, one of which led to a 60-day prison term.
   New divorce rumors have swirled around the couple for months.
   ``It is true,'' spokesman John West said. ``Sean and Madonna are
separated. They plan to divorce and it's amicable.''
   Bob Merlis, a spokesman for Madonna's record label, Warner Bros.,
said that Madonna brought the divorce action. ``I assume (the
divorce was filed) in Los Angeles,'' he said.
   Telephone messages left with Penn's lawyers were not immediately
returned.
   Madonna, a singer best know as the ``Material Girl,'' won stardom
with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a Virgin.'' Her latest album
for Warner Bros., due out late next month, is titled ``Like a
Prayer.''
   Penn, who has starred in the movies ``Colors,'' ``The Falcon and
the Snowman,'' ``Bad Boys,'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,''
is appearing in on the Los Angeles stage in ``Hurlyburly,'' a play
about Hollywood decadence.
   A spokesman for the play, Jay Schwartz, said that Penn would
complete the play's run to Jan. 15.
   The couple married in August 1985 in a Malibu ocean-bluff
ceremony that was buzzed by press photographers in helicopters.
Madonna, whose full name is Madonna Louise Ciccone, appeared in nude
photographs in Playboy and Penthouse magazines the month before the
nuptials.
   The couple starred together in the ill-fated 1986 feature
``Shanghai Surprise,'' in which Madonna played a missionary
smuggling opium in the Orient.
   The pugnacious Penn served more than half of a 60-day prison term
in 1987 for violating parole by punching a movie extra.
   Penn was on probation from an earlier case that stemmed from a
fight he had with a man he accused of trying to kiss Madonna in a
nightclub in April 1986.
   In an interview that year, he spoke fondly of his wife. ``Nothing
that I could possibly come up with is as important as her,'' he
said. ``No movie, nothing is as important as her. And that's about
the best answer I can give.
   ``No whale, no nuclear war, no starving nation is more important,
either.''

<HEAD>Cabinet Approves Budget Cuts, Israeli Austerity Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Thursday approved budget cuts
that will slash $67 million from defense allocations as part of an
economic austerity program designed to cut inflation and promote
growth, Israel radio said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin resisted the move, which comes as
the army tries to put down a 13-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Communications Minister Gad Yakobi, who was on a special Cabinet
committee that hammered out the compromise, told Israel television:
``I think this is a fair compromise. Despite the economic crisis, it
does the maximum not to affect the army's degree of preparedness.''
   The military cutback is part of $611 million in spending cuts
proposed for education, health and other government services.
   The vote was 18-to-2, the radio said, with Education Minister
Yitzhak Navon and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon opposed.
   It said Navon strongly opposed cuts in school spending, and
Sharon felt the overall budget plan does not allocate enough money
for new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories or for
collective farms.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres said the goal is to hold the
deficit in the new budget year, beginning April 1, to the same level
as in the current year. This year's budget deficit is projected at
about $722 million.
   The government has not yet released figures on what actual
spending for the new fiscal year will be. The current budget totals
$29 billion.
   Peres, who assumed office with the new Cabinet in December, began
his austerity program last week by devaluing the shekel 5 percent
against the dollar. On Sunday, he announced a further devaluation of
8 percent.
   The shekel was adjusted to boost Israel's flagging exports and to
stop a run on the dollar that was draining the nation's foreign
currency reserves.
   Peres also announced a sharp cut in government subsidies on such
basics as milk, chicken and public transport to keep this year's
deficit under control.
   He has proposed revenue-raising measures that include higher
taxes on new and luxury cars, larger health insurance payments, new
fees at medical clinics, registration fees for high school students
and higher tuitions at universities.
   Peres initially hoped to cut as much as $166 million from
defense, but ran into strong resistance from Rabin.
   Rabin told Israel radio he was agreeing to the cut because he
couldn't ignore Israel's economic difficulties. But he said his
ministry would have to shift funds from other military programs to
face the high cost of handling the Palestinian insurrection.
   A Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity that
the estimated cost of handling the uprising from the time it started
in December 1987 through next March was $222 million.
   Police Minister Bar Lev said 200 officers will lose their jobs
because of the $3.3 million reduction in his budget and pledged to
keep his officers focused on security duties, Israel radio said.
   Navon objected strongly to the proposal that the government
introduce high school registration fees ranging from 100 to 800
shekels ($55 to $440) a year.
   Such fees, he told Israel radio, ``will lead to dropouts.''
   Peres has set an inflation target of 9 percent by the end of
1989, about half the current rate. He also hopes to stimulate
greater economic growth in Israel. The nation's gross national
product grew just 1 percent this past year.

<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 12th graf, `Crown Prince...' to CORRECT prince's age.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure plunged
dangerously and failed to recover Thursday despite two emergency
transfusions, indicating a sharp decline in his already frail
health, palace officials said.
   Early Friday, Hirohito's breathing rate jumped dramatically to 32
breaths a minute from his normal rate of 20 to 22 breaths due to his
weakened condition, said Ken Maeda, spokesman for the imperial
palace.
   But he said the 87-year-old monarch was ``clearly conscious'' and
that his latest vital signs did not present an immediate crisis.
   Hirohito was given 1.72 pints of blood Thursday in two
transfusions after his systolic blood pressure fell below 70, but it
rose only to 74 by evening, Maeda said.
   Such low levels can permanently damage the kidneys, brain and
other internal organs because of the reduced amount of oxygen
flowing to them. The average person has a systolic blood pressure of
120.
   Sources close to the palace physicians said the level of waste
products in Hirohito's blood has reached dangerous levels because of
kidney damage, Kyodo News Service reported.
   In the past, transfusions have raised the emperor's blood
pressure in a relatively brief period of time, but the recovery time
lengthened as Hirohito's strength waned during more than 3{ months
of intermittent internal bleeding.
   The low blood pressure indicates Hirohito continues to lose blood
internally. Although no discharges were reported Thursday, ``the
lost blood may still be in his body,'' a palace official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Doctors fear the emperor is weakening and are focusing their
efforts on lifting his blood pressure, the official said.
Previously, doctors concentrated on averting massive blood loss, but
now ``the emperor might not have enough energy to discharge a large
amount of blood,'' he added.
   Transfusions have been a major treatment since the emperor's
contidion worsened Sept. 19, when he vomited a substantial amount.
By Thursday evening he had received 67.8 pints of blood.
   Palace officials have refused to comment on news reports that the
emperor is suffering from cancer in his upper intestine or pancreas.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's elder son, is heir to the
throne. Hirohito, the longest reigning living monarch, marked the
beginning of his 63rd year as emperor on Dec. 25, the anniversary of
the death of his father, Emperor Taisho.
   Under the post-World War II constitution, Japan's emperor holds
only symbolic power.

   A Navy cockpit tape of this week's
confrontation between U.S. and Libyan jet fighters offers only
flashes of video images, but provides in audio the drama of American
aviators being unexpectedly caught up in combat.
   The tape, released late Thursday at the Pentagon, also supports
the assertions of administration officials that the two Navy F-14's
repeatedly tried to maneuver away from two chasing Libyan MiG
fighters; the pilot of the lead F-14 can be heard counting each time
he tries to head away, only to have the ``bogies jink back into us.''
   Although the quality is not good, the tape concludes with a
dramatic rush of pictures at the end of the dogfight _ when the last
Libyan MiG is suddenly within visual range.
   The tape shows the lead F-14 struggling to line up in a firing
position behind the MiG-23, finally succeeding in getting a tone
alert for his Sidewinder missile that allows him to fire.
   Pentagon officials, after unveiling the cockpit tape, announced
they were also releasing a still picture taken from the video tape
to prove the Libyan MiG-23 Flogger jets were armed. Libya had
claimed on Wednesday after the confrontation the United States shot
down two unarmed reconnaissance jets.
   The audio portion of the cockpit tape is about 7{ minutes in
length, while the video portion is less than 30 seconds. The audio
portion shows that early on in the confrontation, the American
aviators became concerned about the Libyans' intent.
   After the second attempt to maneuver away from the MiG-23's, the
F-14's go to a ``Warning Yellow, Weapons Hold'' status. That is an
intermediate stage in the process of preparing to fire in self
defense.
   Shortly thereafter, the Americans again try to maneuver away.
   ``Bogies have jinked back into me now, for the third time, noses
on, at 35 miles, Angels 7,'' the lead pilot reports.
   Angels 7 means the plane's altitude is 7,000 feet.
   At 27 miles apart, the F-14's try again and again, their
maneuvers are matched by the Libyans.
   Then after a fifth evasive maneuver: ``Bogies have jinked back at
me again for the fifth time. They're on my nose now, inside of 20
miles.''
   At this point, the lead aircraft commander decides to defend
himself.
   ``Master Arm On,'' he says. ``Master Arm On. Centering Up the T.
Bogies have jinked back into me again. Sixteen miles. Centering the
Dot.''
   The phrases ``centering up the T'' and ``centering the dot''
refer to the use of a cockpit steering cue to ensure an optimum
missile launch position. When ready, the pilot calls out ``Fox 1''
when he fires a Sparrow missile and ``Fox 2'' when he fires a
Sidewinder.
   ``Fourteen miles. Fox 1. Fox 1.''
   At this point, the backseat radar weapons officer can be heard
saying, ``Aw, Jesus.''
   ``Ten miles. He's back on my nose. Fox 1 again,'' the pilot calls
out.
   ``Six miles. Six miles.''
   Then another voice _ again apparently the backseat weapons
officer _ can be heard saying, ``Tally Two, Tally Two,'' meaning the
two Libyans have just come into visual sight.
   The pilot of the F-14 then says, ``Five miles. Four miles.''
   The second F-14 flying as wingman then fires a Sparrow and the
weapons officer in the lead F-14 reports to his pilot, ``Okay, he's
got a missile off.''
   At this point, it becomes almost impossible to determine who is
talking at each point, but the tape continues:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Good hit. Good hit on 1.''
   ``Roger that. Good kill. Good kill.''
   ``I've got the other one.''
   ``Select Fox 2. Select Fox 2.''
   ``All right, Fox 2.''
   ``Those (expletive deleted)...''
   ``Shoot him.''
   ``I don't got a tone.''
   ``Lock him up. Lock him up.''
   ``Shoot him. Fox 2.''
   ``I can't. I don't have a (expletive deleted) tone.''
   At this point, the lead F-14 finally succeeds in manuevering
behind the jinking MiG and gets his missile tone, firing the
Sidewinder.
   ``Good kill. Good kill.''
   ``Good kill.''
   ``Pilot ejected.''
   ``Okay ... let's head north. Head north.''
   ``Let's go down low, on the deck. Unload, 500 knots. Let's get
out of here.''
   ``We're showing two good chutes in the air here.''
   Then in a report back to the carrier: ``Roger. Two Floggers. Two
Floggers splashed. We're heading north.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said no effort was made by the
Americans to communicate by radio with the Libyans. The F-14s did
not have compatible radio equipment, and the E-2C radar sentry plane
that was also airborne did not try. There was not enough time to
make such an attempt, and such tries at radio communication are not
standard procedure when dealing with Libya.

<HEAD>Former Securities President to Plead Guilty and Cooperate in Stock
Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 29-year-old former president of a Wall Street
securities firm will plead guilty to manipulating stock that climbed
in value while others tumbled in the crash of October 1987, federal
prosecutors said Thursday.
   Stanley Aslanian Jr., former president of Haas Securities Corp.,
also will cooperate with an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan into his firm's activities.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said he hoped Aslanian's plea
bargain would encourage others allegedly involved in securities
fraud to do the same.
   An FBI spokesman said 20 agents are assigned to investigate stock
manipulation, probing and unidentified persons, entities and deals.
Giuliani said the investigation will be about past activities, not
current ones.
   Aslanian would plead guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud by
manipulating stock, Giuliani said.
   Under court procedure, Aslanian pleaded innocent before a U.S.
magistrate Thursday and waived his right to require the government
to present his case to a grand jury for possible indictment, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Lieb.
   Aslanian faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   According to the information filed by the government, Haas
Securities went out of business Oct. 28, 1987, after Aslanian was
involved in manipulating stocks.
   Haas Securities was a 75-year-old firm with 12,000 customers and
four offices across the nation, officials said. Giuliani said the
company employed more than 100 people.
   One way Haas Securities manipulated stock was to enter inflated
prices into the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations computer network, Lieb said.
   Kalman Gallop, Aslanian's attorney, said Haas Securities is in
Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.
   ``Millions and millions of dollars'' were involved but profits
could not be easily determined, Gallop said. Aslanian declined to
comment.
   The securities' stock rode out, even rose above, the stock market
crash of Oct. 19, 1987, before it came tumbling down, Gallop said.
   ``They held up remarkably for a day or two and some went up after
the 19th. They had an erratic behavior,'' Gallop said.
   Then the company faltered and the investigation began once Haas
went out of business nine days after the crash, Lieb said. Gallop
acknowledged there were customer complaints.
   ``We have seen a proliferation of these kinds of activities since
the crash,'' James C. Esposito, an assistant deputy director of the
FBI, said at the news conference.
   Lieb said this is a new case involving the manipulation of four
stocks: TS Industries from the Salt Lake City area; Bigo Tires;
Flores de New Mexico in New Mexico and Cliff Engle Ltd. of New
Jersey.
   The information alleges that the scheme lasted from June 1985
until November 1987.
   ``The information further charges that Aslanian and his
co-conspirators employed a variety of fraudulent and manipulative
devices to raise, maintain and control the price of the manipulated
securities,'' Giuliani said.
   The methods included concealing ``certain co-conspirators
controlled the public markets'' for the maniulated stocks;
publishing false information about the companies; and selling stock
without authorization to retail customers who did have the money to
pay for the stock, Giuliani said.
   The co-conspirators also would ``discourage and at times refuse

   Two Sikhs were hanged Friday for the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, whose death triggered
a wave of separatist violence that continues to plague the nation.
   Kehar Singh and Satwant Singh were pronounced dead at 8:15 a.m.
(9:45 p.m. EST), less than half an hour after they were taken from
their tiny cells on death row and marched to the chilly, rain-soaked
gallows at New Delhi's Tihar Central Jail, said a police official
who received confirmation from the prison.
   Two panels of five Supreme Court justices on Thursday each turned
down last-minute appeals by Satwant Singh, the only assassin who
survived, and Kehar Singh, convicted of helping plot the murder.
   The executions capped four years of legal maneuvering that began
after Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down on Oct. 31, 1984, apparently in
revenge for an army raid she ordered on the Golden Temple, the
holiest Sikh shrine.
   Hours before the executions, human rights activists and
opposition politicians appealed to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to
spare the lives of the men convicted in her mother's death. There
was no response.
   Satwant Singh, a 30-year-old former bodyguard of Mrs. Gandhi, and
Kehar Singh, a 54-year-old former government clerk, are not related.
Like all Sikhs, they take the Singh name, which means lion.
   Shortly before 8 a.m., the two men were taken from their 8-foot
by 8-foot prison cells. With their hands tied behind their backs and
their legs bound with iron chains, they were escorted by guards to
the scaffold in the open courtyard, 25 steps away.
   Caps were put on their heads and inch-thick ropes placed around
their necks. With the signal from prison Superintendent Jaidev
Ssarangi, the two hangmen pulled the bolts that released the
trapdoors.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh spent their final hours visiting
with relatives and lawyers.
   ``He's happy and laughing,'' said Jasbi Kaur, Kehar Singh's wife,
after a 50-minute meeting with her husband. ``He told me to take
care of the family.''
   Satwant Singh's lawyer, R.S. Sodhi, described his client as
``very, very composed'' and then read a handwritten statement from
his client.
   ``There is no greater privilege for a Sikh to lay down his life
for the protection'' of the Sikh faith, the statement said. ``I wish
I could be born again and again and each time lay down my life for
this.''
   Fearing the executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal
violence, heavily-armed security forces were placed on maximum alert
in the capital and the northern states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh
and Punjab, where Sikh militants have been waging a bloody,
6-year-old campaign for independence.
   Police were posted at bus and rail stations, often targets of
Sikh extremists. Many schools were ordered closed as a precaution.
   Preparations for the executions were completed last October after
the black-rimmed death warrants were signed.
   Defense lawyers had filed several appeals this week in a third
attempt to block the executions. All were rejected.
   Satwant Singh's appeal sought prosecution of two of Mrs. Gandhi's
security guards. He claimed the guards shot him after he was
disarmed and said their actions amounted to attempted murder.
   He did not appeal for clemency, but under Indian law his death
sentence was delayed automatically as Kehar Singh appealed.
   A third Sikh, Balbir Singh, also had been arrested, tried and
convicted on conspiracy charges and sentenced to death in the
assassination, but the Supreme Court overturned the conviction in
August for lack of evidence.
   More than 1,200 people were killed, most of them Sikhs, in the
raid to rout Sikh militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar four
months before Mrs. Gandhi was killed.
   As Mrs. Gandhi lay dying, a guard named Beant Singh threw down
his gun and shouted: ``I have done what I had to do! Now, you do
what you must do!''
   Other guards opened fire, killing Beant Singh and wounding
Satwant Singh. Beant Singh is revered as a matryr by many Sikh
militants.
   Kehar Singh, a government clerk who was Beant's uncle, was
arrested a month later and charged with helping plot the
assassination, which caused anti-Sikh riots in northern India by
members of the Hindu majority. More than 2,700 people were killed,
nearly all of them Sikhs.
   Sikh violence has increased since, and at least 2,440 people were
killed last year in Punjab, the only Indian state in which Sikhs are
the majority. That was more than double the 1,032 victims in 1987.
   Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in
Punjab. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more than
80 percent of India's 880 million people.

   Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense
secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon
polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair
condition,'' hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
``The senator is expected to make a full recovery.''
   Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted
to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a
colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood
said.
   A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood
said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's
surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
   Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said.
   When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp
also was discovered and removed. Tests of that growth showed it to
contain some ``malignant but well differentiated cells,'' Habgood
said.
   Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come
from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday
night, the spokesman said.
   After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a
defense consultant. He also served as an arms negotiator for
President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra
investigative panel.
   President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on
Dec. 16. The nomination is subject to Senate approval.

   A legion of Hollywood glitterati
feted President Reagan at a $1 million homecoming gala, singing
``Camp David is rare, but it ain't Bel-Air'' and tantalizing the
former actor with a TV offer.
   Reagan, for his part, said he was eager to return to the state
where he began his duel careers in film and politics.
   ``Everytime I come home, I say to myself, `Why did I ever
leave?'' Reagan remarked at Wednesday night's dinner. ``I don't want
to say I'm anxious, but in 15 days, 15 hours and 15 seconds, I will
be on my way.''
   Merv Griffin, who escorted Eva Gabor to the gala to raise money
for Nancy Reagan's anti-drug program, replied ``Isn't it
wonderful?'' when asked about the Reagans' imminent return to
California.

   President-elect Bush is nearing a decision on
his two remaining Cabinet-level selections but apparently has ruled
out James Schlesinger for energy secretary, sources said.
   Meanwhile, sources close to Bush who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that two top contenders for the other unfilled spot,
the newly created job of drug czar, are former education secretary
William J. Bennett and Texas industrialist Ross Perot.
   Schlesinger, energy secretary under President Carter and defense
secretary under President Ford, had earlier been mentioned as a
leading candidate for the energy post.
   The vice president and Schlesinger met last week to discuss
energy issues but ``the job was not offered,'' said a senior Bush
transition official who insisted upon not being identified.

   President-elect Bush was urged today to support
development of new types of nuclear power plants as a way of slowing
global warming caused by the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Research on new types of nuclear reactors is one way to develop
energy sources that produce no carbon dioxide, a principal cause of
the atmospheric warming, said a panel convened by the National
Academy of Sciences and two sister organizations.
   The academy, the National Academy of Engineering and the National
Institute of Medicine made a series of recommendations to the
president-elect on the environment, AIDS, space and science policy.
   In a cover letter to Bush, the presidents of the three bodies
said, ``global environmental change must be made more prominent in
the scientific, political and foreign policy agendas of the United
States.''

   Some of the nation's leading scientists,
engineers and physicians today urged President-elect Bush to move
forcefully to combat AIDS, set new goals for the space program and
appoint a prominent science adviser.
   The recommendations came in the form of a series of white papers
commissioned by the presidents of the National Academy of Science,
the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
   In space research, the panel told Bush the United States cannot
take a leading position without his help.
   ``To give visibility to the importance of his space program, the
president must establish his goals early in his administration. He
should then support them strongly with the public and the Congress
to help ensure their achievement,'' the experts said.

   A new study suggests that women under 45 who
use birth control pills face a greater risk of breast cancer _ a
finding that contradicts earlier research.
   The study results were being presented today at a hearing of the
Food and Drug Administration.
   Researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine found
that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the risk of breast
cancer compared to women who have never used the pill.
   For women who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study
found, the risk of breast cancer was four times greater.

   The head of the Food and Drug Administration
says the number of applications for new drug approvals is doubling
every year, a pace that threatens to choke the agency's ability to
pass judgment on them.
   ``We cannot do this with smoke and mirrors,'' FDA Commissioner
Frank E. Young on Wednesday told a panel of researchers looking for
ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer and AIDS.
   Young said the FDA is receiving an average of 10 applications
each month requesting permission to begin clinical trials for a new
drug, the first step in getting the drug approved for prescription
use by the public. The monthly total has doubled every year since
1984, he said.
   Unless the agency gets more staff, ``the whole ship is going to
sink,'' Young said after his presentation.

   Brain cells produce a modified version of an
important muscle protein, says a study that may help explain why
muscular dystrophy causes mental impairment in some people.
   Scientists have been puzzled about why Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, the most common and severe form of the disease, leads to
mental trouble in some but not all of its victims.
   Duchenne is caused by defects in the gene that tells muscle cells
how to make a protein called dystrophin. The defects can prevent
dystrophin production, leading to progressive weakness and wasting
of voluntary muscles.
   One-third to one-half of Duchenne patients also suffer mild to
moderate mental impairment, according to the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

   Radon detectors are becoming popular items in
hardware stores, but a consumer group says they're only as good as
the laboratory that analyzes them _ and too often that's not any
good at all.
   The group, Public Citizen, maintained Wednesday that nearly half
of the 34 radon testing laboratories it evaluated had quality
control problems. The group sent test samples to seven of the
largest labs and found dramatically false results in come cases.
   ``While millions of Americans are testing their homes for radon
gas, some may be using do-it-yourself kits that provide dangerously
misleading results,'' Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen,
told a news conference.
   Ms. Claybrook said Public Citizen purchased test kits and sent
them in for analysis at the seven laboratories after filling them
with radon-contaminated air obtained at two Energy Department
laboratories. The results at three of the labs were wide of the mark
by 67 percent in one case.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though this town is full of empty promises,
the failure of the independent film distributors is particularly
painful.
   The independents, recently heralded as the creative salvation
from Hollywood's major studios, have been unspooling reels of
here-today-gone-tomorrow clunkers: ``Messenger of Death,''
``Freeway,'' ``Illegally Yours,'' ``Straight to Hell,'' and
``Kansas'' among the most anemic failures.
   Just as audiences are avoiding these titles, those responsible
are trying to dodge financial ruin. The De Laurentis Entertainment
Group is in bankruptcy proceedings, as is FilmDallas Inc. The Cannon
Group lost close to $100 million last year. Debt-heavy New World
Entertainment dropped more than $28 million in the second quarter of
1988.
   While a few independents such as Orion Classics prosper with a
slate of fanciful films such as the new ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown,'' many companies _ including once-celebrated
Island Pictures _ are laying off employees, cutting production or
ignoring bills in desperate attempts to balance books in a tougher
movie market.
   ``A lot of people have been burned,'' said Robert Shaye,
president and chief executive officer of independent New Line Cinema
Corp., which has the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise to keep
its head above water.
   Shipping to theaters typically low-budget movies they made or
purchased, the independents once had a future as bright as a klieg
light. Though lacking the huge production and marketing divisions of
the studios, these smaller outfits shamed Hollywood's power players
with inventive and well-received projects.
   They succeeded by giving film makers what they most covet _
freedom. ``I think (the independents) offer more tender loving care.
That's basically what it takes to release a movie well,'' director
Tony Bill said recently.
   And such concessions occassionally paid off. Cinecom's romantic
``A Room With a View'' was a $16 million critical hit in 1986.
Island's ``She's Gotta Have It,'' directed by Spike Lee, was a
success that same year, and U.S. fans flocked to Skouras Pictures'
1987 release of the Swedish film ``My Life As a Dog.''
   Little did the independents know that real dog years were at hand.
   The home video market, once able to make even the worst Linda
Blair prison film profitable, changed into a business where only
``quality'' movies would be rented.
   Overextended by a release schedule of 385 films, up 100 percent
from 1985, the independents were suddenly stuck with crates of
dead-on-arrival features.
   ``There was a period of time when everybody thought that you
couldn't make an unprofitable movie,'' said Shaye. ``Even if you
screwed up, you could still make a profit in video.'' No longer. And
things got worse.
   As advertising costs soared, the major film companies _ Disney,
Universal, United Artists, Warner Bros. and their pals _ introduced
both schlocky thrillers, such as ``They Live'' and ``Child's Play,''
and the stylish personal films like ``Crossing Delancey'' and ``The
Good Mother'' once reserved for independents. Unlike typical studio
movies, aiming for the broadest possible audience, these films
adapted the independents' fondness for the high-brow.
   ``All of a sudden, the majors are catering to the adult
audience,'' said Ira Deutchman, president of marketing and
distribution for Cinecom. With nowhere else to turn, some
independents chose to match the studios with
lowest-common-denominator washouts.
   The results, in many cases, have been disastrous. ``All those
companies attempted to compete with the studios and they had their
hats handed to them on a platter,'' said Thomas Coleman, the former
chairman of Atlantic Entertainment Group.
   Coleman should know. Soon after he made those remarks, the
financially strapped Atlantic was bought by KVC Video for an
undisclosed sum, and Coleman would no longer head the company.
   Skouras, for one, failed in its recent releases, ``In a Shallow
Grave'' and ``Waiting for the Moon.''
   ``Those films were so ambitious in their scopes and budgets that
I think they probably should have been catered towards a major
studio,'' said Jeff Lipsky, president of Skouras' motion picture
division, which won't release another film until next March.
   ``The most profitable independent films have been of the
no-budget variety. Everybody's risks are low, and the media loves to
discover new talent. They love to be shocked,'' Lipsky said.
   But the only surprise recently was how undistinguished the
independent films came to be. Cineplex Odeon's high hopes for ``The
Glass Menagerie'' were shattered by poor ticket sales. Cinecom's
farm movie ``Miles From Home'' suffered from box-office drought.
Vestron's ``Waxwork'' melted.
   The major studios have bombs, too. But for the independents,
teetering on a much narrower tightrope, consecutive flops can spell
sudden trouble. Stung by the crash of ``Patty Hearst,'' Atlantic can
scarcely afford another flop with ``1969.''
   ``A lot of the smaller companies are really scrambling,'' said
William Quigley, president of Vestron Pictures, buoyed by its
``Dirty Dancing'' riches amid several less successful releases.
   Alive Films _ makers of the rakish hit ``The Moderns'' _ is
turning to horror movies for resuscitation. Vestron, Atlantic and
the Samuel Goldwyn Company are now pursuing midpriced dramas and
comedies with known actors aimed at a broad audience. ``You have to
find pockets of opportunity,'' said Atlantic's Coleman.
   ``It doesn't make sense anymore to go out and buy a marginal art
film from a country in Scandinavia,'' said Steve Rothenberg,
Goldwyn's vice president of theatrical distribution.
   ``Where we're heading is making commercial films like `Mystic
Pizza' that cost between $3 (million) and $7 million,'' he said. So
far, it's working: ``Mystic Pizza,'' a romantic comedy, is doing
brisk business.
   Said Vestron's Quigley: ``For $7 million, we can do pictures that
look like studio pictures, and, at least in the case of `Dirty
Dancing,' succeed about as well as any studio picture out there.''
Vestron's ambitious lineup includes more than 20 films in coming
months.
   Skouras and Orion Classics, the latter riding on a wave of
accomplished art-film hits, is following a different _ and perhaps
less risky _ course. ``You have to look for ... subject matter that
the majors wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole,'' said Skouras'
Lipsky.
   Orion Classics, with a knack for spotting small gems from a
distance, has made a killing with ``Wings of Desire,'' purchased for
around $200,000 and already yielding $3 million in ticket sales. The
company will open the acclaimed Spanish movie ``Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown'' later this month.
   But if independents continue to produce marginal films of any
budget or from any country, the shakeup is likely to continue.
Nobody, it seems, is dying to spend six bucks on movies with names
like Vestron's ``CHUD II.''

<HEAD>A&amp;E Series on U.S.-Soviet Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arts &amp; Entertainment Network begins tonight
an ambitious 26-part series on U.S.-Soviet relations, ``The Eagle
and the Bear,'' produced with help from ABC News.
   Free-lance producers working for A&amp;E actually put together the
series, but it is a cooperative venture between A&amp;E and Cap
Cities-ABC Video Enterprises Inc., and the executive producer is ABC
News' Av Westin. The footage comes from the ABC News and Pathe film
archives.
   The series of half-hour episodes, airing weekly on Fridays,
covers 40 years of U.S.-Soviet history, from World War II to
glasnost. It is part of a burgeoning repertoire of documentaries and
series _ ``The Twentieth Century,'' ``The Vietnam War with Walter
Cronkite,'' ``World War I,'' ``Biography,'' and ``Profiles,'' for
example _ that are making A&amp;E a favorite of history buffs.
   Sophisticated students of U.S.-Soviet relations might not find
much new information in ``The Eagle and the Bear'' if the first
episodes are any indication, but the footage is fascinating and the
series well-written. It is interspersed with interviews with
statesmen and historians.
   Tonight's opening episode, ``Dateline 1943, Europe,'' explains
the basis for the mistrust inherent in the Soviet Union's
international relations _ the country's massive losses in World War
II. In the battle for Stalingrad alone, says the narration, more
Russians were killed than all the Americans lost during the entire
war.
   In the midst of the war began the ``personal diplomacy'' between
Franklin Roosevelt and Josef Stalin, whose apparently amiable
relationship seems not unlike that between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. FDR found in the Soviet dictator a
``stalwart good humor,'' and yet a slide in U.S.-Soviet relations
followed.
   ``I believe that we are going to get along with him (Stalin) and
the Russian people very, very well,'' Roosevelt predicted in an
overly optimistic speech to Congress.
   There is also a lively description of the later meeting between
Stalin and Harry S. Truman at Potsdam. With the Nazis defeated,
Truman was ready to get tough on the communists, and told Stalin
that the United States had test detonated an atom bomb. Historians
recall accounts that Stalin simply didn't react to the information.
He either didn't understand what Truman was talking about, or he
already knew about the atom bomb test.
   Despite Truman's get-tough attitude, he left Potsdam without
changing the Eastern European boundaries that existed when Roosevelt
attended the summit at Yalta.
   By the end of the episode, the United States has dropped atomic
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the United States and Russia
participate as allies for the last time at the signing of Japan's
surrender.
   The Cold War begins, setting the stage for episode two,
``Dateline 1945, Korea,'' airing Jan. 13.
   Later episodes do not necessarily follow linear history. Episode
three is set in 1961 and is about the building of the Berlin Wall,
and the following episode jumps ahead to 1983 and the invasion of
Grenada.
   Later installments have more on Korea and Berlin, plus the Cuban
missile crisis, the arms race, the rise of Solidarity in Poland and
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   A&amp;E has 15 episodes ready for air. The last 11 are in production.
A&amp;E and Cap Cities-ABC Video Enterprises Inc. are collaborating on
another series, ``Heroes.''

television households now have a video cassette recorder. The top
three markets in terms of percentage of homes with VCRs are:
Anchorage, Alaska, 84.3 percent; Fairbanks, Alaska, 78.9 percent;
Las Vegas, Nev., 74.3 percent. ...
   DECLINE _ AND RISE _ OF NEWS RATINGS _ In an age of general
decline in network ratings, ``ABC World News Tonight'' showed a
slight increase _ 1 percent _ in 1988, according to figures from
A.C. Nielsen Co. released by ABC. The ``CBS Evening News'' dropped 6
percent. ``NBC Nightly News'' declined 13 percent. ...
   DECLINE OF THE MINISERIES _ The last time a network miniseries
made the top 10 in Nielsen's all-time-high ranking was 1984, CBS'
``Master of the Game,'' which is 10th on the list as of the
beginning of this television season. A miniseries has to get a 25.0
rating to make the top 20. ABC's ``War and Remembrance'' this season
had an 18.6. The all-time, top-rated miniseries was ``Roots,'' which
had a 44.9 in 1977. A rating is a percentage of U.S. homes with
television.

<HEAD>Annual Farm Survey Poised to Seek Economic Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the Agriculture Department's most
important economic surveys will get under way next month as
interviewers begin asking 26,000 farmers and ranchers what kind of
year they had in 1988.
   Economist Jim Johnson says the fifth annual Farm Costs and
Returns Survey scheduled for Feb. 13 to March 31 ``will provide the
first hard answers'' to a number of questions relating to the 1988
drought.
   The information also will provide an important backdrop as
Congress begins work on farm policy and legislation to replace the
1985 farm law, which will expire in 1990.
   Lawmakers will seek a multitude of answers to economic questions
as they begin hearing proposals for replacing or modifying the 1985
law. They will want to know how the current act performed during its
five-year lifespan.
   The annual USDA survey scheduled in February and March is a
statistical measurement of the farm economy's health and is provided
by farmers themselves.
   One of the most important goals will be to determine how the
drought in 1988 affected the farm financial recovery that was
evident in 1987. Income and debt levels in different sectors of
agriculture and in various parts of the country will be examined.
   What was the impact of the government's drought assistance
program? Did farmers alter production practices because of drought?
   ``Without this annual survey, we'd be out of touch and out of
date,'' Johnson said. ``We'd have to rely on old information and
educated guesses. We'd be treating agriculture, in all its
diversity, as if it were one big farm because we wouldn't have the
data to look beneath the aggregate numbers.''
   The voluntary, confidential survey is managed by the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service, or NASS, and its state
offices. Another agency, the Economic Research Service, analyzes the
information and presents its findings in reports.
   Farmers and ranchers were selected for the survey to represent a
broad cross-section of U.S. agriculture and will be contacted by
local interviewers, or enumerators.
   Doug Kleweno of NASS said that each interview may require around
an hour and a half, on the average, although it depends greatly on
the size of the farming operation and whether it is a single
enterprise or involves several types of operations, such as cash
grain, livestock and dairying.
   The first results of this year's survey will be issued July 5 and
will analyze 1988 farm production expenses, Kleweno said. More
reports, including those showing drought impact and other
information will be issued later.
   Last year's survey _ conducted just before the 1988 drought hit _
included substantial evidence that American farmers were well on the
road to recovery after the heavy burdens of debt, declining land
values and high interest rates of the early 1980s.
   ``Overall, 1987 was probably the best year for the farm sector in
this decade,'' says economist Mitch Morehart in the January issue of
Farmline magazine. ``That wasn't true for all farm types and all
regions of the country, and some farmers were still struggling to
stay afloat as 1988 began.''
   Morehart added: ``Also, we can assume that at least part of the
general recovery in 1987 reflects the fact that some o the most
severely stressed farmers had already left agriculture.''
   According to the report, 1987 brought ``a modest upturn in farm
receipts, a 42 percent increase in federal farm program payments,
generally stable production expenses and record-high farm income.''
   Further, it said, after declining for six straight years, the
U.S. farm sector's equity, or net worth, rose 6 percent to an
estimated $566 billion, spurred by higher land values and continued
reductions in debt.
   ``Of the 2.2 million U.S. farms, an estimated 101,000 were rated
as `vulnerable' to failure,'' the report said. ``They ended 1987
with a troubling combination of high debts and negative net farm
incomes. Their numbers, however, were down from more than 200,000 in
1986.''
   The survey showed that 1987's improvement was greatest in terms
of debt reduction. On the average, farm debt averaged 15 percent of
farm assets in 1987, down from 22 percent in 1986.
   About 44 percent of the farms ended 1987 without any outstanding
debt, compared with 40 percent in the two previous years. Generally,
the no-debt farms were smaller operations, but debt reductions also
occurred at all levels, the report said.
   But the distinction of having no debts ``is probably not the most
important one because debt financing is a common practice in
commercial farming,'' the report said.
   Instead, economists try to distinguish between low-debt farms, in
which debts comprise 40 percent or less of a farm's assets, and
high-debt operations having debts equal to more than 40 percent of
assets.
   Last year's survey showed that in 1987 low-debt farms, including
those without any debts, accounted for 85 percent of all farms, up
from 79 percent in 1986. The remaining 15 percent were in the
high-debt category, and some were technically involvent with debts
equalling or exceeding assets.
   Similar measures will be used in this year's survey to see how
farms performed in 1988.
   ``This survey goes directly to the source, farmers themselves, to
develop an accurate picture of the diverse financial conditions in
agriculture,'' said NASS administrator Charles Caudill. ``It helps
ensure that the decisions affecting farmers are based on reliable
data rather than someone's best guesses.''

major carriers, saying it will acquire 50 Airbus Industrie A320
planes and has options to get another 50 in a deal valued at up to
$3.5 billion.
   The deal announced Wednesday could nearly triple the fleet size
of Braniff, a carrier with 53 jets that has endured three changes of
ownership and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The move also represents one of the largest single orders for

   Speaking Wednesday at the annual auto show here, Smith declined
to provide a specific figure. GM's previous record year was 1984,
when the automaker posted earnings of $4.52 billion on sales of
$83.89 billion. For 1987, GM had a profit of $3.55 billion on
revenue of $101.78 billion.
   Smith also predicted the Big Three _ GM, Ford Motor Co. and

provide filers better advice.
   Lawrence B. Gibbs, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,
said Wednesday that the taxpayer-rights bill is ``a good bill.''
   The legislation requires the agency to fully inform taxpayers of
their rights any time an audit is begun. Another provision extends
the notice required before the IRS can seize property.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Up Modestly; Stocks, Dollar Jump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's report of a modest increase in factory orders in
November has led analysts to conclude that the economy is continuing
to grow moderately.
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods increased by 0.3
percent during the month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   The economic report had relatively little impact on the financial
markets, which were looking ahead to what the Labor Department would
report on Friday about the nation's December unemployment rate.
   Stock prices staged a sharp rally Wednesday, rebounding from the
losses they suffered in the first session of 1989. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials, which fell 23.93 on Tuesday, climbed
33.04 points to 2,177.68.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. But
demand for stocks was limited by fears that Friday's unemployment
report would show a big job gain, leading the Federal Reserve to
tighten credit to stave off inflation.
   The bond market responded indecisively Wednesday, helped by gains
in the dollar but showing concern about the possibility of a big
gain in December employment. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
fell 1-16 point as its yield edged up to 9.08 percent.
   Analysts said the dollar rose in response to news that U.S.
planes shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean Sea.
Investors take refuge in dollars in troubled times.
   The downing of the Libyan jets also sent oil prices higher, but
the gains quickly evaporated and the market ended the day on the
down side.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate oil, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell
28 cents to close at $17.08 a barrel.
   Before November's 0.3 percent gain in factory orders, orders had
risen 2 percent in October and fallen 1.9 percent a month earlier.
For the first 11 months of the year, orders were up 9.3 percent over
the comparable period in 1987.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., said the factory orders added to evidence that the
economy is continuing to grow, although slower growth is expected
during 1989.
   In other economic news, Congress' budget agency said Wednesday
that unless new taxes or spending cuts are approved, the federal
deficit next year will be $141 billion, $14 billion higher than the
White House estimates and well in excess of deficit-reduction goals.

<HEAD>Travelers Claims It Faces `Perpetual Bondage'</HEAD>

   An initiative prohibiting California
insurers from canceling policies places the industry in ``perpetual
bondage,'' claimed a lawyer for four Travelers insurance companies
covering 22,000 motorists.
   The statement came during a hearing called by the state
Department of Insurance in the aftermath of November's passage of
the measure, which would roll-back premiums and place several other
limits on the insurance industry.
   Kent Keller, a lawyer for Travelers, also argued at Wednesday's
session that applying the restrictions to a company's
pre-Proposition 103 policies was unintended by the initiative and
would be unfair. Travelers, which plans to withdraw from the
automobile insurance business in the state, has written such
policies in California since 1897.
   ``It's such a basic American principle of justice that you don't
change the rules while the game's going on without allowing somebody
to get out,'' Keller said. He said the company had no notice of
Proposition 103 restrictions when it wrote the policies.
   But Patricia Staggs, a lawyer for the state, replied that the
voters intended the measure to have ``immediate effect'' on notices
of cancellation.
   Staggs acknowledged that Travelers has the right to withdraw from
the state, but declared that until withdrawal is approved the
companies must renew their automobile insurance policies under terms
of the voter-approved initiative.
   Keller's arguments also were derided by state Sen. Alan Robbins,
chairman of the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee.
   ``This poor, beleaguered little innocent insurance company being
picked upon brought tears to my eyes,'' said Robbins, D-Van Nuys,
who was allowed to take part in the hearing. Despite the claims of a
lack of notice, he added, Travelers was well aware of Proposition
103 for the last year, and contributed $1 million to the campaign to
defeat the measure and pass a no-fault insurance initiative that was
defeated Nov. 8.
   ``They don't really want to leave California,'' Robbins said.
``They want the Department of Insurance to allow them to dump their
automobile insurance policies and allow them to receive $800 million
from other lines of insurance.''
   The one-hour hearing was the first called by the department on an
alleged violation by an insurance company of Proposition 103, the
consumer-sponsored measure that was passed Nov. 8.
   Hearing officer John Faber deferred a ruling, apparently until
the end of the month. The decision, which involves the scope of a
key provision of Proposition 103 on renewal of auto insurance, could
be appealed in court.
   The measure, whose backers included consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, is being challenged by insurance companies in separate
proceedings in the state Supreme Court. The court has allowed most
provisions to take effect but has blocked the 20 percent rollback in
auto and property insurance rates while the case is pending.
   The four Travelers subsidiaries, which write $41 million a year
in auto insurance policies according to company figures, applied to
withdraw from California the day before the election and stopped
renewing policies Dec. 23. Company spokesman Dan Kaferle said about
700 renewals have been refused since then.
   The department responded by invoking a provision of Proposition
103 that forbids non-renewal of an auto insurance policy except in
cases of fraud, non-payment or a substantial increase in the insured
risk. The companies are violating those provisions each time they
refuse to renew a policy for any other reasons, the department said.
   But Keller said the department was wrong for two reasons: the
restrictions can't be applied to companies that are withdrawing from
the state, and shouldn't be applied to insurance policies that were
written before Proposition 103 was passed.
   ``The decision to leave one of the largest markets in the nation
was not an easy one. They have a basic American right to choose,''
he said.
   To apply the non-renewal limitations to companies that are
withdrawing from the market is to place them in ``perpetual
bondage,'' Keller added.
   The four Travelers subsidiaries are Travelers Indemnity Co.,
Charter Oak Fire Insurance Co., Travelers Indemnity Co. of America
and Phoenix Insurance Co. Their applications to withdraw from
business in California apply only to their automobile insurance
policies.
   A spokesman for the companies would not say how many other
Travelers subsidiaries offer automobile insurance.

<HEAD>Digital Hopes To Make Waves In Workstation Market</HEAD>

   Digital Equipment Corp. missed out on the
personal computer boom, but it hopes a big product announcement next
week will keep it abreast of the next wave in computing, desktop
workstations.
   Officials of the world's second biggest computer maker said
Wednesday they would introduce advanced workstations along with new
software and industry-standard personal computers in a major news
conference on Tuesday.
   ``It's probably the most significant desktop announcement we've
ever made,'' Donald McInnis, vice president of Digital's engineering
systems group, said in a telephone interview.
   Digital, the minicomputer giant based in Maynard, Mass., lost out
on billions of dollars in potential revenue from personal computers
because its founder and president, Kenneth Olsen, underestimated the
importance of the machines.
   The company kept building bigger and more powerful clusters of
minicomputers to compete with International Business Machines Corp.,
its bigger rival.
   Two previous attempts to catch up in the PC business failed: the
Rainbow, which did not run industry-standard software, and the
Vaxmate, which was too expensive. In its third attempt, Digital is
showing some humility by selling personal computers made for it by
Tandy Corp. according to Digital specifications.
   ``It's stating for the world that, `Yes, we're going to be in the
low end of the market,''' said Sonny Monosson, editor of the
Monosson Report on DEC and IBM.
   In the smaller but faster-growing workstation business, where
Digital already has the second biggest share of the world market
despite selling relatively slow machines, the company plans two
lines of fast and relatively cheap entries that should expand its
market share.
   Workstations are speedy desktop computers capable of displaying
intricate graphics and are used primarily by scientists, engineers
and other technical professionals.
   As a sign of the importance Digital attaches to workstations, the
company will break from tradition by selling one line incapable of
running programs written for its own Vax VMS operating system. The
new line will run only programs written for Ultrix, Digital's
version of the Unix operating system.
   For the new workstation, Digital had to choose between speed and
compatibility, and it chose speed by using a microprocessor supplied
by Mips Computer Systems Inc. that cannot handle VMS instructions.
   In the software area, Digital scored a major but little-noticed
victory last week when the Open Software Foundation, a standards
group, selected its technology as the standard for the means by
which programs appear in ``windows'' on a computer screen.
   Technology from Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. was
selected as the standard for the look and feel, or surface
trimmings, of the screen presentation. The decision on standards
should help simplify life for computer users and programmers.
   ``Until now we've had chaos and anarchy in terms of standards at
the desktop,'' McInnis said.
   The emphasis on desktop computers is a return to Digital's roots.
The company was founded in 1957 to build small computers better
suited to individual users than the powerful but complicated
mainframe computers dominant at the time.
   Analysts differed on how Digital's new workstations would fare
against the competition of Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer
Inc. and others.
   ``They overtook and passed Apollo in '88. With this new line of
products I think they're going to overtake Sun,'' said Jonathan
Cohler, editor-in-chief of Digital Review, an independent weekly
newspaper based in Boston.
   But Russell Crabs, an analyst for SoundView Financial Group in
Stamford, Conn., said the high-powered workstation will not take off
right away because there is not enough software written for
Digital's Ultrix.
   ``I think it's a defensive move, primarily against Sun,'' he said.
   Digital will trumpet the new products in a press conference in
Littleton, Mass., and other presentations that day and the next in
Santa Clara, Calif.; London; Paris; Copenhagen, Denmark; Sydney,
Australia; and Tokyo.

   Oil futures rose briefly on word that U.S. Navy
fighter jets had downed two Libyan planes, but prices closed lower
after traders' initial concerns subsided.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate oil, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell
28 cents Wednesday to close at $17.08 a barrel.
   Richard Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said the Mediterranean Sea incident led investors to snap up energy
futures in overseas trading and at the start of the day in New York.
Hostilities in the Middle East usually spark buying of energy
contracts because of the possibility of a disruption in oil supplies.
   In Wednesday's incident, U.S. officials said the Navy fighters
shot down two Libyan MiG-23 jets after the Americans were approached
at high speed in what Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci called ``a
hostile manner'' in international airspace.
   After the initial concern over the incident began to fade, prices
retreated, Redoglia said.
   ``While the market was strong through most of the day, by day's
end, the buyers were out and we found the market coming off,'' he
said, adding, ``The market seemed to be a little overbought.''
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange, the
February contract for home heating oil fell 0.58 cent to settle at
52.65 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline prices were little changed, with the
February contract gaining 0.05 cent to finish at 47.32 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Perez: Closer Cooperation With Mexico On Falling Oil Prices, Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALMA VARGAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelan President-elect Carlos Andres Perez
says he and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico have
agreed to combat falling oil prices and the massive foreign debts
facing their nation's economies.
   ``Our countries have suffered the buffeting of the fall in (oil)
prices,'' Perez told a news conference Wednesday after he met with
Salinas during a one-day visit to Mexico.
   But he said that he shared with the new Mexican president
``optimism about the possibilities of a stabilization of the
petroleum market soon.''
   Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2, said tentative steps
toward strengthening the oil market could be made during a meeting
of representatives from non-OPEC governments scheduled for late
January in London.
   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the 13-nation price-fixing cartel that in the
past was unable to limit its members' oil exports to bolster prices.
   Perez said he was optimistic OPEC would be able to keep prices
from falling further.
   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil producer, is not a member
of OPEC but closely follows the cartel's pricing and production
guidelines. About half the oil that Pemex, the Mexican state
petroleum monopoly, sells abroad goes to the United States.
   He also said he and Salinas discussed the foreign debt, which he
said acted like ``a vise on the economy'' of Venezuela. He said the
two leaders agreed to continue discussions on the debt with other
Latin American heads of state, and announced he planned to visit
President Jose Sarney of Brazil later this week.
   ``We seek agreement among Latin American countries to find
reasonable solutions with our creditors,'' Perez declared earlier
Wednesday.
   He said he believed the United States, under President-elect
George Bush, could help Latin America overcome its foreign debt
burden.
   ``We will have the opportunity for great (American) cooperation
with our countries in Latin America, great opportunities for
development,'' said Perez, who met recently with Bush.
   Venezuela on Saturday suspended principal payments on most of its
$26 billion in foreign bank debt, claiming it was short of money
because of low prices for its crude oil exports. Mexico is trying to
renegotiate payments on its $106 billion debt, the second largest
after Brazil's among developing countries.
   Both nations say debt payments don't leave enough money for
investment and economic growth.
   He said Venezuela's decision to suspend debt payments was taken
after exhausting all efforts to comply with its commitments. The
measure also was taken ``to ask for a fairer treatment'' from
creditors, he said.
   Perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem, the
severe economic difficulties of Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico could
extend to other countries.
   Perez said he will seek ``rational negotiations'' after he takes
office ``in search of understanding and not confrontation.'' He said
Venezuela's export income amounted to $7 billion in 1988, while debt
servicing totalled $5.6 billion.

<HEAD>Profit-Sharing Dispute Settled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers announced a settlement in a
dispute with LTV Steel Corp. over profit sharing and said that in
upcoming talks with other producers, profit sharing may be
appropriate but a basic wage increase is better.
   ``We certainly are opposed to the idea that while the CEOs and
executives and everybody else (are) making out pretty well, that the
workers should somehow be prevented from having an improvement in
their basic standard,'' USW President Lynn Williams said Wednesday.
   ``Our members were willing to make sacrifices in times of
trouble,'' he said. ``Our workers have a right to have an input into
their companies and share in things on the upside.''
   At a news conference outlining the union's philosophical stance
for talks later this year with Bethlehem Steel Corp., Inland Steel
Industries Inc., Armco Inc. and National Steel Corp., USW leaders
announced the settlement with LTV that will distribute an estimated
$100 million to about 18,000 active union members.
   They will be paid in April an average of $1.80 for each hour they
worked in 1988. In addition, LTV will distribute stock worth an
estimated 70 cents for each hour worked.
   A year of full-time work amounts to 2,080 hours per worker, so
the payments would amount to about $5,200 in cash and stock for a
fulltime worker.
   The company will also reimburse 38,000 retired union members for
payments they made last year toward health insurance coverage.
   Union officials said the profit sharing would be worth about $100
million, although the figure is tentative.
   ``It's really a vindication of our position,'' Bernard Kleiman,
chief counsel for the union, said at a news conference.
   ``Neither party achieved all of what it sought,'' David H. Hoag,
LTV Steel president and chief executive, said in a printed statement.
   LTV claimed its $1.3 billion third-quarter net loss would result
in a distribution of stock but no cash to the USW members. The union
argued the company's financial condition warranted a cash payout,
despite writedowns that contributed to the third-quarter loss.
   Local union presidents voted overwhelmingly Tuesday in Pittsburgh
to accept the settlement, but no announcement of the results was
made until Wednesday.
   The presidents were assembled to help set goals for upcoming
contract negotiations with four major producers. As union leaders
have declared previously, negotiators want the producers to give
back at least a portion of the wages and benefits USW members
sacrificed during two previous rounds of contract bargaining since
1983.
   With major steelmakers entering what is expected to be their
third consecutive year of significant profits, ``The opportunity ...
is so much better than what it otherwise might have been'' for union
members, said USW President Lynn Williams.
   The 134-member wage and policy committee did not prioritize its
goals for wage and benefit increases, job security and work rules,
he said.
   The timing of contract negotiations at LTV and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh will depend on the two companies' reorganization
in bankruptcy court. USX, the largest steelmaker, has a contract
that runs into 1991.

<HEAD>Chrysler Agrees To Pay $5.1 Million To 150 Ex-Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has agreed to pay $5.1 million to
about 150 former employees in a settlement of an age discrimination
lawsuit filed in 1981 by a federal agency.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed in its suit
against Chrysler Motors Corp., the automakers manufacturing arm,
that the salaried workers were forced to retire because of their
ages.
   The case had been scheduled for trial Tuesday. But Chrysler
agreed Dec. 30 to the settlement, under which it admitted no
liability or wrongdoing. The automaker reached a $2.9 million
settlement earlier last month with 82 other former salaried workers.
   ``An important factor is that at the time this was happening, the
company was fighting for survival,'' Chrysler spokeswoman Karen
Stewart said. ``It was a time when the white-collar staff was being
significantly reduced.''
   The EEOC was to determine how the money would be distributed.
   The case originally sought compensation for more than 1,600
employees allegedly forced to retire between 1978 and 1981, when
Chrysler was near bankruptcy, said Tom Keenbaum, a Detroit attorney
representing the ex-workers.

   The U.S. dollar gained ground against the Japanese
yen today, while share prices declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 125.33 yen, up 1.28 yen from Wednesday's
close of 124.05 yen. After opening at 125.00 yen, the currency
fluctuated in a range between 124.92-125.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which reached a
record high of 30,243.66 points the previous day, lost 59.87 points
or 0.20 percent to finish trading at 30,183.79.
   The dollar has risen overseas in the wake of reports Wednesday
that U.S. planes shot down two Libyan reconnaissance aircraft over
the Mediterranean Sea.
   The U.S. dollar is considered a safe investment in times of
international tension and subsequent dollar-buying leads to a rise
in its value against other currencies.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer, however, said the incident in the
Mediterranean was expected to yield only a ``temporary effect'' on
the exchange market.
   Michiyasu Yamashita of the Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo said market
players began buying the dollar following the news that Emperor
Hirohito's condition had declined.
   ``The dollar has been in an upward trend since this morning and
investors were buying it due to uncertainty over the emperor's
condition,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Radon detectors are becoming popular items in
hardware stores, but a consumer group says they're only as good as
the laboratory that analyzes them _ and too often that's not any
good at all.
   The group, Public Citizen, maintained Wednesday that nearly half
of the 34 radon testing laboratories it evaluated had quality
control problems. The group sent test samples to seven of the
largest labs and found dramatically false results in some cases.
   ``While millions of Americans are testing their homes for radon
gas, some may be using do-it-yourself kits that provide dangerously
misleading results,'' Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen,
told a news conference.
   Ms. Claybrook said Public Citizen purchased test kits and sent
them in for analysis at the seven laboratories after filling them
with radon-contaminated air obtained at two Energy Department
laboratories. The results at three of the labs were wide of the mark
by 67 percent in one case.
   Executives from some of the laboratories, however, challenged the
findings and suggested that Public Citizen, an advocacy group
founded by Ralph Nader, had its own procedural and quality control
shortcomings when testing the testers.
   ``They're drawing staggering conclusions on virtually nonexistent
data,'' complained Ned Doyle, a spokesman for Air Check, an Arden,
N.C., laboratory that fared poorly in the Public Citizen evaluation.
He called the survey ``unscientific and unprofessional.''
   But Ms. Claybrook defended the evaluation, which relied heavily
on laboratories answering detailed questionnaires and the eight
separate test samples sent to some of the largest laboratories.
``It's not perfect information, but it's the best that has been done
to date,'' she said.
   ``Those tests show that an alarming number of the radon test kits
currently on the market may not be doing the job,'' she added.
   According to the consumer group, Air Check had an average error
percentage of 45.7 percent for all kits sent in two samples in July
and October, including 67.5 percent in the July tests; Barringer
Laboratories, of Golden, Colo., had an error percentage of 48.8
percent in the October round of tests, and Douglas Martin &amp;
Associates, of Emmaus, Pa., had an error percentage of 26.8 percent
in the July tests.
   Of the 27 laboratories evaluated by questionnaire, 12 received a
``fair'' or ``poor'' rating on the basis of their quality control,
laboratory procedures and staff competence, according to the
consumer group.
   Richard Martin, president of Douglas Martin &amp; Associates, said
two canisters sent by Public Citizen recorded the wrong time period
during which the kits were in use, throwing off calculations used in
the analysis.
   John Lovell, vice president of Barringer Laboratories,
acknowledged in an interview some quality control problems in
October, but attributed part of the problem to a jump in business
after the EPA publicly urged all homeowners in September to conduct
tests.
   Since then, he said, ``quality control procedures have been
upgraded.''
   Doyle, the Air Check spokesman, suggested that Public Citizen
failed to follow instructions in using the test kits.
   Radon, a colorless and odorless radioactive gas, seeps from the
ground through foundations and can reach unsafe levels in an enclosd
area. Scientists believe a significant exposure to radon can cause
lung cancer.
   But there are no federal standards for either the radon detection
kits or the laboratories. While the EPA periodically sends test
samples to the scores of laboratories that have entered the radon
testing business, critics say the labs are notified of the test
samples in advance and can take special care in dealing with them.
   Public Citizen wants Congress to give the EPA authority to
certify testing labs and test kits and to set minimum standards.
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the agency plans to begin some
``blind tests'' in March, but does not plan to push for greater
regulatory power.
   ``We don't think we need a certification program,'' he said,
adding that the over-the-counter kits are only designed as a
preliminary indicator and need not be exceedingly accurate.

<HEAD>EEC Set to Consider Counter-Measures Against U.S. Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>

   European trade representatives say they
will seek permission to slap stiff duties on U.S. imports of dried
fruit and walnuts to retaliate against sanctions against European
products.
   Any such approval would escalate a trade dispute between the
United States and the European Economic Community sparked by a
European ban on imports of American meat treated with growth
hormones.
   Nico Wegter, an EEC spokesman, said Thursday that representatives
of the 12 nations making up the Common Market trading bloc will be
given a proposal calling for the retaliatory measures.
   The plan, drawn up by the bloc's executive body, the European
Commission, will be offered to counter sanctions the United States
put into effect Sunday to retaliate against the European meat ban.
   American officials have raised the possibility of taking more
actions against the Europeans if the trading bloc strikes back.
   Wegter said the proposal recommends imposing 100 percent tariffs
on dried fruit and walnut imports from the United States. An earlier
list had included honey and canned corn.
   Total EEC imports of walnuts, mostly to Germany, averaged $58.8
million annually over the 1985-87 period, Wegter said. Dried fruit
imports, mainly to Germany and Italy, averaged $37.8 million during
that period. Dried fruit products include apples, pears, apricots,
peaches, prunes and papayas.
   The commission's proposal does not set a date for application of
the tariffs but recommends they be put in place as soon as possible.
   The trade fight was set off by the enforcement on Sunday of an
EEC ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.
The trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat from
such animals.
   The ban is expected to halt the importation of about $100 million
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States, some of
which are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet food is
exempted.
   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten
cattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose a
health risk.
   The ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the trading
bloc agreed to delay it for a year. It has since refused American
appeals for yet another postponement.
   The meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated $166
billion in trade between the United States and the Common Market.
   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States on Sunday
imposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef, hams and pork
shoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee, fermented
alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol by
volume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food made
from grains. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.
   The Common Market has filed a complaint with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to protest the U.S. sanctions. The
96-nation GATT is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring the
free movement off goods around the world. The complaint was filed in
November before the sanctions went into effect.

   A Soviet delegation, including the ambassador to
the United States, are visiting the North American International
Auto Show as guests of Ford Motor Co., the automaker said.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin, his wife and three other
Soviet diplomats were scheduled to arrive in Detroit on Thursday to
view U.S. autos that could go on sale in their country by year's
end, Philip E. Benton Jr., president of Ford's international auto
operations, said Wednesday.
   Ford is the only U.S. automaker negotiating to sell in the Soviet
Union, and Benton said a Ford car, most likely Ford of Europe's
Scorpio sedan, could be sold in that country by the end of 1989.
   Dubinin and his party will be entertained Friday by Ford Chairman
Donald Petersen and other Ford executives at a private reception,
attend a charity preview of the auto show and leave Detroit on
Saturday, Ford officials said.

   Inflation reached 35.5 percent in 1988
following a 6.8 percent increase in December consumer prices, the
Central Bank reported Thursday.
   The annual rate is the second highest in recent Venezuelan
history, after the 1987 record inflation level of 40.3 percent.
   The government had set 15 percent inflation as its goal for 1988.
   The Central Bank said December inflation, the highest on a
monthly basis all year, was led by rising prices for perishable
foods.
   Last year, food and tobacco prices rose by 52 percent while the
cost of shoes and clothing increased 35.2 percent, the bank said.

   Soybean futures prices opened modestly lower today
amid profit-taking on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures
were narrowly mixed in early trading.
   Reports and rumors of new export business gave the markets a
healthy boost late Wednesday.
   The wheat market has been especially strong in recent weeks.
Wheat futures prices rose to new 7{-year highs Wednesday on news
that China had purchased 440,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   But analysts said the bullish trend also has brought a sharp rise
in speculative buying and open interest, which refers to the total
number of buy and sell orders that have not yet been cancelled out
by opposing orders.
   ``A lot of new longs (or buy orders) went into the market
yesterday and open interest went up dramatically, and I think that
spooked a few people,'' said Cathy Leow, a grain market analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``That's the reason
for a little softness in terms of price.''
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.46{ a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to { cent higher with March at $2.83} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with March at $2.46 a bushel; soybeans

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the economic expansion shows signs of
submitting to the unending pressure of Federal Reserve restraints,
many investors are growing concerned about the near-term performance
of stocks.
   They reason that if interest rates continue to rise _ short-term
government notes already yield well over 9 percent _ they will draw
funds from stocks. And if a recession comes, corporate earnings will
face big obstacles.
   The solution? Forget the near term; keep your eyes on the future.
Attach yourself to the long-term growth patterns and forget the
short-term squiggles. Spare yourself worries, save on broker's
commissions, defer capital gains.
   This is a segment of the long-term record, compiled by investment
adviser G.W. Perritt, a former college professor and founder of
Investment Information Services.
   Since 1944, per-share earnings of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index are 21.7 times higher, representing a 7 percent compound
annual growth rate. Annual dividends have grown too, by 6.5 percent
a year, or 15.6 times greater.
   The course wasn't steady; earnings fell at times. But overall, an
upward trend persisted. Per-share earnings averaged $1 between 1940
and 1945, grew to $2.84 in the next five years, doubled by 1968 and
doubled again by 1978.
   Today, the S&amp;P is around 270. Per-share index earnings are $21.70
and per-share dividends are about $10.11. Now project these figures
11 years into the future at the growth rates of the past
four-and-a-half decades.
   The result: By the dawn of the year 2000, per-share earnings,
growing at a 7 percent compound annual rate, become $45.35.
Per-share dividends swell to $20.22.
   We are just getting warmed up, says Perritt. Consider: if the
average price-earnings multiple of the S&amp;P index is applied to these
projections the index will be valued at 621 by the year 2000. That's
2.29 times the current level.
   Alternatively, a 22.9 multiple applied to a Dow Jones industrial
average of 2,150 points yields an average of 4,923.
   Remember, these aren't idle dreams; they are projections based on
what has happened in the past. And they do not even tell the entire
story.
   ``There's more good news,'' says Perritt in his newsletter,
``Investment Horizons.''
   If the index continually provides an annual dividend yield of 3.6
percent, and if you reinvest dividends when earned, you tack on
another 47 percent increment. It adds up to a total return of 237
percent.
   While 7 percent represents actual earnings growth over more than
four decades, some people might consider it too optimistic a goal
for the future. But step it down to 5 percent and you still get a
507 S&amp;P and a 4,035 Dow.
   It is difficult to stand pat in the stock market, considering the
daily excitement, the constant flow of investment advice, the
telephone calls of the brokers, the warnings, the fears, the fads,
the media's need for something new.
   But among many patient, reasonable folks, figures such as these
overwhelm the short-term fluctuations, and repeated studies of model
portfolios document the case.
   The in-and-out trader pays commissions to sell and then to rebuy;
the long-term investor keeps his money. Should there be profits, the
in-and-out trader must pay capital gains taxes; the long-termer
defers those taxes indefinitely.
   The wonderful irony of it is that the long-termer works less and
worries less, and gets paid better for the pleasure of it.

   The New York Mercantile Exchange said today it
has signed an agreement in principle to become a partner in the
global automated futures and options trading system being developed
by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC of
Britain.
   The New York Merc is the first exchange to become a partner in
the Globex system, where it will be able to trade its energy futures
and options contracts and platinum group metals contracts on a
worldwide basis 24 hours a day.
   NYMEX, like the Chicago exchange, will list its products for
trading on Globex only outside of its regular working hours. It is
expected to enter the system for trading in the first half of 1990.
   The Chicago Merc is scheduled to begin trading on Globex later
this year.
   The agreement, already approved by the governing boards of both
exchanges, is subject to approval by members of the NYMEX. A special
vote is scheduled for Jan. 26.

   U.S. banks are no longer threatened with
failing because of uncollected Third World debts, the nation's top
banking regulators said today.
   ``Most of the regional banks have put the LDC (Less Developed
Countries) situation behind them,'' L. William Seidman, chairman of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the House Banking
Committee.
   ``While large LDC exposure by some major banks will be with us
for years to come, at this time we cannot foresee any bank failures
resulting from LDC exposure alone,'' Seidman said.
   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
said U.S. bank exposure to the 15 major Third World debtors declined
by $8.6 billion between July 1987 and the same month last year to
$76 billion.
   ``A disproiportionate share of this reduction was accounted for
by large regional banks, as distinct from the largest multinational
banks,'' Johnson said. ``Nonetheless, the top nine banks reduced
their total exposure over the year by $2.6 billion (to $53
billion).''
   He said small and regional banks have largely abandoned further
international lending in developing countries and have reduced what
exposure they had by selling or swapping the loans at discounts on
secondary markets.
   The larger banks, he said, have not been willing to discount
their loans to the Third World countries as much.
   Seidman said the nine major U.S. money center banks have reduced
their outstanding loans to 31 less developed countries from $61
billion in December 1982 to roughly $55 billion as of last year.
   During the same period, he said, they have raised their aggregate
primary capital from $32 billion to $65 billion.
   Meanwhile, the debt servicing capacity of the six largest
borrowers _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines and
Venezuela _ well exceeds the 40 percent value the secondary market
is putting on the loans, Seidman said.
   President-elect Bush promised last month to ``take a whole new
look'' at Third World debt now estimated at $1.32 trillion,
including loans from other countries and multinational institutions
such as the World Bank.
   But former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, Bush's nominee
to be the new secretary of state, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady both declined an invitation to testify at today's hearing.
   The committee's new chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said Wednesday he was disappointed but added he expects the
administration to develop a policy quickly on what he called a
``growing crisis.''
   Seidman and Johnson declined to characterize the situation as a
crisis, saying there has been great progress since 1982 when Mexico
suddenly stopped paying interest on its debt because of plummeting
oil prices.
   At the time, some feared that the whole international banking
system could collapse. The book value of loans from U.S. banks to
Third World countries then was $139.7 billion and the banks had only
$66.2 billion in capital to cover them if the countries defaulted.
   While the book value of the loans has fallen by $42 billion,
banks have increased their capital to $139.7 billion, as of last
June, the congressional General Accounting Office said Wednesday,
greatly reducing their exposure.
   The GAO said a major component of the turnaround was $2.3 billion
that regulators required the banks to set aside as special reserves
and another $20 billion that banks have voluntarily set aside over
the past year and a half to cover loan losses.
   However, that is not enough, the GAO said, estimating that $49
billion of loss reserves would more accurately reflect the
diminished value of the loans.
   Meanwhile, the World Bank says Third World countries in 1988 paid
out $43 billion more in servicing the debt than they received in new
loans and investments from developed countries.
   ``Although the banks increased their reserves because they know
they are not going to be repaid in full, they continue to insist on
debt-service payments based on face value,'' the Rev. J. Bryan
Hehir, a social policy counselor for the U.S. Catholic Conference,
told the committee.
   The result of austerity programs to service the debt, Hehir said,
is growing poverty, malnutrition and unemployment and _ because of
cuts in health programs _ the reappearance of diseases thought to
have been eradicated.
   ``Living standards in the 1980s have declined more than 25
percent in sub-Saharan Africa and 15 percent in Latin America, and
both regions are deeper in debt than ever,'' he said. ``...All of
this spells recession, leads Latin Americans in particular to
question their leaders' economic strategy and breeds revolution.''

   She says that tobacco remains ``legal today solely by historical
accident and political maneuvering.''
   ``The accident is that millions of Americans became addicted to
tobacco before the hazards of smoking were widely recognized and
before products sold to the public were systematically reviewed for
safety. The maneuvering involves skillful political manipulation by
the tobacco industry to obtain exemption from every law and
authority designed to protect the public from hazardous substances.''
   She says that with falling domestic demand, the industry is
aiming more at foreign markets, the Third World, especially Asia _
for instance Japan where 63 percent of the males smoke and China
where 70 percent of the males smoke. Only 27 percent of American men
smoke, she says.
   Furthermore, American cigarettes sold abroad are higher by far in
tars and nicotine than domestic brands.
   Indeed, those 25 years ago when the surgeon general first
attacked smoking, most smokers cut down and looked to the industry
to provide them with safer cigarettes, which the industry did.
Opponents, who had pressed for safer cigarettes, then pressed for
none at all.
   The strength of the new attack on smoking has the fervor and the
rationale of ``Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.'' The National Academy
of Sciences in 1986 legitimized studies that held that non-smokers
were endangered by environmental tobacco smoke which was called ETS.
   That same year, the surgeon general said that 20 years of
accumulating evidence allowed the verdict: ``It is now clear that
disease risk due to the inhalation of tobacco smoke is not limited
to the individual who is smoking, but can extend to those who inhale
tobacco smoke emitted into the air.''
   While urging changes, he emphasized that those changes ``should
not be designed to punish the smoker.''
   ``Cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior, and the individual
smoker must decide whether or not to continue that behavior;
however, it is evident from the data presented in this volume that
the choice to smoke cannot interfere with the non-smokers' right to
breathe air free of tobacco smoke.''
   While the studies have been criticized, they are largely
statistical and have not been refuted. But since many smokers have a
guilty conscience about their habit anyway, efforts to fight off the
increasing repression make little headway.
   Not that there have not been efforts. Philip Morris publishes a
glossy, entertaining magazine that has become a rallying point for
smokers militant enough to fight back. Introduced in 1985 with a
circulation of 150,000, the free magazine claims a circulation today
of 12 million and a readership of 24 million.
   It reports local and national efforts to restrict the rights of
smokers and provides a vent for some of the emotions of those who
feel they are persecuted by the non-smoking movement.
   Publisher Guy Smith explains that its surveys produce a profile
of the American smoker that should command attention in the
marketplace.
   ``We want Detroit to know that smokers buy cars _ a lot of cars.
Furthermore, we want Detroit to know that although some people
complain about cars with ashtrays, there are still millions of car
owners who smoke and use ashtrays.''
   If the message is aimed at automakers, it is also aimed at
politicians, restaurateurs and others who serve the general public.
   Consider the Philip Morris statistics: Smokers own 35 million
cars, 5 million of them new last year; they have 38 million TV sets,
23 million VCRs, 5 million home computers, 30 million credit cards.
Sixty-five percent of them are married and 40 percent have children.
Almost 90 percent are registered voters and the vast majority said
they voted in the last election. They are affluent, educated, active
in community affairs and charitable organizations. Every day, 21
million of them go out to eat.
   That does not jibe with the statistics of the non-smoking
movement, which sees smoking as largely a blue-collar problem, the
affluent, better-educated having fled the smoking ranks.
   Everybody's statistics show the number of women who smoke is
bucking an otherwise downward trend, especially young women. The
non-smoking people say this is especially disheartening, because
smoking by a prospective mother has been shown to be injurious to
the fetus during pregnancy.
   Some 35 million Americans have quit, most of them obeying the
strictures of the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association, the American Medical Association, and myriad other
health groups allied against smoking.
   As a social experiment, the campaign for a smoke-free America has
made remarkable strides. But it is not the first attempt to stomp
out the lowly weed.
   They tried whipping in Russia and beheading in Turkey, and in
this country health issues were a prime motive in the late 1800s.
Now it's local bans on smoking as in New York City and Beverly
Hills, curtailed advertising and special taxes (35 cents more a pack
in California).
   Today's anti-smoking movement is hard-nosed and persistent,
thanks to federal involvement. It is an emotional confrontation.

<TEXT>
   Gone are the days of the toothy, tire-kicking car
salesmen clad in loud sports jackets.
   Replacing them are today's multiple-dealership, well-heeled
businessmen with one eye on the auto industry and the other on real
estate.
   They're called megadealers. Often, they control dozens of
businesses, sometimes in a variety of states. The growth of the
megadealers along with high technology and wages could spell trouble
for smaller, single-nameplate dealerships.
   ``I see the little people getting out and the bigger people
getting bigger,'' said megadealer Max Pearson, president of the
Pearson Companies of Richmond, Va.
   Megadealers have nearly as many ways of operating as they have
cars on their lots.
   Some limit their businesses and their locations. Dealer Services
Inc. of Westbury, N.Y., for instance, handles just imported cars _
Honda, Acura, Subaru, Saab and Isuzu _ and only on Long Island.
   Some, like Pearson Companies, are spread across the country and
sell a variety of cars and light trucks.
   Pearson Companies is made up of 18 dealerships _ 11 in Virginia,
three in Florida and four in Texas. Those stores sell cars and light
trucks carrying Acura, Chevrolet, Dodge, Eagle, Honda, Hyundai,
Jeep, Lincoln, Mercury, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Oldsmobile, Pontiac,
Subaru and Toyota nameplates.
   Variety like that is what megadealers are all about, no matter if
they're under one roof, in one city or spread out nationwide.
   ``If you diversify and have representation in all facets of the
market and one part gets weak, then the others hold it up.'' Pearson
said.
   The business philosophy that drove Pearson and others to acquire
more dealerships is reflected in numbers of outlet and the number of
people who own then.
   Between 1979 and 1987, according to the National Automobile
Dealership Association, the number of dealerships nationwide has
dropped 11 percent _ falling to about 25,000 from 28,000 _ while the
number of dealership owners has declined 32 percent _ to 17,000 from
25,100.
   ``You really are seeing a significant shift'' toward megadealers,
NADA spokeswoman Mary Beth Robinson said.
   ``It seems to be the way to go,'' said Jim Mucciello, controller
of Dealer Services. ``It doesn't put all your eggs in one basket.''
   Such diversification takes lots of money.
   ``Twenty years ago, you could go out with $200,000 to $400,000
and you could get into a dealership,'' NADA Executive Vice President
Frank McCarthy said. ``Today the dealerships are costing anywhere
from $2.5 (million) to $4 million on the conservative side.''
   He said auto manufacturers require between 10 percent and 20
percent in available capital before allowing a dealership to market
its vehicles, he added.
   ``The business today is a closed society,'' McCarthy said. ``It
costs so much money to get into this business, and you have to have
expertise to get in.
   ``There's not too many people who have that combination. As a
result, you have existing dealerships who buy up other dealerships.''
   Compounding the costs of getting cars and parts is securing the
property the dealership sits on.
   ``Land values in this country are wild and wooly right now,''
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith said in a recent interview.
   ``We just opened a dealership in Long Island City, N.Y., where
it's an office building we built nd there's a dealership on the main
floor,'' he said. ``The office building upstairs helps carry the
rent so that you can have a dealership in what otherwise would be an
impossible location just because of the land value.''
   Real estate costs are high on the minds of businessmen like Ken
Meade of the Meade Group, which assembles a number of dealerships on
the same piece of land. Meade and his Grosse Pointe Farms-based
business is developing Michigan's first single-owner auto mall. In
it, he plans to have eight dealerships, with a common body shop and
service area and related businesses, including a car wash and a fast
oil change operation.
   As in other states, Michigan cities and suburbs have strips where
automobile dealers have sprung up. Some dealers in Troy have banded
together as the Troy Motor Mall in advertising, but those businesses
are independently owned and operated.
   Meade has commitments from Toyota and Jeep-Eagle for dealerships
and is negotiating with others, which he won't identify, for space
in his business near Utica, about 20 miles north of Detroit.
   His planned automotive mall is near the 160-store Lakeside Mall,
and Meade said he will offer shuttle bus service to the shopping
center for customers waiting for their cars to be serviced,
heightening the attraction of the multidealership mall.
   In addition to real estate costs, the price of getting into the
car-selling business is rising because of the costs of high-tech
equipment and qualified people to use it.
   That's putting the squeeze on the little guy, like Emmett Ysser,
owner of Emmett Ysser Inc. of Savannah, Tenn., about 100 miles east
of Memphis.
   ``At little stores, it's difficult to have the capital to do the
things that the megaboys can do,'' said Ysser, who sells Chevrolet,
Dodge, Chrysler and Plymouth cars and light trucks.
   ``In the last 10 years there's been greater change (in selling
cars) than the first 40 years. It's in line with technology,'' said
Ysser, whose dealership, started by his father, will celebrate 50
years in business in 1989.
   The cost of new equipment is compounded by the growing complexity
of today's automobiles. Machines that help mechanics fix problems
and keep cars running are becoming highly specialized, Ysser said,
meaning a larger investment applies to a smaller part of his service
business.
   In the past, he said, ``You take a diagnostic piece of equipment
that sells for $2,000 and do 90 percent of your repairs. Now you go
to $20,000 (of equipment) for 5 percent, which means the bigger
operations can afford it more than we can.
   ``A megadealership may have two machines and eight stores and run
them back and forth'' cutting costs and increasing profits, Ysser
said.
   No matter what changes have occurred, small dealers, like Ysser,
and big dealers, like Meade, agree a trend is growing toward
megadealers. It's a word Meade says should be struck from the
vocabulary.
   ``The dealers that own different franchises have been around for
a long time,'' Meade said. ``Somebody named it `mega' in 1983 and it
stuck.''

   Share prices finished stronger but below the day's
highs Thursday on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by speculative
buying of leading British stocks and by successive rises on Wall
Street.
   The stronger dollar continued to underpin the London market,
producing more gains in blue-chip shares. Takeover speculation
continued to enliven the market, generating some healthy trading
volumes in the food and oil sectors.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 11.7 points higher at
1,471.5. Volume totaled 448.0 million shares, up from 353.1 million
shares on Wednesday.
   The market opened on a stronger note following Wednesday's
33-point surge in the Dow Jones industrial average. The dollar
continued its upward move in European trading Thursday, supplying
further impetus for the major British dollar-earning stocks.
   Wall Street opened higher Thursday, providing a firm undertone to
the London market during the afternoon trading session. The Dow
average was up another 5.71 points at 2,183.39 when the London
market closed.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 6.5
points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,799.5, below the day's high of

<HEAD>Toyota Luxury Car Division Gets Reprieve in Use of Lexus Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. officials heaved a collective
sigh of relief Thursday after learning the company's new Lexus line
of luxury cars could keep its name, at least for now.
   ``Whoa, that's good news,'' Jim Perkins, senior vice president of
the Japanese company's Lexus division, said after being told of the
ruling in a New York federal court.
   Mead Data General Inc. has sued Toyota claiming that the Lexus
name diluted the business of its Lexis legal information retrieval
service.
   A federal district judge issued a restraining order last week
forbidding Toyota from using the Lexus name, but an appeals court
delayed implementation of that order earlier this week.
   The ruling Thursday by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New
York extended the reprieve on a limited basis at least until Jan.
30, when the appellate court will hear arguments on the merits of
the case by lawyers from both sides.
   The extension came just as Toyota was unveiling its Lexus line at
the North American Auto Show, which runs through Jan. 15 in Detroit.
Lexus also has a display running the same time at the Los Angeles
Auto Show.
   Company officials had nervously wondered whether they would have
to cover up the names of the cars at their swank exhibits.
   ``We could have changed it (the display) in four hours,'' said
Perkins.
   Appellate Judge Emilia Kearse said Toyota may continue to use the
Lexus name at the auto shows and at other expositions, but cannot
advertise Lexus nationally until the matter is settled.
   Lawyers from both sides were happy with Thursday's decision.
   ``Essentially, they have given each side part of what it
wanted,'' said Mead attorney Charles J. Farouki.
   Arthur D. Gray, who represents Toyota, said: ``We're pleased with
the result.''
   ``We're one step further,'' added Bob McCurry, executive vice
president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``I think it shows that we
have a case there.''
   Toyota and the Lexus division have dropped millions of dollars
into the Lexus name since it was agreed upon in August 1987.
   The Lexus booth at the Detroit auto show features two four-door
sedans, the LS400 and ES250, which vary in cost from $20,000 to
$40,000 and are aimed at buyers ready for luxury cars but unwilling
to pay more for European imports.
   The legal dispute with Mead has attracted heavy press attention
to the Lexus exhibit, where reporters got a preview before the
exposition opens to the public Saturday.
   ``Our most immediate job is to earn name recognition for Lexus,''
said Perkins. ``Unfortunately, we're doing it the hard way.''

<HEAD>Corn Futures Rise On Rumors; Wheat, Soybeans End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices closed moderately higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late rally fanned by
rumors of an expansion of the long-term grain agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   The Nov. 28 extension of the previous 5-year U.S.-Soviet grain
pact set the maximum amount of Soviet purchases of U.S. grain at 12
million metric tons a year. That limit was expanded to 16 million
metric tons on Dec. 23.
   Rumors on Thursday that the Agriculture Department planned to
expand the maximum purchase limit to 20 million metric tons sparked
a buying frenzy in the corn futures pit shortly before the close,
analysts said.
   Cathy Leow, a grain-market analyst with Thomson-McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York, said an expansion was almost inevitable
since the Soviets have already bought nearly 16 million metric tons
of U.S. grain.
   ``They're already bumping up against the maximum,'' she said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to } cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.48 a bushel; corn was
} cent to 3} cents higher with March at $2.87 a bushel; oats were {

<HEAD>New York Mercantile Exchange Enters Global Futures, Options Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange said Thursday it
has joined a worldwide automated network that will enable it to
trade energy and metals futures and options round-the-clock starting
next year.
   NYMEX, the world's leading energy exchange, said it signed an
agreement in principle to become a partner in Globex, a trading
system being developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Reuters Holdings PLC of Britain.
   Globex is scheduled to begin operating in October, when the
Chicago exchange will begin using the system. The New York exchange
will enter the system in the first half of 1990.
   The agreement, already approved by the governing boards of both
exchanges, is subject to approval by members of the NYMEX. A special
vote is scheduled for Jan. 26.
   ``The need exists for a 24-hour trading system for all
international futures and options products,'' said Lou Guttman,
chairman of NYMEX. ``Globex represents the optimum solution to
facilitate that need. It integrates our present open outcry system
with current technological advancements in a manner that draws the
best from both.''
   Like the Chicago exchange, NYMEX will list its products for
trading on Globex only when its trading pits are closed to preserve
the current ``open outcry'' system. The New York exchange currently
trades between 8:10 a.m. and 3:10 p.m. EST.
   NYMEX is the first exchange to become a partner in the Globex
system. In addition to energy contracts, such as oil and gasoline,
it will trade metals, such as platinum.
   Two other New York futures exchanges, the Commodity Exchange and
the New York Cotton Exchange, said Thursday they also were
considering offering their products for trading on the Globex system.
   The Chicago Merc and Reuters announced in September 1987 their
plan to develop the computerized system that would allow
round-the-clock trading of the Merc's financial futures contracts.
   The goal of Globex is to capture more of the rapidly growing
business from Europe and the Far East, especially Japan. The
increasing amount of Japanese investment in the United States has
created among Japanese investors a desire to hedge, or protect,
their investments from volatile pricing by buying and selling
futures contracts.
   The Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Merc's fiercest
competitor, has been luring more overseas business by extending its
trading hours.
   The CBOT urged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in
September to reject the Globex proposal, claiming that because
trades would not occur in the traditional manner, the system was
``inherently susceptible'' to abuse.
   CBOT spokesman Ray Carmichael said Thursday his exchange had no
comment on the NYMEX-Globex link-up.

<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp. and three partners in a
southwestern coal pipeline project have reached a $60 million
out-of-court settlement with Kansas City Southern Railway Co.,
company officials said Thursday.
   The settlement stems from a 1984 antitrust lawsuit involving
Houston-based Texas Eastern and subsidiaries of Bechtel Group Inc.,
Enron Corp. and KN Energy Inc., all partners in the ETSI Pipeline
Project.
   The lawsuit alleged that Kansas City Southern conspired with
other railroads to block the proposed $3 billion pipeline project
designed to transport coal slurry from Wyoming to Midsouth and Gulf
Coast utilities.
   ETSI agreed to settlements with Union Pacific and the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroads in late 1987 and with Burlington-Northern
Railroad Co. last November.
   The Santa Fe Railroad also is a defendant in the October 1984
lawsuit, but has yet to reach a settlement. A trial involving that
company is scheduled next Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Beaumont.
   Texas Eastern is involved in natural gas and petroleum pipelines,
refining and marketing and real estate development.

   Soviet officials are cracking down on the highly
successful cooperative movement, banning the small private ventures
from such lucrative operations as video salons and some medical care.
   At a remarkable news conference Thursday on the new restrictions,
bureaucrats criticized cooperatives for printing risque posters and
skimming money off the most profitable businesses.
   In a meeting later Thursday, the ruling Communist Party Politburo
called for creation of conditions ``for increasing the output and
quality of goods turned out by cooperatives and bringing the prices
of these goods closer to state prices.'' The report on the Politburo
meeting by the Tass news agency provided no details how that would
be accomplished.
   The crackdown seemed strikingly at odds with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's attempts to revive the stagnant economy by expanding
cooperatives and reducing the power of the Moscow ministries. In a
New Year's Eve speech, Gorbachev specifically called for a
``stronger cooperative movement'' in 1989.
   But a panel of eight officials of deputy ministerial rank told
the news conference that co-ops had to be barred from businesses
ranging from filmmaking to jewelry manufacturing, because they are
competing with their ministries for critically short supplies and
making products of ``poor quality.''
   As an example, Ivan P. Korovkin, deputy chairman of the state
publishing committee, unrolled a cooperative-produced poster
featuring a nude woman and a strategically placed black cat.
   ``Look! Much is of low quality and doubtful taste,'' he said.
   He proceeded to a pack of five trading cards depicting poplar
Soviet rock groups. He said they were sold by a cooperative for
about 48 cents, when a state publishing house would have charged
only about 5 cents.
   ``They have received 600,000 rubles ($960,000) profit just
publishing these!'' Korovkin said, clearly appalled. He did not
explain why state publishing houses are not printing items such as
the cards, even though 2 million people bought them.
   ``Paper is in short supply,'' Korovkin noted, and the ministries
must ensure it is used appropriately.
   But Vladimir Yakovlev, a leader in the cooperative movement,
sharply criticized the decree. He said in a telephone interview
after the news conference that it passed without the prior public
debate Gorbachev keeps promising as part of his democratic reforms.
   Yakovlev, chairman of Fact, a Moscow-based market research co-op,
predicted a public outcry, similar to the one last summer that
forced revision of a plan to tax cooperatives up to 90 percent of
their profits.
   Cooperatives have mushroomed since they were legalized two years
ago, and now more than 700,000 Soviets work for them, sharing in the
profits and taking home salaries several times higher than average.
Most co-ops offer services or fashionable goods hard to find in
enterprises run by government ministries.
   Korovkin also complained the cooperatives wanted to publish
``classics of Russian literature, modern literature, posters and
detective stories,'' which are in high demand and short supply. But
not a single cooperative was publishing cheap books, such as
children's stories and manuals for schools, leaving that low-profit
business to the ministries.
   A short supply of film also was cited as the reason for
prohibiting cooperatives from producing their own movies.
   ``Even in state movies, quality is not that high,'' said V.G.
Makoveyev, deputy of the state cinematography committee, presumably
implying that inadequate film supplies limit directors' ability to
reshoot scenes.
   Video salons _ popular cafes that offer armchairs and snacks to
movie-goers watching rarely shown movies on big-screen video _ are
being banned because they violate copyright laws, the bureaucrats
said.
   Medical cooperatives, which have been doing a booming business in
a nation with free but often poor-quality medical care, are being
sharply restricted because many were using state-owned equipment,
the officials said.
   Yakovlev noted that many of the medical and video cooperatives
being put out of business by the decree have invested heavily in
equipment, which the state must now buy back.
   He also worried that the decree failed to define banned
publishing activities, leaving advertising and informational items
in a gray area. He said Moscow officials probably will permit
advertising co-ops to continue but provincial authorities are much
more conservative.
   Cooperatives also are being banned from any business involving
foreign currency, even though a law published in early December
specifically encouraged co-ops to enter businesses that would earn
the hard currency so desperately needed by the Soviet Union. The
cash restriction apparently is aimed at reducing black-marketeering.
   The new restrictions also ban cooperative schools, wineries,
pharmaceutical manufacturing, pawnshops, lotteries, and production
of icons and other religious artifacts.
   Cooperatives will be allowed in certain areas, such as concert
promotion and medicine, only under the wing of the appropriate state
agency, which will control their production and profits, officials
said.
   Officials said religious groups asked for the last restriction,
saying they depended on the sale of such goods for their own income.
They refused to identify the religious groups.

<HEAD>Money Funds Fell $449.5 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual
funds fell $449.5 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $278.03 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $246.1 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group said.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $281.89 billion in the week
ended Nov. 23, 1988.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 226 general purpose funds rose $249.1 million to $89.94
billion, assets of 91 broker-dealer funds decreased $1.29 billion to
$115.67 billion, and assets of 136 institutional funds rose $588.4
million to $72.41 billion.
   ``The decline in assets of money market funds in the
broker-dealer category overwhelmed the modest increases in assets of
general purpose and institutional funds,'' said Jacob Dreyer, the
institute's vice president and chief economist. ``But it is
extremely difficult to pinpoint the reasons for money flows at the
turn of the year, when investors' decisions are heavily influenced
by tax positioning, balance sheet considerations and other
transitory factors.''
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.39 percent from 8.18 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.14 percent from 8.01 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 29
days, down from 32 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.22 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.20 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.21
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.18 the
previous week. Yields were 8.48 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.44
percent; 8.58 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.55 percent; and 8.71
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.70 percent.

<HEAD>Publisher Moves Step Closer To Winning Hostile Bid For Collins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch's News International PLC
continued to press its $725 million hostile bid for William Collins
PLC Thursday after a rival suitor dropped out of the fight.
   J. Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co., the merchant bank advising Collins,
a Scottish publishing group, held talks Thursday with Charterhouse,
the advisers to News International, after Groupe de la Cite,
France's second largest book publisher, withdrew a friendly bid on
Wednesday.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said he would not refer
the News International bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
which could block the proposed deal.
   The French firm pulled out Wednesday because not enough
institutional shareholders were prepared to give irrevocable
undertakings to accept its proposed offer, Collins said.
   Mark Bogard, a Schroder executive, said Thursday's discussions
centered on ``what the nature of the assurances that News feel they
could give would be,'' regarding the future of Collins' business
within News International.
   Collins wants a commitment that it will be an autonomous unit
within News, that its core businesses would be expanded and that
Collins management would stay in London and Glasgow. Collins also
wants an assurance that it would spearhead News International's
English-language publishing interests worldwide, he said.
   It had received similar assurances from Groupe de la Cite, he
said.
   After Collins receives an answer from News International, Bogard
said, ``the board of Collins will have to decide whether those are
adequate'' and whether to recommend the bid.
   Groupe de la Cite had indicated in December it was prepared to
pay 880 pence, or $15.84, for each Collins voting share, valuing the
entire company at around 403 million pounds, or $725 million. Just
before Christmas, News International sweetened its own offer to
match exactly the French bid.
   Groupe de la Cite had approached News International Wednesday
with an improved offer for Collins on condition the Murdoch group
sell its 41.7 percent voting stake in Collins. But News
International refused and the French firm withdrew its offer.
   Murdoch and Collins jointly own Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc. in
New York.
   News of the French withdrawal came after the London stock market
closed on Wednesday. News International shares finished unchanged on
Thursday at 213 pence, or $3.83, while Collins shares closed down 3
pence, 5 cents, at 882 pence, or $15.88.

   The stock market pushed ahead Thursday to its
highest level since the October 1987 crash as traders awaited the
government's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.86 to 2,190.54,
surpassing its 1988 closing peak of 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21.
   On Oct. 16, 1987, just before taking a 508-point drop on ``Black
Monday,'' the average stood at 2,246.74.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in the
daily tally of nationwide trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 837 up, 611 down and 509 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.04 million
shares, up from 149.70 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 208.41 million shares.
   The data from the Labor Department Friday on employment for
December are expected to show continued strength in the economy.
   That presumably would give the Federal Reserve extra cause to
consider a further tightening of credit in its campaign to keep
inflationary pressures from reviving.
   Indeed, the Fed is thought by some analysts to have pulled in the
reins a bit this week ing in the parade will be nearly 12,000 people, from
bell
ringers to bagpipers, from baton twirlers to the California Raisins,
Mickey Mouse, Goofy and 47 members of the Alaska National Guard
Eskimo Scouts, dressed in Arctic gear with beaver hats.
   Daniel Denning, managing director of the inaugural parade, said
there will be 78 floats, 53 bands, 20 marching units, 24 horse
units, 3 choirs, 4 dancing units, 35 military units and one helium
balloon of Popeye the Sailor, official Boy Scouts spokesman.
   Bob Hope and pioneering pilot Chuck Yeager will lead the parade
as honorary grand marshals.
   The first float will feature a rippling replica of the American
flag, 20 feet high and 40 feet long. Pulling up the rear will be the
320 members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, seated eight abreast on
risers on a 100-foot float.
   In between will be a float depicting Washington's crossing of the
Delaware River, a Cinderella carriage pulled by two large white
horses and a Texas entry that will be ``practically as big as the
state itself,'' said one press release.
   Texas will be represented by a 10,000-gallon hat pulling a size
100 40E cowboy boot, followed by ``a corral of hootin' Texas
two-steppers'' and a matching boot, all strung out over 100 feet.
   The Indiana float is entitled ``Hoosier Pride,'' the same name
that Quayle gave his campaign plane. It will include a peace dove,
the Stars and Stripes and the inaugural theme of peace, prosperity
and independence.
   Among the 457 horses in the parade will be a mounted posse of
U.S. marshals on 30 golden palominos and six Belgian draft horses
pulling a Conestoga wagon.

   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Corp. car
sales jumped in the last 10 days of December, contributing to
overall sales increases for the Big Three automakers in 1988, the
companies said Thursday.
   GM sold an average of 14,656 cars daily in the nine selling days
from Dec. 21-31, up 42.2 percent from the same nine-day period last
year.
   Ford said it sold an average of 8,781 cars daily for the period,
a 26.4 percent increase.
   Chrysler Corp. reported selling 3,497 cars a day in the late
December period, slipping 1.7 percent from late December of 1987.
   For the year, GM said it sold 3.641 million cars, an average of
11,823 a day for the year's 308 sales days, up 2.1 percent from
3.556 million _ an 11,581-a-day average _ in the 307 selling days of
1987.
   Ford said it sold 2.205 million cars, or 7,160 a day, in 1988, up
8.8 percent from 2.019 million or 6,579 a day, in 1987.
   Chrysler's 1988 car sales of 1.063 million or 3,450 a day, were
up 10.1 percent from 962,057, or 3,133 daily, in 1987, the company
said.
   GM said it set a light-truck sales record for the year,
delivering 1.741 million trucks, an average of 5,651 daily, for a
12.6 percent increase over 1987.
   Ford sold 1.462 million trucks, averaging 4,747 a day, up 4.2
percent. Chrysler reported sales of 955,619 light trucks, a daily
average of 3,102, for a 14.6 percent increase.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Thursday, gathering momentum from its gains in the previous session.
   The U.S. currency rose on Wednesday following news that U.S. jet
fighters had shot down two Libyan war planes over the Mediterranean
Sea. The dollar tends to rise in times of world unrest because it is
seen as a safe investment.
   Audrey McNiff, a vice president at Irving Trust Co., said
Thursday the dollar retained the strength it drew from the
U.S.-Libyan incident.
   Analysts said traders' bullishness regarding the dollar was
dampened somewhat by comments from Helmut Schlesinger, vice
president of the West German central bank. He said the bank would
maintain a slightly restrictive monetary policy to thwart
inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Dealers took Schlesinger's remarks as a call for higher interest
rates in West Germany, which would boost the mark and lower the
dollar.
   But the dollar still managed strong gains.
   The currency began its day in Tokyo, rising 1.28 Japanese yen to
a closing 125.33 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 124.50 yen,
and in New York, it rose 1 yen to 125.975 yen from late Wednesday's
124.975.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7985 West German marks, up from
1.7874; 1.5380 Swiss francs, up from 1.52815; 6.1415 French francs,
up from 6.0910; 1,318.50 Italian lire, up from 1,314.50; and 1.19025
Canadian dollars, down from 1.19265.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.7955 West German marks, up from 1.7875; 1.5195
Swiss francs, up from 1.5180; 6.1155 French francs, up from 6.0985;
2.0220 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0140; 1,316.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,313.00; and 1.1877 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7970 from $1.8065
Wednesday, and in later New York trading, sterling slipped to
$1.7940 from late Wednesday's $1.8090.
   Gold prices fell on domestic and overseas markets. In New York,
Republic National Bank quoted a bid of $408.25 for a troy ounce of
gold as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $408.50 late Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold edged down to $407.90
from late Wednesday's $408.70.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.75 a troy
ounce, down from $409.75 late Wednesday, and in Zurich, Switzerland,
the late bid price was $407.20, down from late Wednesday's $409.40.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.22 to close at a bid $410.94.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $6.01. However, in New York, a troy ounce of
silver rose to $5.965 from late Wednesday's $5.937.

<HEAD>With AM-Drexel Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Investment Board on Thursday
suspended business with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street
company that agreed last month to plead guilty to widespread
securities fraud charges.
   Marshall Burkes, the board's executive director, said the action
was consistent with a policy against doing business with a company
that admits or is found guilty of a felony.
   The Investment Board, which manages $18 billion in retirement and
other funds, paid slightly more than $500,000 a year in commissions
to Drexel Burnham, less than 5 percent of its annual bill for
commissions.
   ``They are a substantial dealer, but by no means a major
dealer,'' he said. He said the suspension was indefinite.
   ``We will reconsider the suspension if and when Drexel can make a
case that they have corrected their problems,'' Burkes said.
   Last week New York City suspended Drexel from participation in an
upcoming sale of municipal bonds, in what was seen as a signal that
other governmental money-raising authorities may take similar action
in the aftermath of the firm's agreement to settle criminal charges.
   Drexel agreed Dec. 21 to pay the government a record $650 million
in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts after
a two year criminal investigation of the firm by federal prosecutors.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Advance Limit On Chinese Buying Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
a pound Thursday on the New York Cotton Exchange amid rumors that
China, normally a cotton exporter, had purchased as much as 100,000
bales of U.S. cotton.
   On other markets, cocoa futures tumbled; livestock and meat
advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures gained;
precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures were slightly
higher.
   Cotton settled 1.88 cents to 2 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at 58.13 cents a pound.
   The gains followed two days of losses, including a steep slide of
1.82 cents in the March contract's price on Tuesday after the
National Cotton Council proposed that the Agriculture Department
take steps to lower the price of U.S. cotton on the world market to
make it more competitive.
   Rumors that China had purchased 70,000 to 100,000 bales of U.S.
cotton filtered into the market early in Thursday's session, right
behind a Chinese newspaper's report that China's 1988 cotton
production totaled 4.01 million metric tons, a 4.3 percent decline
from 1987.
   Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said that while there was no confirmation of the Chinese
buying, ``from my friends in the trade, I can tell you it's pretty
definite they did take some cotton.''
   Judith Ganes, a New York-based analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the strong rally also reflected the realization
that any moves by the USDA to lower the adjusted world price of U.S.
cotton would have no effect on current crop prices.
   Overall, she said, the supply and demand factors for U.S. cotton
are ``overwhelmingly bearish,'' with a huge surplus and record
supplies expected this year.
   Cocoa futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange as bearish fundamentals reasserted themselves in the market.
   Prices had rallied on Tuesday on confirmation that the French
trading house Sucres et Denrees had bought 400,000 metric tons of
cocoa from the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
   The purchase was believed to be part of a secret deal whereby the
French government would subsidize the withholding of 200,000 metric
tons of the Ivorian cocoa from the market for two years to help
stabilize prices.
   But with worldwide cocoa supplies far outstripping demand, Ms.
Ganes said many traders doubt that France will keep the high-quality
Ivorian cocoa warehoused.
   ``It's expensive to finance it and, especially if prices drop,
they're sitting on an expensive bundle,'' she said.
   Cocoa settled $49 to $80 lower with the March contract at $1,433
a metric ton.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork futures finished
substantially higher, buoyed by strong spot markets and expecations
for a bullish USDA quarterly hogs and pigs report on Friday. Most
cattle futures also rose.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February
at 73.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent
higher with January at 84.45 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .48 cent higher with February at 46.95 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .48 cent to 1.03 cents higher with February at 44.35
cents a pound.
   Corn futures finished moderately higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade in a late rally fanned by rumors that the USDA planned to
increase to 20 million metric tons from 16 million metric tons the
maximum amount of U.S. grain that the Soviet Union can purchase
annually under the U.S.-Soviet long-term grain agreement.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $4.48\
a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3} cents higher with March at $2.86} a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.45
a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
January at $8.13 a bushel.
   In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 34 cents
higher with February at $17.42 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent to
.80 cent higher with February at 53.47 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .03 cent lower to .12 cent higher with February at
47.40 cents a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 80 cents to 90
cents lower with February at $410.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5
cents to 2.8 cents higher with March at $6.05 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .10 point higher at 283. Each
point is worth $500.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese banks are expected to approve about $5
billion in loans to help finance the $24.53 billion buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc., according to the Kyodo News Service.
   Quoting unnamed sources in the finance industry, Kyodo said the
banks would lend about $500 million each to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co., which bid $109 a share for RJR Nabisco in the biggest buyout
in financial history.
   The Kyodo report named three of Japan's leading banks _ Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. and Sanwa Bank Ltd. _ and
said other banks would respond favorably to their participation and
agree to join the financing venture to a total of $5 billion.
   Spokesmen for leading banks indicated Thursday that the decision
would be made sometime Friday.
   ``We are still looking at it,'' said a spokesman for Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, asking anonymity.
   The two other banks made similar comments.
   Kohlberg, Kravis had no comment from New York on Thursday.
   Last month, Henry Kravis, a principal of Kohlberg Kravis, visited
Tokyo to try to persuade Japanese investors to help finance the
purchase.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two narrower measures of the nation's money
supply rose in late December while a third, broader money supply
gauge fell, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$900 million to a seasonally-adjusted average of $786.3 billion in
the week ended Dec. 26 from a revised $785.4 billion in the previous
week. The previous week's figure had been reported initially as
$785.5 billion.
   It said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,065.7 billion in the same week from $3,065.2 billion the previous
week.
   But the central bank said a broader measure, M3, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $3,900.0 billion from $3,902.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates as well as
trends in the broader money measures, M2 and M3.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $173 million in
the week ended Dec. 28, compared with a gain of $720.0 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings, excluding
extended credit, averaged $1.372 billion a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $438 million the previous week.
   The latest week's average was the highest since the week ended
Jan. 6, 1988 when borrowings averaged $2.46 billion a day.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $285.0 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$284.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. said Thursday it had fired
five executives and disciplined 12 others for their roles in a
Pentagon fraud scandal that has cost the suspended defense
contractor more than $127 million.
   The Rockford-based manufacturer of aircraft-control systems also
said it had taken administrative action to ensure that it would
never rehire the five fired employees or five other former
executives who had previously left the company in connection with
charges of overcharging the government on contracts.
   The company refused to say how high up in its management ranks
the disciplinary measures went.
   ``We're not identifying them except to say they represent various
levels of management,'' spokesman Claude Vernam said in a telephone
interview.
   Sundstrand, the largest employer in Illinois' second-largest
city, said in a statement that the disciplinary measures were
``unpleasant'' but necessary.
   ``Sundstrand is determined to conduct its defense-contracting
business with integrity and unwavering dedication to complying with
the laws, regulations, practices and policies that are expected of
us as a company by our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees
and communities in which we serve,'' the company said in its
statement.
   In addition to the five who were fired, Sundstrand:
   _Docked the salaries and issued letters of reprimand to four
employees.
   _Froze the salaries and issued letters of reprimand to two
employees.
   _Issued letters of reprimand and ordered special training in
ethics and government-contract compliance for two employees.
   _Ordered similar training for four additional employees.
   Sundstrand pleaded guilty Oct. 12 to overcharging the government
on defense contracts from February 1980 to January 1987 and was
fined a total of $127.3 million.
   The Defense Department later suspended Sundstrand from bidding on
or receiving government contracts. The suspension is to remain in
effect until the Defense Department is satisfied that abuses won't
recur, a process that could take anywhere from a few months to
several years.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas of Chicago said in October that his
office would continue to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by
individuals at Sundstrand, with a report expected within 90 days.
   Valukas said Thursday that the investigation was nearing
completion.
   ``Give or take some slippage, I think we'll resolve this thing
fairly quickly,'' he said.
   Sundstrand said in its statement that it was negotiating with the
government and was ``hopeful of a speedy conclusion leading to the
lifting of (the) suspension.''
   The company also said it was negotiating with the government for
settlement of other penalties that could total nearly $40 million.
   Sundstrand, with a work force of 4,500, has depended on defense
contracts for more than 40 percent of its sales, which totaled $1.4
billion in 1987.

<HEAD>Campeau Turns To Newspaper Ads To Boost Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Robert Campeau, the Canadian who created a U.S.
retail empire by taking over two huge department store chains, took
to some of the nation's biggest newspapers Thursday to boast of his
achievements and promise continued strength.
   But the ads _ headlined ``Nothing Succeeds Like Success'' _
painted a picture of Campeau Corp. that differs from the view
presented by the company's disappointing sales and losses during
1988.
   ``Having met all of our financial obligations in 1988, we project
operating results for 1989 and beyond that are more than adequate to
service all of our remaining obligations,'' Campeau said in the
advertisement, which appeared in such papers as the New York Times,
the Atlanta Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, the Los Angeles Times
and the Wall Street Journal.
   ``Because we have achieved so much in this last year, it has been
difficult for some to track and monitor our progress,'' the ad said.
``But you should know that we have had a truly outstanding 1988.''
   Last year, Campeau defeated R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. in a takeover
battle for Federated Department Stores Inc. Campeau paid $8.8
billion for the company whose divisions included Bloomingdale's,
Filene's, Foley's, Burdine's, Rich's and Lazarus department store
chains and Ralph's grocery stores in California.
   In December 1986, the Canadian company purchased Allied Stores
Corp. for $3.4 billion.
   Analysts have suggested the debt caused by the two purchases
weakened Campeau's operation.
   The ad reported a 36 percent increase in operating earnings for
the third quarter ``despite a retail environment we knew would be
difficult. And we expect strong results in the fourth quarter as
well.''
   Earlier this month, Campeau Corp. reported operating profit of
$437 million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, 1988. However, the
company also said it had a net loss of $14 million, compared to a
net loss of $123 million for the same 1987 period.
   Allied divisions lost $18.3 million in the three months ended
Oct. 29, while the Federated stores lost $35.2 million.
   Thursday's advertisement also boasted of ``resounding'' Christmas
sales season. Separately, Campeau reported a 6 percent increase in
Christmas business.
   That performance was in line with overall estimates for the
retail industry, but below increases reported by other retailers.
For example, Sears, Roebuck and Co. reported Thursday its December
sales rose 8.4 percent. At May Department Stores Co., one of
Campeau's biggest compeititors, sales were up 10 percent.
   The ad hinted at thousands of layoffs at Federated divisions,
saying ``1988 was neither easy nor painless'' and, ``we had to make
some hard decisions and take some difficult actions.'' But it also
promised there would be no more sales of assets from Campeau's
retail holdings.
   During 1988, Campeau trimmed Federated, selling several
department store chains: Foley's, Filene's, Bullock's and I. Magnin.
   Robert Campeau also sold several specialty store chains and
Federated's Gold Circle-Richway discount stores.
   Additionally, 17 of Allied's 24 store units have been sold off in
the two years since Campeau acquired the retailer, leaving a handful
of department store chains.
   The advertisement said the divestitures had brought in $4.1
billion and reduced original debt by $3.4 billion.
   There were reports during the year that a planned sale of
high-yield bonds to help pay for the Federated acquisition was
postponed because of a lackluster response by investors.
   Investors were said to be uncertain about the high-yield bond
market in the wake of RJR Nabisco Inc. and Kraft Inc. takeovers. But
analysts said there also were concerns about Campeau's own
performance.
   Campeau denied the reports, but in late October scaled back to
$750 million a planned $1.15 billion junk bond offering.

<HEAD>CFTC Proposes New Rules for Hybrid Trading Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Thursday proposed new rules designed to make it easier for banks,
investment houses and corporations to raise billions of dollars
through a host of new investment products, such as bonds linked to
the price of oil and bank deposits tied to the exchange rate of the
dollar.
   By a 5-0 vote, the commission, which regulates futures and
commodity options markets, proposed a rule and issued an
interpretative letter removing some kinds of so-called ``hybrid
instruments'' from CFTC regulation.
   Until now, the commission has granted about 15 case-by-case
exceptions for hybrids that are predominantly a security or time
deposit. The interpretative letter and proposed rule set out the
standards for further exemptions from CFTC oversight.
   Commission Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm said the new rules are aimed
at removing the ``regulatory uncertainty'' that has discouraged the
development of new products. However, she said, the rules do not
mean hybrids will go unregulated.
   In the case of securities, the instruments must be regulated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the case of bank
deposits, the issuing institution must be regulated by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. The rules do not provide an exception for
instruments offered by savings institutions.
   ``Today's releases represent an attempt to provide some
stability. ... They reduce regulatory duplications, but they also
eliminate regulatory gaps,'' Ms. Gramm said.
   The interpretative letter takes effect immediately but is subject
to change based on public comments offered in the next 45 days. The
related regulation being proposed will be open for public comment
for the same period and the commission must adopt a final version
before it takes effect.
   Hybrid instruments combine the characteristics of debt securities
such as bonds or bank time deposits with certain characteristics of
futures or commodity options.
   Examples include a bank deposit with its principal indexed to the
exchange rate of the dollar and Japanese yen or a corporate note
with its yield tied to the price of gold or oil. Another kind of
hybrid guarantees a set rate of return over inflation.
   Robert Mackay, the commission's chief of staff, speculated that
many U.S. banks will take advantage of the new rules because
starting Dec. 31 the Federal Reserve will allow them to offer
deposit accounts in foreign currencies.
   He said corporations and financial institutions potentially could
raise billions of dollars with hybrid instruments.
   Robert R. Davis, a CFTC member since 1984, said Thursday's action
``may represent the most significant actions taken by the commission
during my tenure.''

<HEAD>Whirlpool Sells Kitchen Cabinet Business to Private Partnership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. said Thursday it
agreed to sell its kitchen cabinet business for an undisclosed
amount to a partnership made up of Bund Capital in Washington, D.C.,
and John Malaspina of Virginia Beach, Va.
   The transaction, subject to a definitive agreement and to
government approval, is expected to be completed within two months,
said David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Whitwam had announced previously that Whirlpool would sell the
kitchen and bathroom cabinet operation _ Whirlpool Kitchens Inc. _
to devote more resources to its primary appliance business.
   Whirlpool became the world's largest appliance company with the
purchase of a majority share of Dutch electronics giant NV Philips.
The purchase, announced in August and consummated Jan. 2, forms a
joint venture with expected sales of about $2 billion a year,
augmenting Whirlpool net sales that totaled $4.2 billion in 1987.
   Revenues of the kitchen cabinet business were not available
separately, Whirlpool spokeswoman Donna F. McLean said Thursday.
   Whirlpool Kitchens was included in Whirlpool's 1987 annual report
under ``other products and services,'' a category that accounted for
2 percent of the net sales, Ms. McLean said.
   Bund Capital, headed by Malcolm Bund and Bob Putnam, specializes
in acquiring medium-sized building materials and automobile
aftermarket companies. Malespina was previously associated with
Riviera Cabinets and was on the board of the National Kitchen
Cabinet Association for six years.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Failure To Review Joint Venture `Shortsighted'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas Congressman says the Reagan
administration's failure to review a joint petroleum refining and
marketing venture between Texaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia is
``irresponsible and shortsighted.''
   Rep. John Bryant last month asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady to investigate the joint venture, Star Enterprise, on national
security grounds. He and three other Democratic members of Congress
_ Sens. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and Jeff Bingamon of New Mexico
and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts _ contended the acquisition
falls under the law enabling the government to block mergers
involving foreign interests if there is evidence national security
is threatened.
   ``This is a perfect indication of how totally addicted this
administration is to foreign cash and foreign takeovers to maintain
their illusion of an economy that's going in the right direction,''
Bryant said.
   Bryant claimed this week that the Texaco-Saudi deal presented
``legitimate national security'' concerns.
   Texaco Inc. and Saudia Arabia announced Monday that they had
closed the deal, under which Texaco and Saudi Refining Inc. would
refine, distribute and market petroleum products in 23 Eastern and
Gulf Coast States.
   Texaco said last year it expected to receive $812 million for a
50 percent interest in its refining assets and marketing system and
an additional $1 billion in benefits and savings.
   Bryant contends the deal could seriously increase U.S. dependence
on foreign oil, erode the domestic oil industry, and jeopardize
consumers through possible market manipulation.
   An interagency panel chaired by the Treasury Department, the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, declined
recently to review the venture, a Treasury spokesman said Thursday.
   ``The committee decided not to oppose this; the committee decided
not to investigate, that there was no reason to investigate,'' said
the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the
committee had looked at the proposed venture in June and reached the
same conclusion.
   The administration in general favors foreign investment in the
United States, the spokesman said, ``unless there is an overriding
reason _ national security, national interest _ to deny it. We favor
international movement of capital, and that includes into the United
States.''
   The Saudi-Texaco venture would include three refineries, 50
distribution terminals, 1,400 service stations and 10,000 franchised
gasoline stations.
   Bryant said 96 percent of the three refineries' capacity would be
used to refine Saudi crude.
   Bryant said that amounts to Saudi Arabia guaranteeing itself an
outlet for crude oil into the American market, giving the Arab
nation the option of lowering crude prices while earning increased
prices at the gasoline marketing level.
   ``I feel very concerned that it (the deal) is going forward
without any review of the type the statute called for. It is
consistent with administration practices to go along with any kind
of foreign takeover of any kind of American company. It's been their
economic policy,'' Bryant said.
   ``The purpose of the inquiry was to look and see if concerns we
had had some validity. To not even look is irresponsible and
shortsighted,'' he said.

<HEAD>Western Banks Increase Credit to Soviet Bloc, Cut Third World Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western commercial banks expanded
lending to the Soviet bloc and further reduced their exposure in the
debt-ridden Third World during the first half of last year, a survey
showed Thursday.
   Outstanding international claims by banks in 16 advanced
industrial economies that report to the Bank for International
Settlements declined 4 percent in nominal terms to $649.9 billion in
the first semester of 1988, a BIS semi-annual survey said.
   Total claims showed a slight rise of $1.2 billion when adjusted
for currency exchange-rate movements, though the report did not list
an adjusted total figure.
   New credit to centrally-planned East European economies jumped $5
billion when adjusted for currency fluctuations, compared with a
rise of $1 million in the last half of 1987, BIS analysts said.
   The Soviet Union received $4 billion in new loans. Claims on
Bulgaria and East Germany also increased.
   In Latin America, Western banks reduced their adjusted exposure
by $5.7 billion as credits to commercial debtors slumped, the survey
said. Banks cut outstanding claims on Mexico by $2.7 billion and
those on Brazil by $2.2 billion, the report said.
   Among developed countries outside the BIS area, credit to
Australia increased a record $4.3 billion.
   Banks' involvement with South Africa remained virtually unchanged
after outstanding claims were reduced by $100 million during the
period.
   The Basel-based BIS is an international institution also known as
the central bankers' bank. Reporting countries are the United
States, Canada, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, France, Denmark, Finland, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Austria and Spain.

   European officials tentatively agreed
Thursday to slap stiff duties on imports of American dried fruit and
walnuts to retaliate against recent U.S. sanctions against European
products.
   Representatives of the 12-nation European Economic Community left
it to their nations' foreign ministers to formally approve the
measures and set the date for application of the higher tariffs. The
foreign ministers will meet Jan. 23 in Brussels.
   ``The hammer is raised, but it won't actually fall until the
ministers decide, (giving) time for the Americans to show a little
understanding,'' said an official of a member nation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Formal approval of the sanctions would escalate a trade dispute
between the United States and the Common Market trading bloc, which
was touched off Sunday by a European ban on imports of American meat
treated with growth hormones.
   The United States retaliated against the meat ban by imposing,
also on Sunday, higher tariffs on a variety of European products.
   Alan Holmer, deputy U.S. trade representative, said in a
satellite broadcast from Washington that ``it's presidential
decision'' whether the United States would take further retaliatory
measures against any European sanctions.
   ``There would be very strong support in the U.S. government for
taking that kind of action if we were to reach that point,'' he told
foreign journalists in a program sponsored by the U.S. government.
   ``But frankly we hope we won't have to reach that point and that
the (EEC) will not take any kind of counter-retaliatory steps in the
next several weeks,'' he said.
   The European officials also tentatively decided to allow meat
shipped from the United States before Sunday to enter the Common
Market until the end of the month. Officials said it was hoped that
the United States would allow a similar grace period for sanctioned
products from Europe.
   Under the tentative plan, the EEC would impose 100 percent
tariffs on dried fruit and unshelled walnuts imported from the
United States. An earlier list had included honey and canned corn.
   Total EEC imports of walnuts, mostly to Germany, averaged $58.8
million annually over the 1985-87 period, he said. Dried fruit
imports, mainly to Germany and Italy, registered an annual average
of $37.8 million during that period. Dried fruit products include
apples, pears, apricots, peaches, prunes and papayas.
   The trans-Atlantic conflict was set off by the EEC enforcement of
the ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.
The trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat from
such animals.
   The ban is expected to halt the importation of about $100 million
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States, some of
which are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet food is
exempted.
   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten
cattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose a
health risk.
   ``The (community) has failed to present any evidence that a
proper application of the growth-producing hormones in question pose
any threat to human or to animal health,'' Holmer said.
   ``We as yet have seen no scientific evidence whatsoever to
support the (EEC) hormone ban and as a result we feel it necessary
to protect U.S. trade interests,'' he said.
   The meat ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the
trading bloc agreed to delay it for a year. It has since refused
American appeals for yet another postponement.
   The meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated $166
billion in trade between the United States and the Common Market.
   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States on Sunday
imposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef, pork hams and
shoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee, fermented
alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol by
volume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food made
from grains. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.
   The Common Market has filed a complaint with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to protest the U.S. sanctions. The
96-nation GATT is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring the
free movement off goods around the world. The complaint was filed in
November before the sanctions went into effect.
   Holmer reiterated that the United States would like the Common
Market to turn the dispute over to a special GATT panel for
resolution but that it has so far refused to do so.
   The Canadian government also has not gone along with the meat
ban. Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina have agreed to
ship meat from untreated cattle to Europe.
   EEC members are France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the
United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Sales Up 20.7 Percent in Late December, 7.5 Percent for the Year</HEAD>

   Booming year-end car and truck sales at General
Motors Corp. and a jump in car sales at Ford Motor Co. contributed
to overall increases in domestic sales in 1988, the auto companies
said Thursday.
   Manufacturers said sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks
averaged 44,477 a day in the Dec. 21-31 period. That represents a
20.7 percent increase from the same late December period in 1987.
   For the year, domestic car and light-truck sales reached 11.7
million, averaging 38,060 a day in 1988, up 7.5 percent from 1987
when 10.9 million were sold, or an average of 35,408 a day.
   Imported car and light truck sales in 1988 slumped to 3.7
million, an average of 12,087 a day, compared with 4.1 million, or
13,229 a day.
   High employment and low inflation helped keep boost overall
sales, said Jeanette Garretty, auto analyst with the Bank of America
in San Francisco.
   ``It's been a good year for the economy,'' Garretty said.
   Combined domestic and foreign car and light truck sales totaled
15.4 million in 1988, up from 14.9 million in 1987 and approaching
the 15.7 million of 1985, the second-best sales year ever. The
record year was 1986, when 16.3 million vehicles were sold.
   Industry analysts believe 1988 will move into second place after
sales figures for heavy trucks and medium-duty imported trucks
become available in several weeks, said Ray Windecker, a veteran
Ford Motor Co. analyst.
   In previous years, sales of those trucks have approached the
300,000 mark, and Windecker said that when the overall figures for
1988 are tallied, sales will have surpassed those in 1985.
   Between Dec. 21-31, GM sold an average of 14,656 cars a day, an
increase of 42.2 percent over the same period last year. Ford said
it sold an average of 8,781 cars a day for the period, a 26.4
percent increase.
   But Chrysler Corp. reported selling 3,497 cars a day, slipping
1.7 percent from late December of 1987.
   For the year, GM said it sold 3.64 million cars, an average of
11,823 a day, up 2.1 percent from 3.55 million, an 11,581-a-day
average, in 1987.
   Ford said it sold 2.2 million cars, or 7,160 a day, in 1988, up
8.8 percent on a dalily sales basis from 1987 when it sold 2.0
million, or 6,579 a day.
   Chrysler's 1988 car sales of 1.1 million, or 3,450 a day, were up
10.1 percent from 962,057, or 3,133 a day, in 1987, the company said.
   GM said it set a light-truck sales record for the year,
delivering 1.7 million trucks, an average of 5,651 a day, for a 12.6
percent increase over 1987.
   Ford sold 1.5 million trucks, averaging 4,747 a day, up 4.2
percent, and Chrysler reported sales of 955,619 light trucks, a
daily average of 3,102, for a 14.6 percent increase.
   Among Japanese carmakers, Toyota sales increased in 1988 to
616,529 from 583,809 in 1987.
   Honda saw 1988 import sales drop to 393,360 from 421,688 the
previous year, but sales of its U.S.-made cars jumped to 375,625
from 316,618 in 1987.
   The top-selling European manufacturer was Volkswagen, though its
sales of 168,800 cars were down from 191,705 the year before,
followed by Volvo, which saw sales drop to 97,848 for the year from
105,087 in 1987.

<HEAD>RKO General Sells KRTH AM and FM in Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   The parent of RKO General announced Thursday
it would sell Los Angeles radio stations KRTH-AM and FM, the latest
step in the FCC-ordered dismantling of the RKO network.
   Beasley Broadcast Group of Goldsboro, N.C., will pay $86.6
million for the stations, which play rock oldies.
   In keeping with a settlement between the Federal Communications
Commission and RKO's parent, GenCorp of Fairlawn, Ohio, the seller
gets to keep just $56.2 million, or 65 percent of the purchase price.
   The balance, $30.4 million, will be divided among six companies
that challenged RKO's and GenCorp's fitness to hold the KRTH
broadcast licenses.
   In the settlement, which ended a 23-year wrangle before the FCC,
GenCorp didn't admit wrongdoing, but agreed to sell 12 radio
stations and one television station, splitting the proceeds from
each sale with those who challenged that particular license.
   The dispute began in 1965, when a challenger disputed RKO's right
to operate KHJ-TV in Los Angeles, citing billing irregularities and
questioning the corporate character of GenCorp, the former General
Tire &amp; Rubber Co.
   In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of one television license, the
FCC noted that GenCorp, the former General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., had
been accused of improper domestic political contributions and of
bribery overseas.
   GenCorp, which makes aerospace and automotive products and
plastics, has approval for the KRTH deal from Beasley Broadcast and
the various challengers, but the transaction must be OK'd by the FCC.
   Beasley has radio stations in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami and
elsewhere.
   When the sale was announced late Thursday, Beasley officials
weren't available to say if they planned to change the station's
management or format.
   GenCorp sold KHJ-TV to The Walt Disney Co. in December, with
license challenger Fidelity Television Inc. getting 32 percent of
the $320 million purchase price.
   Similar sale agreements have been approved for RKO's WHBQ-AM in
Memphis, Tenn.; WGMS-AM in Bethesda, Md.; WGMS-FM in Washington,
D.C., and WRKO-AM and WROR-FM in Boston. The company is seeking
buyers for WOR-AM and WRKS-FM in New York City; KFRC-AM in San
Francisco; WAXY-FM in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; WFYR-FM in Chicago and
WHBQ-TV in Memphis.

<HEAD>Nintendo Sues Atari Games And Its Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home video game giant Nintendo of America
Inc. on Thursday sued Atari Games Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Tengen Inc., accusing the two companies of violating a
licensing agreement.
   The actions follow a lawsuit filed in mid-December by Atari Games
that alleged Nintendo was violating anti-monopoly laws. That suit,
which sought $100 million in damages, said Nintendo was limiting the
number of games it manufactures under licensing agreements with
software developers and preventing them from making the games
independently.
   Nintendo, which is based in this Seattle suburb and controls 80
percent of the U.S. market for home video game machines, said
Thursday it had terminated its licensing agreement with Tengen,
under which Tengen had developed and marketed video games to be run
on the popular Nintendo Entertainment System.
   Atari Games, of Milpitas, Calif., was founded in 1985 as a
privately held company and is not affiliated with Atari Inc. of
Sunnyvale, Calif., the publicly held computer manufacturer.
   Atari Games spokesman David Ellis said Tengen produces home
versions of Atari Games arcade games, including Pac-Man and RBI
Baseball.
   Nintendo's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, accuses Tengen of breach of contract, violation of
federal and state trademark laws, and unfair competition. It also
alleges Atari Games conspired with and aided Tengen's violations of
Nintendo's rights, interfered with Nintendo's license with Tengen,
and engaged in activities that violate the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organization Act.
   Tengen recently announced it would independently manufacture and
distribute certain games for the Nintendo system that previously
were produced under license from Nintendo.
   Ellis said the legal staff of Atari Games was reviewing the
lawsuit and that it would be premature to comment on its specifics.
   However, he said, ``As far as we know, we have not breached any
agreements whatsoever.''
   By terminating its agreement with Tengen, Nintendo said Tengen
will no longer receive marketing benefits available to Nintendo
licensees, including promotion in Nintendo publications, nationwide
merchandising services, and game play advice and support from
Nintendo's telephone game counselors.
   Ellis said Tengen games are sold in 12,000 retail outlets
nationwide and that the company has its own game support staff.
   Nintendo also said it would ``vigorously defend'' itself against
Atari Games' suit.
   Atari Games alleged in its suit that it had lost between $30
million and $35 million because it was required to rely on Nintendo
for manufacturing its games and was limited in the number of game
cartridges it could sell. The company said Nintendo equipped its
machines with a computer chip that works only with video game
cartridges with a compatible chip.
   Howard Lincoln, Nintendo's senior vice president, said Nintendo
and all of its licensees have been suffering from a worldwide
computer chip shortage, which has required Nintendo to allocate
chips among all its licensees, including Tengen.
   Nintendo of America, which had an estimated $1.7 billion in sales
in 1988, more than double its 1987 sales of $800 million, is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan.
   Ellis said Tengen had sales of about $35 million in 1988, while
sales for the privately held Atari Games were not available.
