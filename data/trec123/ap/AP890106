   Convicted torture-murderer Gary Heidnik has
regained consciousness after apparently attempting suicide in his
prison cell with a drug overdose, prison officials said.
   Heidnik's condition was upgraded to fair Thursday, but he
remained under tight security in the intensive care unit of West
Penn Hospital, said Tom Seiverling, a spokesman for the State
Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh.
   Heidnik, 45, was semi-comatose earlier this week after being
found unconscious in his cell Sunday. Prison officials believe
Heidnik stored up medications that were prescribed for him by
pretending to take them at the designated times.
   The self-proclaimed minister faces the death sentence for the
slayings of two of six women he kept chained in the basement of his
Philadelphia row house. He was convicted and sentenced last July.

   Going out to buy a puppy, Cecilia Kaler
placed her three-year-old son in a child seat, left the car running
and got out to clear snow from the windshield. She never finished
the job.
   As soon as his mother closed the door, little Michael Kaler
locked it, put the car in drive, and rode away Wednesday. The car
went down the driveway, across a busy road, narrowly missed a tree
and fire hydrant, rolled on its side down an embankment and finally
came to rest in a creek.
   Michael was wet, cold and otherwise unharmed, said Kaler, a
resident of this community 15 miles southeast of Syracuse.
   A nearby man heard Kaler screaming and rushed over. He smashed a
window and freed little Michael.
   ``Anybody who says there's no God doesn't know what they're
talking about, because someone certainly was looking out for him,''
Kaler said Thursday.

   Afghan resistance leaders talk as
though they are on the threshold of victory: Soviet troops are ready
to leave Afghanistan, and the Kremlin's client regime in Kabul is
tottering.
   But the Afghan guerrillas are as paralyzed politically as they
were a decade ago when they started fighting their country's
Soviet-backed totalitarian government.
   Unable to put aside internal rivalries, the guerrillas have yet
to come up with a coherent plan for the future as the Soviet Union
tries to negotiate with them in a last-minute show of seeking a
political solution to a messy war.
   It is a David-and-Goliath image: The communist superpower, unable
to vanquish ragged bands of mountain men with its missiles and
warplanes, dispatches one of its sharpest negotiators _ Yuli
Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister and ambassador to Kabul _
to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan to meet the insurgents.
   The fractious alliance of seven Pakistan-based guerrilla groups
does not even agree on whether its leaders should be meeting
Vorontsov, let alone how to govern Afghanistan _ if it should get
the chance.
   Time is running out. The Soviet withdrawal, according to a
U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in Geneva last April, is supposed to
be completed by Feb. 15.
   The new chairman of the seven-party alliance, Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi, leader of the Afghan National Liberation Front, seems to
epitomize this uncertainty.
   Soft-spoken and genteel, the bespectacled, gray-bearded former
Islamic theology professor readily acknowledges he cannot speak for
all six other leaders in the alliance.
   ``Mostly, we try our best,'' he said in an interview a few hours
before heading to Islamabad, where Vorontsov has been meeting
Foreign Ministry officials of Pakistan, one of the chief champions
of the guerrillas. The insurgents also have been armed by the United
States, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations.
   What, then, is the point of talking to Vorontsov, whose country
already has accepted the principle of a broad-based Afghan
government to supplant the one headed by its old protegy, President
Najib?
   ``If we refuse and reject negotiations with the Russians, we will
be blamed by the world,'' Mojaddidi said. ``For 10 years we have
been asking for this ... It is a great success, whether we get a
result or not.''
   Mojaddidi said the insurgents should propose only one or two
leaders _ a president, a prime minister or both _ to take over from
Najib, former head of the feared and loathed KHAD, the Afghan secret
police force modeled after the Soviet KGB.
   Other guerrilla leaders favor selecting an entire Cabinet or
calling parliamentary elections _ a monumental task in a nation
where war, snow and mountains have rendered vast regions all but
inaccessible.
   Adding to the logistical problem is the fact that one-third of
the 15 million Afghans have fled as refugees to other countries.
About 3 million are in Pakistan. Another 2 million are in Iran,
where eight more guerrilla groups operate independently from the
those in Pakistan.
   Relatively moderate leaders favor calling ex-King Zahir Shah home
from exile in Italy to serve as a symbolic head of government. The
most fervent Islamic fundamentalists reject any role for the king in
post-Soviet Afghanistan.
   ``The people are completely fed up with the (guerrilla)
leadership,'' said an Afghan analyst who monitors events in
Afghanistan and Peshawar, the town 20 miles from the Afghan border
where the seven parties maintain seven separate headquarters.
   ``What is going to happen? Are they going to fight each other?
It's a serious possibility,'' the analyst said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Asked whether the alliance would break up, he said: ``There is no
alliance. How is it going to break up? There are seven parties,
seven political departments, seven military departments, seven
financial departments.
   ``They decide between themselves to have a spokesman, and then
every other leader makes public statements completely against the
alliance,'' he said.
   Mojaddidi took over as the alliance's chairman and spokesman on
Jan. 1, succeeding Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the first talks with
Vorontsov a month ago in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   Rabbani, head of the Jamiat-e-Islami, relinquished the
chairmanship after three months in keeping with the alliance's
tradition of a revolving leadership.
   Mojaddidi, Ahmed Gailani, leader of the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, leader of
Harakat-e-Inqilab-e-Islami, are the comparative moderates in the
alliance. All three have suggested bringing back the king as a sort
of living flag to unite the people long enough to choose a
government.
   The other four groups in the alliance espouse a more
fundamentalist form of Islam than that advocated by Mojaddidi,
Gailani and Mohammadi.
   The most intransigent opponents of monarchy are Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar of Hezb-e-Islami and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf of the
Ittehad-e-Islami.
   The other two leaders, Younus Khalis and Rabbani, also have
opposed the return of the king, but they have toned down the
vehemence of their earlier rejections. Khalis' group, like
Hekmatyar's, is named Hezb-e-Islami.

<HEAD>Fears Of Legionnaires' Disease Close School For Second Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school canceled classes for a
second day Thursday after a custodian was diagnosed with
Legionnaires' disease and another custodian began showing symptoms
of the disease.
   Test results to determine if the second custodian at Hunterdon
Central Regional High School has the disease should be available in
about five days, said Marilyn Riley, state Health Department
spokeswoman.
   The bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease is transmitted
through the air from vaporized water, Ms. Riley said. Health
officials inspected the building Thursday for bacteria sources.
Samples of water will be taken Friday and Sunday from the school,
she said.
   ``Our feeling is, if we're going to have to run a disrupted
school day because of the testing, we may as well take one more day
off,'' said district spokesman Willard Richard. ``We're also
concerned about any possible health hazard. We don't want to be
taking chances.''
   A 33-year-old male custodian, who officials have declined to
identify, was diagnosed with Legionnaires' in December. He was
responding to treatment at Warren Hospital in Phillipsburg and was
expected to be released soon, Ms. Riley said. He was admitted to the
hospital Dec. 18.
   A 44-year-old custodian at the school became sick Jan. 2 with
pneumonia and a high fever. He also was responding to therapy and
doing well in Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, she said.
   Legionnaires' disease is fatal about in 15 percent to 20 percent
of confirmed cases, said Robert Breiman, a medical epidemiologist at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. It is usually
successfully treated with antibiotics.
   The source of Legionnaires' disease would be easier to find if
the second custodian has the disease, but it would not confirm that
the bacteria was at the school because the men could have been in a
common place other than the school when they contracted the
bacteria, Breiman said.
   If only the one case is confirmed, it will be harder to determine
its source, he said.
   About 1,850 students from Flemington, Readington, Delaware,
Raritan and East Amwell townships attend the school.
   People under 20 years old usually are not affected by the
bacteria, called legionella pneumophila, Breiman said. It most
commonly strikes elderly people and those whose immune systems are
weakened, he said.
   Legionnaires' disease was named from an outbreak at the
Pennsylvania American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford
Hotel in Philadelphia in July 1976. Thirty-four people _ 29
Legionnaires or family members and five other people who had been
near the hotel _ eventually died of the disease.
   About 800 to 1,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported to
the center each year, Breiman said. There is no vaccine, he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Shows Film Of Dogfight To Support Claim of Justification</HEAD>

   The Pentagon has released photographs and a
dramatic audio tape of the U.S.-Libyan dogfight over the
Mediterranean that it says prove its pilots were provoked and acted
reasonably in downing the Libyan planes.
   The photographs, although of poor quality, show at least one of
the two Libyan MiG-23 fighters carried missiles. The Libyan
government has claimed both its planes were unarmed.
   The cockpit audio tape clearly records the pilot of the lead U.S.
Navy F-14 Tomcat citing each of five attempts to maneuver away from
the approaching Libyan jets, then, along with a second F-14,
shooting down the MiG-23s.
   Libya has asserted that the incident Wednesday was connected to
growing American complaints that a Libyan chemicals plant is being
readied for full-scale production of poison gas. President Reagan
has said he would not rule out a military strike against the plant,
which Libya claims is merely a medicine factory.
   The Pentagon said there was no link between the factory dispute
and the air battle, which it said began while the Navy Tomcats were
flying a routine protective patrol for the aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy well off the Libyan coast.
   In Paris on Thursday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz hinted
that Reagan may be willing to work out a deal with Libya that would
not require destruction of the plant.
   Before arriving in Paris for an international conference on
chemical weapons where the U.S.-Libyan dispute will take center
stage, Shultz acknowledged even some of America's allies are not
convinced the plant is a weapons facility.
   In his first public comments on Wednesday's air battle with
Libya, Reagan on Thursday said the American pilots had done the
right thing in firing their missiles.
   ``Our pilots acted completely in self-defense,'' Reagan said as
he boarded Air Force One in Los Angeles, where he ended two weeks of
vacation.
   The audio tape released Thursday by the Pentagon indicated that
early in the confrontation the American aviators became concerned
about the Libyan's intent.
   After carrying out his fifth maneuver to evade the Libyan jets,
the pilot of the lead F-14 says: ``Bogies have jinked back at me
again for the fifth time. They're on my nose now, inside of 20
miles.''
   At this point, the lead aircraft commander decides to defend
himself.
   ``Master Arm On,'' he says. ``Master Arm On. Centering Up the T.
Bogies have jinked back into me again. Sixteen miles. Centering the
Dot.''
   The phrases ``centering up the T'' and ``centering the dot''
refer to the use of a cockpit steering cue to ensure an optimum
missile launch position. When ready, the pilot calls out ``Fox 1''
as the code for firing a Sparrow missile.
   ``Fourteen miles. Fox 1. Fox 1.''
   ``Aw, Jesus,'' responds the backseat radar weapons officer.
   ``Ten miles. He's back on my nose. Fox 1 again,'' the pilot calls
out.
   The release of the photo and audio tapes came as State Department
sources disclosed the United States had sent a ``straightforward
message'' to Libya ``through diplomatic channels to let them know
our point of view'' on dogfight.
   One State Department official, who declined to be identified,
said the message contained the same type of information released by
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, explaining why the United
States considered the action justified self defense.
   No response from the Libyans has been received, the official
added.
   At the United Nations, meantime, the United States offered the
same message to the Security Council, saying the U.S. planes fired
on the Libyan aircraft in reaction to hostile actions that
``constituted an armed attack'' on American forces.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun made the statement in a letter to
the 15-member council, which held private consultations on Libya's
protest of the incident. But Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser
called the incident a ``premeditated act of aggression'' and said
the Libyan fighters were ``unarmed, on routine reconnaissance,
ordinary flying.''
   In releasing the video tape, chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard
declared Thursday: ``It tells me that the Libyan ambassador to the
U.N. is a liar. That's the first thing it tells me.
   ``They were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile
intent.''
   The audio tape paints the drama of the melee, complete with the
heavy breathing that comes from maneuvering a high-speed fighter in
tight turns and indications of how hard it is to maneuver behind a
MiG to get a ``tone'' and get off a clear shot with a missile.
   After a second attempt to maneuver away from the MiG's, the F-14s
go to a ``Warning Yellow, Weapons Hold'' status.
   That is an intermediate stage in the process of preparing to fire
in self defense.
   Later, after the lead F-14 had fired a second Sparrow missile the
two Libyan fighters came into view. The second F-14 then fires a
Sparrow and the weapons officer in the lead F-14 reports to his
pilot, ``Okay, he's got a missile off.''
   At this point, it becomes almost impossible to determine who is
talking, but the tape continues:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Good hit. Good hit on 1.''
   ``Roger that. Good kill. Good kill.''
   ``I've got the other one.''
   ``Select Fox 2. Select Fox 2.''
   Fox 2 is the code for a heat-seeking Sidewinder missile.
   ``All right, Fox 2.''
   ``Those f------ ...''
   ``Shoot him.''
   ``I don't got a tone.''
   ``Lock him up. Lock him up.''
   ``Shoot him. Fox 2.''
   ``I can't. I don't have a f------ tone.''
   At this point, the lead F-14 finally succeeds in manuevering
behind the MiG and gets his missile tone, firing the Sidewinder.
   ``Good kill. Good kill.''
   ``We're showing two good chutes in the air here.''
   Then in a report back to the carrier: ``Roger. Two Floggers. Two
Floggers splashed. We're heading north.''

   Oliver L. North will face 12 other charges once
the judge in the Iran-Contra case grants a prosecution motion to
dismiss the two major charges against the former National Security
Council aide.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is asking U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to dismiss charges of conspiracy to defraud
the government and theft of government property stemming from the
diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   According to legal experts, Gesell has little discretion in the
matter, meaning in all likelihood the charges will be dismissed.
   Walsh wants the charges dismissed ``without prejudice,'' meaning
he would be free to bring the counts again if the national security
problems would be worked out. But Gesell scheduled a hearing for
Monday to hear defense arguments. The defense is expected to argue
the charges should be dismissed forever.
   The remaining charges and the penalties against North are as
follows:
   Obstruction of Congress in Sept. and Oct. 1985, five-year
imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   False statements to Congress on Sept. 5, 1985, five-year
imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   False statements to Congress by North on Sept. 12, 1985,
five-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   False statements by North to Congress on Oct. 7, 1985, five-year
imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   Obstruction of Congress in Aug. 1986, five-year imprisonment and
$250,000 fine.
   Obstruction of Congress in Nov. 1986, five-year imprisonment and
$250,000 fine.
   Obstruction of a presidential inquiry in Nov. 1986, five-year
imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   False statements on Nov. 23, 1986, five-year imprisonment,
$250,000 fine.
   Destroying or falsifying government documents, three-year
imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   Receipt of an illegal gratuity, the installation of a security
fence around his suburban Virginia home, two-year imprisonment and
$250,000 fine.
   Conversion of traveler's checks to personal use, 10-year
imprisonment, $250,000 fine.
   Conspiracy to defraud the Treasury and the Internal Revenue
Service, five-year imprisonment, $250,000 fine.
   A wire fraud charge stemming from the diversion and a charge that
North created false documents to obstruct the investigation of the
security fence were dismissed last year on other legal grounds.

   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard gave this
second-by-second chronology Thursday of the incident in which two
U.S. Navy jets shot down two Libyan MiG-23 fighters over the
Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday.
   All times are local time, which is seven hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time.
   11:55 a.m. _ A U.S. E-2 electronic surveillance plane reported
spotting two MiG-23 Floggers airborne from Al Bumbah, passing from
land over the sea.
   11:57 a.m. _ The Navy F-14s report radar contact with the MiGs at
a range of 72 nautical miles and an altitude of 10,000 feet, moving
to 8,000 feet, and traveling at a speed of 430 knots.
   11:57 a.m. _ The MiGs are reported on a bearing of 180 degrees at
a range of 61 nautical miles, on a course of 330, northeast, at
8,000 feet; the bearing, 180 degrees from the F-14s, or straight at
them.
   11:58 a.m., 17 seconds _ The F-14s turn left 20 degrees at 20,000
feet in order to avoid the approaching MiGs. ``This is the first
avoidance maneuver,'' Howard said.
   11:58 a.m. and 24 seconds _ The MiGs turn right, descend to 5,000
feet, still at 430 knots. ``This is their first turn toward the
F-14s,'' Howard said.
   11:58 and 43 seconds _ The F-14s descend to 3,000 feet. The MiGs
are now at 53 nautical miles, coming head on. The F-14s turn left to
course 140 in the second avoidance maneuver.
   11:59 a.m. _ The MiGs are at 49 nautical miles.
   11:59 a.m. and 16 seconds _ The MiGs change course to 340 and
increase speed to 500 knots to come back into head-on position
toward the F-14s.
   11:59 a.m. and 26 seconds _ The F-14s accelerate and turn right
in their third avoidance maneuver.
   11:59 a.m. and 38 seconds _ The commander of the F-14 patrol
takes the first step in preparing his weapons for firing.
   11:59 and 49 seconds _ The MiGs are at 35 nautical miles and they
turn again directly toward the F-14s, for the third time, and the
MiGs are at an altitude of about 7,000 feet.
   Noon and eight seconds _ The F-14s turned right to 210 degrees in
their fourth maneuver to avoid the MiGs.
   Noon and 15 seconds _ The number two F-14 aircraft reports that
its weapon-firing radar has a fix on the second MiG.
   Noon and 20 seconds _ The MiGs turn into a head-on position for
the fourth time.
   Noon and 26 seconds _ The F-14s turn left in their fifth
avoidance maneuver.
   Noon and 53 seconds _ The MiGs turn back into the F-14s for the
fifth time.
   Noon and 57 seconds, the lead F-14 reports that a MiG is again on
a collision course, and the airborne warfare officer, assisting the
pilot on the two-man plane, prepares the weapons for immediate
firing.
   12:01 p..m. and 20 seconds, the first Sparrow missile is fired by
the lead F-14 at a MiG at a distance of 12 nautical miles. The MiGs
are now traveling at 550 knots and accelerating.
   12:01 p.m. and 32 seconds _ The second Sparrow missile is fired
at 10 nautical miles. The second F-14 reports the MiGs in sight at
five to six nautical miles.
   12:01 p.m. and 45 seconds _ The MiGs turn sharply toward the
second F-14.
   12:01 p.m. and 53 seconds _ The second F-14 visually identifies
the two MiG-23s at five nautical miles.
   12:01 p.m. and 57 seconds _ The second F-14 fires a Sparrow
missile at the No. 2 MiG.
   12:02 p.m. and six seconds _ The second F-14 breaks away to the
right and reports a good hit on the second MiG.
   12:02 p.m. and 36 seconds _ The lead F-14 fires a Sidewinder
missile at the lead MiG. The pilot of the lead F-14, the commander,
reports sighting both of the hits, sighting the ejection seats
firing on both of the MiGs and reports two seeing two parachutes
coming down.
   12:03 p.m. and two seconds _ Both F-14s turned north back towards
the carrier.

   The American F-14s that shot down two Libyan
MiG-23 fighters were operating under guidelines that say U.S. forces
can open fire only when threatened, administration officials said.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, discussing the incident with
reporters Wednesday, said the F-14s from the aircraft carrier USS
John F. Kennedy, fired in self-defense and were operating under
``normal peacetime rules of engagement.''
   Such rules are never publicly disclosed, except in general terms.
   They were the subject of controversy after an Iraqi jet fired at
the USS Stark in the Persian Gulf May 17, 1987, killing 37 U.S.
sailors, and after the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian commerical
airliner last July 3, killing 290 passengers and crewmembers.
   For forces in the Persian Gulf, the rules were tightened after
the Stark incident to give commanders in the field ``more freedom to
exercise command authority'' and decide when to fire, said Lt. Jim
Wood, a Navy spokesman.
   But the ships and planes accompanying the Kennedy were operating
under more or less the same rules as they would have been before the
Stark or Vincennes incident, said Wood.
   ``There is a basic premise that the officer in charge must defend
his ship at all cost,'' Wood said.
   ``In wartime, that means that anything not identified as a friend
is an enemy. In peacetime, anything that is not identified as an
enemy is a friend,'' he said. ``The peacetime rules of engagement
enable our forces to adequately defend themselves when there is
danger of hostility.''
   The judgment of when to fire, he said, is left ``to the judgment
of the on-scene commanders,'' in this case the pilot of the lead
F-14 on the patrol.
   ``If you are a pilot leading a flight of aircraft and felt there
was imminent danger of being attacked, you don't need to wait to be
fired on,'' said Wood.
   Although the decision to fire rests on the unit commander, the
rules themselves ``are approved at the highest level,'' said Wood.
   ``The president ultimately approves them, as he made the change
for the Persian Gulf after the Stark incident. They are usually made
at the recommendation of the fleet commanders,'' he said.
   Additionally, if unit commanders perceive themselves under
greater danger, they may order their weapons kept at the ready
without a change in the rules of engagement, he said.
   Navy ``officers are briefed thoroughly prior to any deployment
overseas,'' he said. Additionally descriptions of the situation in
specific regions ``are frequently written in classified publications
that all officers have access to.''
   Those guidelines ``are dynamic and vary depending on geography.
The rules governing ships off the coast of Libya are a lot tighter,
for example, than those off the coast of Spain, where there is less
perceived danger,'' he said.
   For forces operating near Libya, he said, ``given the ever
present possibility that foreign aircraft or other combatants were
present, there would be weekly if not daily review of the rules of
engagement.''
   Wood said that the pilots and officers aboard the Kennedy
``definitely would have been tested in a written manner prior to
their departure from Norfolk,'' their home base in Virginia last
August.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: North May Lose Key Weapon In Iran-Contra Defense</HEAD>

   A powerful weapon in Oliver L. North's defense
arsenal may be silenced by the prosecution's decision to drop the
two central charges against him in the Iran-Contra case.
   The ex-Marine's continued demand to include national secrets in
the case was delaying the trial while independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh fought a rear-guard action with intelligence agencies over
the release of classified information demanded by the court.
   Faced with the Reagan administration's refusal to allow more
disclosures of secret information in his own evidence, Walsh
streamlined the case Thursday by asking the court to dismiss the two
charges most laden with national security problems.
   If as expected U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell grants
Walsh's motion, the prosecutor will surrender the most politically
explosive charges, which allege a criminal conspiracy to divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar at Harvard
University Law School, who has done some legal work for Walsh, says
what's left is a ``lean and mean'' set of allegations that North
shredded documents, lied to Congress and obstructed a presidential
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh can ``proceed without the cloud of national security''
hanging over the remaining charges against the former National
Security Council aide, Tribe said.
   The move may also defuse the difficult legal issue raised by
North's issuance of subpoenas for President Reagan and
President-elect Bush to testify in court.
   That question, unresolved by the courts, could have delayed the
trial for months while White House lawyers fought the summonses all
the way to the Supreme Court.
   Without charges he conspired to corrupt Reagan's legitimate
effort to sell arms to free American hostages, North will have a
harder time justifying the need to subpoena Reagan and Bush.
   ``When those issues are removed, both the need for presidential
testimony and the need for the great bulk of the documents that
allegedly might compromise national security are radically
reduced,'' Tribe said.
   North can no longer claim that he thought he was acting with
presidential authority when he secretly helped finance the
Nicaraguan rebel cause with money from the arms-for-hostages deals.
   Therefore he has no need to use classified documents to support a
contention that his modus operandi in other, authorized, covert
operations was no different from the role he played overseeing the
secret arms network for the Contras.
   It is unlikely Gesell would let North claim he thought he was
acting with presidential authority when he shredded National
Security Council documents and lied to Attorney General Edwin Meese
III during the November 1986 presidential investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The 12 remaining charges are all felonies that carry penalties
ranging from two to 10 years imprisonment and fines up to $250,000.
   ``It's a sad day when we think charges of lying to Congress,
obstructing (a presidential inquiry)... and destroying documents are
somehow relatively unimportant,'' Tribe said. ``In the broader
scheme of things those charges should be taken very seriously.''
   Some of those charges may still pose some secrecy problems for
Walsh, and he may have to jettison a few other counts of the
indictment. But it greatly increases the likelihood that the case
will go to trial in the near future.
   Tribe said it also reduced the possibility that Reagan would
reverse his oft-stated position and issue a pardon. ``The need to
use a pardon as a means of preserving the alleged confidentiality of
executive information is a greatly reduced one.''
   Another Harvard University law professor, Alan Dershowitz, said
he thought dismissal of the two major charges against the retired
Marine colonel will ``make it a lot easier... for North to defend
himself at trial.''
   ``He won this battle,'' Dershowitz said. ``It remains to be seen
whether he's gonna win the war.''

   MARCH 7 _ Cable News Network correspondent Jeremy Levin is
kidnapped in Beirut. Levin, freed 11 months later, is first of 15
American hostages, of whom eight remain captive. Five were either
freed or escaped. University librarian Peter Kilburn and CIA Beirut
station chief William Buckley were murdered.
   SUMMER _ Iranian purchasing agents put out call for weapons,
including TOW anti-tank missiles. By November, Iranians are
suggesting link between weapons sales and release of U.S. hostages.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1985</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   JULY _ Israeli official suggests dealing with Iran to U.S.
national security adviser Robert McFarlane and says transfer of arms
could lead to release of hostages. McFarlane takes the message to
President Reagan.
   AUG. 30 _ First planeload of U.S.-made weapons is sent from
Israel to Tehran. McFarlane and Donald Regan, White House chief of
staff, later disagree on whether Reagan approved shipment. Reagan
says he does not remember.

   SEPT. 15 _ American hostage Rev. Benjamin Weir is released.
   DEC. 4 _ McFarlane resigns as national security adviser and is
succeeded by Rear Adm. John Poindexter.
   DEC. 5 _ Reagan signs finding describing operation with Iran as
strictly an arms-for-hostages deal. Poindexter later testifies that
on Nov. 21, 1986, he tore up only copy of finding that bore the
president's signature.
   DEC. 5 _ In discussions with Israeli officials about Iran arms
shipments, national security aide Lt Col. Oliver North mentions
plans to use Iranian weapons sales to generate profits that could be
used to support Nicaragua's U.S.-backed Contras.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1986</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   JAN. 17 _ Reagan signs a secret intelligence finding authorizing
CIA participation in the sales and ordering process be kept secret
from Congress.
   FEBRUARY _ First direct shipment of arms from Pentagon stocks is
sent to Iran.
   APRIL _ North writes memo outlining plans to use $12 million in
profits from Iran arms sales for Contra aid.
   MAY 25 _ North and McFarlane fly to Tehran with shipment of spare
parts, expecting hostages to be freed. Negotiations break down and
they return to Washington.
   SEPT. 26 _ Iranian middlemen deposit $7 million into Swiss bank
account. More spare parts and TOWs are prepared for shipment.
   OCT. 5 _ North flies to West Germany for meeting with Iranian

is freed.
   NOV. 4 _ A pro-Syrian news magazine in Beirut breaks news that
McFarlane had flown to Iran to meet and negotiate with officials
there.
   NOV. 13 _ White House admits selling arms to Iran. Reagan repeats
administration has not bargained with terrorists or sold arms for
hostages.
   NOV. 21 _ CIA director William Casey briefs Senate Intelligence
Committee on arms deal, but makes no mention of diversion of funds.
North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, shred, alter and remove
documents relevant to arms deal.

from retired Air Force Gen. Richard Secord, who describes how $3.5
million in proceeds from arms sales to Iran were diverted to Contras.
   MAY 6 _ Casey dies.
   MAY 11 _ McFarlane begins four days of testimony, during which he
says Reagan instructed staff in 1984 to find ways around
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to Contras. McFarlane denies
he, North and Poindexter concocted cover story in early November
1986 to cover up administration's arms sales to Iran.
   JULY 7 _ North begins six days on stand during which he says he
had authorization from his superiors for diverting Iran arms sale
money to the Contras, Casey knew of diversion all along, and North
always assumed Reagan knew about it. But he says he never discussed
plan with the president or received written presidential
authorization for it.
   JULY 15 _ Poindexter testifies over five days he never told
Reagan Iran arms sale proceeds were being diverted to Contras.
Poindexter says Reagan, in writing, authorized straight
arms-for-hostages swap in December 1985 but Poindexter tore up the
document in November 1986 as the affair unraveled.
   AUG. 6 _ Hearings conclude.
   NOV. 18 _ Final report of House and Senate investigating
committees concludes Reagan bears ultimate responsibility for
Iran-Contra affair because he allowed ``cabal of the zealots'' to
seize control of policy and bypass the law. Committee Republicans
dissented sharply, saying mistakes amounted only to errors of
judgment.

<NOTE>1988</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   MARCH 16 _ North, Poindexter and two others are indicted on
charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales profits to the
Contras. ``I can assure you I will never give up, we will win, I
just cannot tell you how soon,'' North says. The case is assigned to
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   MARCH 17 _ Marlin Fitzwater, President Reagan's spokesman, says
there has been no discussion of a pardon for North.
   MARCH 18 _ North announces he will retire from the Marine Corps
May 1 because he may have to subpoena ``the highest ranking
officials in our government.''
   MARCH 25 _ Reagan refers to ``the so-called scandal'' and says he
still considers North ``my hero.''
   JUNE 6 _ Gesell, who authorized turning over 300,000 documents to
the defense, warns that the danger of exposing the nation's most
sensitive secrets poses a serious obstacle to pressing the
conspiracy charges against the four defendants.
   JUNE 8 _ Gesell orders separate trials for the four defendants;
Walsh, the next day, chooses North for the leadoff trial.
   JULY 8 _ Gesell sets Sept. 20 for the start of North's trial.
   AUG. 5 _ Gesell reschedules trial for after the election to give
lawyers time to sort through hundreds of thousands of classified
documents and orders North to file a specific notice of the
government secrets he wants to disclose.
   SEPT. 30 _ Federal appeals court rebuffs attempt by North and two
other defendants to stop the prosecution.
   NOV. 7 _ One of 16 criminal counts, fabricating a document, is
dismissed.
   NOV. 21 _ Gesell warns if North stands trial, the court will have
little control over the testimony of witnesses ``acquainted with
high security matters.'' He appeals to Reagan to decide whether
North is to be pardoned.
   NOV. 29 _ Gesell refuses to dismiss two of the central charges
against North, conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of
government property. He dismisses a third, wire fraud.
   DEC. 1 _ President Reagan rules out a North pardon but says
``duty requires'' his administration to block release of secret
documents North wants for his trial.
   DEC. 1 _ Amiram Nir, the Israeli go-between in secret U.S. arms
deals with Iran, died Nov. 30 in a plane crash in Mexico while
traveling under an assumed name, Mexican officials say.
   DEC. 12 _ Gesell tells North he can't use 3,500 secret documents;
says he can't use more than 300, roughly the same number planned to
be introduced as evidence by the prosecution. The decision removes a
major obstacle to the trial going forward.
   DEC. 16 _ John W. Keker, a former Marine who was _ like North _
wounded in combat in Vietnam, is named to be lead prosecutor in
North's trial.
   DEC. 21 _ Gesell sets Jan. 31 for the start of the trial.
   DEC. 30 _ North subpoenaes President Reagan and President-elect
Bush as defense witnesses. The Justice Department says the summons
``raises significant legal and constitutional questions.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1989</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   JAN. 5 _ Prosecutors ask Gesell to dismiss conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled North would need at trial.
Gesell sets hearing for Jan. 9. Reagan says action satisfies concern
about national security. Asked about a pardon, he says ``we're
waiting for the judicial process to go forward.''

   Thaddeus Armie Eure, the nation's
longest-serving state official and who calls himself the ``oldest
rat in the Democratic barn,'' today ends a 52-year career as North
Carolina's secretary of state.
   ``He is the essence of North Carolina _ its symbol,'' says Rufus
Edmisten, a Democrat elected to succeed the 89-year-old Eure.
``Governors come and go, but Mr. Thad has remained. He has been
North Carolina.''
   State officials were sporting red bow ties _ one of the
flamboyant secretary's many trademarks _ at a ceremony honoring him
in the Capitol today.
   Eure is retiring voluntarily from a post no one has been able to
wrest from him since he was elected in 1936, when he ran on the
campaign slogan, ``Give a young man a chance.''
   His term has spanned the administrations of 12 governors and nine
presidents. President Reagan wrote Eure in 1987 congratulating him
on serving longer than any state government official in the nation.
   Still, he is reluctant to discuss his feelings about his
departure, saying only, ``I haven't thought too much about that.''
   Besides the bowtie, which Eure said he began wearing as a young
man and never saw a reason to switch, he is known for the straw hat
he dons each spring and his regular attendance at an annual
Democratic gathering in the mountains called the Ramp Festival,
where politicians swap stories and eat ramps, which are wild leeks.
Eure onced dubbed himself ``king of the ramps.''
   He also gained a reputation for his colorful annual orientation
classes for freshmen members of the General Assembly, where he
dispensed history and advice, and for a 1984 remark that the last
governor he admired was Clyde R. Hoey, who took office in 1937.
   ``Those were the trying days, the 1930s. Governor Hoey was a
quarterback and he ran the plays,'' Eure said. ``He knew how to
handle people. No matter what their gripe was, he knew how to handle
them.''
   Eure was born and raised on a Gates County farm and was mayor of
Winton from 1923 to 1928. He served a term in the state House of
Representatives from 1929-30, and was defeated for re-election but
remained in Raleigh as House clerk.
   The first-floor, northeast corner office he moved into as clerk
in 1931 is the one he has occupied for 57 years. Today will be his
last day there.
   The office was crammed with a half-century's worth of political
memorabilia, including photographs of Eure with Presidents Truman
and Johnson and a donkey that dispenses cigarettes from its south
end when its ear is pressed. Eure said he would move the stuff into
his garage.
   ``It's like succeeding an institution,'' Edmisten said. ``Every
time I touch something that's been his, it's like I'm on hallowed
ground. ... I know I won't hold this office 52 years. I probably
won't even live another 52 years.''
   The accolades began almost as soon as Eure announced his
retirement more than a year ago, saying his wife, Minta, was in ill
health.
   Last May, Eure's son, Thad Eure Jr., paid tribute to his father
in an interview, saying the elder Eure mortgaged his home for
$40,000 to give his son money to start the Angus Barn 28 years ago.
The popular Raleigh restaurant now grosses $4 million to $5 million
a year.
   Thad Eure Jr. died last month. The Eures also have a daughter,
Armecia Black.
   On Tuesday, at Eure's final meeting with the Council of State,
Gov. Jim Martin presented him with a North Carolina flag that had
flown over the state Capitol.
   The rotunda ceremony today was the brainchild of a member of Elon
College's centennial year planning committee. Elon has a special
affinity for Eure, who has been a member of the school's board of
trustees since 1942 and chairman since 1955.
   ``I've been on the board nearly half the age of the
institution,'' Eure said. He plans to retire from the chairmanship
in May.

<HEAD>List of Poisons Used In Chemical Warfare</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Chemical Conference, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Because of their effectiveness, relative economy and ease of
production, poison gas and other chemical weapons have been called
the poor nation's atomic bomb. On Saturday, envoys from more than
140 nations will meet in Paris to discuss changes in the 1925 Geneva
Protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemical
weapons.
   Here is a list of some gases in the chemical arsenal, drawn from
``Chemical Warfare,'' a book by Edward M. Spiers, published by
University of Illinois Press:
   
   CHLORINE: Chlorine irritates the nose, throat and lungs and
causes coughing, smarting of the eyes, nausea and vomiting. A 0.1
percent concentration causes death within a few minutes.
   PHOSGENE: Phosgene is 10 times more toxic than chlorine, but
severe symptoms and death may not occur for several hours after
exposure. Phosgene damages the air sacs of the lungs, causing a
deadly accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Victims less severely
affected may cough bloody sputum for months. Phosgene caused 80
percent of the gas fatalities in World War I. A 0.02-0.05 percent
concentration kills in minutes.
   MUSTARD: Mustard gas blisters and burns the skin or lungs on
contact. It also attacks the eyes, causing inflammation of the inner
surface of the eyelids, and causes hoarse coughing and bleeding from
the nose. Symptoms are delayed for 2-4 hours unless one is directly
exposed to the liquid. A concentration of one-tenth of a milligram
per liter for 10 minutes is fatal.
   HYDROCYANIC ACID: Hydrocyanic acid affects the nervous system.
Also known as prussic acid, it can be absorbed through the skin and
acts rapidly on its victims. Symptoms progress through giddiness,
headache, and unconsciousness to convulsions and paralysis of the
brain's respiratory center. A concentration of 2.5 milligrams per
liter is fatal.
   LEWISITE: Lewisite is absorbed through the skin and lungs, acting
as both a blistering-burning agent and a poison because it contains
arsenic. Lewisite has effects similar to those of mustard gas, but
the symptoms are more severe and burns appear sooner. A
concentration of one-tenth of a milligram for 10 minutes is fatal.
   ADAMSITE: At low concentrations, adamsite irritates the mucous
membranes of the nose and throat. The lower respiratory tract is
affected by higher concentrations. A concentration of 3 milligrams
per liter for 10 minutes is fatal.
   SNEEZE AND NAUSEA GAS: This gas causes sneezing, choking,
headache, chest pains, and vomiting. Twitching and an unsteady gait
result from higher concentrations. A concentration of 3 milligrams
per liter for 10 minutes is fatal.

   In a speech marking the 30th anniversary of his
rise to power, Fidel Castro seemed intent on erasing any doubts
about the stability of Cuban-Soviet relations or the state of his
revolution.
   It was a back-to-basics speech Wednesday, with strong attacks on
the Reagan administration and ringing praise for the Soviet Union
and Cubans for sacrifices made in the building of socialism.
   As Castro described it, the revolution has turned a corner. Two
years ago, the Cuban leader was unhappy with evidence of laziness
and corruption, but on Wednesday night, before tens of thousands of
people, he said he detected a new spirit of dedication.
   Those honored at the ceremony included eight workers who Castro
said contributed thousands of hours of volunteer work for a huge
exhibit of the revolution's achievements in social and economic
development.
   One the workers had been known to work 30 hours at a stretch,
Castro said. His colleages wanted him to go home, but ``who was
going to stop him?'' the president asked.
   The exhibit, known as ``Expocuba,'' opened Thursday with 45
pavilions focusing on Cuban innovations in science, technology and
other fields.
   ``We respect the paths others take in the construction of
socialism,'' Castro said, seemingly dismissing as inconsequential
the deepening contrasts between the Cuban and Soviet systems.
   His prior criticism of liberal reforms introduced by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had touched off speculation about a
possible loosening of ties between the two countries.
   But Castro went out of his way to praise Soviet policies on
detente and disarmament and said the two countries see eye-to-eye on
the international debt and trade.
   ``We will never forget the (Soviet) support received in decisive
moments,'' he said.
   In the past year and a half, there has been modest improvement in
U.S. relations with Cuba, but on Wednesday night the Cuban leader
sounded much like the Castro of old in his remarks about the United
States.
   A slight chill fell over the crowd when Castro touched on this
subject. It was near the end of his nearly three-hour oration, and
with dusk long past, many in the audience huddled together for
warmth.
   Curiously, Castro omitted criticism of the U.S. downing of two
Libyan fighter planes Wednesday over the Mediterranean. But he
assailed the Reagan administration's threats to destroy a Libyan
plant the United States says is intended to produce chemical weapons.
   It was shortly after this that the chief U.S. representative in
Cuba, Jay Taylor, rose from his seat in the diplomatic section and
walked out.
   Castro warned that the United States may be embarked on a policy
of aggression against Third World countries under the cover of
detente with Moscow.
   He also indicated it may be time to reform the United Nations to
dilute the power of the five members of the Security Council, who
each have veto power. The five are the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France.
   It is unjust for Britain, a country of 50 million, to have veto
power while no such authority is given India, which has 880 million
people, Castro said.
   He said 4 billion people live in the Third World but the current
U.N. structure leaves power in the hands of countries that represent
a minority of the global population.
   Castro mentioned the U.N. issue in expressing concern over a
U.S.-led move in the Security Council to reduce, because of
financial considerations, the number of U.N. forces who will oversee
the transition in Namibia to independence from South Africa.

<HEAD>DOE Official Says Contractor Change Adds To SRP Delays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The change in contractors at the Savannah
River Plant is ``aggravating'' the already long delay in restarting
the weapons plant's nuclear reactors, according to a Department of
Energy official.
   ``The engineering continuity is being lost'' as Du Pont Co.
prepares to turn over operations at SRP on April 1 to Westinghouse
Savannah River Co., said Richard W. Starostecki, the DOE's deputy
assistant secretary for safety, health and quality assurance.
   ``There's a lot of turmoil that is natural when you have a change
in management,'' Starostecki told the Aiken Standard. The complex
near Aiken produces tritium for nuclear bombs.
   The DOE official told the Augusta Chronicle on Thursday that the
first reactor still could be restarted by October. He also said
reports of cracks discovered in reactor cooling lines are ``not a
new issue.''
   The Augusta newspaper reported that SRP officials are reviewing
criteria used to determine when a cracked cooling pipe is replaced.
Officials are monitoring about 25 cracks in cooling lines at the
three reactors _ 15 of which are in the K-Reactor, which is the one
slated to be restarted first.
   At present, the cracks will not delay the restart, the newspaper
said.
   DOE officials also said Wednesday they expect Congress to approve
their planned request for up to $300 million toward building the new
military production reactors.
   The request is the first by the DOE's New Production Reactor
office, and is part of a proposed $6.8 billion project to build
reactors at SRP and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   The DOE would rely primarily on the SRP reactor to supply
perishable tritium gas for U.S. nuclear weapons in the next century.
The smaller Idaho reactor would serve as backup.
   Ronald W. Cochran, acting director of the NPR office, said he is
confident that Congress will approve the funding. This year's
appropriation will go toward safety analysis, environmental planning
and reactor design, he said.
   Construction of the Savannah River NPR is expected to start in
1991 or 1992, providing thousands of construction and engineering
jobs for the Aiken area.
   Cochran said the defense officials are concerned about current
delays at SRP because of the plant's major role in the military
project.
   Starostecki, who helped oversee commercial nuclear power for
about 12 years as a member of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said only aggressive, clearly-defined management can
deal with equipment problems that inevitably develop with all
nuclear reactors.
   While praising Westinghouse's qualifications, he said he is
frustrated with how long it's taking to complete
earthquake-resistance improvements and other work at SRP's reactors.
   SRP's three operable production reactors _ P, K and L _ have been
shut down since last summer for a DOE-ordered upgrade of management
and hardware.
   The 1950s-era reactors are the nation's only source of perishable
tritium gas, an essential component of nuclear weapons.
   Starostecki said SRP needs a management team with clear lines of
responsibility, and authority to promptly ``find and fix'' reactor
safety problems.
   The DOE hopes to authorize restart of the K reactor this year,
with the others to follow, but no current ``target dates'' have been
announced.
   He has recently sent teams of experts to SRP to investigate
cracking found in several reactor coolant pipes, but said Tuesday
the investigators have ``not brought back anything startling.''
   The commercial nuclear industry has learned to deal with pipe
cracking, he said, and SRP must benefit from that knowledge.

   A former minister, unemployed and too proud
to accept handouts, looked to God to provide for his family _ until
the day his teen-age son died of starvation. On Thursday he was
charged with murder.
   Larry Cottam, a former Seventh-Day Adventist minister who was
fired from his job as a truck driver last March, rejected public
assistance and refused to send his children to public school, where
they would have qualified for school breakfast and lunch programs,
neighbors and officials said.
   ``His belief (was that) God would provide,'' said Roy
Dieffenbach, Cottam's former boss at Norandex Inc. in Wilkes-Barre.
   Authorities on Wednesday found no food in the well-kept house in
a middle-class, suburban neighborhood in northeastern Pennsylvania,
where Cottam's 14-year-old son, Eric, died of starvation.
   Cottam, his wife and daughter were all hospitalized for
malnutrition.
   Dr. George E. Hudock Jr., the Luzerne County coroner, on
Wednesday ruled the teen-ager's death a homicide.
   Hudock said the teen-ager had not eaten in at least three weeks
and weighed 69 pounds, about 80 pounds less than normal for his
height, 5-feet-10.
   Cottam, 39, was listed in fair condition Thursday at Mercy
Hospital in Wilkes-Barre. His wife, Leona, 37, and daughter, Laura,
12, were listed in serious condition at the hospital.
   Cottam and his wife were arraigned Thursday at the hospital on
one count each of criminal homicide and two counts each of reckless
endangerment and endangering the welfare of their children.
   They could face the death penalty if convicted on the homicide
charge. District Magistrate Donald Swank set a preliminary hearing
for Jan. 13.
   Social service agencies will take custody of the daughter,
District Attorney Correale F. Stevens said.
   Cottam said he blamed himself for the tragedy.
   ``I don't hold God responsible. The error was on my part, not
God's,'' Cottam told WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday night.
``My wife and I feel terrible about Eric's death, but my faith in
God is not shaken.''
   Cottam was pastor of four local Seventh-Day Adventist churches,
with a total congregation of about 250, when he was transferred to
Pittsburgh. The family moved back to Nuangola in 1985 after he lost
his post in Pittsburgh.
   Dieffenbach said he fired Cottam in March over a dispute
involving the condition of a truck that Cottam refused to drive
without two new tires.
   Those who know the Cottams said the close-knit family kept to
themselves and rarely left their modest two-story home.
   Larry and Leona Cottam had kept their children out of school
since they returned to the area in 1985 and in May won a two-year
court battle to educate them at home.
   Elsa Heintzelman, a Crestwood School District official, said
Eric's death could have been prevented if the children were enrolled
in public schools. She said the children would have qualified for
school meal programs.
   ``We've all been very sad that this happened because it need not
have happened at all,'' Ms. Heintzelman said.
   Richard Deane, superintendent of the school district, said the
children were smart and had scored well on standardized tests.
   Ms. Heintzelman said the school district was concerned about the
children's welfare because they were so isolated, and also
questioned whether the Cottams were qualified to teach at home.
   According to Ms. Heintzelman, Eric and Laura Cottam weren't
allowed to talk to adults without their parents being present and
weren't allowed to take part in activities with other children.
   The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader on Thursday reported that the
family lived on savings and cut costs wherever possible. The
newspaper said the Cottams had unplugged their refrigerator, bought
day-old bread and kept their house cold.

<HEAD>Carlucci Endorses Base-Closing Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to save billions of dollars by closing
dozens of military bases around the country goes before Congress
after being approved ahead of schedule by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   The House and Senate must deal with the plan in its entirety,
approving or rejecting it. The congressional resolution would then
go to the White House. Senate and House leaders have predicted
Congress will approve the plan.
   Carlucci told reporters Thursday that U.S. military leaders
strongly endorsed what he called a ``unique opportunity'' to save
money.
   ``We just have to move ahead and do this,'' Carlucci said. ``We
have not closed a base since 1978. And I think that fact speaks for
itself. We need to step up to the plate here.''
   Carlucci took just a week to review the recommendations of a
government commission that had been created by the administation and
Congress to review 4,200 military properties.
   After seven months of review, the commission recommended outright
closure of 34 military installations and 52 military housing
complexes and partial closure of five other installations. It
recommended that 54 other bases receive new missions or additional
personnel.
   Members of the commission estimated the closings would save the
nation $693 million a year in the short term, and up to $5.6 billion
over two decades.
   Carlucci said he would have endorsed the closing of even more
bases, but did not want to tinker with the delicate political
compromise.
   ``I would not try to change this law at this time or this report
at this time, simply because we do have the political momentum that
is necessary to make a breakthrough in this area,'' he added.
   Carlucci and Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, rejected the view of one commission member, former Sen.
Thomas Eagleton, D-Mi., that the Navy had ``stonewalled'' to avoid
having its bases closed.
   ``The other members of the commission did not join Senator
Eagleton in his dissent,'' said Carlucci. ``I have spoken to the
secretary of the Navy (William Ball), who has assured me that from
his perspective the Navy gave its full cooperation to the
commission.''
   Crowe, a Navy officer, told reporters: ``It makes good sense from
the standpoint of both management and economy to allow DoD (the
Department of Defense) to cut back marginal installations as
circumstances change.''
   ``This is especially true in times of fiscal constraints where
the resulting long-term savings assume even more importance.''
   Carlucci, as a strong proponent of base closings, had been
expected to approve the list all along. But he demonstrated his
enthusiasm by announcing his decision before a legal deadline of
Jan. 15.
   He also said he would ask Congress for $500 million in the fiscal
1990 budget and another $500 million in the 1991 budget to help
cover the expense of closing bases, such as relocating employees.
   ``I would like to reiterate that this is a unique opportunity to
make significant changes to DoD's base structure which will not only
save taxpayer dollars but also improve our nation's defense,''
Carlucci said.
   Carlucci said he sympathized with local political leaders who
worried about the economic impact of individual base closings.
   ``But on the other hand, they can't have it both ways,'' he said
``They can't say that we've got to have efficiencies and economies
in the Department of Defense, and at the same time defend bases
which a totally non-partisan, highly qualified group ... examined
and said this particular base can be closed.''

   John Lawe, 69, the one-time bus cleaner who led
35,000 workers in an 11-day transit strike in 1980, died Thursday of
cancer Thursday.
   Lawe, a longtime union activist, joined the Transport Workers
Union in 1949, the year he came to the United States from Ireland
and got a job as a bus cleaner for the old Fifth Avenue Coach Co.,
now a part of the Transit Authority.
   Beginning as a shop steward, he rose through the union ranks
during his 17 years as a cleaner and driver. During the TWU's 1966
citywide strike, Lawe served on the union's negotiating committee.
   In 1977, Lawe, was voted president of Local 100, and in that
position led the April 1980 strike that forced millions of commuters
to carpool or walk and cost the city about $1.1 billion in lost
business, more than $1 million a day in lost sales taxes and
$700,000 in police overtime.
   On May 1, 1985, he was sworn in as International President of the
TWU of America. The union, which represents 100,000 workers
nationwide, has had only three previous presidents: Michael Quill,
Matthew Guinan and William Lindner.

<HEAD>US Pork Producers Say Canada Trying To Hog Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Pork Producers Council has
formally asked the U.S. government to impose import duties on pork
products from Canada, claiming the Canadian meat is subsidized and
competes unfairly with American hog farmers.
   Council President Ray Hankes said Thursday a petition was filed
Jan. 4 with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Commerce
Department asking that countervailing duties be imposed on fresh,
chilled and frozen pork products from Canada.
   State pork associations and a number of U.S. meat packing
companies also signed the petition. A ruling on the council's
petition is expected in about six months, he said.
   ``A countervailing duty would eliminate the unfair advantage
Canadian farmers have over U.S. pork producers because the Canadian
government subsidizes its hog production,'' Hankes said in a
statement released here. ``Canadian pork producers can benefit from
more than 20 potential subsidy programs.''
   There has been an import duty on live hogs from Canada since July
1985, a move upheld by the U.S. Court of International Trade during
a lengthy appeals process.
   But the American producers contend the import duty on live hogs
doesn't prevent Canada from slaughtering its hogs and shipping the
pork to U.S. markets. The Commerce Department ruled in 1985 the
import duties on pork products were justified.
   The U.S. Court of International Trade, acting on an appeal by the
Canadian Meat Council, overruled the Commerce decision.
   As a result, Canada has increased its shipments of pork into the
United States by more than 52 percent since 1984, Hankes said.
   The council also said imports of Canadian pork have reduced the
revenues of U.S. hog producers by as much as $3.37 per 100 pounds of
hogs marketed in the first nine months of 1988, according to a study
by economist Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri.
   Overall, the imports from Canada were said to cost American
producers as much as $697 million in lost revenues last year.
   The Agriculture Department said imports of Canadian pork products
in 1988 totaled a carcass weight equivalent of 440.2 million pounds
through Dec. 3, according to Canadian government figures. That
compared with 501.5 million pounds for all of 1987 and 313.9 million
pounds in 1984.
   Kevin Bost of the department's Economic Research Service said in
a telephone interview the countervailing duties on live hogs from
Canada have trimmed the imports sharply, from more than 1.3 million
head in 1984 to around 650,000 to 700,000 head last year. Shipments
may be around 700,000 head in 1989, he said.
   According to USDA figures, American hog farmers produced around
15.6 billion pounds of pork in 1988, an estimate of carcass weights
after slaughter. The forecast calls for a slight increase this year.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold the Soviet Union an additional 390,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday the wheat was part of 2
million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the
United States, now in its sixth year.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment in January and February.
Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the
Soviets have about 1.2 million tons still available under the
program.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under
EEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The
pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31,
1990.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 760,000 tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. Sales also
include 10.2 million tons of corn, along with some soybeans, soybean
meal and sorghum.
   Only the wheat is subsidized, however.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 390,000 tons of
wheat would be about 14.3 million bushels.
   Sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of
$22.83 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on
the 390,000 tons of wheat will be paid to five companies: Cargill
Inc., 100,000 tons; Toepfer International Inc., 50,000; Ferruzzi USA
Inc., 150,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000; and Peavy Co., 40,000.

   Farmers have signed enough fragile land into a
long-range conservation program to reduce annual soil losses by
nearly 600 million tons, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Thursday that about 28 million acres have been
contracted under the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP. The goal
is to retire 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land
from crop production by 1990.
   An agency spokeswoman, Leslie Wilder, said the 600 million tons
of soil saved each year would be enough to cover one square mile, or
640 acres, to a depth of 429 feet.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take qualified land from crop
production for 10 years. In return, they get federal assistance to
plant the land in protective grass or trees and then draw annual
rental payments. Those average around $49 per acre each year.

<HEAD>Diplomats Allowed To Break the Ice In Social Settings With PLO</HEAD>

   At one time, U.S. diplomats got into hot water
if they clinked teacups with members of the PLO, but now the State
Department has switched signals.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed Thursday
that American officials around the world have been given the green
light to mix with Palestine Liberation Organization representatives
_ but strictly on an informal basis.
   ``There have been instructions that have allowed people in social
settings to respond socially to introductions,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The spokeswoman emphasized the new policy for formal contacts
between the United States and the Palestinian group still stands:
U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau, is the only person
authorized to conduct America's diplomatic dialogue with the PLO.
   ``The one channel for communication with the PLO officially
remains our ambassador in Tunis,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The spokeswoman declined to outline the exact ``diplomatic ...
niceties of teacups and handshakes,'' but said ``people may respond
socially in a setting. If you're introduced, there may be the
exchange of courtesies.''
   ``These are not to be construed as official contacts,'' she said,
adding it was expected such meetings might occur at diplomatic
receptions or ``in a group at a large party, if people meet or are
introduced.''
   One State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the new policy came about after President Reagan's
historic decision in mid-December to reverse the policy of refusing
to deal with members of the organization, long shunned as a band of
terrorists. Reagan said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had met U.S.
demands by renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to
exist.
   Two days after Secretary of State George Shultz announced
Reagan's decision to drop the 13-year ban on contacts with the PLO,
Pelletreau met for an hour and 40 minutes with a PLO delegation in
Tunis, where the organization has its headquarters.
   ``Suddenly, ambassadors wanted to know what to do if they got
calls from a PLO representative, saying, `I've been told we can have
a dialogue, when can we meet?''' the official said.
   He said a message was sent to all U.S. embassies as a ``guideline
for people about what they can and cannot do. ... It's just normal
courtesy.''
   ``It means no one will go out of their way to set up a meeting,
but if you're in a social setting and a PLO official walks up to
you, of course you're not going to walk away,'' he said. ``Now you
can have a social conversation.''
   The official stressed that the change was a subtle one.
   ``We haven't recognized the PLO, we haven't recognized a
Palestinian state,'' he said.
   Even so, any contact is considered sensitive.
   In 1979, U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young resigned his post amid
controversy over an unauthorized meeting he held with a PLO
representative in a Manhattan apartment.

   Three national unions and two states are asking
a federal court to block government regulations lifting a 40-year
ban on work at home in five apparel-related industries.
   ``Eliminating the ban on homework is a profoundly reactionary
attack on the most basic legal rights of working men and women,''
Jay Mazur, president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers
Union, said Thursday after the suit was filed in federal district
court here.
   ``It would condemn tens of thousands of workers _ mostly
immigrant women _ to abject exploitation and threaten the working
standards of countless others,'' Mazur said of the Labor Department
plan, scheduled to take effect Monday.
   The suit contends that the regulations contain inadequate
safeguards to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage,
child labor, maximum work hours, workplace safety and other issues.
   It also attacks the department's record of enforcing regulations
covering homework in the knitted outerwear industry _ which has been
legal for the past four years _ and asks that the government be
ordered to consider reinstating the ban in that field.
   Labor Department officials said they had not seen the suit and
therefore could not comment on most aspects. But they rejected its
characterization of enforcement of labor laws in the knitted outwear
industry.
   ``It's just not true that the department cannot enforce the Fair
Labor Standards Act in a homework environment,'' said Alan McMillan,
a deputy assistant secretary. ``We absolutely feel that we can.''
   McMillan said the four-year experience monitoring homework in the
knitted outerwear industry had prompted the department to strengthen
its enforcement procedures and include the improvements in the new
regulations.
   The five manufacturing industries covered by the new rules are:
gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideries
and, to a limited extent, jewelry.
   Much of the women's apparel industry is not affected. But the
Labor Department last week said it was considering drafting proposed
rules for lifting the broader homework ban, too, and the outcome of
the suit could signal whether organized labor will be successful in
blocking that attempt.
   About 167,000 workers are employed by the five affected
industries, which generated $10 billion worth of production in 1986,
said Susan Cowell, vice president of the ILGWU.
   Joining the garment workers' union in filing the suit were two
other national unions, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union and the Service Employees International Union; two New
York-based union locals; three apparel-industry employer
associations representing 255 companies; and the states of New York
and Pennsylvania, where homework is banned by state law.
   ``Industrial homework has always been a way to violate labor law
with near impunity,'' New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said
in a statement. ``Homework can never be adequately regulated.''
   Named as defendants were Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, and
Paula V. Smith, administrator of the department's wage and hour
division, which enforces many of the laws the suit contends would be
violated if the homework regulations were allowed to take effect.
   Prohibitions on apparel industry homework were adopted in the
1940s to combat exploitation of immigrants and other low-wage
workers. Lifting the bans has been the Reagan administration's top
deregulatory effort in the labor relations area for the past several
years. President-elect Bush has backed the efforts and is expected
to continue the deregulatory push.

   Education lobbyists say they have the perfect
way for George Bush to fulfill his pledge to be the education
president: raise federal education spending by $10 billion in his
first term.
   ``There's an education deficit analogous to the Grand Canyon. To
have someone throw in a shovel of dirt is not going to solve the
problem,'' said Gerald Morris, president of a 100-member coalition
called the Committee for Education Funding.
   The committee suggested Thursday that Bush start with an
immediate down payment of $2.5 billion in the Education Department
budget for fiscal 1990. That would be an 11 percent increase over
the current $21.9 billion budget.
   Furthermore, the committee said, Bush should add $500 million to
Head Start, the preschool program for disadvantaged children that is
run by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``We don't see that it's unrealistic or unattainable,'' Becky
Timmons, vice president of the committee, said of the spending
blueprint.
   During his presidential campaign, Bush made several expensive
education proposals, including $500 million for a ``Merit Schools''
program to help the disadvantaged, $400 million for Head Start and
$50 million for magnet schools. However, Bush has also vowed to cut
the deficit and not raise taxes.
   He is expected to rework the lame-duck budget Reagan will be
sending to Congress on Monday. That document reportedly will
recommend $35 billion in cuts across the government.
   Morris said his coalition is not taking positions on the tax
issue or on which types of domestic spending could be cut to offset
education increases. But he and others said they are encouraged by
Bush's campaign promises, his ``tone of moderation'' and his
appointments so far.
   ``We haven't had the luxury of working with the administration in
the last seven years because we've been on opposite sides of the
fence,'' Morris said in reference to the Reagan administration,
which repeatedly sought cuts in the education budget.
   He said a Bush administration is likely to be more hospitable.
``We may have a very different and warmer _ and certainly welcome _
environment,'' he said.
   The funding committee is a non-profit, non-partisan coalition of
groups that represent more than 50 million students, parents,
teachers, administrators, presidents, librarians, counselors,
trustees and school board members. Virtually every major education
group in the country is a member.
   Under its plan, $1.6 billion of the 1990 increase would go to
programs for disadvantaged students of all ages, from remedial
tutoring to college tuition grants. Another $768 million would cover
the cost of inflation for all federal education programs, while $150
million would be reserved for presidential initiatives and modest
increases in small existing programs.
   According to the committee, education spending accounted for 2.5
percent of the federal budget in fiscal 1979 but only 1.7 percent in
fiscal 1988.
   Officials cited the following statistics to make the case for a
four-year, $10 billion investment:
   _From 1979 to 1988, Pell grants to needy college students went
from covering 50 percent of all college expenses to 29 percent while
the buying power of the maximum award declined 13 percent.
   _Head Start serves less than 20 percent of the children who
qualify for it.
   _Chapter 1, the major federal program for disadvantaged
elementary and secondary school children, serves less than half
those eligible.
   _Federal money for educating handicapped children now covers only
8 percent of per-pupil expenditures as opposed to 12.5 percent in
1979.

   A Senate committee chairman wants the FBI to
look into a newspaper's allegations that one of President-elect
Bush's Cabinet nominees headed a GOP organization ``riddled with
former Nazi collaborators.''
   The Oakland (Calif.) Tribune, in an editorial Dec. 28, said its
questions should be answered before the Senate approves Bush's
nomination of Edward Derwinski as the first head of the newly
created Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who will conduct the Senate
Veterans' Affairs Committee's confirmation hearings on the
nomination, asked Bush to look into the editorial's charges in the
course of ``its customary background investigation.''
   The editorial said Derwinski associated with former fascists and
anti-Semites in 1972 when he headed the executive board of the
Heritage Groups for Re-election of the President and this year when
he co-chaired Bush's Coalition of American Nationalities.
   Through a spokesman, Derwinski said the charges amounted to
``guilt by association.''
   Several members of the coalition resigned this summer after the
Washington Jewish Week said they had pro-fascist or anti-Semitic
records during World War II.
   Derwinski, who served for 23 years as a Republican congressman
from Cook County, Ill., is in the State Department as undersecertary
for security assistance, science and technology.
   He was not available for comment Thursday, but a spokesman, Bill
Anderson, said of the editorial: ``It is guilt by association. He
has had nothing to do with the hiring or the service of those
mentioned in this article. Anyone who examines his record in
support, for example, of Jewish organizations, or as a diplomat in
Israel can categorically rule out any anti-Semitism on his part.''
   Anderson said Derwinski had lent his name to Republican ethnic
committees in every presidential election campaign since 1960.
   Cranston, in his letter to Bush, said he raised the issue with
Derwinski Wednesday during ``a nice meeting with him to discuss the
forthcoming nomination.''
   He sent Bush a copy of the editorial and wrote, ``As you can see
the editorial raises serious charges.''
   ``Before the U.S. Senate approves him it ought to ask the nominee
whether he intends to represent American veterans or Nazi veterans,
American democratic ideals or those of foreign dictatorships,'' the
editorial said.
   ``Those questions are apt, given Derwinski's record of service in
an organization riddled with former Nazi collaborators and his
alleged role in passing U.S. secrets to the South Korean CIA in the
late 1970s,'' it said, but added:
   ``The record certainly doesn't prove that Derwinski is a closet
Nazi sympathizer or a foe of democracy. But it does call into
profound question his judgment, in particular his willingness to
turn a blind eye to the background and beliefs of notorious
colleagues if they share his anti-communism.''
   The paper quoted Russ Bellant, author of a study published by
Political Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., as saying that
``at least four people charged with war crimes were in leadership
positions'' of the 1972 Republican group Derwinski headed.
   The research group calls itself an independent organization that
gathers information on ``right-wing groups and trends.''
   The editorial also said that during a 1977 House investigation of
alleged South Korean influence peddling on Capitol Hill, Derwinski
appeared to be responsible for leaking to the Korean government the
defection of an official of the Korean Central Inelligence Agency.
   But Anderson said the House Ethics Committee investigated and
cleared Derwinski of tipping off the South Korean government.

   The five contenders to replace retiring Paul G.
Kirk Jr. as Democratic Party chairman take to the road this weekend
for a series of regional meetings aimed at selecting a leader who
can staunch the flow of voters from its ranks.
   The front-runners for the chairmanship are Richard Wiener of
Michigan, president of the Association of State Party Chairs, and
Ronald H. Brown, a Washington attorney who was a top adviser to
Jesse Jackson in the late stages of his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Also competing for support were three former congressmen _ Jim
Jones of Oklahoma, Michael Barnes of Maryland and James V. Stanton
of Ohio.
   Ever since Kirk announced early last month that he would not run
for a second four-year term despite the pleas of many party leaders,
the contenders to succeed him have competed for the endorsements of
big-name Democrats.
   Brown quickly lined up Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
   Stanton was backed by former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.
of Massachusetts and by House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois.
   Jones got the support of Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and John
Breaux of Louisiana, while Barnes was backed by former presidential
nominee Walter F. Mondale and former Secretary of State Edmund S.
Muskie.
   But few if any of the big names making endorsements will cast
votes on Feb. 10 when the Democratic National Committee meets in
Washington to elect the new party chairman.
   That is where Wiener has his strength. Many of the state party
leaders who worked with the Michigan party chairman quickly lined up
behind him after Kirk decided four years was enough.
   Many Democrats who tried to convince Kirk to serve a second term
argued that a fight for the chairmanship after another losing
presidential campaign _ the fifth in six elections for the White
House _ would further damage the party's standing among voters.
   Some Democrats privately questioned whether the selection of
Brown, who is black and identified with Jackson, would alienate
Southern and blue-collar voters who have deserted the Democrats in
recent presidential elections.
   Brown has responded that many of the same Democrats who were
condemning his tie to Jackson were cheering last spring when he
agreed to serve as the candidate's convention manager.
   Jones said the question was philosophy rather than race, saying
that Brown was too identified with the party's liberal wing at a
time when a centrist was needed as the Democratic spokesman.
   ``What Ron Brown is saying is that he should not be judged by
Jesse Jackson but by the fact that he was campaign manager for Ted
Kennedy against Jim Carter,'' said the former Oklahoma congressman,
``and I think that's sort of legitimate and I think that's what the
decision is going to be made from.''
   The contenders will meet Saturday in Chicago with Midwest members
of the DNC and then travel to Atlanta for a meeting on Sunday with
Southerners.
   Another session is scheduled for Tuesday in Newark, N.J., and a
final one the following Saturday in Salt Lake City.
   All five candidates appeared Thursday before union political
directors at the AFL-CIO headquarters.
   Of the 404 votes on the DNC, 46 are cast by union
representatives. But labor's influence is considered far greater
than that, and all the candidates will be watching closely next week
when individual union presidents meet with AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland to determine whether labor will issue an endorsement.

<HEAD>Cities Head Says Bush, Cities Should Find `Common Purpose'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's cities expect a more ``mature
relationship'' with the federal government under George Bush than
they have had during the Reagan era, the incoming president of the
National League of Cities says.
   Using a parent-child analogy to discuss how cities have fared in
their dealings with the federal government, Phoenix Mayor Terry
Goddard told a National Press Club luncheon on Thursday:
   ``During the sixties and seventies we had a pampered childhood.
... And then very abruptly at the beginning of the eighties, we were
orphaned. ... We were thrown out in the storm and we were told to
fend for ourselves.''
   ``We're looking for a new relationship, a mature relationship,
one that binds two powerful entities, the federal government and
local government into a common purpose,'' and partnership said
Goddard, who was recently elected the league's president.
   The league is the nation's largest and oldest organization
representing towns and cities.
   Although he said the cities had learned to cope, stretch
resources and survive their ``Oliver Twist'' adolescent period
without Washington, the 41-year-old Goddard said municipalities face
problems like the spread of drugs, lack of affordable housing, and
decaying infrastructure and environment.
   ``There is serious trouble in urban America,'' he said.
   Goddard said the problems of cities are often ignored because
they're dull and gradual. He said they aren't noticed until ``after
a system fails, after a building collapses or a bridge falls
through.''
   But he said the new administration should focus on what can be
done to prevent catastrophe before it happens.
   Goddard met Thursday afternoon with Jack Kemp, Bush's nominee to
head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he
presented the league's proposal for six initiatives for the Bush
administration and the 101st Congress to help tackle urban problems.
   The proposal includes establishing a council of urban advisers,
developing a comprehensive national housing policy, a national
policy on children and families and a new federal surface
transportation policy, and invigorating federal support for urban
research.
   Goddard said cities recognize the federal deficit problem and
don't seek a return to their pampered days, ``but we do need a
positive administration response, one which is willing to use
national leadership and coordination to help us save money and add a
sense of direction.''
   Goddard said Bush could demonstrate a commitment to a partnership
with cities if he consults local officials, sets up a mechanism to
consider the impact of agencies' actions and regulations on
municipalities, evaluates approaches cities have found successful in
dealing with their problems and doesn't rule out spending new funds
in critical areas.
   That done, ``We pledge to help the president-elect become the
best urban president this country has known,'' said Goddard.

   Media magnates Samuel and Donald Newhouse are
fighting the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, in a case that can have enormous
financial consequences for the family's privately held publishing
and broadcasting empire.
   The Internal Revenue Service contends the estate of Samuel and
Donald's father, Samuel I. Newhouse Sr., owes $600 million in taxes.
If the IRS wins, it plans to seek an additional $600 million, plus
hundreds of millions of dollars in interest.
   One of the major issues is whether the elder Newhouse, who died
at age 84 in 1979, controlled the family publishing company as the
IRS contends _ or allowed decisions to be made by consensus.
   Since the trial's opening on Wednesday, both Samuel and Donald
Newhouse have testified the company was run by consensus management.
If they're right, the value of their father's stock would be less _
and so would the estate's tax bill.
   The family contends the estate of Samuel I. Newhouse Sr. should
be taxed on the basis of Newhouse having held 22.2 percent of the
company's stock, resulting in a tax bill of no more than $47 million.
   The IRS argues that the estate should be taxed as if the elder
Newhouse ruled the company while he was alive.
   The IRS acknowledges it's engaged in one of its largest tax
disputes ever. The Newhouse company owns such major newspapers as
the Newark Star Ledger, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the New Orleans
Times-Picayune and the Oregonian in Portland; and magazines
including Vogue, Parade, Glamour and The New Yorker.
   The family's principal publishing company is Advance
Publications. It also runs Newhouse Broadcasting Co.
   Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. told the court Thursday that he, his
brother, their father and their two uncles all shared in the
empire's decision-making before the elder Newhouse's death.
   ``All of us in the family were obsessed with our business,'' said
Newhouse, who testified he became a ``full partner'' in the
mid-1950s after beginning his career as a cub reporter writing
obituaries.
   Newhouse said his father ``was not a dictator,'' but part of a
``consensus management'' in which the family believed ``we're all
involved with this together.''
   He said there were no formal votes to make decisions, but
admitted that consensus was sometime reached after ``heated
arguments.''
   Asked by IRS lawyer Howard P. Levine if the elder Newhouse
determined the salary and dividend declarations of the private
company, Newhouse said, ``No, it's not true.''
   Newhouse said when his father was alive, the controlling family
members would divide up the various properties and make frequent
visits to assess the operations.
   Newhouse revealed that in 1979, his salary rose from $239,500 the
previous year to nearly $408,000.
   He explained that all the family members received a large
increase that year, because they had taken over more responsibility
after the elder Newhouse became ill.
   On the trial's opening day Wednesday, Donald Newhouse also
insisted that his father did not dominate the decision-making
process.
   The case legally revolves around the worth of two classes of
Advance Publications common stock owned by Samuel Newhouse Sr. at
the time of his death, and a separate class of preferred stock owned
by five family members at that time.
   The IRS says the 10 shares of Class A stock that the elder
Newhouse held _ those controlling the company _ were worth $420
million, and the shares of Class B non-voting stock were worth
$811.8 million _ a total of $1.2 billion.
   Independent experts hired by the IRS have estimated the company's
value in 1980 as high as $2.1 billion.
   According to the Newhouses, the figures should be $8.6 million
for the Class A stock and $170.1 million for the Class B stock, for
a total of $178.8 million.

   As four Mariel Cuban detainees convicted of
crimes after fleeing their homeland in 1980 were returned to Cuba, a
government spokesman said he hoped such repatriations will speed up.
   But Auxiliary Bishop Agustin A. Roman of Miami called again for a
halt to the repatriations, saying the Cubans had been denied due
process and that their human rights could not be assured in Cuba.
   The four, who had been detained at the federal prison at
Talladega, Ala., left Birmingham shortly after 2 p.m. Thursday for
the 90-minute flight to an airport near Havana.
   Earlier in the day, U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in Birmingham
denied the request to stay the repatriation of Jose Nodarse-Valdes
and Juan Cajigal-Mulen. Nodarse-Valdes, 39, was convicted of
criminal possession of a weapon and assault, and Cajigal-Mulen, 31,
was convicted of robbery and cocaine possession, the Justice
Department said.
   The other two repatriated Thursday were Ricardo Olivera-Quintero,
28, convicted of murder, and Mario Sosa-Hernandez, 50, convicted of
illegal possession of heroin with intent to sell, said Justice
Department spokesman Joseph C. Krovisky.
   The detainees were among 125,000 people who had fled Cuba in the
so-called Mariel flotilla in 1980.
   They were the third batch of prisoners returned to Cuba since
early December 1988, when repatriation of some detainees was resumed
under a 1984 agreement with that island nation. Five detainees were
returned Dec. 2, followed by four more Dec. 15.
   About 400 Cubans are on a Justice Department list of people who
might face repatriation, and another 400 to 500 are on that list but
will not be repatriated until they finish serving prison and jail
terms, said Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Duke
Austin.
   Asked whether detainees would continue to be repatriated every
few weeks in groups of four or five, Austin said, ``We certainly
hope that the numbers will improve, but it's all subject to what the
courts do.''
   But Roman, in telephone interview from Miami, criticized the
latest deportations and reiterated his call that they be stopped.
   ``We are asking to defer the deportation until ... we will be
assured human rights will be observed,'' Roman said.
   Austin contended that special care already has been taken to
protect their legal rights.
   ``I don't know of any alien in the United States that has ever
had more legal review of their case than the Cubans have,'' Austin
said.
   ``These people have had formal hearings in front of immigration
judges,'' he said. ``They've had appeals in front of the board of
immigration appeals, made up of independent law judges. They've had
legal action in the district court in Georgia, before the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court of the United States has
reviewed their cases twice. If that isn't due process, I don't know
what is.''
   The repatriation program for 2,746 Cubans was suspended in 1985
at Cuban President Fidel Castro's insistence after 201 were
returned. In 1987, the United States and Castro agreed to resume the
repatriations.
   The 1987 agreement set off 11 days of rioting in November 1987 at
federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La.
   After the riots, the Justice Department began a review process to
determine which Cubans should be repatriated. That review resulted
in the list of the 800 to 900 people to be returned to Cuba.

   A chlorine cloud as big as six
football fields spewed from a factory Thursday near the site of the
Reagan presidential library, forcing thousands of evacuations,
backing traffic up for miles on closed roads and freeways and
injuring three firefighters.
   Chlorine escaped during most of the day from a 5,000-gallon,
30-ton tank at the Traveling West Textile Co., forming a
greenish-yellow, potentially deadly cloud on the outskirts of this
suburb northwest of Los Angeles.
   Just after dark, a specially outfitted hazardous-materials squad
was able to tighten a valve on the tank. ``They got a big wrench and
tightened the valve,'' said Battalion Chief Larry Whelan.
   Earlier, firefighters directed a high-pressure, 80-foot stream of
water on the tank, a process that caked the loose valve with ice,
temporarily sealing the leak.
   While the leak was stalled, the cloud over Simi Valley dissipated
and the valve on the tank was tightened. As a precaution, the valve
was then capped, Whelan said.
   At 7 p.m., the evacuation order was lifted, giving way to massive
traffic jams in this city of 100,000 people.
   Whelan said an estimated 11,500 people had been evacuated from
offices and homes in a 15-square-mile area after the leak was
reported at 7:40 a.m. The evacuees included at least 1,400 students,
1,000 business workers and the 125-member staff of the Simi Valley
Enterprise newspaper.
   Three members of the Fire Department's hazardous materials team
were taken to the hospital, Ventura County fire spokeswoman Susan
Chandler said. Two of them were treated and released; the other was
kept for observation.
   ``We don't expect any major injuries or deaths,'' Ms. Chandler
said.
   The gas from the factory at Madera Road and Easy Street settled
in a huge cloud over the northwest part of the city, not far from
the 100-acre foothill site where the $60 million Reagan library is
to be built.
   It spread slowly during the day, and was 100 feet by 600 yards by
late afternoon, said Ms. Chandler.
   Traveling West, which dyes bulk textiles, had been closing down
the factory in preparation to move out of state, fire officials
said. Whelan said the tank was drained on Tuesday of all but 20 to
50 gallons of liquid chlorine used to treat plant wastewater before
it was funneled into the sewers.
   Chlorine and its compounds are used for bleaching in the paper
and textile industries, for disinfecting municipal water supplies,
for household bleaches and germicides and in the production of many
organic and inorganic chemicals.

   Actress Melanie Griffith says director Alfred
Hitchcock was ``sick'' and helped sour her relationship with her
parents because of his obsession with her mother, Tippi Hedren.
   ``He didn't like kids. He never wanted me on the set and I felt
like he took mom away from me, which he did. He was obsessed with
her,'' she said in an interview in the Jan. 23 issue of US magazine.
   Hedren starred in Hitchcock's thrillers ``The Birds'' and
``Marni.''
   Griffith said that when she was 6, Hitchcock ``sent me a box
shaped like a coffin, and inside was a miniature of my mother,
exactly the way she looked in `The Birds.' He was sick.''
   Griffith, 31, star of the box-office hit ``Working Girl,'' is the
only child of Hedren and developer Peter Griffith, who divorced when
she was 4.
   She recently reconciled with her parents after a long
estrangement. Her son, Alexander, 3{, helped her realize she was
partly to blame for the rift.
   ``When you have a child, you realize what your parents went
through,'' said Griffith, who is divorced from the child's father,
actor Steven Bauer. She is engaged to marry ex-husband Don Johnson.

   Actor Tom Cruise says his childhood battle with
dyslexia prepared him for his eight-year drive to stardom.
   ``My drive and determination go back to difficult times as a
kid,'' the 26-year-old actor said in an interview to be published
Sunday in Parade magazine. ``I had to set goals and force myself to
be disciplined, because I always felt I had barriers to overcome.''
   Cruise said his dyslexia, the learning disability that makes
reading difficult, surfaced in kindergarten.
   ``I was always put in remedial classes and I felt ashamed, like
we were the dummies,'' he said.
   His mother, who had studied special education, recognized his
symptoms and tutored him.
   ``My mother said, `Look, you're dyslexic, so you'll just have to
work harder at what others take for granted.' The motivation had to
come from me. I was going into my junior year of high school and I
vowed, `This time I won't be in the remedial class.' I worked very
hard to bring my reading up to grade level so I could feel that I
fit in.''

   She's risen from successful model to movie queen,
but Kim Basinger admits she has plenty of fears, including live

   ``I really am scared to death to get up and do that kind of
stuff,'' said Basinger, who won't appear before live talk show
audiences or be an Oscar presenter.
   The stars of ``My Stepmother Is An Alien'' also says she's still
scared of the dark.
   ``There isn't a night that I don't go to sleep without looking
under my bed,'' she said in the Jan. 23 issue of US magazine. ``I
can't stand any doll in my room or anything staring at me. ... I
have terrible, terrible dreams _ especially when I eat Indian food.''
   Seeing herself onscreen, she said, can be a bad dream come true.
   ``I have to be pushed down the aisle and into a seat. It's very
uncomfortable for me _ you know, when there's a zit up there or your
lips look unusually large because of the lipstick you choose,'' she
said. ``I'm a failure at objectivity when it comes to myself.''

   TV detective Jessica Fletcher has helped
Hollywood solve another mystery: the identity of this year's ``Woman
of the Year'' in broadcasting. It's Angela Lansbury, star of CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Lansbury, who is in her fifth season playing Fletcher, will be
honored March 22 at the International Broadcasting Awards show at
the Century Plaza Hotel, an event sponsored by the Hollywood Radio
and Television Society.
   ``Murder, She Wrote'' is CBS' highest-rated series and placed
second overall in the most recent Nielsen survey. Lansbury, a
four-time Tony winner for Broadway performances that include
``Mame,'' has said this will be her last year with the show,
although she hopes to do an occasional movie based on the character.

   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey has
bought a weekend home in northwest Indiana, according to local
residents who say they have seen her out jogging.
   ``She jogs around the block. We see her out running,'' said
William Hickman, who owns a restaurant near the house.
   The property includes a carriage house, stables, helipad,
swimming pool and several satellite dishes. It is located about 65
miles east of Chicago, where Winfrey's nationally syndicated show is
produced.
   According to documents filed Nov. 1 in the LaPorte County
recorder's office, the house was purchased by First Citizens Bank of
Michigan City acting as trustee for an unidentified person. The
seller was Elmer F. Layden Jr., a son of one of the famed Four
Horsemen of Notre Dame football teams in the 1920s.
   A spokeswoman for Winfrey refused to confirm the purchase.
   ``The woman deserves some privacy,'' said spokeswoman Christine
Tardio.

   Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter,
had more public engagements than any member of Britain's royal
family last year, including her mother, according to a veteran
royal-watcher.
   Anne, 38, a mother of two, former Olympic horsewoman and
president of the Save the Children charity, made 429 official visits
last year, including opening ceremonies, receptions, lunches and
banquets. That was eight more than the Queen.
   The list is compiled annually by Tim O'Donovan, a faithful reader
of the daily Court Circular in The Times of London. He reported the
rankings in a letter to the paper Thursday.
   Third on the list was Anne's brother, heir-to-the-throne Prince
Charles, with 359. Charles was followed by his father, Prince
Philip, with 279 engagements, and his wife, Princess Diana, with 191.

   The giant plumes blasted into the sky by
volcanoes may look like ordinary clouds, but they contain
engine-clogging ash that can pose disaster for unsuspecting aircraft.
   To avoid dangerous events like those that forced two airliners to
land with engine malfunctions in 1982, a pair of federal agencies is
launching a new volcano watch program for aviators.
   The volcano alert project was announced Thursday by the National
Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration and the Federal Aviation
Administration, although a formal start-up date was not set.
   Over the years, major volcanic eruptions have spewed vast plumes
of ash to high altitudes where it was spread widely by strong winds.
   In one case in 1982, ash from Galuggung volcano in Indonesia
caused engine shutdowns in Boeing 747 airliners on June 23 and on
July 13. Both planes were forced to land when their engines
malfunctioned after being coated with the glass-like ash.
   More than 20 volcanic eruptions have been reported beneath the
North Pacific air routes between North America and Asia in just the
past five years.
   Active volcano areas include Italy, Greece, New Zealand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest,
Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, East Africa, Hawaii and the
Caribbean.
   Volcanic ash plumes can spread as high as 60,000 feet and,
especially at night, it can be difficult for a pilot to tell when a
cloud is being entered.
   In the new warning program, NOAA weather satellites, pilot
reports and other sources of information will be used to watch for
volcanic eruptions. The U.S. Geological Survey and the worldwide
Scientific Event Alert Network operated by the Smithsonian
Institution will also assist.
   While weather satellites are expected to be the primary source of
information, scientists stress that in the early stages of an
eruption it can be very difficult to tell the difference between ash
clouds and ordinary water or ice clouds. Heat imaging satellites
should help in this area.
   Once an eruption is detected, the FAA will be kept advised of the
location, height and movement of ash clouds. The Civil Aviation
Organization of the United Nations will also be informed of volcanic
cloud movement so it can advise airlines from other nations.
   The advisories will report height and plume movement at two-hour
intervals and will provide short- and long-range forecasts of cloud
movement.

<HEAD>Barry Rebuffs Suggestions That He Submit To Drug Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry Jr., whose
association with a drug suspect is being investigated by federal
prosecutors, has brushed aside suggestions that he submit to a drug
test to defuse the controversy.
   Barry told reporters Thursday that he has been drug-free in
previous tests. He repeatedly has denied using drugs or knowingly
associating with drug users.
   Barry said he has taken drug tests twice a year during routine
physical examinations.
   ``I've taken a drug test for five years in a row,'' he said.
``I've released them twice a year.''
   That comment caught Barry's press secretary, John White, by
surprise.
   ``I've been here 18 months, and I've never handled the release
(of a test),'' White said. ``I don't know anything about that.''
   Barry's physician, Dr. Vincent J. Roux, said he doesn't recall
giving Barry drug tests.
   ``I'm not sure I have ever given the mayor a drug test,'' Roux
told WUSA-TV. ``I don't remember.'' The physician said he last
examined Barry about six months ago.
   Barry, mayor of the nation's capital for a decade, is facing his
most serious political crisis following disclosures that he met last
month with a man who is the subject of a city police drug
investigation.
   Police called off an attempt to make an undercover purchase of
drugs from the man, Charles Lewis, after detectives encountered one
of the mayor's security guards while Barry was at the hotel where
Lewis was staying, authorities have said.
   Sources familiar with the investigation say the U.S. attorney's
office has subpoenaed Barry's telephone records and other documents.
Barry has acknowledged calling Assistant Police Chief Isaac Fulwood,
who is supervising the city's drug investigation, but has said he
was trying to speed up the probe and not influence its outcome.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens is investigating the incident, and is
expected to interview Barry. The mayor refused on Thursday to answer
questions about whether he would talk to prosecutors.
   Barry has acknowledged visiting Lewis, whom he described as an
acquaintance, but he denied any involvement with drugs or knowledge
that Lewis was the target of a city police drug investigation.
   The mayor said in a statement released Wednesday night that he
would cooperate with the federal probe.
   Lewis, a former city government employee, later coordinated a
joint personnel project between the governments of the city and the
Virgin Islands. He was fired from that job in April after Virgin
Islands officials became concerned that the project was becoming too
costly.
   Federal sources have said that Stephens has expanded his
investigation to include the Virgin Islands agreement, and the
Interior Department, which acts as comptroller for the island
territory, is also auditing the program.
   Joyce Fleischman, a spokeswoman for the inspector general for the
Interior Department, said auditors had not yet found a written
contract for the $260,000 project.
   District of Columbia law requires that such projects have formal,
written contracts.
   Investigators are trying to learn whether city officials billed
personal purchases to the Virgin Islands government and whether
other spending irregularities occurred.
   Auditors say that the names of some persons staying in St. Thomas
hotel rooms reserved for city officials working on the project do
not match a master list of employees provided by the city government.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Casts Doubt On Future Meetings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Economic Commission, already
facing an uncertain future, has lost a court battle to keep its
deliberations secret.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green ruled late Thursday in favor
of a suit brought by several news organizations, who had contended
that the commission's efforts to bar the public from several
upcoming hearings represented a violation of a federal open meeting
law.
   The 14-member advisory commission was created by Congress in
hopes that the panel could come up with a package of spending cuts
and tax hikes that would break the seven-year deadlock on the budget
deficit.
   Drew Lewis, co-chairman of the commission, had argued that the
commission would be unable to complete its job if it could not
hammer out differences in private.
   The commission attorneys had also contended that the members of
the panel were so prestigious that their public discussions on
economic matters could create chaos in financial markets reacting to
partial news reports on the deliberations.
   But in her ruling, Green said that Congress could have exempted
the commission from the open meetings requirements of federal law
but decided not to do so.
   ``Fully recognizing that the commission's composition would be
prestigious and its activities significant to the national need and
the international community, Congress made a deliberate choice to
make this commission subject to the open meeting requirements,'' the
judge said in her ruling.
   The judge said that her ruling did not mean that the commission
was prevented from ever meeting behind closed doors, but she said
any closed-door sessions would have to meet the strict definition in
the law that holding the session in public would ``significantly
frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.''
   The lawsuit challenging the closed meeting was filed by The
Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the Bureau of National
Affairs, which publishes financial newsletters, and Stephen
Wildstrom, an editor at Business Week.
   Public Citizen, a consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader,
joined in the case.
   Eleanor Smith, an attorney with Public Citizen, said the judge's
ruling was a victory for the public's right to know.
   ``The commission's policy deliberations touch the life and
livelihood of every American, and it is exactly that kind of
discussion that the law requires to be conducted in the open in our
democracy,'' Smith said in a statement.
   David Mathiason, executive director of the commission, said the
panel's attorneys had not yet read the ruling and therefore he could
not comment on whether the commission would appeal the decision.
   Mathiason said no decision had been made on whether to cancel the
commission's next meetings, on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The commission had already canceled a session in early December
after Green had issued a temporary restraining order blocking the
panel from closing the meeting.
   The judge's ruling, if not overturned, would mean that the
commission would have to hold its debates on ways to cut the deficit
in open sessions. The public hearings the commission has held so far
have revealed deep divisions on the panel over whether new taxes
will be needed to balance the budget.
   Because of this, critics had said it was doubtful that the panel
would be able to craft a plan that would find favor with
President-elect Bush and Congress.
   Bush, who derided the commission during the campaign as a
stalking horse for tax increases, last month appointed former Sen.
Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., and former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio, as his
representatives on the panel, but he maintained his stance that no
increase in taxes will be needed to balance the budget.

   Officials today lifted the freeze
on recruiting maids from the Philippines to work in Malaysia, but
doubled the cost for the domestic workers' services and imposed a
new immigration quota.
   The cost of employing a maid now is 4,000 ringgits ($1,477) per
month, and under government orders only 420 maids can be recruited
monthly from the Philippines, said Richard Ng, head of the
Association of Agents of Domestic Helpers Malaysia.
   Ng said 14 agencies are empowered to hire maids from the
Philippines, charging employers 1,500 ringgits ($554) a month per
their services.
   The maids are paid about 400 ringgits ($148) a month.
   They are about 3,600 Filipina maids in Malaysia. The freeze was
imposed last year after Philippines President Corazon Aquino banned
maids from taking overseas jobs. She lifted it in October.

<HEAD>Madonna, Sean Penn to Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop singer Madonna has filed for divorce to
end her turbulent three-year marriage to actor Sean Penn, a
spokesman for her record label said.
   ``I assume (the divorce was filed) in Los Angeles,'' Warner Bros.
spokesman Bob Merlis said Thursday. He did not say when she made the
filing.
   ``It is true,'' said John West, a spokesman for Penn. ``Sean and
Madonna are separated. They plan to divorce and it's amicable.''
   The announcement follows a nullified divorce filing from late
1987 and several well-publicized fights involving the hot-tempered
Penn, one of which led to a 60-day prison term. Divorce rumors have
been swirling around the couple in recent months.
   Madonna rose to fame with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a
Virgin,'' and is perhaps best known by the title of another song,
``Material Girl.'' She has also starred in the movie ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' and David Mamet's Broadway play, ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Penn, who has starred in the movies ``Colors'' and ``The Falcon
and the Snowman,'' is appearing in Los Angeles in ``Hurlyburly,'' a
play about Hollywood decadence. A spokesman for the play, Jay
Schwartz, said Penn would complete the play's run to Jan. 15.
   The couple married in August 1985 in a Malibu ocean-bluff
ceremony that was buzzed by press photographers in helicopters. They
starred together in the flop 1986 film ``Shanghai Surprise,'' in
which Madonna played a missionary smuggling opium in the Orient.
   The pugnacious Penn served more than half of a 60-day prison term
in 1987 for violating parole by punching a movie extra. At the time,
he was on probation for fighting a man he accused of trying to kiss
Madonna in a nightclub in April 1986.
   In an interview that year, he spoke fondly of his wife. ``Nothing
that I could possibly come up with is as important as her,'' he
said. ``No movie, nothing is as important as her. And that's about
the best answer I can give.''

<HEAD>Contra Leaders Urging Bush To Impose Sanctions Against Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Nicaragua's Contra resistance are
urging the incoming Bush administration to impose sanctions against
the country's Sandinista government to enforce any agreements
reached in an expected diplomatic offensive.
   Alfredo Cesar, the Contra's chief negotiator, said Thursday that
agreement also has been reached inside the Contra movement on a
modified peace plan to be presented next month at a summit meeting
of Central American presidents in El Salvador.
   Cesar said the plan was discussed with U.S. officials Thursday at
a meeting at the State Department.
   At a news conference, Cesar said the peace plan, a modification
of an initiative presented last June, is supported by all Contra
leaders. He said U.S. officials had expressed the hope ``that the
proposal would be one, not several.''
   Cesar predicted the United States will begin a major and extended
diplomatic effort to achieve democratic reform in Nicaragua soon
after President-elect Bush takes office.
   He said it is likely that military efforts against the
Sandinistas will be put on the back burner, at least for the time
being.
   ``I have no doubt myself that the Bush administration will make a
very serious diplomatic effort _ with bipartisan support from
Congress _ as the first way to get a solution,'' he said. ``It will
be a serious effort that will last several months.''
   But he said the necessary leverage to pressure the Sandinistas to
make binding commitments and concessions can only come through
imposing strong sanctions on an escalating scale.
   ``At this moment the military wing of the resistance is idle,
it's intact but it's idle; the troops are sitting in border camps,''
Cesar said.
   ``So the leverage for the upcoming phase of the negotiations has
to come from the United States and the diplomatic pressure from the
big countries of Latin America,'' he said.
   Cesar added: ``One of the most important changes I would expect
is sanctions for not complying'' with an agreement. ``That has been
the key element missing from past efforts.''
   He said sanctions should be applied against the Sandinista regime
not only by the United States but by the nations of Europe and Latin
America as well.
   Sanctions should range, Cesar said, ``from diplomatic isolation _
passing through economic pressure _ and even the use of force if
necessary.''
   ``If sanctions are not applied, the new initiative will face a
very high risk of failing also,'' he said.
   Cesar said that the U.S. officials with whom he and other Contra
leaders met made no commitments and were ``very clear in saying they
could not speak for the Bush administration.''
   Cesar said Contra leaders will offer a single, unified peace
proposal including three major modifications and additions to
previous plans.
   They are:
   _ The elimination of some sections that Cesar said were
considered ``too perfectionist.'' For example, Cesar said the
Contras dropped a condition that all Sandinista-appointed
magistrates resign. Instead they called on the Sandinistas to give
assurances that the nation's Supreme Court ``will be composed of
independent people.''
   _ The timetable of the plan was adjusted to provide ``more
flexibility and more graduality.'' Deadlines of 15 to 30 days for
meeting conditions of the plan have been extended to 60 days or so,
Cesar said.
   _A new section has been added proposing a national and
international effort to rebuild Nicaragua's economy once democratic
reforms are under way. Cesar said this would include an appeal to
the United States, Europe and Latin America for economic aid.
   ``That is a totally new element,'' Cesar said of the final point.

<HEAD>Complaints Drop But Airlines' On-Time Record Worsens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of consumer complaints against U.S.
airlines fell in December to the lowest level in four years, the
Department of Transportation said.
   The department also reported Thursday that the on-time
performance of the 13 largest carriers in November worsened. The
on-time mark had held above 80 percent for seven previous months,
including October's 83.4 percent, but fell to 77.7 percent in
November.
   The monthly performance reports also showed a slight increase in
November for mishandled baggage, with 6.17 reports per 1,000
passengers, compared with 6.09 a month earlier.
   The department said it received 724 consumer complaints about the
airlines in December, down 40 percent from November and the fewest
recorded since December 1984, when the total was 552. For the year,
the 23,844 complaints represented a 47 percent improvement over 1987.
   Though the complaint statistics are released at the same time as
the on-time and mishandled-baggage data, they routinely represent
different months, since the complaint figures are more quickly
compiled.
   Eastern Airlines, which early this year was consistently among
the worst on-time performers, had the best record in November, 85.3
percent. Eastern also led October's list, with a 90.3 percent mark.
   ``On time'' means within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival, and the
records do not count flights delayed because of mechanical problems.
   Eastern was followed by Delta, with an on-time record of 79.8
percent in November, and American West, at 79.2 percent. United had
the worst mark of the major carriers, 73.8 percent, likely because
of its concentration of flights into Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport, plagued by congestion and air traffic control problems.
Nearly one-third of all flights into O'Hare were delayed.
   But the worst on-time arrival record among the airports belonged
to San Francisco, with a mark of 59.4 percent for all flights.
   The airports at Charlotte, N.C., Atlanta and Salt Lake City led
the list for on-time arrivals, each exceeding 81 percent.
   Piedmont registered the worst record for mishandled baggage, with
8.01 reports per 1,000 passengers. Southwest had the best mark, at
3.49.

<HEAD>Research Inconclusive On Breast Cancer Risk From The Pill, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration committee is
recommending no changes in the use of birth control pills, saying
new research on a possible link between oral contraceptives and
breast cancer is inconclusive.
   The committee, in an announcement following a daylong meeting
Thursday, said that it found the new studies ``did not show a cause
and effect relationship between oral contraceptives and breast
cancer'' even though portions of the studies suggested a greater
risk for the cancer among women who started taking the pill at a
very young age.
   ``The studies are conflicting and inconsistent so it is difficult
to draw a conclusion,'' the committee statement said.
   The committee also declined to suggest any major changes in the
labeling that accompanies the drug.
   The 11-member committee is composed of specialists in obstetrics
and gynecology from 10 states. Their recommendations will be
evaluated by officials within the FDA.
   During the hearing, Jeffrey Perlman, a federal researcher, told
the committee that no studies, including the most recent, establish
a clear link between breast cancer and birth control pills.
   Perlman, chairman of the contraceptive evaluation branch of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human development, told the
committee ``there is no overall increase in risks for breast cancer
for oral contraceptive users.''
   Recent studies by Boston University and the Royal College of
General Practitioners in England which suggest some connection
between breast cancer and the pill, he said, are ``confusing and
contradictory.''
   Perlman said his findings were based on analysis of a massive
government survey, called the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, and
actual occurrence of cancers since 1973.
   The results, he said, show ``there is a large breast cancer
epidemic in the United States,'' but the increase in the disease
cannot be attributed to birth control pills.
   An FDA advisory committee earlier heard reports from Clifford R.
Kay, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners study,
and Samuel Shapiro, director of a study undertaken at the Boston
University School of Medicine.
   Both studies showed some increases in breast cancer among some
subgroups of women taking the pill, but even the researchers said
their own the studies were not consistent and perhaps flawed.
   ``We simply don't know if pill use is associated with a
significant increase in breast cancer,'' Kay admitted.
   He said the English study, which involved some 46,000 women over
a 20-year period, did suggest an increase in breast cancer among
women who have taken the pill for two to seven years, but Kay said
the findings contradict many other studies and did not clearly show
a direct cause-and-effect relationship.
   Shapiro said the Boston University study, which involved more
than 6,000 women in four cities over a 12-year period, showed there
appeared to be an increased risk of cancer among women aged 35 who
have taken the pill for five years or more.
   But he said the studies also show a statistical suggestion of
greater risk for women who have taken the pill for only three
months. This finding, said Shapiro, is ``proof of a bias in our
data.''
   Rich Salem, a spokesman for Ortho Phamaceutical, maker of
Ortho-Novum, a leading birth control pill, said the ``most recent
findings are apparently in conflict with other studies and seem to
be in conflict with each other.''

<HEAD>Teaching Hospitals Are Overcompensated, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration and a congressional watchdog
agency agree that Medicare payments to compensate teaching hospitals
for higher patient-care costs are hundreds of millions of dollars
too high.
   A report by the General Accounting Office released Thursday said
the payments to offset indirect expenses from the teaching
hospitals' medical education programs for interns and residents
could be cut in half.
   Such a cut would amount to as much as $1.2 billion this year,
which GAO suggested could be redistributed among all hospitals with
Medicare patients.
   The Department of Health and Human Services, in comments included
in the report, agreed that the teaching hospitals are being
overcompensated. It said the adjustment factor that inflates their
standard reimbursement should be lowered.
   Medicare spokesman Dennis Siebert declined to comment on whether
cuts in these payments would be proposed in President Reagan's 1990
budget, which is to be given to Congress next week.
   The extra payments are projected to total $2.3 billion in the
current fiscal year for more than 150 major teaching hospitals and
nearly 800 smaller teaching hospitals that treat Medicare patients.
   Teaching hospitals receive extra payments for the direct costs of
providing medical education, including salaries and fringe benefits
for residents and teaching physicians. Those payments, amounting to
about as much as the payments for indirect costs, were not addressed
by the report.
   The payments are in addition to the standard hospital
reimbursements paid by Medicare, the federal health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled. Medicare payments to more than
5,400 teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the current fiscal year
are projected to total about $50 billion.
   The adjustment for the higher indirect costs at teaching
hospitals is determined by a complicated formula that takes into
account such factors as the greater number of diagnostic procedures
performed at these facilities, their higher staffing ratios and
increased record-keeping.
   The Medicare payment system takes into account cost differences
among hospitals related to local wages, patient mix and location,
but because of shortcomings in the formula, Congress has inflated
the payments covering indirect costs. This was done in recognition
that teaching facilities are located primarily in urban areas and
treat a disproportionate share of severely ill and low-income
Medicare patients.
   Congress set the adjustment factor for fiscal years 1989-95 at
7.65 percent, but the report said the figure could be lowered to
within a range of 3.73 percent to 6.26 percent. In that range, the
government could save from $416 million to $1.2 billion in the
current fiscal year. Savings could be as much as $1.5 billion in
fiscal year 1991, the report said.
   However, GAO recommended an adjustment factor of 5.09 percent for
fiscal years 1989-95, which it said would save $776 million this
year, $843 million next year and $1 billion in fiscal year 1991.
   In comments included in the report, HHS Inspector General Richard
Kusserow said President Reagan's budget for the current fiscal year
proposed reducing the adjustment factor to 4.05 percent, which would
be an even deeper cut than advocated by GAO. Congress, however, did
not agree and set the figure at nearly double that rate.
   The department took issue with several aspects of the report,
including some of GAO's technical decisions on data used in the
formula.
   The Association of American Medical Colleges, a national group
representing academic medical center and community teaching
hospitals and medical schools, said GAO's estimates were too low and
fail to account for some of the added costs teaching hospitals face.

   Better-educated Americans smoke far less since the
surgeon general first warned of tobacco's dangers 25 years ago, but
by 2000, 30 percent of those who never went beyond high school will
still be lighting up, researchers reported today.
   Poorer and less educated people are missing the message that
smoking is linked to cancer and other numerous health problems, said
researchers at the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``Smoking prevalence has declined across all educational groups,
but the decline has occurred five times faster among the higher
educated compared with the less educated,'' they reported in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   One reason may be that much of the antismoking message has gone
out in newspapers and medical journals, typically read by the better
educated, said Dr. Michael C. Fiore, a leader of the CDC group.
   ``Little has gone out via mass media, especially television,'' he
said in a telephone interview Thursday from Madison, Wis., where he
is now an assistant professor of medicine at the University of
Wisconsin Medical Center.
   From 1974 to 1985, the number of U.S. smokers among people who
had completed four years of college plummeted by more than a third,
from 28.5 percent to 18.4 percent, the CDC group said.
   But the corresponding drop among people who never graduated from
high school was 2.1 percent, from 36.3 percent to 34.2 percent, the
researchers found.
   Fiore said that while the number of smokers overall is decreasing
steadily _ from more than 40 percent in the 1960s to less than 29
percent by 1987 _ differences in smoking patterns based on
educational status stand out more than those based on gender and
race.
   About 1.3 million Americans quit smoking annually between 1974
and 1985, but about 1 million young people joined the smoking ranks
each year during the 1980s, the researchers said.
   The researchers, co-led by John P. Pierce, said that if the trend
continues, 22 percent of the population 20 and older in the year
2000 will smoke, compared with 30 percent in 1985.
   They further predicted that while less than 10 percent of college
graduates will be smokers in 2000, at least 30 percent of those with
no more than a high school education will be puffing.
   ``Public health interventions must be made more relevant to these
slowly changing groups,'' the researchers said. ``Only when such
targeted efforts are successful will smoking have the potential to
lose its distinction as the number one preventable cause of death in
the United States.''
   A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a Washington-based group
representing the tobacco industry, said the study only confirms that
people in that segment of society enjoy smoking.
   ``The antismoking forces should not adopt some paternalistic
attitude saying these people are less in a position to take
information on smoking and health and make a rational decision on
whether or not they should smoke,'' said Gary Miller.
   Smoking-related deaths claim 390,000 Americans annually, said
Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society in
New York.
   Smoking is linked to lung cancer, heart disease, chronic
obstructive lung disease, emphysema, and cancers of the mouth,
larynx, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, bladder and possibly cervix,
Ms. Schellenbach said.
   The researchers based their figures on data collected by the
National Center for Health Statistics through the National Health
Interview Surveys.
   Data was collected in seven surveys over an 11-year period, with
sample sizes varying from 10,000 to 40,000 adults 20 years old and
older who were chosen to represent the population as a whole, Fiore
said.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who during his tenure has warned
of the dangers of inhaling other people's smoke and has branded
nicotine an addictive substance, is scheduled to issue a new report
on progress in the fight against smoking on Jan. 11. That is the
25th anniversary of the first report from the surgeon general's
office that pronounced smoking a health hazard.

<HEAD>Panama Says U.S. Navy Exercises Violated Canal Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. naval forces violated a major
treaty by staging ``intimidating, provocative and unapproved''
military exercises in the Panama Canal, the Defense Forces said.
   A communique from the Defense Forces, commanded by strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noreiga, said Thursday's manuevers violated the
Torrijos-Carter Treaty because all U.S. and Panamanian military
operations in the canal must be coordinated by both countires.
   The communique said nine U.S. Navy combat patrol boats ``fully
armed with its crew in a state of readiness'' took part in morning
exercises Thursday at the canal's Pacific Ocean entrance. It said
the boats were escorted by two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters.
   Under the treaty signed in September 1977, all military
operations in the 50-mile waterway linking the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans must be coordinated by a canal defense group that includes
representatives of both countries.
   Canal-based U.S. military officials could not be immediately
reached for comment.
   The Panamanian military said it considered the exercise ``an
intimidating, provocative and unapproved action against the civilian
population and members of the national and international merchant
marine community.''
   The communique said participating in the exercise were three
103-foot patrol boats, four 45-foot patrol boats and two 20-foot
patrol boats with outboard motors.
   The Defense Forces said it lodged complaints with the U.S.
government and the canal defense group but received no explanation.
   A Panamanian television station Thursday night broadcast a tape
of the exercise near the Point of the Americas, at the canal's
Pacific Ocean entrance.
   The U.S. military's Southern Command operates along the canal,
with about 13,000 troops and 11 military installations.
   About 3,000 U.S. troops left Panama in March after the U.S.
government imposed economic sanctions against Panama in an attempt
to force out Noreiga, the Panamanian strongman.
   Last February, the Noriega-dominated National Assembly ousted
elected President Eric Arturo Delvalle and replaced him with
Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma.
   Delvalle had tried to dismiss Noriega in February after a federal
grand jury in Miami indicted the military leader on drug trafficking
charges.

<TEXT>
   Nearly $20 million, most of it in neatly stacked
$20 bills, has been seized here in what authorities said was the
largest cash haul in the history of the war on drugs.
   Eleven people, allegedly members of a powerful Colombian drug
cartel that controls cocaine distribution in the metropolitan area,
were arrested in the raid Thursday.
   ``It is the largest cash seizure in a drug case in the world,''
said Robert Stutman, head of the Drug Enforcement Agency's New York
office, at a news conference held among dozens of ordinary brown
boxes brimming with $20 bills.
   ``This is the result of people laying down $20 a shot'' for
cocaine, he said.
   Stutman said $19 million in neatly stacked $20 bills and some
$100 bills were found in boxes inside a passenger van at a Queens
warehouse called Zoom Furniture.
   An additional $630,000, three loaded submachine guns, a pistol
and detailed business ledgers were seized after task force members
executed search warrants at two private homes in Queens and on Long
Island.
   ``The accounts showed they were doing about $1 million a day in
cash,'' by selling cocaine throughout the city, Stutman said.
   Authorities believe the money was heading out of the country to
be laundered. The 10 men and one woman arrested were charged with
conspiracy to distribute narcotics, sai Ann Driscoll of the U.S.
attorney's office.
   Those arrested were all believed to be members of the powerful
Cali drug cartel, which law enforcement authorities say controls
cocaine distribution in the region.
   Stutman said the suspects were probably illegal aliens.
   Despite the magnitude of the haul, Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward said losing the money would barely cause a ripple in cartel
operations and stressed that even record seizures would not solve
the drug problem.
   ``There are still three more legs on the table that have to be
addressed and they are cutting demand, giving treatment on demand
(to addicts) and prevention through education.''
   The cash haul resulted from intensive surveillance by a task
force made up of members of the DEA, city and state police, in which
they concentrated on activities at the warehouse.
   Those arrested were identified as Carlos Earnesto Restrepo, 30,
of Texas; Jose Rivera, 29, of Great Neck, N.Y.; Omar Ospina, 38,
Alexander Lara, 20, Cesar Ramirez, 24, Jorge Alberto Orrego, 25,
Aguilera Martinez, 43, Carlos M. Andrade, 28, Jose I. Rincon, 32,
Moises Agusto Gomez, 24, all of New York and Ana Milena Ruiz of
Houston, Texas.

   Greg Epker knows how his wife killed their
four children and herself, but he doesn't know why _ and authorities
say he likely never will.
   The family had some financial problems, but chances are ``pretty
strong'' the motive will never surface, said Sheriff Robert Nall.
   ``He's completely mystified. ... He can't understand it either,''
Nall said of Epker, who was hospitalized for shock after he
discovered the grisly scene upon returning to the family home from
his job at a sign company in nearby Quincy.
   Police pieced together the chain of events on Thursday, a day
after the murder-suicide rocked this western Illinois town of 1,000
in the rolling farm country about 140 miles northwest of St. Louis.
   First, Sheila Epker drowned her oldest daughter, Casey, 8, in a
bathtub. Then she placed pillows and blankets on the kitchen floor,
making beds for her three other children to die in, and turned on
the gas stove.
   When the gas proved too slow a method, the 27-year-old housewife
marched her children _ dressed in their Sunday best _ into the
living room one by one, sat them on a couch and shot each in the
head.
   Then she, too, sat on the couch and took her own life with the
same gun.
   Nall said Mrs. Epker had no history of mental problems, nor had
she shown any signs of alcohol or drug abuse. He acknowledged they
had financial problems, but ``no more than any other young family.''
   But the Quincy Herald-Whig reported Thursday that St. Mary
Hospital had sued the Epkers over $3,900 in bills accumulated since
1980. The hospital won the judgment and Epker's wages were docked
Dec. 28, the newspaper said.
   ``There's a lot of speculation and there are a lot of ways to go
with it,'' Nall said.
   Neighbors said the family had been in the modest one-story house
about seven years. The house has a neatly kept front yard and a set
of children's swings in back. They described Mrs. Epker as outwardly
cheerful, but said she had little contact with neighbors.
   ``She would wave or smile, but she never came over or had any
conversations with me,'' said Vera Oenning, who said Mrs. Epker had
spoken to her only once in seven years though the families lived on
about 50 yards apart.
   The Epker children _ daughters Casey, 8, Shannon, 5, and Mandy,
2, and 1-year-old son Lance _ were ``sweet, cute, just as cute as
buttons,'' said neighbor Karen Dingerson. ``The oldest one was
always ushering the others around.
   ``You wonder with such beautiful children and a nice home ... But
you never know what's going on behind closed doors, what's going on
in someone's mind,'' she said.
   All but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle, the
sheriff said. Mrs. Epker apparently tried to strangle Casey before
drowning the child in the bathtub, Nall said.
   Casey had been a second-grader at Mendon Elementary School, where
Principal Dean Herring described her as ``a little blonde-headed
girl who always had a smile on her face and usually a kind word to
say.''
   Her classmates were bewildered, Herring said, adding a
psychologist was standing by.
   ``I don't see something as tragic as this passing over in a
couple of days,'' he said. ``It's something we will be dealing with
for a while.''

   Libya and the United States disputed each
other's facts, honor and circumstances in the downing of two Libyan
jets by U.S. warplanes during a contentious emergency session of the
U.N. Security Council.
   The two sides are expected to resume their verbal dogfight today
when the session moves into its second day.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser, who sought the urgent
meeting, called the U.S. action a ``premediated act of aggression
and a prelude to large-scale aggression'' against economic and
military installations.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun told the council the two U.S.
Navy fighter jets that shot down the MiG-23s over the Mediterranean
on Wednesday acted in self-defense because they faced ``imminent
threat of being shot down by the intercepting Libyan aircraft.''
   Okun said the United States considers the matter closed.
   Libya repeated its claim that the jets were unarmed
reconnaissance planes.
   That disputed a Pentagon videotape shot from one of the U.S. jets
showing one Libyan plane carrying four missiles. The videotape,
released Thursday, showed the U.S. fighters tried high-speed
maneuvers five times to avoid the MiG planes before they fired.
   Libya wants the 15-member Security Council, the most powerful
U.N. body, to formally condemn the U.S. military action.
   On Thursday, the United States and Libya traded charges and six
other speakers _ representing the Arab League, Bahrain, Burkina
Faso, Cuba, Syria and Tunisia _ condemned the U.S. action.
   However, the United States and Britain, two of five permanent
members with veto power, were expected to kill any resolution of
condemnation. British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said Thursday
that the U.S. account of the clash showed ``it is clear they acted
in self-defense.''
   The United States, Britain and France cast vetoes to kill a
condemnation in the council of the April 1986 U.S. air raid against
Libya in Benghazi and Tripoli. About 100 people were killed in the
attack, including the daughter of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   The other permanent council members are China and the Soviet
Union, whose Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennedy I. Gerasimov,
sharply criticized the U.S. attack as a show of ``state terrorism.''
   Other members of the Security Council are Algeria, Brazil,
Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and
Yugoslavia.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov told reporters the
Soviet Union had warned the United States before Thursday's attack
not to escalate tensions with Libya over an alleged Libyan chemical
weapons plant.
   ``We gave a warning signal to Washington to show restraint in
that area,'' Belonogov said, ``not to raise the tension in the area.
We were concerned by this (U.S. anti-Libyan) campaign in connection
with a so-called chemical weapons plant.''
   Belongov urged the United States to consider Libya's offer of
inspection of the plant, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, the Libyan
capital. The United States says such an inspection would be
inconclusive because the plant could be quickly dismantled and the
offending materials hidden.
   Libya claims the plant is only for the manufacturing of
pharmaceuticals but the United States and Britain say it is intended
to produce chemical weapons and is ready to go on line.
   U.S. officials have denied any connection between the air action
and allegations about the chemical plant.
   Okun, the acting permanent U.S. representative, said ``when it
comes to a choice beween the word of the Libyans and the word of the
United States, I think the world knows whose word to accept.''
   In Washington, the Reagan administration has made no final
decision about whether to attack the plant, but Pentagon contingency
plans suggest the first-ever use of cruise missiles with non-nuclear
warheads, sources say.
   The sources said use of the unmanned Tomahawk cruise missile is
``a preferred contingency'' because no pilots would be involved and
because of the missile's accuracy.

   The U.S. dollar closed higher Friday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices slightly rebounded on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 125.97 yen, up 0.64 yen from Thursday's
close of 125.33 yen. It opened at 126.10 yen and traded between
125.70-126.15 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed 25.75 points or 0.09
percent higher to finish trading at 30,209.54, despite a decline
during morning trading.
   A majority of institutional investors however have moved to the
sidelines following reports Emperor Hirohito, 87, was in serious
condition, one dealer said, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened higher in Tokyo
following overnight gains in New York, where it finished at 125.98
yen.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer attributed the dollar's firmness to
investors' expectations of higher U.S. interest rates.
   It is widely believed in Tokyo that the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board will raise its discount rate if December's jobless figure, due
out later Friday, shows economic strength. The discount rate is the
central bank's lending charge to financial institutions.

<HEAD>FAA To Require Collision Warnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large air transport planes will be required
within three years to install systems which will automatically warn
a pilot of an impending collision with another aircraft, according
to regulations issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Ending years of research and controversy, the FAA on Thursday
issued the requirement that all commercial jetliners with 30 or more
seats have the device, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System,
known as T-CAS II, by Dec. 30, 1991.
   In addition, turbine-powered commuter aircraft with 10 to 30
passenger seats must carry a less sophisticated collision system,
known as T-CAS I, within six years. The system alerts pilots to
potential collisions but does not provide them with avoidance
maneuvers as does T-CAS II.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, in making the T-CAS II
announcement Thursday, said the new rule will be ``one of the most
significant safety initiatives in recent years. It will provide an
added margin of safety for the flying public. This equipment will
provide pilots with an independent backup to the safety services
which they already receive from the air traffic control system.''
   For some time, the FAA has let it be known it was preparing such
a requirement. Several airlines have been using operational T-CAS
units on a test basis on a small number of planes for more than a
year.
   The FAA and industry have been testing various versions of a
collision avoidance system since the mid-1970s and the government
announced in l981 that it would pursue development of the so-called
T-CAS system for use by commercial jetliners.
   The agency estimates the rule will affect 3,364 existing U.S.
commercial airplanes and an additional 3,100 airplanes that are
expected to be added to the airline fleets by the year 2003. The
cost to the airlines of equipping these aircraft is put at $806.3
million, according to the FAA.
   The T-CAS system, installed in the cockpit, alerts a pilot if
there is another aircraft in the vicinity and on a potential
collision course.
   A computer analyzes the flight path of both aircraft and if the
potential for a collision increases, a computerized voice advises
the pilot whether to ``climb'' or ``descend'' to avoid the other
plane.
   The system works only if the second aircraft has a similar system
or a so-called ``Mode-C'' transponder which provides altitude
information. Although many private airplanes do not have a Mode-C
transponder, the FAA requires such equipment in most airspace used
by commercial jetliners.
   Airline pilots have supported development of a collision
avoidance system, but the pilots union has not favored the T-CAS
system being required by the FAA.
   The 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association has pushed for
development of a more sophisticated system that would give not only
descend and climb directions, but also direction to turn left or
right to avoid a collision.
   The FAA, however, decided not to require the more sophisticated
system which has not been fully tested as yet in order to speed up
installation of the devices.

   The debate between the United States and Libya over
an alleged chemical weapons plant may overshadow a 140-nation
conference on the use of poison gas and other chemical arms. Such
weapons have been called a poor nations' atomic bomb.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and a Libyan delegate plan to
attend the opening session Saturday, and tension is expected.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France said his government hopes
the five-day conference will not ``deviate from its agenda'' because
of the shooting down Wednesday of two Libyan jet fighters by U.S.
Navy planes.
   Delegates are expected to discuss changes in the 1925 Geneva
Protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemical
weapons. The document does not forbid making the weapons and has no
enforcement provisions.
   With their effectiveness, relative economy and ease of
production, such weapons are feared because they greatly increase
the killing power of smaller, less armed countries.
   Many countries want to give the protocol teeth and spur
negotiations on a treaty banning production of chemical arms. They
include the United States and Soviet Union, the only two countries
that admit having the weapons.
   Both French and U.S. officials indicated they would honor a
``gentlemen's agreement'' against name-calling at the conference.
   The United States has been vocal in the weeks before the
conference about what is says is a big chemical weapons plant Libya
has built south of Tripoli and is ready to go on-line. Libya says
the factory only manufactures pharmaceuticals.
   President Reagan refused to rule out military action against the
plant at Rabta. Washington said Wednesday's air action over the
Mediterranean was not related to the allegations.
   But Shultz said Wednesday that the United States may not have to
level the plant if Libya is willing to work out a deal.
   ``Whether there is something else that can be done, we'll see,''
he told reporters on a flight to Paris from Washington. He did not
elaborate.
   The private Stockholm International Peace Research Institute says
at least 10 countries are reliably reported to have chemical
weapons. The United States says about 20 either have produced the
weapons or are capable of doing so.
   Iraq's use of mustard gas in its eight-year war with Iran, and
charges that it used poison gas last fall on rebellious Iraqi Kurds,
have kindled public interest in chemical weapons.
   Reagan proposed the conference in his address to the U.N. General
Assembly in September. France, as official keeper of the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, offered to be host for the meeting.
   President Francois Mitterrand will give the opening address when
the conference convenes at the headquarters of the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization. U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar also will speak.
   French officials emphasized the conference is diplomatic in
nature and will end with a final communique that has no legal
weight, but both Washington and Moscow want action.
   The United States wants to enhance the U.N. secretary-general's
role in investigating allegations of chemical weapons use. It also
will urge industrialized nations to deny such technology to Libya
and approve economic sanctions on those who help proliferate use of
the weapons.
   Soviet officials seek an agreement requiring all nations,
including the superpowers, to destroy existing chemical weapons over
a 10-year period.
   Mitterrand also has urged a sanctioning role for the United
Nations. He also has called for an embargo on deliveries of products
and technologies involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons and
a further embargo on all arms to ``nations in question.''
   The protocol is a one-page document with 118 signatories that has
long been considered inadequate. The Geneva conference on chemical
weapons, which would ban use, production and stockpiling, has
languished for nearly a decade.

   Workers at a company repeatedly cited
for illegally dumping chemicals released a cloud of deadly chlorine
gas when they failed to tighten a valve, forcing 11,500 people to
evacuate, officials said.
   Three firefighters were injured and massive traffic jams snarled
this Los Angeles suburb before authorities capped the leak and
lifted the evacuation order Thursday evening, more than 11 hours
after the gas was first reported.
   ``We don't expect any major injuries or deaths,'' Ventura County
Fire Department spokeswoman Susan Chandler said.
   The chlorine escaped from a 5,000-gallon tank at the Travelin'
West Textile Co. and formed a greenish-yellow cloud over an area as
big as six football fields on the outskirts of this city of 100,000
people.
   The gas ``forms an acid in your lungs that creates blisters, and
you could die,'' said fire department spokesman Kevin Nester.
   Battalion Chief Larry Whelan said workers drained the tank of all
but 20 to 50 gallons of liquid chlorine on Tuesday, but instead of
tightening the valve with a wrench, ``they only hand-tightened it.''
   The chlorine, used to treat the plant's wastewater before
disposal, turns into a gas when released into the air.
   Deputy City Manager Jay Corey said the city had fought Travelin'
West for two years over its dumping of dyes and other chemicals in
city sewers.
   He said the city cited the company several times in 1987 and 1988
for illegal dumping and then sought a court injunction. The city
recently won a cease-and-desist order requiring Travelin' West to
stop discharging dyes and chemicals into the sewers by Jan. 1, he
said.
   Two weeks ago, Travelin' West informed the city it would close
the plant and move, Corey said. Authorities believe the firm was
shutting down its operation, he said, but it was unclear whether the
chlorine tank was emptied earlier this week as part of that move.
   Late Thursday, city officials obtained a temporary restraining
order barring any plant employee from entering the building until an
investigation can be completed.
   Travelin' West officials did not immediately answer telephone
calls, and could not be located by city officials.
   After the leak was discovered, firefighters directed a
high-pressure, 80-foot stream of water on the tank that caked the
loose valve with ice and temporarily sealed the leak. That allowed
the cloud to dissipate and enabled firefighters to tighten the
valve, Whelan said.
   Just after dark, a specially outfitted hazardous-materials squad
was able to tighten the leaking valve on the tank. ``They got a big
wrench and tightened the valve,'' said Whelan. As a precaution, the
valve was then capped, he added.
   Whelan estimated 11,500 people were ordered to evacuate offices
and homes in a five-square-mile area after the leak was reported at
7:40 a.m. Rail traffic through Simi Valley also was halted.
   The gas settled in a huge cloud over the northwest part of the
city, not far from the 100-acre foothill site where the $60 million
Reagan library is to be built. The cloud spread slowly during the
day, covering an area 100 feet by 600 yards by late afternoon, said
Ms. Chandler.
   An evacuation center at Royal High School had to be abandoned as
the evacuation area grew. The center was moved to Simi Valley High
School several miles east of the trouble zone where Red Cross
volunteers set up the gymnasium for 2,000 people.
   People were allowed to return to the area at 7 p.m., producing
more huge traffic jams in this city 40 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
   Two members of the fire department's hazardous materials team
were treated at a hospital and released, while a third member was
kept for observation, officials said.
   One of the most common chemicals in the United States, chlorine
is used to kill bacteria in swimming pools and drinking water
supplies, as a bleaching agent in paper and textile manufacturing,
and as a building block in manufacturing other chemicals.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Again, Share Prices Up A Bit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both the U.S. dollar and share prices finished
higher in Tokyo markets today amid concerns over Japanese Emperor
Hirohito's health and the upcoming release of the U.S. jobless
figure, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 125.97 yen, up 0.64 yen from Thursday's
finish of 125.33 yen. Opening higher at 126.10 yen, the U.S.
currency moved in a range of 125.70-126.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 59.87-point
loser Thursday, regained 25.75 points or 0.09 percent to end trading
at 30,209.54.
   The Nikkei index started higher in Tokyo following an overnight
gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, but it quickly
plunged after news reports about the weakening yen and the emperor's
condition taking a turn for the worse.
   But the index recovered from its morning loss when
defense-related issues began attracting investors, said a dealer
with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   Investors increasingly bought steels in the afternoon, which
helped the index's recovery, said the dealer, who spoke on the
condition he not be named.
   Some investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the U.S.
jobless figure for December, due out later today in Washington, the
dealer said. But he said market sentiment was quite optimistic,
expecting no major changes in U.S. economic policy before the
President-elect Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 850 million
shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed higher than its
Thursday finish, though slightly lower than its opening today in
cautious trading in anticipation of the U.S. unemployment rate,
dealers said.
   It was widely believed that the currency's higher opening in
Tokyo followed its overnight one-yen jump in New York, where it
finished at 125.98 yen.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer said the dollar's firmness was a result of
investors' expectation for a U.S. interest rate hike if the jobless
rate improves.
   Some Tokyo investors believed that U.S. banks might raise their
discount rates if the jobless rate is lower, which would indicate
the U.S. economy has been steadily growing.
   An estimated $8.8 billion were exchanged in spot trading.

   Libya reportedly is moving its jet fighters to desert
oases and posting machine gun nests around public buildings, saying
the United States plans an attack to follow up on its downing of two
Libyan planes.
   The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero reported from Tripoli on
Thursday that Libyan fighter jets were transferred inland from
coastal bases, some as far south as the heart of the Sahara desert,
to be out of range of possible attack by U.S. naval forces in the
Mediterranean.
   An Italian in Tripoli said by telephone that the capital's
streets were calm but that public buildings were fortified with
machine gun posts one day after U.S. jets shot down two Libyan MiG
fighters over the Mediterranean.
   Soldiers stood in for traffic police in the streets, the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug said.
   The government refused entry to 30 foreign journalists at Tripoli
airport Thursday, and an aide at the Information Ministry indicated
the 200 journalists now in Libya also may be asked to leave.
   The Libyan government newspaper Al-Fajr El-Jadid on Thursday said
the shooting ``clearly demonstrates that the United States intends
to attack Libya. The United States (fleet in the Mediterranean) is
there to attack Libya and the attack against our airplanes is
evidence of this.''
   The Reagan administration said Libya was lying when it claimed
the planes were unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. Pentagon spokesman
Dan Howard said photos from an American jet showed one of the
fighters carried four missiles.
   A U.S. videotape of the incident, released Thursday, showed the
U.S. fighters tried high-speed maneuvers five times to avoid the MiG
planes before they fired.
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi did not appear publicly or had issued no
statements by Thursday evening. On Wednesday, the Libyan leader
denounced the incident as American ``terrorism'' and vowed to ``meet
challenge with challenge.''
   On Thursday, Libyan officials promised Western journalists who
arrived earlier in Tripoli a visit to a plant that the U.S.
administration charges was built recently to manufacture chemical
weapons. Gadhafi insists the plant is a pharmaceutical factory.
   By evening, the promised visit to the site, in Rabta 60 miles
southwest of Tripoli, had not materialized.
   Syria's health minister, Mohammed Ayad Chatti, who said he
visited the plant recently, told reporters the facility was ``a
small factory, not high-tech,'' and that it manufactures medicine.
   Asked about reports it was ringed with missiles and artillery, he
replied, ``That's because it cost a lot.''
   Wednesday's attack was the second U.S. strike against Libyan
targets in less than two years.
   The United States bombed Libya in April 1986 for suspected Libyan
involvement in a West Berlin disco frequented by U.S. servicemen.
   Libya's official media said Palestinian leader Col. Saeed Mousa
arrived in Tripoli on Wednesday night and issued a statement
supporting Libya after the U.S. action.
   Mousa, also known as Abu Mousa, leads the Fatah-Uprising faction,
which is backed by Syria. It broke with Yasser Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 1983.
   On Wednesday night, Libyan media reported a message of solidarity
from Ahmed Jibril, who leads the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command. The group has been mentioned as a
possible suspect in last month's bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in
Scotland, in which 270 people were killed.

<HEAD>Actress Escorted Off Delta Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police escorted actress Zsa Zsa Gabor off a Delta
Air Lines flight after she refused to keep her dogs in travel
kennels, an airline spokesman said.
   Ms. Gabor, 69, was traveling from Los Angeles to her home in Palm
Beach, Fla., with an assistant and two Shih Tzu dogs when the
confrontation occurred Thursday night during a stopover at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   During the flight, she ``removed her two (dogs) from their
kennels,'' airline spokesman William D. Berry said. ``The Delta
agent came aboard. He asked her six times to comply. She refused to
comply. Each time he was responded to with considerable vulgarity.''
   Atlanta police officers were then called by the agent to escort
Ms. Gabor off the aircraft.
   Dogs are not permitted to run free in the cabin of the airplane,
Berry said.
   ``Passengers complained,'' he said. ``The captain asked her to
put them back in the kennel. All she had to do was leave the dogs in
the kennel, but she would not comply. We asked her to do nothing
more than any other passenger.''
   Ms. Gabor contended the dogs were not disturbing anyone, and said
the Delta agent on the plane ``was screaming at me like I was some
criminal.''
   ``I was so upset you can't imagine. This is not the end of
this,'' she said before boarding an Eastern Airlines flight to
complete the last leg of her trip.
   ``If I live to be 100 I'll never understand why five policemen
would have to come and take me off the plane,'' Ms. Gabor said. ``As
long as I live, I don't want to hear the word Delta.''

   Two French television journalists charged with
trying to ship bogus bombs through Kennedy International Airport to
test security don't believe the act was illegal, their attorney said.
   ``They did not intend to violate the law and we don't believe
they have,'' said John Wing, lawyer for Alain Chaillou and Bruce
Frankel, who work for the French television station TF1 in New York
City.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said Thursday he was pressing
charges against the two men because ``this type of irresponsible
behavior can invite a lot of crackpots to do the same thing.''
   In Wednesday's incident, three packages containing bogus bombs
were left for shipment at the small cargo areas of TWA, Pan Am and
Air France, Port Authority police said.
   The packages also contained a typed message that read in part:
``Congratulations! You have found our phony bomb! (made with molding
clay, one alarm clock and wires),'' said authority spokesman Armando
Arrastia.
   The message was written on the letterhead of the television
station, he said.
   The incident came about two weeks after a Pan Am Boeing 747 from
London to New York exploded over Scotland, killing all 259 people
aboard and 11 on the ground. Investigators have blamed the crash on
a bomb planted on the jet.
   Chaillou, the station's New York bureau chief, and Frankel, a
producer, were charged with ``willfully and maliciously'' conspiring
to violate the federal Air Safety Act. The charge carries a maximum
five-year sentence upon conviction. The complaint alleged they
knowingly gave false information about the content of the packages.
   They appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate John Caden, who
released them on their own recognizance and scheduled a hearing for
Jan. 25.
   The men declined to speak to reporters.
   The complaint said that Frankel told an FBI agent at the airport
that his station wanted to do a ``news experiment'' to test the
security systems at Kennedy in light of the recent Pan Am bombing.
   Frankel said the project was designed with the approval of
Dominique Bromberger, the chief of the news department in Paris, and
Patrick Poivre D'Arvorm, the station's chief news anchor, according
to the complaint.
   ``TF1 regrets, of course, the disturbance yesterday at Kennedy
Airport and TF1 will do everything, of course, so that our two
friends will be released,'' anchorman Jean-Pierre Pernod said at the
conclusion of the station's afternoon newscast in Paris.
   Frankel, 37, was arrested at the airport after TWA counter
employees became suspicious of a 6-inch-by-8-inch brown package
Frankel wanted to check through to Paris, Arrastia said.
   Frankel then told police he had delivered two similar packages to
the small cargo areas of Pan Am and Air France, Arrastia said. The
other fake bombs were then recovered.
   Chaillou turned himself in after Frankel's arrest.

   African students in Beijing today demanded China
release three Africans being held in Nanking and boycotted classes
for a third day.
   The students also called on China to change the way it spells the
word Africa because the Chinese characters have a bad meaning and
called for a public apology from Chinese students who participated
in anti-black demonstrations.
   ``We want freedom for our brothers in Nanking,'' said one student
from Mali.
   A snowstorm delayed the flight of a group of African diplomats
heading from the capital to the eastern city of Nanking for talks
with African students and Chinese officials.
   On Thursday, an official report said the three African students,
held by police following a brawl in Nanking that triggered racial
unrest in four cities, admitted they broke the law.
   One of the three remained under arrest and apparently faced a
trial, while the two others were being punished with 15 days of
``disciplinary detention,'' the Xinhua News Agency said.
   A fourth African student detained by Nanking police was released
Thursday, it said.
   Students contacted in Nanking questioned the truth of the Xinhua
report. ``It is very easy for the Chinese to put words in people's
mouths, especially when they are in jail and cannot speak for
themselves,'' said Carl Ameho, a student from Ghana.
   On Thursday, about 45 African students held 10 days at a guest
house following the Christmas Eve brawl returned to Hehai
University, the scene of the fight.
   They were among 140 students, mostly from Africa, who tried to
flee to Beijing in the face of the Chinese protests last week but
were taken by police to the guest house.
   The four were taken into custody Saturday by about 400 police
who, according to students and African diplomats, used electric
cattle prods and wooden clubs on the students. Chinese officials
deny any violence was used.
   The trouble began Christmas Eve in Nanking, when Chinese
gatekeepers refused to allow two Chinese women to attend an African
student party.
   Xinhua said Alex Dosoo of Ghana beat a university worker during
the fight. He was the only African formally arrested.
   It said Alpha Robinson of Gambia and Dossoumou Boni Lodovic of
Benin ``tried to stir up trouble'' during the brawl and were given
15 days detention. All three admitted that they broke the law, it
said.
   Hanson Ebenezer Ekow of Ghana was released, Xinhua said. Hehai
University said all four were expelled from the school.
   A student from Ghana said the Xinhua report distorted the
incident.
   He said that when he went down to the university's main gate to
see why his friends weren't being allowed in, a group of Chinese
attacked him.
   ``They began beating me,'' said the student, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Alex and the others came down to save me.
It was self-defense.''
   African students said that on their first day back Chinese
students at Hehai yelled, ``Black devil, you've returned,'' and
``Black devil, get lost.''
   Ameho said most of the students still want to leave Nanking.
Racial incidents also have occurred in Hangzhou and Wuhan.
   In Beijing, several hundred African students at the Beijing
Languages Institute continued their class boycott, prompted by
Chinese allegations that a black student accosted a Chinese woman in
her room.
   The student from Mali, who spoke on condtion of anonymity, said
the students ``also want China to change the way its spells Africa.
Other areas of the world have nicer names.''
   Africa is called ``Feizhou,'' in Chinese, which means literally
the bad continent. America, for example, is called ``Meiguo,'' or
the beautiful country.
   China denies charges of racial prejudice, and expresses
solidarity with the Third World in giving scholarships to African
students. There are about 1,500 African students from 40 nations in
China.
   Social contacts between African men and Chinese women are a
frequent source of tension.

<HEAD>Girl At Adult-Only Condominium Spared Eviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old girl threatened with eviction
from an adult-only condominium since her mother died last year will
be allowed to remain at least two more months, the condo board has
ruled.
   Eviction proceedings were scheduled to begin against Jamie Swartz
on Jan. 10, but the Viewpointe Condominium board ruled Thursday the
girl can stay while the ramifications of a new federal housing act
are researched.
   ``It must be similar to what someone on Death Row must feel,''
said Jill Swartz, Jamie's stepmother. ``It's not over yet. It's just
a reprieve until they find something else to throw at us.''
   The Fair Housing Amendment Act, which takes effect March 12, bans
age discrimination in housing with the exception of subsidized
facilities for the elderly, or in complexes where all occupants are
62 years old or above or if 80 percent of the units have one
resident at least 55 years old.
   The board is not clear if the Viewpointe condos fulfill the age
exemptions, said Douglas Neway, attorney for the condo association.
But the board has scheduled a meeting for Jan. 10 to vote on a
proposal to require at least one resident at least 55 years old in
each unit.
   Some residents of the condominium who oppose the adult-only rule
dare seeking to cancel the meeting.
   ``I think if they get the 55 or older thing through, they'll be
right back on Jamie's case again,'' said Marcy Esposito.
   In a prepared statement, Neway said the board decided that no
action would be taken on Jamie's case at least until the new law
goes into effect.
   Jamie moved into the complex with her father, Lynn, and her
stepmother in April after her 42-year-old mother, Maye Swartz, was
hospitalized with cancer. The condo board voted in July to allow
Jamie to stay until her mother finished chemotherapy. Mrs. Swartz
died in September.
   The board threatened to seek eviction in November, but it allowed
the girl to remain through the holidays provided the two-bedroom
condo was placed on the market.
   The couple said there have been few buyers interested in the
condo, purchased three years ago for about $50,000.

   High employment and a sound economy helped drive
car-and-truck sales to at least their third-highest level in 1988,
with domestic makes showing strong gains while imports lagged, U.S.
automakers and analysts said.
   Boosted by a surge at the end of last year, total sales of cars
and light trucks in the United States amounted to 15.44 million
vehicles in 1988, automakers reported Thursday. That was up from
14.9 million in 1987.
   Some industry analysts believe 1988 may end up as the second-best
year ever, with sales topping the 1985 mark of 15.7 million when
heavy and medium-truck import sales figures become available in
several weeks. Ray Windecker, an analyst at Ford Motor Co., said
those sales have approached 300,000 vehicles in previous years.
   The industry's record year was 1986 when sales hit 16.3 million
vehicles.
   High employment and low inflation helped boost sales, said
Jeanette Garretty, auto analyst with the Bank of America in San
Francisco.
   ``It's been a good year for the economy,'' said Garretty.
   Domestic car and light-truck sales were 11.72 million in 1988, up
7.5 percent from 10.9 million in 1987.
   In the year's final sales period, Dec. 21-31, sales of U.S.-made
cars and light trucks soared to 400,297 vehicles, up 20.7 percent
from the same period of 1987.
   Sales of imports, which had to contend with toughening
competition and a weak dollar, dropped 8.6 percent to 3.72 million
from 4.1 million in 1987.
   Among the domestic automakers, General Motors Corp. reported
sales of 3.64 million cars last year, up 2.1 percent from 3.55
million in 1987. GM said its light-truck sales rose 12.6 percent to
1.7 million vehicles.
   ``The numbers have started to move in the right way,'' said GM
President Robert Stempel, adding that the figures showed the No. 1
automaker was turning the corner after losing market share in recent
years.
   Ford said it sold 2.2 million cars, up 8.8 percent from 2.0
million the previous year. Sales of its light trucks rose 4.2
percent to 1.5 million vehicles, the company said.
   Chrysler Corp., the third-largest U.S. maker, said 1988 car sales
rose 10.2 percent to 1.1 million from 962,057 a year earlier.
Light-truck sales jumped 14.6 percent to 955,619, it said.
   Among Japanese carmakers, Toyota sales increased in 1988 to
616,529 from 583,809 in 1987.
   Honda saw its import sales drop to 393,360 from 421,688 in 1987,
but sales of its U.S.-made cars increased to 375,625 from 316,618.
   The top-selling European manufacturer was Volkswagen, although
its sales fell to 168,800 cars last year from 191,705 in 1987. The
West German company stopped assembling cars in the United States
last July.
   Volvo ranked second among European makers, with sales dropping to
97,848 for the year from 105,087 in 1987.

<HEAD>Woman Shoots Self at Graves of Daughters She Killed</HEAD>

   A woman who first tried to commit suicide
in 1956 after shooting her three young daughters to death succeeded
32 years later as she stood in front of their graves.
   Lorene Calbeck, 67, shot herself in the chest Tuesday night at
Lake Wales Cemetery, drove home and called for help. She died en
route to a hospital, said Polk County Sheriff's detective Richard
Land.
   Mrs. Calbeck had been depressed since her husband of 45 years,
Mark, died in June, a neighbor said. She left notes to authorities
telling them how to contact a friend and giving instructions on how
to care for her oven.
   On May 24, 1956, Mrs. Calbeck, then 34, took her children on a
ride to a deserted area, stripped them to their underwear in the
moonlight and shot each in the heart, police reported.
   Shirley, 5, was shot four times with a .22-caliber target pistol.
Pamela, 3, and Jan, 15 months, each were shot twice.
   Mrs. Calbeck drove the bodies home, placed them on a bed
according to size and covered them with cellophane. She then fired a
pistol into the left side of her chest, but survived. She never told
authorities why she shot the girls.
   At that time, she left three notes, one to authorities on how to
reach her husband who was working in Michigan; a second to her
husband; and the other to the trailer park manager on how to care
for her gardenias.
   A grand jury took no action against Mrs. Calbeck. She was sent to
the Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee and hospitalized for 12
years, said Hilda Barnhardt, a Lake Wales resident who knew Mrs.
Calbeck since 1982.
   Mrs. Barnhardt said she didn't know until Wednesday why Mrs.
Calbeck had been hospitalized.
   ``It was such a shock to learn she had children. She had never
mentioned the children or why she had been institutionalized,'' she
said. ``She just didn't talk about it.''

<HEAD>Armenian Prosecutors Fired For Lack Of Action During Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Armenian prosecutors have been fired and
several others disciplined for failure to halt ethnic violence
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Pravda said today.
   Four prosecutors received ``strong reprimands'' and the Armenian
prosecutors' committee of peers recommended a fifth resign at the
end of his term, ``pending conclusion of an investigation into
murders in the Gugar region,'' the official Communist Party
newspaper reported.
   Pravda did not elaborate on those murders, and it gave no
specific allegations against the prosecutors.
   But the newspaper did charge that illegal activities of Armenian
activists in the ``Karabakh'' committee ``often went unpunished.''
All of the disciplined prosecutors have Armenian names.
   Armenian activists have been pressuring authorities to transfer
the largely Armenian area of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan to
Armenia to protect residents against alleged discrimination.
   Pravda said unsanctioned rallies inflamed passions and led to mob
violence. The prosecutors' panel found that concessions made by
local government and factory leaders to Karabakh committee activists
contributed to the danger, the newspaper said.
   ``As passions mounted, the prosecutors and internal affairs
(police) officials began to lose control over events, and failed to
ensure law and order, public safety and observance of the
constitution,'' Pravda said.
   The prosecutors' panel said all prosecutors in the southern
republic, which also was ravaged last month by an earthquake that
killed 55,000 people, should ``rectify the gross mistakes,
miscalculations and shortcomings in their work'' and prevent further
ethnic clashes.

<HEAD>Report: Anti-Gadhafi Force Trained by U.S., Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Libya-UN, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.- and Israeli-trained force of Libyan
dissidents are fighting in the western Sudan as part of efforts to
overthrow Col. Moammar Gadhafi, a newsletter reported.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman declined comment on the report by
the London-based publication Africa Confidential. Another ranking
U.S. defense official, who requested anonymity, denied the Defense
Department was involved with any such Libyan dissident group.
   ``We can't speak for the CIA, but (the Defense Department) isn't
in this,'' the source insisted.
   The newsletter said the ``substantial Contra force of Libyans''
has been trained in Chad, Cameroon, Gabon, the Central African
Republic and the United States.
   The newsletter on African affairs, published every two weeks,
gave no attribution for the detailed report, which was printed
before U.S. F-14 fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23s over the
Mediterranean on Wednesday.
   ``The operation is well-advanced and is already putting pressure
on Libyan and pro-Tripoli groups operating out of Sudan's lawless
western region of Darfur,'' where fighting has broken out in recent
days, it said.
   The report did not detail how the force planned to overthrow
Gadhafi, but said it was operating under the emblem of the National
Front for the Salvation of Libya, which is committed to ousting the
Libyan leader.
   Led by Col. Abdoulgassim Khalifa Haftar, the front's main force
is based at Ouadi-Doum in northern Chad, it said.
   The force has millions of dollars in Libyan equipment captured by
the Chadian army and controlled by the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, the newsletter said.
   Up to 2,000 Libyan prisoners of war taken by the Chadians form
the backbone of the force, with Western mercenaries being recruited
in Kinshasa, Zaire, the newsletter said.
   Its military activity, the newsletter said, is likely to be
directed at the Libyan base at Tanoa south of the Aozou border
strip, which Libya claims from Chad, and at pro-Libyan groups and
Libyan troops in Darfur, Sudan.
   The instructors include 30 Americans who arrived in Chad in 1987
and 49 Chadian soldiers under Capt. Ahmed Gourou who returned in
December from a seven-month course at Camp Hall in Leadville, Colo.,
where they learned to decode information from U.S. radar and
surveillance aircraft, it said.
   American personnel are also in control of a major new supply base
at Yoko in central Cameroon, the newsletter said.
   In Cameroon, the Israelis trained 13 National Front members at
Djoum under the authority of Col. Titus Ebogo, commandant of the
presidential guard, it said, noting that Cameroon is Israel's main
base in the region.
   The Israelis are also training the guerrillas near Kaele in
Cameroon and at Ndele in the Central African Republic, the
newsletter said.

   The answer is: Dick Thomas, a former fish
and wildlife technician with the state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   The question: Who spurred dozens of media mavens, including TV's
Jeopardy, to seek the answer to the time-honored question, ``How
much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?''
   Thomas came up with an answer _ 700 pounds _ to the woodchuck
riddle during some idle moments last June. In the intervening six
months, his little joke has popped up all over America.
   Last week, it popped up on the TV game show Jeopardy, which
provides contestants with answers and asks them to pose the matching
question.
   The phone at Thomas' home in the upstate town of Caledonia
immediately started ringing with calls from friends who wanted to be
sure he knew what happened. But Thomas was nonplussed by the
attention. He's used to it now.
   ``I've got my woodchuck file right here,'' Thomas said Thursday.
``It would be a lot bigger but I didn't start keeping it right
away.''
   The file includes stories from papers all over the country. Their
interest perked up after Thomas wrote to Fin, Fur and Feather Facts,
a normally sober Department of Conservation newsletter, last June.
   ``It's high time someone provided an answer to this question,''
he wrote.
   Thomas described woodchucks and their burrows, computed volumes
and weights, and ended, ``Next time someone asks you ... tell him,
`Oh, about 700 pounds on a good day with the wind at his back'. Then
say, `Everybody knows that.' ''
   The Wall Street Journal, which Thomas said called him three times
to get the woodchuck facts straight, provided him with an idea for
another project _ determining how many peppers Peter Piper picked.

   Whoever stole Roger Rabbit and
Bugs Bunny here has turned the escapade into a harebrained scheme.
   The plywood cartoon characters were pilfered from Terry Higgins'
prize-winning Christmas lighting display last week.
   The next day, Higgins found a broken piece of Bugs Bunny's ear in
a plastic bag. The bag also contained a note made from letters cut
out of a newspaper directing him to a downtown parking garage.
   Bugs was recovered from a janitor at the garage, along with
another note from a group which mystifyingly called itself the
United Front For BOX.
   ``Our organization is very sorry about Bugs's ear. It was quite
honestly an accident,'' the note read. ``If you follow our
directions, you will find Roger perfectly intact. We will give you
further instructions within 24 hours.
   Higgins said he and his son waited for several days but nothing
happened.
   ``We all think it's some kids who are doing this,'' he said.
``They probably stole them and it became a big joke. Whoever wrote
these notes did a beautiful job. There is a lot of work in it.''
   Bugs has had successful ear surgery but Higgins said he's anxious
to see Roger again.

   Members of the classy Woodlands Club,
where it costs $12,500 just to join, have been admonished to cut out
the food fights or risk getting kicked out.
   ``Some of our members have never been in a club before and don't
know the protocol,'' manager Phil Swett said, trying to explain why
the club at times resembles ``Animal House'' more than ``Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous.''
   To set the unruly straight, Swett mailed the 630 members a letter
detailing offensive behavior that has been observed at the $10
million sports, recreation and housing complex that opened last
August in this wealthy town north of Portland.
   Among the distasteful behavior cited in Swett's letter:
   _ Parents sitting idly by while their children throw food around
the dining room. Some families, Swett said, have left their dining
table with food ``literally covering the floor.''
   _ Parents leaving soiled baby diapers around the club and making
no effort to clean up ``accidents.''
   In addition to the $12,500 initiation fee, members pay a $2,500
annual fee and must spend at least $800 a year on food and drinks at
the club.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz indicated the
United States may be willing to work out a deal with Libya that
would not require the destruction of a plant said to be on the verge
of full production of poison gas.
   Shultz said Thursday en route to Paris for an international
conference on chemical weapons that he also will make a fresh
attempt this weekend to persuade the Soviet Union to help close down
the Libyan plant outside Tripoli.
   ``They (the Soviets) are very concerned about the problem,''
Shultz said. ``They were very quick to endorse the idea of this
conference.''
   Shultz has already discussed the Libyan plant with Shevardnadze.
The first time, a U.S. official said, was when they both attended a
U.N. General Assembly session in New York in late September. The
second occasion was Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit
last month to New York.
   Shultz said the United States has given the Soviets some of the
information that led U.S. analysts to be ``quite comfortable'' about
accusing Libya of being ready to begin chemical weapons production.
But, he said, ``so far as I know, we have not convinced them.''
   Shultz planned meetings today with President Francois Mitterrand
and Prime Minister Michel Rocard, Canadian Foreign Minister Joe
Clark and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet Abdel-Meguid.
   Shultz said Thursday on his flight from Washington that the
United States supports the destruction of the Rabta facility ``to
take care of the problem,'' but hinted the dispute might be resolved
without leveling the facility.
   ``Whether there is something else that can be done, we'll see,''
Shultz said without elaborating.
   Shultz acknowledged some of America's best friends are not
convinced the plant 60 miles southwest of Tripoli is a weapons
facility. Britain, however, said it has conclusive independent
information the plant, about to go on line, is involved in chemical
weapons production.
   The Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, has offered a one-time
inspection of the plant that he says produces pharmaceuticals.
   The State Department rejected the offer, saying the facility
could be easily changed to omit the chemical weapons production
items, then put back into production after the inspectors leave.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher says he is
``very concerned'' about U.S. allegations that West German companies
had helped Libya build the plant.
   The West German Foreign Ministry announced that its ambassador to
Libya, Juergen Helner, has asked Gadhafi to accept international
inspection of the plant.
   The forceful U.S. condemnation of the facility, which began more
than two months ago, has prompted speculation that the United States
might attack Rabta, as it did Tripoli in 1986 after accusing Libya
in the bombing of a West German nightclub.
   President Reagan's public refusal to rule out the military option
and the U.S. downing Wednesday of two Libyan jet fighters over the
Mediterranean fueled the speculation further.
   Companies in about a half-dozen industrialized countries are
suspected of assisting Libya. The State Department has urged them to
desist. As a result, Shultz said, chemical weapons have not been
produced at Rabta.
   ``They are not there yet,'' Shultz said. ``They have had some
difficulties.''
   The conference of 140 nations opens Saturday.

<HEAD>Mercer Becomes First Missouri Prisoner Executed in 24 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who raped and killed a woman
brought to him as a ``birthday present'' was put to death early
today in Missouri's first execution in 24 years.
   George ``Tiny'' Mercer, clasping a Bible, was injected with a
toxic dose of drugs at 12:03 a.m. as his wife, Christy, watched
through a death chamber window. He was declared dead at 12:09 a.m.
   Mercer, 44, had been on death row at the Missouri State
Penitentiary longer than any other inmate and his efforts to stop
the execution failed Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court and Gov.
John Ashcroft refused to grant a stay.
   Warden Bill Armontrout said he read Mercer his death warrant, and
then, ``He shook my hand and thanked me and he asked that we look
out for one of his shipmates down here,'' referring to a fellow
inmate.
   Later, Mercer's body was taken from the penitentiary in a hearse.
   About 30 death penalty opponents held a service at a church and
about a dozen went to the maximum-security prison for a candlelight
vigil.
   Hours earlier, the Supreme Court, on a 7-2 vote, rejected a
motion to stay the execution. Ashcroft refused to intervene, saying
the state Board of Probation and Parole had concluded that the
judicial process had functioned properly in Mercer's case.
   Mercer was condemned to death for the 1978 murder of Karen
Keeton, 22, a waitress.
   According to evidence at his trial, friends brought Ms. Keeton to
Mercer as a ``birthday present.'' His 11-year-old daughter was at
home during an assault in which Mercer forced the woman to have sex
with him at gunpoint before killing her.
   In a 1981 interview, Mercer denied killing the woman and said he
had found religion in prison.
   ``The old Tiny is dead now,'' he said in 1981. ``He's buried.
He's gone. I'm a new man in my way of thinking, my attitude toward
life and everything. The Lord's done this to me.''
   Missouri reinstated its capital punishment law 12 years ago. The
last person was executed in the gas chamber in 1965. The Legislature
changed the method to lethal injection last year.
   There are 66 other men and one woman facing the death penalty in
Missouri.
   Mercer was the 105th person put to death in the United States
since the Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty
in 1976.

<HEAD>Cabbies Get Bigger Fare With Smaller Tires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passengers would be well advised to
carry a tape measure when they hail a Danish taxi because some
unscrupulous cabbies are driving with undersized tires to cheat the
meter, reports said today.
   Copenhagen's taxi registration branch has discovered cab owners
have equipped their vehicles with tires that are smaller than the
size approved for their cars, an the result is the meter runs five
to 12 percent too fast.
   This means that in a normal operating period of two years and
155,000 miles, the tire change can yield up to 100,000 kroner, or
$14,300 in extra fares, the Jyllands-Posten newspaper said.
   Police, while declaring the tire changing trick to be illegal,
say they lack the manpower to check tires on all taxis after an
initial inspection.
   ``We control in most cases only that the taxi meter is correctly
adjusted. This is a guarantee that the tires were legal at the time
of inspection, but that's all it does,'' motor vehicle inspector
Nyegaard Jensen was quoted as saying.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was stronger in early European
trading today and foreign currency dealers said they were nervous
about the possibility of central bank intervention. Gold prices also
rose.
   Traders attributed the dollar's rise to firming U.S. interest
rates and continuing tension in the Mediterranean where American
warplanes shot down two Libyan planes.
   ``I think we'll see the Bundesbank this morning,'' said a trader
at a large German bank in Frankfurt, referring to the West German
central bank.
   A trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt agreed, ``They should come
into the market.''
   The Bundesbank reportedly intervened in the market Thursday,
selling a modest amount of dollars.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a closing 125.97 amid concerns over
Japanese Emperor Hirohito's condition. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 126.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.7985 West German marks, up from 1.7955
   _1.5345 Swiss francs, up from 1.5195
   _6.1405 French francs, up from 6.1155
   _2.0263 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0220
   _1.1915 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1877
   Markets were closed in Italy for a national holiday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7925, slightly cheaper for
buyers than late Thursday's $1.7970.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $407.75 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $408.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.60, up from $407.20 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 50 cents to close at a bid
$410.44.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Thursday's bid, and its lowest level since March
1987.

<HEAD>Saudi Tanker Splits In Half After Mystery Explosion, Six Reported
Dead</HEAD>

   A Saudi Arabian tanker broke in two today
and its stern section sank after a mystery blast believed to have
been caused by a drifting mine left six crewmen dead, authorities
said.
   Shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Greek captain of the 36,904-ton Sagheera was among those killed in
the explosion in the southern end of the gulf Thursday. Two other
men were listed as missing.
   They said 26 members of the crew made up of Greek officers and
Sri Lankan seamen were rescued Thursday from lifeboats by the Omani
Coast Guard.
   The Sagheera was ripped by an explosion as it was sailing empty
into the storm-whipped Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Persian
Gulf, en route for the Saudi port of Mina Saud. The blast started a
fire aboard the tanker.
   Shipping sources said the vessel later split in two and that one
of two salvage tugs that went to aid the blazing tanker was towing
the bow section in the Gulf of Oman toward the Omani coast.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors shipping traffic around the world, reported an explosion in
the tanker's pump-room before it caught fire.
   It did not say what could have caused the blast. But U.S. Navy
officers have been warning for weeks that winter storms could tear
mines, laid during the Iran-Iraq war, loose from their moorings,
leaving them to drift into shipping lanes.
   Winds were gusting at more than 30 miles an hour in the gulf
Thursday, with waves as high as 30 feet.
   The U.S. Navy has estimated as many as 200 mines were still
believed to be in the gulf, mainly in northern waters, despite
mine-sweeping operations by the U.S. and other navies in the
strategic waterway.
   Several vessels were hit by mines during the Iran-Iraq conflict
before fighting was halted Aug. 20 when a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire took effect.
   No ship has been confirmed to have hit a mine since the
cease-fire began.
   The Sagheera was one of more than 500 ships attacked during the
so-called ``tanker war,'' an offshoot of the gulf conflict in which
both sides raided merchant vessels in the waterway.
   The Saudi vessel was hit by Iranian gunboats April 4 last year,
but suffered only minor damage and none of its crewmen was hurt. It
was not known whether the Sagheera was manned by the same crew
Thursday.

   Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure worsened today and
physicians expressed concern about possible damage to his brain and
organs because of lack of oxygen, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure stood at 68 over 30 late
today, while his breathing rate, which increased significantly to 32
breaths per minute early today, eased to 26 in the evening, palace
officials said.
   His systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading has been in the
60-80 range since early Thursday despite court physicians' efforts
to push it up with emergency transfusions.
   It was longest that his pressure has been below 90 since he fell
seriously ill on Sept. 19.
   An average systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading is about
120 and a sustained low reading can damage the brain and internal
organs because of the lack of oxygen flowing to them.
   ``It is unlikely that his blood pressure will recover
significantly considering his failing health,'' said a palace
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Doctors don't seem
to be concerned about the low blood pressure so much as long as it
stays above 70.''
   Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda attributed the
continuous low blood pressure to the weakening of Hirohito's overall
condition.
   ``His overall condition appears to be weakening,'' he said. ``His
kidney and other organ functions may have been affected slightly.''
   Hirohito dischaged a small amount of blood this afternoon, Maeda
said.
   But he stressed that the world's longest reigning monarch
remained ``clearly conscious'' and his condition was not yet
critical.
   Maeda said doctors applied an oxygen mask to the emperor to help
his respiration, but he tried to brush the mask away.
   Transfusions have been a common method of treatment since the
emperor fell ill 3{ months ago, and as of Thursday evening he has
received 67.83 pints of blood.
   Doctors believe the internal bleeding originated in the upper
intestinal region, where Hirohito underwent a bypass surgery in
September 1987.
   The palace has not confirmed newspapers and magazines reports
that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's elder son and heir to the
throne, has assumed the full roster of imperial duties like signing
government documents since Hirohito fell seriously ill.

<HEAD>Investigation Demanded In Purported Use of Nazi Victims' Body Parts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli officials have called for an
investigation of reports that body parts from Nazi victims are being
used in German universities for medical experiments.
   The officials called on West Germany to open an investigation
after the reports appeared this week on West Germany's ARD
television network, Israel's state TV and in the daily newspaper
Maariv.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel expressed outrage Thursday,
saying, ``We have heard about it only from the media, and it sounds
shocking.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner said, ``It's
the kind of story that you must thoroughly look into because of all
the implications.'' Yitzhak Arad, director of Yad Vashem, Israel's
Holocaust memorial, said he called Wilhelm Haas, West Germany's
ambassador in Israel, when he heard of the report.
   ``He said he had heard about it and asked his government for
details even before I called,'' Arad said.
   Arad said he was ``shocked and hurt'' by the news that the
remains of Nazi victims were being used as medical specimens.
   ``They were victims, murdered by the Nazis and now they are used
for experiments,'' he said. ``This can not continue.''
   ``I am sure that professors and probably the students knew what
they were using,'' he said. ``But it was in their interest to hide
the truth. I am now sure there will be an end to it.'
   Maariv said Thursday an investigation had been ordered by the
government of the German state of Baden Wuerttenberg, where two
universities that allegedly are using body parts of Nazi victims are
located.
   ``It is clear that if these facts are true, it is not possible
for these organs and tissues to be used as teaching aids,'' a
spokesman for Baden Wuerttenberg told Maariv.
   Maariv and Israel TV said body parts from Nazi victims, including
communists and the mentally handicapped, are used for medical
education at Heidelberg and Tuebingen universities.
   Harry Wall, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith said: ``It's frightening irony that a country where doctors
used live victims for medical experiments may be using the remnants
of those victims for medical research.''
   Maariv reported Wednesday that during the Nazi era the director
of a research institute in Germany personally selected mentally
retarded people for the gas chamber so he could use their brains for
experiments.
   ``He succeeded in gathering a special collection that included
697 `fresh brains' that were passed on to the University of
Frankfurt,'' Benno Mueller-Hill of Cologne University was quoted as
saying by Maariv. He said the brains were still used today in
universities.
   Israel TV said more than 1,000 bodies were sent to German
universities for medical education during the Nazis' 12-year rule.
The report described specific cases involving political prisoners
but did not document any cases involving Jewish holocaust victims.
   One German professor supported the use of body parts from Nazi
victims, telling Israel TV they were of a higher quality than
samples now available.
   ``Especially at our university, these samples are very valuable
for teaching,'' said Ulrich Drews, a professor at Tuebingen
University.
   ``They were prepared ... in an almost artistic manner. ... The
quality of the samples can hardly be matched today,'' Drews said.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Cigarette Warnings Are Inadequate</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Smoking Trends, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new studies say warnings on cigarette
advertisements don't work as they should _ in most cases because
people don't read them.
   ``People don't pay much attention to the words in the ads. They
look at the pictures,'' said Dr. Paul Fischer, an associate
professor of family medicine at the Medical College of Georgia.
   Fischer conducted one of the studies, which were reported in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the U.S. Surgeon
General's warnings about the hazards of smoking to be put on
cigarette packages and advertisements. The warnings began appearing
in 1972 after the tobacco industry and the Federal Trade Commission
reached an agreement on the wording.
   Fischer used video equipment to monitor how 61 Georgia teen-agers
moved their eyes across cigarette ads in magazines. The teen-agers
were paid for taking part in the study, he said.
   Equipment problems meant data could be taken from only 45 of the
subjects, ages 13 to 17, who viewed a total of 202 advertisements,
Fischer said.
   But in 43.6 percent of the viewings, he said, the teen-agers did
not see the warnings on the ads.
   A marketing research executive commissioned by the Tobacco
Institute, a Washington-based trade association that represents
major cigarette manufacturers, contended the study was flawed.
   ``They should have used a minimum of 150 to 200 people for the
study and it should have been a representative sample in order to
get true results,'' said Elliot Young, president of Perceptions
Research Services Inc., an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., market research
firm.
   Fischer's study drew a distinction between ``looking'' and
``reading'' and defined reading as a situation in which the eye was
fixed on the ad for at least 0.1 seconds.
   After viewing the advertisements, the teen-agers were asked to
choose the five warnings that were in the ads from a list of 10
possible choices.
   Another study, conducted by Dr. Ronald Davis, director of the
Office on Smoking and Health for the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, found that while people were able to clearly
read cigarette ads on street and highway billboards and on taxis,
they had trouble making out the warnings.
   His study used two nonsmoking CDC workers in Atlanta and two
nonsmoking New York City Health Department workers as viewers.
   In Atlanta, under average driving conditions, the two CDC workers
in a moving car were able to read the brand name of a cigarette
advertised on street billboards after viewing them for 3 seconds.
But in 18 cases they were unable to read the warning against smoking
and in 27 cases they were able to make out only part of it, the
study said.
   On highway billboards, the CDC observers were able to read the
brand name in the ad in all 39 cases, but were able to completely
read the warnings in only two of the incidents, the study said. The
warnings were partially read in six of the viewings.
   Two viewers, who saw 100 ads on taxis in New York City from a
sidewalk bench were unable to read any warnings, even though they
could read the brand name in every case, the study found.

<HEAD>China's Harvest Slumps For Fourth Year in the Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today said its 1988 grain harvest fell for
the fourth straight year, putting in danger the nation's ability to
feed its 1.08 billion people.
   The official China Daily blamed the shortfall on one of the worst
droughts in China's history and ``lack of motivation'' by peasants
to plant more grain. The central bank said it would lend $2.32
billion to the Agricultural Bank. Officials have said greater state
investment is needed to increase yields.
   The State Statistical Bureau said 393.79 million tons of rice,
corn, wheat and other grains were harvested last year, down from
1987's 402.98 million tons and only slightly higher than 1985 and
1986 harvests.
   China produced a record 407 million tons of grain in 1984 but has
been unable since to match it. Premier Li Peng has said China needs
to produce 500 million tons per year by the year 2000 in order to
keep up with population growth.
   China's goal had been to produce 450 million tons in 1990, but
the official China Daily said this will be almost impossible.
   The newspaper said prolonged drought in many areas of the country
and typhoons and floods in other places were partly to blame for
1988's poor results.
   However, it also blamed a ``lack of motivation'' for peasants to
increase production.
   The paper quoted the State Statistical Bureau as saying the
amount of land used to grow grain fell in 1988 because peasants made
bigger profits from raising crops such as melons and vegetables for
sale to cities.
   Grain production is a highly political issue in a country that
only recently has been able to feed its fast-growing population.
Emphasis on grain as ``the key link'' in the economy remains central
to the ruling Communist Party's program. Failure to promote grain
production cost officials their jobs.
   Over the last decade, however, state investment has gone heavily
to industry and infrastructure development at the expense of
agriculture because it had bettter prospects for profit.
   The China Daily said the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, had agreed to give the Agricultural Bank the extra money in
1989 for investment in farm projects.
   It quoted Agricultural Bank officials as saying they planned to
increase their farm credit fund by $4.8 billion, including the
central bank contribution, and were considering raising the rest of
the money by issuing bonds.

   Gobs of oil continued to wash ashore in
Washington and British Columbia two weeks after a spill from a
tugboat-tanker collision that one official said could scar the coast
for ``months if not years.''
   As experts assessed the ecological damage to the Pacific
Northwest, Shell Oil Co. estimated Thursday that a ruptured pipeline
in Missouri spilled 840,000 gallons of oil Dec. 24 near a tributary
of the Missouri River in one of the biggest inland spills in U.S.
history.
   Shell has recovered about 441,000 gallons, company spokesman Tony
Canino said.
   The state of Missouri is ``probably headed for legal action''
against Shell for not notifying officials immediately after
discovering the rupture, a spokesman for the state Department of
Natural Resources said.
   In northwest Washington, experts hiked along the shoreline of
Olympic National Park Thursday to assess damage to fragile
tidepools, kelp beds, rocky shores and wildlife from an estimated
231,000 gallons of bunker oil. The oil spilled after the Dec. 22
collision of a tugboat and a tanker in heavy seas two miles off
Grays Harbor on the central Washington coast.
   Olympic Chief Ranger Chuck Janda said a damage assessment should
be ready by Saturday.
   Evidence of the spill, which has washed up along 300 miles of
coast from Newport, Ore., to Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
will remain ``a long, long time _ months if not years,'' he said.
   Tides and heavy surf appear to be gradually shifting the oil
northward, Janda said.
   State wildlife officials say about 3,700 sea birds have died in
Washington, with no estimates immediately available from Oregon or
British Columbia. Janda said contaminated birds still were being
found.
   Volunteers had cleaned 890 birds and released 42 by late
Thursday, said Susan Ewing of the state Department of Wildlife.
Among the species hardest hit have been murres, auklets, scoters,
loons and grebes, officials said.
   Many beaches along the rugged coast are accessible only by
helicopter or on foot at low tide. Janda said cleanup crews are
using choppers to haul out 20,000 pounds of oil-soaked sand, kelp,
driftwood and other material daily. The cleanup could continue for
several weeks, he said.
   At Canada's Pacific Rim National Park, 100 miles to the north on
Vancouver Island, crews began preparing to remove blotches of oil
from 87 miles of beaches surrounding Barkley Sound. In some places,
the stench overpowered the smell of salt air.
   Sause Bros. Ocean Towing of Coos Bay, Ore., owner of the barge
and tug, said the cost of cleanup in Washington alone was $10,000 a
day. The cost is covered by insurance, it said.
   Shell's 840,000-gallon estimate on the size of the Missouri spill
was the first the company has given. It would be on the scale of a
spill a year ago from an Ashland Oil Co. storage tank on the
Monongahela River near Pittsburgh, which federal officials said then
was among the nation's worst.
   Published estimates of the Monongahela spill have ranged from
500,000 to 1 million gallons.
   The oil erupted from a 35-foot rupture in a buried pipeline near
the Gasconade River, about 140 miles west of St. Louis. Oil has
moved since into the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
   Beginning today, Shell is increasing cleanup efforts on the
Gasconade and Missouri rivers, which will take ``at least two more
weeks,'' Canino said.
   Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch Cos. recalled some of the 2,000 workers
to its St. Louis brewery Thursday to begin a test run. Busch stopped
brewing beer Tuesday after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the
plant's water supply.
   The spill hasn't threatened drinking water.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
resting at home after spending a week in a hospital for treatment of
congestive heart failure, an aide said.
   Marcos, 71, left St. Francis Medical Center by private ambulance
Thursday accompanied by his wife, Imelda, and doctors, said hospital
spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Calls to Marcos' physicians were not returned. Marcos spokesman
Gemmo Trinidad said the ousted Philippine leader would have
round-the-clock care.
   It was his second hospitalization in a month. Marcos spent nine
days at St. Francis in December with what aides said was congestive
heart failure, in which the heart is too weak to pump the amount of
blood required by the body. The condition causes chest pain,
shortness of breath and fatigue and can be fatal.
   A federal court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 19 in New York to
determine whether Marcos is healthy enough to be arraigned there on
racketeering charges. Prosecutors contend Marcos is able to travel;
the defense says he is not.
   The Marcoses were indicted Oct. 21 on charges they plundered
their homeland of more than $100 million and stashed much of the
money in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent and is free on $5 million bail, but
Marcos has not been arraigned because of ill health.
   The couple have lived in exile in Hawaii since they were ousted
in 1986.

   Vietnam will withdraw its remaining
50,000 troops from Cambodia by September if a political settlement
to the war is reached, Cambodian President Heng Samrin said today.
   While it previously did not name a month, Vietnam has repeatedly
pledged to withdraw all its troops earlier than its original target
date of 1990 if a political settlement could be reached.
   Resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk was quoted as saying,
however, that Vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are false, that
peace talks have failed and that Cambodia's future can be settled
only by continued fighting.
   Heng Samrin made the pullout offer in a speech in Cambodia's
capital of Phnom Penh to mark his government's first decade in
power. Vietnam installed the government on Jan. 7, 1979, two weeks
after launching a full-scale invasion of Cambodia.
   In the speech, broadcast by the official Phnom Penh radio and
monitored in Bangkok, he accused the guerrilla opposition of
prolonging the peace negotiations by making what he called the
``unreasonable'' demand that the Phnom Penh government be dismantled
before a general election is held.
   Heng Samrin repeated that his government wanted a settlement on
the basis of a Vietnamese withdrawal along with measures to prevent
the former fanatical Khmer Rouge regime from retaking power.
   He said that ``to contribute to achieving this solution,''
Vietnam and his government ``have agreed if there is a political
solution, all Vietnamese troops will be withdrawn from Cambodia no
later than September 1989. All the points above should be
implemented with effective international control.''
   Heng Samrin said his government hopes that other parties will
keep promises to end aid and sanctuary to the Khmer Rouge and the
other guerrilla groups. Such promises have been made by China, which
arms the guerrillas, and by Thailand, which gives them territory for
bases.
   Vietnam claims to have made annual partial withdrawals of its
troops since 1982. It says the largest came in 1988, when the
Vietnamese military high command, all advisers, and 50,000 soldiers
returned home. Vietnam says the remaining 50,000 troops will be
repatriated by 1990, whether there is a political solution or not.
   The guerrillas' demand that the Heng Samrin government be
dismantled has been one of the major barriers in the peace talks.
   The major peace forums have been meetings in France between
Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen and Sihanouk, and multilateral
talks, the second round of which are scheduled in Indonesia next
month.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said Sihanouk on Jan. 1 sent a note to
countries backing the resistance, telling them that the Vietnamese
troop pullout ``is not real and not unconditional.'' The radio
broacast occurred Thursday and a text of it was seen in Bangkok
today.
   In the note, Sihanouk said the supposed pullouts were mere
rotations and about 120,000 Vietnamese soldiers remained in
Cambodia, 20,000 of them in the Cambodian army. Also, 40,000 troops
in the the Cambodian army are Vietnamese naturalized as Cambodians,
he said. In addition, nearly 1 million Vietnamese colonizers were
sent to Cambodia from 1978 to 1988, he claimed.
   The radio said Sihanouk ``further said that this issue can be
solved one way only, and that is through the efforts and sacrifices
on the battlefield in Cambodia by Cambodian resistance forces which
are intensifying their activities against the Vietnamese
aggressors.''

<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers stoned Arab cars
after an Israeli was fatally shot near this West Bank settlement,
and police said today the killing may have been carried out by
nationalist Palestinians.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Palestinians in Bethlehem and
surrounding Christian villages observed a general strike today as
Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas. Graffiti painted on
buildings called for an escalation of the 13-month Palestinian
uprising.
   On Thursday, troops shot and wounded two Palestinian teen-agers
during disturbances in the West Bank's Kaddoura refugee camp and the
village of Beit Likiya, Arab hospital officials said.
   Israel radio said security forces suspect Palestinians killed Tel
Aviv taxi driver Shmuel Edri, 42. Security forces believe
Palestinians may have forced him at gunpoint to drive to a junction
near the Jewish settlement of Yakir, 25 miles north of Jerusalem.
   His body was found near there Thursday night, and a police
spokesman said he was shot twice in the chest.
   Police chief Haim Malka, head of the West Bank's northern
section, said police believe nationalists were involved but they are
still investigating.
   At first police noted Edri had a criminal record, implying the
slaying may have had crime links. But Malka later told Israel radio:
``His criminal record was from the 1970s, not the 1980s, and his
crimes were not that great.''
   Police spokesman Yosef Faris said police found 850 shekels ($480)
and an undisclosed amount of money in dollars in a wallet found on
Edri's body. It is illegal for Israelis to hold foreign currency.
   Faris said troops also found two spent 9mm cartridges and two
live rounds near the body. At the site of the slaying, bloodstains
could be seen for about 30 feet along the road.
   Ruth Scheih, a 28-year-old resident of Yakir, said she and her
husband discovered Edri lying on the ground waving his arms.
   ``We saw there was blood. He didn't say anything, he made one
more hand movement and then nothing,'' Mrs. Scheih said.
   She said that immediately after the slaying, settler leaders
issued calls for protest demonstrations in this isolated, hilltop
settlement.
   Residents of the nearby settlement of Ariel took to the streets
early today when they heard the news, Israel radio reported. It said
the settlers burned a tire in the road and hurled rocks at
Palestinian cars, copying the tactics used by Arabs in their
anti-Israeli protests.
   The army closed off the area and clamped curfews on the Arab
villages of Kifl Harith and Deir Istiya while searching for
suspects, the radio said. It said troops ousted several settlers who
entered Arab villages.
   Merchants today shuttered their businesses and all public
transportation was halted in Bethlehem and the nearby Christian
villages of Beit Jalla and Beit Sahour in compliance with orders for
a general strike issued by PLO-backed leaders of the Arab uprising.
   The strike was called to coincide with today's celebration of the
Orthodox Christian Christmas.
   A leaflet from the underground uprising leaders ordered a similar
strike on Dec. 24 to mark the suffering of Palestinians in the
revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   At least 347 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, most
by army gunfire. Fourteen Israelis also have died in the unrest, not
counting Edri.

   The U.S. ambassador to the 35-nation
Helsinki review conference said today the meeting had achieved
historic agreements on human rights, but Hungary voiced fears that
Romania could ``torpedo'' the accord.
   In a surprise move, Romania on Thursday presented the conference
with 17 suggestions for deleting or changing the draft of a final
accord.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Romania is seeking to change or delete commitments to religious
freedom, the freedom of movement and clauses on emigration and
tourism.
   Hungary's Communist Party daily, Nepszabadsag, described the
Romanian demands as a ``diplomatic torpedo'' that could undo two
years of hard work in Vienna, where the 35-nation review conference
opened in November 1986.
   The newspaper added, however, that ``torpedoes do not always hit
their traget, and there have been instances of their returning to
where they have been launched.''
   Tensions between Hungary and Romania have been high for years,
particularly over the plan announced last year by the Romanian
government to raze thousands of ethnic Hungarian villages and
resettle residents in industrial centers.
   U.S. ambassador Warren Zimmermann played down the Romanian
demands over the human rights accord, saying they were merely
suggestions and noting that they had been rejected Thursday by
coordinators responsible for the draft accord.
   Zimmermann told a news conference that the draft of the final
accord was an ``excellent'' document that needed very few changes to
be acceptable to the United States.
   Under the consensus mechanism of the Helsinki review process, a
final accord must be approved by all 35 participating nations to
take effect.
   ``If we are able to achieve it, it will be a document that sets a
really historic set of markers in human rights, perhaps the most
far-reaching... ever,'' Zimmermann said.
   The United States, Britain and Canada still seek improvements in
the accord to guarantee that East bloc citizens can monitor their
nations' human rights and that new Soviet laws limiting emigration
on the ground of state secrecy will not apply to those already
waiting years to emigrate.
   Among the achievements of the Vienna conference, Zimmermann
noted, is a mechanism guaranteeing continuous East-West discussion
of human rights.
   There will be a human rights conference in Paris this summer, in
Copenhagen in 1990 and in Moscow in 1991.
   In addition, the draft accord entitles states signing the
Helsinki accords to raise any human rights matter with another
participant at any time.
   Delegates hope to end the Helsinki conference by mid-January,
paving the way for new East-West talks on reducing conventional
forces to begin in Vienna in February or March.
   Negotiators from the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations were
still working today to finish a mandate for those talks by early
next week.
   Zimmermann said he expected ``a lot of quiet diplomacy'' to try
to reach an agreement before Jan. 17, when Austria has invited the
foreign ministers of 34 non-participant nations to a three-day
closing meeting of the Helsinki review conference.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, labeled passionless during
his failed presidential campaign, inspired liberal followers and
riled conservative critics with a suprisingly vitriolic State of the
State speech.
   Dukakis on Thursday night lashed out at his opponents as
``gutless wonders'' and said ``baloney'' to those who accuse the
state of overspending.
   Republican leaders and conservative Democrats said they found
some of the governor's remarks bitter and even tasteless.
   All sides agreed that Dukakis was signaling his determination to
push for new taxes when he releases his plan next week to address a
shortfall of at least $636 million in the state's $11.6 billion
budget.
   Despite the budget gap, the newly combative Dukakis promised
``we're going forward, not back'' with investments in the economy,
drug-free schools and the environment.
   Dukakis' 24-minute speech broadcast from the House Chamber was
interrupted 21 times for applause. The audience included
legislators, state officials and family members.
   Referring to his critics as ``the chronic complainers and the
gloom-and-doomers,'' the Democratic governor said: ``Well, I have a
message for them tonight, because they are the gutless wonders of
Massachusetts politics. I'm not going to let them get away with it,
and neither are you.''
   The statement drew the strongest applause of the night.
   Two days after his surprise announcement that he would not seek a
fourth term in 1990, Dukakis pledged to fight harder than ever for
his agenda.
   ``Some people may think that over the next two years I intend to
ride off into the sunset. Well, they're sadly mistaken,'' he said.
   Jim Braude, head of the liberal Tax Equity Alliance for
Massachusetts, said he was very encouraged. ``He painted a picture
of a very compassionate state and said with no equivocation that
compassion costs money,'' Braude said.
   Rep. John Flood, a conservative Democrat who is chairman of the
Taxation committee and who has blamed Dukakis for the fiscal
predicament, fumed that the ``gutless wonders'' remark was tasteless.
   In his speech, Dukakis briefly mentioned his presidential
campaign as ``the adventure of my life'' and made a veiled reference
to President-elect George Bush when he said: ``Tonight is a night
for tough talk _ and no lip reading.''

   Troops backed by tanks and
armored personnel carriers today stormed a military garrison after
Moslem captors killed a general they were holding hostage, officials
said.
   A hospital near the garrison said at least five people were
wounded. A wounded soldier reported numerous dead, and city police
chief Lt. Col. Jovencio Gongora said several bodies still were in
the compound.
   Gongora said he suspended the assault at dark. Bodies could not
be recovered because some dissident Moslems were believed still on
the grounds.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters in Manila the attack
began after the military learned the regional Constabulary
commander, Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, had been shot and killed by a
renegade Moslem policemen.
   One of the wounded, Staff Sgt. Rosendo Novelenio, told reporters
there were ``many dead'' on the second floor of the headquarters
building where Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and his chief of staff,
Col. Romeo Abendan, had been held. There was no word on Abendan's
fate.
   Batalla and Abendan were captured Thursday after Batalla ordered
Moslem policemen to surrender their weapons and face murder charges
in a 1984 incident.
   House of Representatives Speaker Ramon Mitra said the military
decided to storm the garrison after the policemen's leader,
patrolman Rizal Alih, rejected Mitra's last offer. Mitra had asked
to see Batalla and verify he was alive.
   Ramos said the military learned of Batalla's death from the
governor of largely Moslem Sulu province, Tupay Loong, who spoke
with the kidnappers.
   Witnesses said tanks and armored personnel carriers smashed
through the gates ahead of marines. Reporters saw captors resist
with automatic rifles and grenade launchers, and at least one
armored vehicle was disabled by the firing.
   Reporters said a portion of the building where the hostages were
held had been destroyed by tank fire.
   Officials said 30 to 40 armed men, some of whom may have been
Moslem soldiers, apparently slipped into the headquarters building
overnight to join Alih and an estimated 15 followers. The captors
demanded to be flown to Siasi Island, 120 miles to the southwest.
   Mitra said Alih reneged on an overnight deal to end the dispute
in exchange for a safe passage to Palawan Island, where he would
surrender to military police.
   Alih was charged in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor Cesar
Climaco but was acquitted. Three weeks after Climaco's death, seven
people were killed in a marine raid on Alih's home.
   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batalla
received permission to arrest Alih. He and eight others were ordered
detained by Batalla and all of them could be charged with murder or
conspiracy to commit murder.
   Military officials claim Alih has been operating several illegal
businesses in the Zamboanga area, 560 miles south of Manila.
   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which has
population of 59 million. About half Zamboanga's residents are
Christian and half Moslem.
   Batalla, 50, was promoted to brigadier general last month. He
graduated from the Philippine Military Academy in 1961, finishing
sixth in a class of 54.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said they will seek fines and
jail time for two Chicago Tribune reporters accused of defying a
judge's gag order in publishing the name of a boy accused of
stabbing three classmates.
   Circuit Judge Robert E. Byrne, who issued the gag order, declined
to drop contempt of court charges against reporters Joseph Sjostrom
and Jan Crawford during a hearing Thursday but said he would give
the case to another judge.
   Assistant State's Attorney Carmen Polo said he would seek fines
and jail sentences if the two are convicted.
   Byrne had ordered news media not to identify the 14-year-old
charged in the stabbings at a high school Dec. 7. The Tribune had
published the teen-ager's name before the judge issued the order and
published it again the day after the order.
   The newspaper said the reporters had obtained the boy's name
after interviewing his mother and students at the school in Elmhurst.
   ``Truthful information in the public domain can't be made secret
again by an order,'' said Joseph P. Thornton, an attorney for the
newspaper.
   ``There is an element of waiver when the mother talks to the
press in detail and gives them the name,'' he said.
   He said that the Tribune believed the gag order was improper and
based on an unconstitutional law and that the decision to print the
name was made by editors.

   A salvage team searching the
floor of the Indian Ocean today found the cockpit voice recorder of
a South African Airways jet that crashed more than 13 months ago
near Mauritius, the government said.
   All 159 people aboard the Boeing 747 from Taipei, Taiwan, to
Johannesburg died in the Nov. 28, 1987 crash that occurred minutes
before the plane was to make a scheduled stop in Port Louis in the
island nation of Mauritius.
   South Africa has not released any explanation for the cause of
the crash, but it staged an elaborate search for the flight recorder
that has cost $6 million, accoring to the Department of Transport.
   The recovery ship Stena Workhorse, using a remote-controlled
mini-submarine, found the recorder 110 miles northeast of Mauritius
at a depth of 2.5 miles, said the minister of transport, Eli Louw.
He said the recorder would be brought to South Africa for
examination as soon as possible.

   Gov. George Deukmejian has touched off
what could be a political free-for-all with the announcement he will
not seek re-election in 1990.
   The two-term Republican, first elected in 1982 against Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, said Thursday he has no ambition to set
``some record for longevity'' and will return to private life,
perhaps in business or law.
   He ruled out a post in President-elect Bush's administration,
saying, ``I have no interest whatsoever in going to Washington.''
   Three prominent Republicans and one Democrat immediately
announced that they were considering running for governor.
   Six other prominent politicians _ three in each party _ either
said they would have announcements soon or declined to comment on
rumors they were interested.
   The 60-year-old Deukmejian said he had planned from the beginning
to serve only two terms.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp is widely viewed as the early
front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor. He declined
to comment Thursday on his political plans but had declared late
last year that he intended to form an exploratory committee for a
gubernatorial campaign.
   Republican Pete Wilson, elected two months ago to his second term
in the U.S. Senate, also declined to say whether he will seek
Deukmejian's office.
   Former San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein, a Democrat, said
after Deukmejian's announcement that she was forming an exploratory
committee, and state Sen. Bill Campbell, former state Sen. H.L.
Richardson and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said they were
considering seeking the GOP nomination.
   Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth also has been mentioned as
a potential Republican candidate.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's deputy foreign
minister promised today that the Red Army will be out of Afghanistan
by Feb. 15, an Afghan guerrilla leader said after meeting with him.
   However, minister Yuli Vorontsov appeared to be reneging on a
promise that Moscow would not insist on a postwar role for
Afghanistan's communist party, said Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, leader
of the rebel delegation at the meeting.
   The two sides held a second round of direct talks in the Pakistan
capital, and Mojaddidi said they agreeed to meet again ``in a few
days.''
   Vorontsov ``promised that they will withdraw on the 15th of
February. They confirmed this,'' the guerrilla leader told reporters
after the talks.
   Vorontsov refused comment, but when he arrived in Islamabad on
Wednesday, he said the withdrawal deadline could be pushed back if
the Moslem guerrillas continue fighting.
   ``They asked for a cease-fire several times, but we said a
cease-fire is not possible,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we said we can
stop attacking your military forces when they are leaving
Afghanistan.''
   Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan in 1979
to help the communist government in its war with the guerrillas.
Under a U.N.-mediated accord reached in April, the Kremlin promised
to withdraw its forces by Feb. 15. Half had been pulled out by
August.
   Vorontsov and the guerrillas were at an impasse on the postwar
role of the Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, said
Mojaddidi.
   Despite earlier rebel demands that Moscow stop insisting there be
a part for the communists to play in a postwar government, Vorontsov
continued to make a pitch for the Soviet Union's proteges, the
Afghan leader said.
   ``They want the present regime to participate in the future
government,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we can't (allow that).''
   The guerrilla fighters, based in Pakistan and Iran, agreed prior
to today's talks that President Najib of Afghanistan and his Marxist
party were anathema to peace.
   Vorontsov scheduled a news conference Saturday, the final day of
his four-day trip. He will also meet Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
on Saturday.
   Mojaddidi, who is chairman of a loose alliance of seven
Pakistani-based guerrilla parties, said the only agreement that came
out of today's talks was ``that we will continue the negotiations
after a few days.'' He did not say where they would meet.
   The first Soviet-guerrilla talks were held last month in the
Saudi Arabian resort city of Taif.

   A messy mix of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain hit the
Midwest and East today, as storms dropped as many as 8 inches of
snow in the West and unleashed winds of up to 80 mph.
   Snow fell in Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Menomonee Falls
received more than 3 inches. Rain, freezing rain and sleet were
reported as far south as North Carolina.
   Weather advisories for snow and freezing drizzle were issued for
Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin and for snow and freezing rain in
Indiana, lower Michigan and Pennsylvania. A winter storm warning was
in effect in extreme northeast Ohio.
   Winter weather advisories were also posted in West Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, New York City and New York
state's Long Island.
   The deaths of two homeless men in New York City were blamed on
the cold.
   Thunderstorms boomed over Illinois and Indiana. Rain was
scattered over the rest of the Ohio Valley and the Tennessee Valley.
   Snow also fell over much of the West, and rain fell along
sections of the Pacific Coast.
   In Nevada, Lake Tahoe ski areas received 1 to 2 feet of snow. Ten
inches fell between Ely and Elko, and 6 to 8 inches fell in Eureka,
which also had blowing and drifting snow. The snow and winds of 60
to 70 mph produced zero visibilities in that area.
   The snow snarled rush-hour traffic in Reno, delaed flights in and
out of Reno Cannon International Airport and was blamed for sending
about 20 cars skidding off a highway between Reno and Carson City.
   In California, a snow slide blocked portions a highway near Lake
Tahoe, and avalanche crews closed some roads. In Utah, dense fog
contributed to accidents involving more than a dozen vehicles on a
freeway in Salt Lake Valley.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for Nevada and for Utah,
where up to 2 feet of snow was expected. Snow also fell in Wyoming,
Montana and North Dakota. Snow advisories were posted in Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona, Southern California's Owens Valley and
North Dakota.
   Today's forecast called for snow showers from southern New
England to southern New York state, much of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
northern Virginia, and northern West Virginia and in eastern Upper
Michigan; freezing rain from Lower Michigan to northern Ohio, with
rain from the rest of the upper Ohio Valley to Virginia andNorth
Carolina; snow from much of the northern Plains to the northern
Rockies; and rain along the southern and central Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were predicted in the teens in northern New
England and northeast New York, North Dakota and Montana; 20s and
30s from the rest of New England to New Jersey, the northern half of
the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley,
South Dakota, Nebraska, the Rockies, Nevada and parts of the central
Pacific Coast; 80s in southern Texas; 70s in much of the rest of
Texas, the central Gulf Coast and Florida; and 50s and 60s in the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees below zero at St. Johnsbury, Vt., to 72 degrees at Key West,
Fla.

   Less than six weeks after undergoing a rare
five-organ transplant, a 3-year-old girl is rejecting the new organs
and will die without another complete transplant, doctors say.
   Rolandrea Dodge of Farmington, N.M., became only the second
person to receive a new liver, stomach, pancreas, small intestine
and portion of a large intestine in a 16{-hour operation Nov. 29.
   But Dr. Thomas Starzl, the transplant pioneer at Children's
Hospital here, said Thursday the girl's immune system was rejecting
the new organs. Hospital officials launched a nationwide search for
another set of donor organs after blood tests and biopsies revealed
the rejection, Starzl said.
   ``She is very critically ill. Rolly's only chance for survival is
with a new set of organs,'' said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon.
   The little girl was in intensive care, her breathing aided by a
respirator. Rolly, as she is called by parents Cyndi and Brandon
Dodge, was born with intractable secretory diarrhea, an incurable
disease that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and
liquids. She has spent her life in hospitals, getting 21 hours a day
of high-protein food through intravenous feeding.
   Four other people in the United States have had multiple
abdominal organ transplants, and all have died. Three of the cases
involved fewer than five organs, while only one involved five.
Doctors are not sure what went wrong with Rolly because there are so
few precedents, Ms. McMahon said.
   ``Doctors are seeing some things ... and they they are not
exactly certain what they are. They can't say definitely what is
happening, but they can say they're resulting from the changes in
her immune system,'' she said.
   Two of the previous four transplants took place at Children's.
The most recent was Tabatha Foster, 3, of Madisonville, Ky., who
died of a blood infection in May, six months after her operation.
Tabatha was the only other patient to get five organs.
   ``Some of Rolly's symptoms are different from Tabatha's,'' Ms.
McMahon said. ``In all of her six months, Tabatha never exhibited
any symptoms of rejection.''
   Doctors believe Tabatha's infection was caused by the amount of
cyclosporine she received. While cyclosporine keeps the body's
immune system from rejecting donated organs, too much of it can
leave a patient vulnerable to infections. Rolly was given less of
the drug than Tabatha.

   Two Sikhs shouted a religious battle cry
moments before they were hanged today for the 1984 assassination of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, autorities said.
   The executions prompted threats of massacres by Sikh militants.
Heavily-armed police and paramilitary units were on alert in the
capital, as well as in Punjab and neighboring states of Himachal
Pradesh and Haryana.
   Scattered violence was reported in New Delhi and Punjab.
   Satwant Singh, Mrs. Gandhi's bodyguard, and Kehar Singh were
pronounced dead less than a half-hour after they were taken from
their tiny cells on death row and marched to the rain-soaked gallows
at New Delhi's Tihar Jail, a police official said.
   According to a Home Ministry official, Kehar Singh proclaimed his
innocence and Satwant Singh said he had no regrets. As the nooses
were tied around their necks, they shouted the Sikh warrior call,
``Say the faithful, God is great!'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The executions capped four years of legal maneuvering that began
after Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, apparently in
revenge for an army raid she ordered on the Golden Temple, the
holiest Sikh shrine.
   The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected appeals by both men.
   Satwant Singh was one of the two policemen who opened fire on
Mrs. Gandhi in the garden of her official residence. The other,
Beant Singh, was shot to death minutes later by Gandhi's bodyguards.
   Kehar Singh, Beant Singh's uncle, was convicted of helping plot
the assassination.
   Satwant Singh, 30, and Kehar Singh, a 54-year-old former
government clerk, are not related. Like all members of the Sikh
religion, they take the Singh name, which means lion in Punjabi
language.
   Shortly before 8 a.m., the men were taken from their 8-by-8 foot
prison cells. With their hands tied behind their backs and their
legs bound with iron chains, they were escorted by guards to the
scaffold in the open courtyard, 25 steps away.
   Caps were put on their heads and inch-thick ropes placed around
their necks. Two hangmen then pulled the bolts that released the
trapdoors.
   Relatives of Kehar Singh, including his son Rajinder and wife
Jabsir, wept at a police barricade about a half-mile from the jail.
   Police said no civilian was allowed to witness the execution.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh spent their final hours visiting
relatives and lawyers.
   Satwant Singh's lawyer, R.S. Sodhi, described his client as
``very, very composed'' and read a handwritten statement from him.
   ``There is no greater privilege for a Sikh to lay down his life
for the protection'' of the Sikh faith, the statement said. ``I wish
I could be born again and again and each time lay down my life for
this.''
   The bodies of the men were cremated, a Home Ministry official
said. Prison officials said the ashes would not be turned over to
relatives for fear of violence.
   In the northern city of Amritsar, wall posters threatened mass
killings of Hindus. The head priest of the Sikh religion, Darshan
Singh Ragi, told 300 people at a special prayer service that the men
``did the right thing in killing Mrs. Gandhi.''
   Police in New Delhi reported the stoning of buses near the
prison. In Punjab, suspected Sikh extremists set fire to a bus in
the village of Vaunver, and security forces defused two bombs hidden
in the center of the town of Ludihana, police said. There were no
reports of casualties.
   Both men were convicted in 1986 and sentenced to death. The
convictions and sentences were later upheld by the Delhi High Court
and the Supreme Court.
   Another Sikh, Balbir Singh, also was convicted of conspiracy and
sentenced to death. The Supreme Court, however, acquitted him for
lack of evidence.
   Four months before her assassination, Mrs. Gandhi ordered an army
raid on the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine. The temple was
being used as a armed base by militant Sikhs.
   More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the radi.
   Gandhi's assassination caused anti-Sikh riots in northern India
by members of the Hindu majority. More than 2,700 people were
killed, nearly all of them Sikhs.
   Sikh violence has increased since, and at least 2,440 people were
killed last year in Punjab, the only Indian state in which Sikhs are
the majority.
   Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in
Punjab. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more than
80 percent of India's 880 million people.

   A fraternity whose members disrupted two
African studies classes at the University of Wisconsin has agreed to
pay more than $40,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing them of civil
rights violations.
   The University of Illinois chapter of Acacia denied in the
tentative agreement filed in federal court Thursday that the April 8
disruptions were racially motivated.
   But Anne Sulton, an attorney for students in the two classes,
likened the incident to a ``Ku Klux Klan night ride.''
   The fraternity agreed to pay $50 to each of the students in an
African languages class and $40 to those in a class on African
storytelling.
   Ruben Cotton and James Sommers, the students who brought the
class action lawsuit alleging that the disruptions were racially
motivated and deprived students of their civil rights, will receive
$2,500 and $750 respectively.
   Their lawyers said fraternity members called Cotton ``boy'' when
he tried to stop them from throwing stink bombs and disrupting a
class. Cotton is black.
   A professor said someone jumped on his back during a melee in his
class.
   The settlement is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge John
Shabaz.
   In August, a Dane County judge placed on probation seven
fraternity members who pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and
unauthorized presence on university property.
   They were required to donate money to charity, volunteer time to
community organizations and write essays on black history.

<TEXT>
   Troops searched the home of former
President Ferdinand Marcos today for soldiers who allegedly were
involved in a robbery in which four people were killed, officials
said.
   Marines in battle gear surrounded the mansion in San Juan, a
suburb of Manila, but they found nothing after a two-hour search,
said Col. Emiliano Templo, deputy chief of the Philippine
Constabulary's Capital Command.
   Armed men described as soldiers on Monday held up an armored van
carrying $350,000, and three of them were killed in a shootout with
police. The other robbers escaped after killing a police officer.
   Templo said the military obtained a warrant to search the
premises after a soldier allegedly involved in the robbery told
investigators the other suspects were using the Marcos house as
their hideout.
   Templo, who led the raid, said the search was hampered because
electricity in the house was cut off shortly after Marcos and his
family fled to Hawaii during the February 1986 civilian-military
uprising that ended his 20-year rule. He said the search was
conducted with lights brought by television crews.
   Looters stripped the house of its furnishings after the Marcoses
fled, and only the caretaker and a few security guards occupy the
house now, Templo said.

   ``Bloom County'' was 25 years behind the
times in a comic strip satirizing ``flesh''-colored crayons as part
of a ``Crayola-Republican conspiracy.''
   The strip by Berke Breathed on Thursday depicted a black child
pondering a ``flesh''-colored Crayola crayon while drawing a
self-portrait.
   There hasn't been a Crayola crayon called ``flesh'' since 1963,
said the manufacturer, Binney &amp; Smith Inc. The company said it
changed the name of the color to ``peach,'' partially as a result of
the civil rights movement.
   Company spokesman Brad Drexler said the change ``was really our
people saying, `Look, the description of flesh really isn't
accurate.'''
   Spokeswoman Suzanne Whelton of The Washington Post Writers Group,
which syndicates ``Bloom County,'' said the point of the strip was
to lampoon commercial definitions of ``flesh'' color.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Threaten To Kill Two U.S. Missionaries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A note found at the site where two U.S.
missionaries were kidnapped said drug traffickers will kill them if
Colombians are extradited to the United States to face drug charges,
an official said.
   The missionaries, kidnapped Tuesday night, had received threats
and knew they lived in a dangerous area, a relative in the United
States said today.
   Hector Pardo, spokesman for the Colombian Evangelical
Federations, said the missionaries _ Richard Grover, 50, of Warroad,
Minn., and Roy Libby, 50, of Atlanta _ were being held by drug
traffickers who threatened to kill one of them for every Colombian
extradited to the United States to face drug charges.
   Their kidnappers also have demanded the release of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, an extradited drug kingpin sentenced to life imprisonment
without parole last year in the United States, said Pardo.
   Grover and Libby were kidnapped by about 10 men dressed in
military uniforms as they attended a meeting of evangelists in La
Florida village, 180 miles southwest of Bogota, he said.
   ``The kidnappers came into the meeting and demanded money, and
they didn't have any money to give them. So they took the two
missionaries. They (authorities) haven't heard a word since then,''
said Grover's sister, Connie Wold of Thief River Falls, Minn.
   Ms. Wold said drug traffickers had threatened her brother before
and he knew he lived in a dangerous area.
   Pardo also said a Norwegian-Colombian missionary, Bruce Olson,
was abducted by leftist guerrillas in September and is still alive.
   Olson, whose mother and brother live in St. Paul, Minn., was
kidnapped while working with the Motilone tribe on the Venezuelan
border, Pardo said.
   Olson became a Colombian citizen last year, Pardo said.
   A note found at the spot where Grover and Libby were abducted
said one American would be killed for every Colombian extradited to
the United States to face drug charges, Pardo said in a telephone
interview. Libby has lived in Colombia 20 years and Grover has lived
here 10 years, he said.
   Colombian security forces for seven years have said that leftist
guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking but have never produced
evidence.
   Raids on drug traffickers hideouts have turned up dozens of
police and army uniforms and other disguises.
   Colombia extradited 14 Colombians to the United States to face
drug trafficking charges under a 1979 treaty. But none has been
extradited since the Colombian Supreme Court negated the treaty on a
constitutional technicality last April.
   Seven years ago, before security forces began alleging guerrilla
involvement in drug trafficking, insurgents kidnapped and killed
American missionary Chester Bitterman in Bogota. There were 600
kidnappings in Colombia last year, most of them by leftist
guerrillas.
   In July, Lehder Rivas was sentenced in Jacksonville, Fla., to 135
years in prison and fined $350,000 for smuggling tons of cocaine
into the United States.
   He was a leader of the Medellin cartel, a major cocaine-smuggling
organization. He was arrested and sent to the United States in 1987
after a gun battle at his mansion in Medellin.

<HEAD>Serbian Media Carry Entire Christmas Message By Patriarch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patriarch German called today for an
end to Serbian suffering in the ethnically troubled province of
Kosovo. His Orthodox Christmas address was carried in full for the
first time by state-run media.
   Although the Serbian patriarch's Christmas addresses have been
carried in the state press since 1987, today was the first time
communist authorities allowed the entire message to be printed.
   German called for a prayer which would ``finally end ...
suffering on the Serbian Kosovo and Metohija.'' Metohija is the
traditional Serbian name for the region renamed Kosovo despite
opposition from the Serbian Orthodox church.
   Belgrade's Politika daily also quoted the head of the Serbian
Orthodox Church as repeating an earlier statement that ``the events
in Kosovo and Metohija represent an incurable wound for the Serbian
Orthodox church.''
   Today, the eve of Serbian Orthodox Christmas, Belgrade television
was expected to carry excerpts from the Patriarch's message, TV
sources said.
   The Orthodox Serbian minority claims that harassment by ethnic
Albanians is driving them from Kosovo, the ancient Serbian heartland
that borders Albania. More than 30,000 Slavs have migrated from the
region since 1981, when at least nine people died in ethnic violence.
   Moslem ethnic Albanians, who have the highest birthrate in
Europe, comprise about 90 percent of the population of the backward
southern Yugoslav province.
   There has been an increasingly open celebration of religious
holidays in Yugoslavia in recent years, coinciding with the
communists apparent inability to curb the worst economic and social
problems in history.

   Fire swept through a five-story apartment
house undergoing renovation, killing four people and injuring five,

authorities said today.
   ``The building looks like it's probably a total loss,'' said
Police Chief Richard J. Abele.
   About 150 to 200 firefighters battled the blaze Thursday night.
   The cause of the fire was not known, but it was believed to have
spread through an elevator shaft of the brick building, which was
being renovated, said Deputy Fire Marshal Michael Kirby.
   ``It had just been inspected. It had a full book of approvals,''
said Fire Chief Harold Lamphere. ``The (smoke) alarms were ringing.
Everything was working.''
   The last of the dead were removed from the building this morning,
authorities said.
   A man who suffered fractures when he apparently jumped from the
building was at Hartford Hospital, authorities said. His condition
was not available.
   Two people suffering from smoke inhalation were in fair condition
at William H. Backus Hospital, a spokeswoman said. A firefighter and
another person were treated for minor injuries.

   Tighter security measures ordered
after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 took effect today at British
airports, causing some passenger delays while workers closely
searched carry-on baggage.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon announced the stepped-up
security Thursday after a meeting of the National Aviation Security
Committee in London.
   The new measures are aimed primarily at American carriers, and
passengers faced long lines to have their hand baggage examined
before boarding Pan Am and TWA flights at London's Heathrow Airport.
   ``I certainly believe that it's best to take a few extra
precuations and be safe, rather than rush things and be sorry,''
said Lee Godman who was traveling to Miami.
   Channon announced Thursday immediate ``further steps to increase
safety of the security of cargo, also mislaid luggage and also to
take further steps to tighten up the existing regulations on cabin
bags.''
   ``There will be more rigorous searching on American airlines, and
on any airline where we think the threat is commensurate, but at the
moment it will be American airlines,'' he said.
   He gave no other details but said he would soon take additional
measures to increase airline security.
   Channon's announcement came hours after Lockerbie buried two
townspeople killed when wreckage and blazing jet fuel from the New
York-bound Boeing 747 rained on the southern Scottish town Dec. 21.
   The explosion killed all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the
ground.
   London's Evening Standard newspaper on Thursday reported that
experts probing the crash were concentrating on 12 passengers
believed to have joined Flight 103 in London after arriving from
airports in the Middle East.
   ``The fear is that their baggage, checked in as destined for New
York at airports with much less stringent checks than London, may
have been put on to the doomed jet without further security tests,''
the paper said.
   There was no official comment on the report from Pan Am.
   The government on Thursday announced a $1.8 million rebuilding
program in Lockerbie, where buildings were destroyed by falling
wreckage and fire.
   In the small, close-knit town, a Requiem Mass was held Thursday
for one of the victims, 10-year-old Joanne Flannigan.
   Her parents are also counted among Lockerbie's 11 dead but their
bodies have not been found.
   Joanne is survived only by brothers Stephen, 14, who was fixing
her bicycle at a neighbor's house at the time of the crash, and
David, 20, who lives away from home.
   Later Thursday, a funeral service was held at All Saints
Episcopal Church for another victim, 81-year-old Mary Lancaster.
   Searchers have recovered 242 bodies, and by Thursday night had
released 164 of them for burial or other funeral arrangements.
   Officials say they believe some of the 28 still missing may have
been cremated in the fiery fuel-fed crash that left a 30-foot-deep
crater in the town.

   President Reagan said today he supports a 50
percent pay raise for members of Congress and other federal
officials because ``we must not allow federal service to become the
province only of the wealthy.''
   In a letter to the House and Senate, Reagan said he endorsed the
pay-raise recommendations of the Commission on Executive,
Legislative and Judicial Salaries. He said ``fair compensation for
those who bear the responsibility for effective functioning of our
government is critical at this juncture of history.''
   In advance of the president's decision, which was made public
late Thursday by the White House, consumer activist Ralph Nader
labeled it the ``greatest salary grab in government history.''
   The raise will increase the pay for members of Congress and
federal judges to $135,000 a year unless both houses of Congress
reject it by Feb. 8.
   In his letter today, the president coupled his support for the
pay hike with a plea that Congress at the same time bar outside
income such as speaking fees, as the commission recommended last
month.
   ``The current system undermines public faith in the integrity of
senior federal officials, particularly in the legislative branch,''
Reagan wrote. ``Congress should move immediately to enact
legislation that takes a comprehensive approach to the problems
posed by honoraria, including payments for articles, speeches and
appearances, and other forms of financial benefits.''
   President-elect Bush, asked today about the pay raise, said he
supports whatever Reagan decides, but may take another look at the
issue when he becomes president.
   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,
Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything other
than to get this deficit under control. ... I am vice president and
I will be supportive of what the president decides. I've done that
for seven and eleven-twelfths years and I don't plan to change now.
So let's see what the president says and then when the ball is in my
court and the buck is stopping on my desk, I may have something else
to say about matters of this nature,'' Bush said.
   He spoke after the White House released Reagan's letter
supporting the pay increase.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said, ``I'm very pleased that the
president has decided to make this decision. This is a pay raise for
all the top-level federal officials ... but, of course, we
(Congress) take all the heat.''
   Nader said, however, ``Mr. Reagan has put an end to any further
pretense that he wants his federal deficit reduced. He has thumbed
his nose at the vast majority of the American people, Republican,
independent and Democrat alike who are against the greatest salary
grab in government history.''
   Reagan could have modified the proposal made last month by the
commission. Under the law, unless both the House and Senate vote to
head off the pay increases, they will automatically take effect 30
days after the plan is submitted to Congress with the proposed
federal budget on Monday.
   The commission recommended that members of Congress and federal
district judges, who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000. The
House speaker's salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000, and that
of majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.
   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would get
raises from their current $99,500 to $155,000.
   The commission also recommended that Congress raise the
president's pay to about $350,000 from the current $200,000, where
it has stood since 1969. However, such a hike would not take effect
until 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising a
president's pay during his term.
   Fazio said he believes the Senate is likely to reject the raise,
as it has in past years when the House allowed pay hikes to take
effect. The lawmaker said he believed a ban on honoraria would be
enacted if the raises were accepted. He said that would keep the
overall benefit to lawmakers less than that for judges.
   On Thursday, the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union delivered
petitions to the White House bearing the names of 13,000 people who
oppose the raise.
   Spokesman David Keating said after the White House announcement,
``I think Reagan's action is outrageous. Adopting fat pay raises for
top officials will sabotage President-elect Bush's flexible spending
freeze proposal ... Raising congressional pay by 50 percent is about
as popular as trading arms with the ayatollah.''
   A White House statement said that since 1969, ``salary levels for
senior federal officials _ executives, legislators and judges _ have
declined 35 percent in constant dollars while the compensation of
workers in the private sector has kept pace with inflation.''
   ``Federal trial judges are currently earning less than some
junior lawyers in private practice and are leaving the bench in
record numbers,'' it said.
   In addition, deputy White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht said
the National Institutes of Health had trouble attracting qualified
scientists for senior positions in critical areas such as cancer
research, and the average length of service in the executive branch
had fallen to 18 months.
   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the salary commission, said last month
he expected strong pressure to abolish honoraria and other forms of
outside pay.
   The public interest group Common Cause has reported that
lawmakers accepted a record $9.8 million in speaking fees from
special interest groups in 1987.
   The pay recommendations directly affect about 2,500 top federal
employees and indirectly affect 10,000 other high-level employees
whose pay is tied to salaries in the top echelon.

   An official at a leading university
today said two microscopic tissue samples used for medical education
may have come from the corpses of Nazi victims, but he denied the
practice was widespread.
   A report by the television network ARD that West German
universities still use body parts from Nazi victims for medical
instruction has touched off angry reaction from Israeli officials,
who called for an official investigation.
   But administrators at three West German universities said they
knew of no tissue samples from Nazi victims at their institutions,
and a fourth school _ Tuebingen _ said it has withdrawn from its
anatomy collection the two microscopic examples it had had in store.
Officials at a fifth West German university could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   Tuebingen and Heidelberg universities are at the center of the
furor caused by the ARD television report late Monday night.
   The Israeli media also picked up on the ARD report saying the two
universities use body parts from Nazi victims, including communists
and the mentally handicapped, for medical education.
   Georg Sandberger, Tuebingen University chancellor, today said the
ARD report is incorrect and that there was no widespread use of such
tissues at his university.
   ``We conducted an inquiry after the allegations. We found we had
only two items of microscopic tissues in our collection of anatomy
that may have come from the victims of the Nazi regime,'' Sandberger
said in a telephone interview from his home in Tuebingen.
``Subsequently, I have ordered those withdrawn from the collection.''
   Sandberger said records at the school indicate the two tissue
samples may have been taken from the corpses of ``a young Polish
woman and a young German who were decapitated in Stuttgart'' during
the Nazi regime.
   He said the tissues may have been left over from the times when
Nazis delivered corpses of their victims to universities for
anatomical study.
   Sandberger said, ``In our collection now there are neither body
parts nor tissues which we can trace to this (Nazi) time.''
   The AP attempted to reach Heidelberg University officials to
comment on the media allegations, but the institute was closed
because of a local holiday.
   The university chancellor, Siegfried Kraft, was vacationing in
the Black Forest and could not be reached.
   Sandberger said the media reports were ``mainly based on wrong
information which was given by one of our professors.'' He
apparently was referring to Professor Ulrich Drews.
   Israel TV quoted Drews as saying, ``Especially at our university,
these samples (taken from corpses of Nazi victims) are very valuable
for teaching.''
   He was further quoted as saying, ``They were prepared ... in an
almost artistic manner.''
   The AP attempted to reach Drews four times by telephone at his
home to ask for comment, but there was no answer. There was also no
answer at his office.
   Sandberger said he was ``embarrassed about these comments on the
tissue _ that they couldn't be removed (from the anatomy collection)
because they were wonderfully drafted.'' He added, ``This is not the
right attitude to have toward this issue.''
   Israel TV reported that more than a thousand bodies were sent to
German universities for use in medical education during the Nazis'
12-year rule.
   Sandberger said Tuebingen University had received some corpses
during that time but that they were all buried in a Tuebingen
cemetery after the war or handed to Allied occupation authorities.
   A number of West German universities have begun responding to the
media reports that use of the remains of Nazi victims for medical
education is a widespread occurrence.
   ``Since World War II there have been no samples here from people
executed or from the bodies of the persecuted,'' said Karl Zilles,
director of the Cologne University anatomy department.
   Spokesmen at Hamburg University and Berlin Free University also
said they know of no such samples at their schools and that their
anatomical collections stem from after the war.

   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings says he has a
blockage in his coronary arteries and may seek to delay his Senate
impeachment trial.
   ``I know this much _ my life comes before anybody's
impeachment,'' the 52-year-old judge said Thursday.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King said Hastings'
caseload will be reduced out of concern for his health.
   Hastings has continued to preside over civil trials since the
House impeached him Aug. 3. Senate Rules Committee hearings on his
trial are set for Jan. 26.
   He is accused of conspiring to obtain a $150,000 bribe and lying
about it at his 1983 trial, at which he was acquitted. Hastings also
is accused of breaching confidentiality about a wiretap and bringing
disrepute on the courts.
   A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is needed to convict
Hastings and remove him from the bench.
   Hastings said cardiac catherization Dec. 28 showed one artery is
75 percent blocked and another is 50 percent blocked. More tests are
scheduled for Jan. 12, he said.
   ``If my health, according to the physical, (is satisfactory), be
assured I'll be there bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and ready to
proceed,'' Hastings said. ``If not, nobody on Earth will cause me
to.''

<HEAD>Rival Shiite Militias Battle In South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias hammered each
other's positions in south Lebanon with artillery and grenades
today, and police said at least two people were wounded.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran called on the Syrian-backed Amal
and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militias to end the bloodshed, saying
``vengeance will not solve anything in Lebanon,'' according to the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Amal and Hezbollah fighters battled with mortars, guns and
grenades in Jbaa, Ein Bouswar, Jarjou and Louwaizeh, which are
mostly deserted villlages in southern Lebanon.
   One Amal militiaman and a civilian woman were wounded in the
fighting on the edge of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone,
north of its border with Lebanon, police said.
   The latest fighting, which came after two days of calm, brought
the casualty toll to 29 killed and 78 wounded since clashes between
the militias began Dec. 31, according to police.
   Khamenei accused the Americans and the Israelis of instigating
the fighting, according to the official Iranian agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   ``We believe the confrontation between Hezbollah and Amal is not
natural. There are hands at work trying to implement the plans of
global arrogance against the people of Lebanon,'' the news agency
quoted Khameini as saying.
   ``Global arrogance'' is the phrase used by Iran for the United
States and its allies.
   Since Dec. 31, the two militias have battled in the southern
slums of Beirut and in south Lebanon. Syrian troops stopped the
violence in Beirut.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, and Hezbollah, or Party of God, are
struggling for dominance of the 1 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains an estimated
40,000 troops in the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. But it has no military presence in south Lebanon.
   Senior officials from both sides have been shuttling between
Damascus and Tehran in recent weeks in an apparent effort to dampen
the feuding.

   Morning disc jockeys Glenn Beck and Clydie Clyde began a contest
this week that asked KRBE-FM listeners to send in breakfast meat and
a raw egg in a regular envelope with no padding. The first to arrive
unbroken was worth $1,004.
   Eleven envelopes arrived Thursday. Six were leaking yellow and
clear goo. Five arrived unscathed. ``I think that's pretty
amazing,'' Beck said.
   Postal officials, however, were not amused, fearing one of their
$900,000 sorting machines would get yucked up with yolk. They also
reminded station officials that regulations prohibit mailing of
perishable foods.
   The station invited the postmaster and the manager of the local
post office to appear on the radio show.
   ``Hopefully, it will smooth some feathers,'' said Jim Sartorius,
KRGE operations manager.

<HEAD>Kim Dae-jung Says Koreans Want Stability, But Also Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said
Friday South Koreans want stability after years of political turmoil
and President Roh Tae-woo must keep his promise of full democracy to
ensure that stability.
   ``People want to see stability. Stability is the most important
issue for our people,'' Kim said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   Koreans, however, are also determined to have democracy after
years of military rule and there won't be political peace if the
government fails to meet their expectations, he said. ``Without
democracy we cannot have stability,'' he said.
   Kim, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, also said he
plans to visit Moscow for talks on improving relations. He also
called on the United States to show it fully supports democracy in
South Korea.
   Roh, who completes his first year in office next month, has not
yet proved he intends to meet his promise of bringing in total
democracy, Kim said.
   Kim said he did not see any strong public opinion at this point
on whether Roh should keep a 1987 campaign promise to hold a
referendum to give voters a chance to evaluate his performance. The
government has indicated a decision on a referendum will be made
this spring.
   Asked if he expects Roh to complete his five-year term, Kim said,
``If he can really be sincere in realizing democracy and realize
freedom and justice, then he can be safe. Without that his
government cannot be safe.''
   The opposition has taken a more moderate approach toward Roh in
recent months, apparently sensing a public desire for stability. But
opposition leaders would be quick to seize on any opportunity to
attack Roh if public sentiment turns against the government.
   Kim and rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam were defeated by
Roh in December 1987 presidential elections after they split the
opposition vote. Roh, a former general, has implemented broad
reforms under his promise to introduce full democracy.
   A major challenge confronting Roh is the government's handling of
the legacy of his disgraced predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and
uncovering of corruption and human rights abuses under Chun's rule,
Kim said.
   Roh, a longtime friend of Chun, opposes opposition demands that
Chun be made to appear before a National Assembly investigation into
misdeeds of the old government. Chun went into rural exile in
November after apologizing to the nation.
   The government must also complete work on revoking laws and
restraints imposed by the Chun government to support its
authoritarian rule, Kim said. All restraints on free speech, human
rights and politics must end, he said.
   The government's investigation into abuses under Chun was not
satisfactory because it centers on individuals rather than
widespread misdeeds committed by the Chun government, Kim said. The
inquiry must take in the entire Chun regime, he said.
   The opposition leader said he has accepted an invitation to visit
Moscow in 1989. He said he wants to discuss reducing tensions with
communist North Korea.
   South Korea is making an effort to establish ties with communist
nations to reduce tensions on the divided Korean peninsula and
promote trade.
   Good relations with Washington and Tokyo will remain critical for
South Korea's interests, Kim said. But he expressed hope that
Washington would make it clear that it fully supports democracy in
South Korea to remove suspicion that it has supported authoritarian
rule in the past, he said.
   Kim expressed concern about growing anti-American sentiment
because of a perception that Washington helped keep Chun in power
and failed to push for democratic reform.
   ``We are not convinced that America has really changed its Korean
policy to support democracy. But I am eager to see such a change so
that I can persuade our young men and other anti-Americans that they
should not be anti-American,'' he said.

<HEAD>NASA Minimizes Risk Of Nuclear Plant Aboard Shuttle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Removes characterization of group in 11th graf, ``Steve Aftergood;

panels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

   NASA said today the risk of a nuclear accident
will be only slight when it launches an interplanetary satellite
containing a plutonium power plant later this year from the space
shuttle Atlantis.
   In an environmental impact statement required by law, the space
agency said health and environmental consequences of the ``most
probable'' of accidents _ a one-in-10 million chance _ would be
small.
   The inch-thick document was released by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and an abstract was to be published in the
Federal Register.
   The electric generator, holding nearly 50 pounds of plutonium
oxide, will be aboard the Galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch
from the space shuttle in October for a two-year study of the planet
Jupiter.
   According to one estimate, if that amount of plutonium were
released into the atmosphere it would have about 10 times the
radioactivity of the Soviet spy satellite that crashed into Canada
in 1978. Plutonium is used in nuclear weapons as well as nuclear
reactors.
   The environmental impact statement calls for public comment over
the succeeding 45 days before a final statement is issued.
   ``This is part of the approval process, the portion of the
process where the public and interested groups can review our
thinking and our analysis of the risk and comment,'' said NASA
spokesman Charles Redmond. ``This is a nuclear device and through
this process we hope to get launch approval.''
   The final approval must come from the president or from the
Office of Science and Technology Policy, Redmond said.
   ``An intensive analysis of the proposed action indicates that the
possible health and environmental consequences of launch or mission
anomalies pose small risks,'' the statement says. ``The accident
estimated to be the most probable would pose very small health risks
and very small probability of environmental contamination.''
   A nuclear generator has not been carried aboard a space shuttle
before, although the devices have been used on space probes and
manned flights to the moon.
   Steve Aftergood, of the Center to Bridge the Gap, in Los Angeles,
said his organization will not oppose use of the generator. The
group has been critical of nuclear power in space.
   ``There is a finite risk,'' he said. ``I believe NASA has done a
good job of minimizing that risk by design of the system. The risk
is not reduced to zero. Reasonable people disagree.''
   ``The basic question is, `do the benefits outweigh the risks?'''
he added. ``My judgment is they do.''
   On the Galileo mission, the generator would be used to provide
electricity to the space probe. The satellite does not have solar
panels because it will travel too distant from the sun to draw
energy.
   It is built to withstand fire and explosions, such as the
accident that destroyed the Challenger and killed its crew of seven
in 1986.
   According to the environmental impact statement, the most likely
accident would involve the complicated method used to send the probe
on its journey. That scenario envisions a crash of the satellite
into Earth at high speed.
   Galileo will be released into Earth orbit by the shuttle and
boosted toward Venus by an attached rocket stage. Flying around
Venus and using a second rocket, the probe will gain velocity that
will speed it back toward Earth. From Earth, the satellite will gain
an additional boost, loop out into space and return a second time
for another push before it finally hurtles toward Jupiter. The trip
to Jupiter will take six years.
   The trajectory is called VEEGA, for Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity
Assist.
   ``The maximum credible accident would be an accidental reentry
into the Earth atmosphere during a planned VEEGA flyby,'' the
statement said. It put the chances of that happening as one in 10
million.

   Government troops killed 250 guerrillas
last month in an army offensive in northwestern Uganda, an official
report said Friday.
   Government troops engaged in three battles with rebels of the
Holy Spirit Movement in December that claimed the lives of 30
soldiers and wounded another 20, said the newspaper New Vision.
   Maj. Gen. Fred Rwigyema, deputy army commander, said the rebels
were forced to retreat and hide among the civilian population, the
report said.
   The latest casualty figures brought to more than 700 the number
of Holy Spirit rebels reported killed by the army since last year.
   The Holy Spirit Movement, one of nine rebel groups fighting the
government, was founded in 1986 by self-proclaimed warrior priestess
Alice Lakwena. Her fighters believe oil smeared on their chests
would ward off bullets and the stones they carried would explode
like grenades.
   Most of Lakwena's 7,000 fighters have been killed and she has
escaped to Kenya.

   More than 400 West Africans stranded on
Nigeria's border with Benin were moved to Lagos on Friday after the

   The foreigners, among 2,000 people arrested last week on charges
of illegal mining precious gems in the northern state of Kaduna,
said the government of Benin had refused them passage through its

   Internal Affairs Minister John Shagaya denied Nigeria intended to

   The group included 201 people from Senegal, 191 from Mauritania,
27 from Mali, six from Gambia, four from Zaire and three from Sierra

   The foreigners were to be sheltered at a trade center on the
outskirts of Lagos, where they were to be questioned, Shagaya said.
He said those found innocent would be allowed to return to their
homes in Nigeria.

   Argentinian writer Ernesto Sabato was named
Friday to receive the 1989 Jerusalem Prize, which is awarded to an
author whose work focuses on the freedom of the individual.
   The decision was announced by the office of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
Kollek.
   The prize, a scroll and $5,000, is to be given during the
Jerusalem International Book Fair in March.
   The jury was headed by Abba Eban, the former Israeli foreign

Greene, Simone de Beauvoir and Eugene Ionesco.
   Sabato, 77, originally a physicist, wrote his first novel, ``The
Silent Well,'' while doing post-graduate studies in Paris. In 1943
he abandoned scientific work to devote himself to writing. His
fictional works include ``The Tunnel,'' ``Of Heroes and Graves'' and
``Abadon, the Exterminator.''
   In 1983, Sabato was appointed by Argentinian President Raul
Alfonsin to head the public committee investigating the thousands of
Argentinians who were abducted, and presumed murdered, during the
earlier military regime.

the same way about her.
   Police escorted the 69-year-old entertainer off a Delta flight
Thursday night after she refused to keep her dogs in travel kennels,
an airline spokesman said.
   The confrontation occurred during a stopover in Atlanta. Airline
officials said Ms. Gabor, who was traveling from Los Angeles to her

in the first-class section of the Delta jet.
   ``The Delta agent came aboard,'' airline spokesman William D.
Berry said. ``He asked her six times to comply. She refused to
comply. Each time he was responded to with considerable vulgarity.''
   Atlanta police were then called to escort Ms. Gabor off the
aircraft.
   Ms. Gabor contended the dogs were not disturbing anyone, and said
the Delta agent ``was screaming at me like I was some criminal.''
   ``I was so upset you can't imagine. This is not the end of
this,'' she said before boarding an Eastern Airlines flight to

   Eleven bloody animal heads, apparently

   The Morning News Tribune of Tacoma reported that the heads were

   ``These remains were gathered from the area of Enumclaw in a

   ``The elk and deer are being slaughtered by the Indians because
it has been allowed by the Washington State Game Department and our
governor.''
   ``The most we have is a case of illegal dumping,'' said King

   Many hunters have been upset by a state agreement to allow
Indians covered by federal treaties to hunt on state lands, subject
to tribal restrictions, outside the seasons that apply to
non-Indians.

institutes; and the Great Wall Industry Corp. Several thousand
Chinese experts working for the ministry have developed software
that ``is very interesting and can be commercialized,'' said the
vice president of UniHorn, James H. Spear Jr.
   Among the new products the new company is to develop is software
that enables computers to do engineering design work, Spear said.
   He said UniHorn sought out the Chinese partners because of their
low-cost expertise.
   Unison has four other joint ventures in China, including the

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 15 grafs to UPDATE with teacher saying she saw a
bruise but no signs of abuse. PICKS UP 8th graf pvs, `DiLuzio said ...'</HEAD>

   A teacher testified today at the murder trial of
Joel Steinberg that she once noticed a small bruise on the face of
Lisa Steinberg but never saw any signs that the 6-year-old was being
abused.
   Steinberg is charged with fatally beating the girl, whom he
adopted illegally.
   The teacher, Elizabeth Kasowitz, said that when she questioned
Lisa about the bruise under her eye, the girl told her that her
little brother had punched her.
   ``Did she seem natural?'' asked Steinberg's lawyer, Ira London.
   ``Yes. She said it with a smile. It seemed like a plausible
explanation.''
   ``We always question children when we see visible marks,'' added
Kasowitz, a teacher for 16 years.
   Kasowitz said she and Lisa talked about the bruise a few days
before Halloween in 1987. Days later, Lisa was removed unconscious
from the apartment of Steinberg and his lover, Hedda Nussbaum. She
died of brain injuries three days later.
   Kasowitz said that she had attended faculty conferences and read
newsletters on how to spot signs that a child is being abused or
getting improper care.
   ``Did you see any of the signs on Lisa Steinberg when she was
your student?'' said London.
   ``No,'' said Kasowitz.
   The teacher said that during the time she knew Lisa, the child
seemed happy and displayed no changes in personality or behavior.
She said Lisa was late more frequently toward the end of the term
but that she did not consider the latenesses excessive.
   Another of Steinberg's lawyers, Adrian DiLuzio, said Thursday
that the defense would call a cabaret singer from Dallas who will
say she saw Ms. Nussbaum abuse Lisa.
   The first-grader's death in an affluent household led to a
re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and
social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, denies that he hit the child, but
Ms. Nussbaum, the prosecution's chief witness, said he told her the
night Lisa was fatally injured that he had ``knocked Lisa down and
she didn't want to get up.''
   The cabaret singer, Marilyn Walton, has said in TV interviews
that Ms. Nussbaum was jealous of Lisa. She also has said Ms.
Nussbaum wanted Steinberg's name and money and was upset that she
didn't get them.
   DiLuzio said Ms. Walton, who met the defendant several years ago
through her attorney, will testify that ``she did observe Hedda
Nussbaum mistreat the child on at least one occasion'' in 1983 or
1984.
   ``She's going to have some comments as to Joel's state of mind
with respect to the child and why Joel was always with the child _
because he was afraid to leave the child with Hedda,'' DiLuzio said
outside court.
   On another matter, prosecutors said they were considering asking
judge Harold J. Rothwax to drop the first-degree manslaughter charge
against Steinberg because their case is based on the theory that he
fatally beat Lisa out of recklessness and depraved indifference, not
because he intended to.
   First-degree manslaughter is charged when a defendant intends to
cause physical harm to a victim and, in doing so, ends up killing
the victim. The prosecution said it was considering requesting the
charge be dropped to avoid confusing the jury.
   ``Our theory is that the murder was depraved and not
intentional,'' said Peter Casolaro, an assistant Manhattan district
attorney.
   ``If they want to do that then I would be inclined to agree to
it, too,'' said DiLuzio.
   Rothwax has said he would drop the first-degree manslaughter
charge if both sides agreed.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, testified for
seven days as a prosecution witness. She had been charged with
Lisa's murder along with Steinberg but the charges were dropped and
she became a state's witness.

<HEAD>Arab Radicals Form Anti-PLO Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab radicals announced Friday the formation of
a new anti-PLO alliance in the occupied territories that includes
Moslem fundamentalists and pro-Syrian extremists opposed to Yasser
Arafat's recent peace overtures.
   Palestinians in Bethlehem and the surrounding Christian villages,
meanwhile, observed a general strike to mark the day Orthodox
Christians celebrate Christmas. Graffiti painted on buildings called
for an escalation of the Arab uprising.
   Also Friday, police said they suspected Palestinian nationalists
were responsible for the killing of an Israeli shot to death in the
occupied West Bank the night before.
   Israeli hikers clashed with Arabs as they made their way past the
occupied West Bank village of Beit Inan on Friday, Israel Radio
said. The hikers opened fire at youths, who hurled large rocks at
them, but there were no reports of injuries, Israel Radio said.
   Soldiers evacuated the seven hikers, all of whom live on Jewish
West Bank settlements near Beit Inan, north of Jerusalem. Police
detained them briefly for questioning and confiscated their
firearms, the radio said.
   In a leaflet issued Friday, the Palestinian radicals accused
Arafat of ``selling out Palestine to imperialism and Zionism'' by
announcing he recognized Israel and renounced terrorism at a news
conference in Geneva last month.
   ``We demand the establishment of a militant leadership to replace
the diminishing leadership of Yasser Arafat,'' said the leaflet,
which was signed by the United National Front in Occupied Palestine.
   The group is an alliance of Islamic extremists and pro-Syrian
radicals, including members of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Abu Moussa's breakaway
faction of Arafat's mainstream Fatah.
   The leaflet said the group ``rejected all surrenderist
solutions'' and advocated ``liberating the whole of Palestine
through armed struggle.''
   ``There can be no reconciliation with the Israeli killers and no
negotiations with Zionist criminals,'' the document said. ``We
oppose any kind of political settlement, whatever its source, and
consider negotiation with the enemy to be a grave treason and
unforgivable crime.''
   The leaflet also called for the formation of a new Palestine
National Council led by Palestinian militants who advocate armed
struggle.
   The present council, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
parliament in exile, adopted a declaration of independence in
November that implicitly recognized Israel.
   Pro-Syrian Palestinians said the new alliance was the result of
increasing cooperation between the two groups in recent months.
   ``The PLO has been moving from one mistake to another. We totally
reject the PLO's political compromises,'' said Sufian Khatib, a
Jerusalem doctor who opposes Arafat. ``There is a need to make
corrections in the PLO political line.''
   Also Friday, merchants closed businesses and all public
transportation was halted in Bethlehem and the nearby Christian
villages of Beit Jalla and Beit Sahour in compliance with a general
strike called by PLO-backed leaders of the Arab uprising.
   It was called to coincide with Friday's celebration of the
Orthodox Christian Christmas. A procession through Bethlehem by the
Greek Orthodox patriarch was subdued and traditional Christmas
decorations were absent.
   A cluster of about 70 Greek Orthodox worshipers, almost all of
them Palestinians, attended Christmas Mass at the Church of the
Nativity, built on the site where tradition says Jesus was born.
   The number of participants was down sharply from the usual
several hundred worshipers who have filled the church for past
Orthodox Christmas celebrations. The service was broadcast on
loudspeakers erected in Manger Square, which was empty except for
dozens of Israeli soldiers on patrol.
   A leaflet last month by underground leaders of the uprising
called for strikes on the Western churches' Christmas Eve and Jan. 6
to express sympathy for the suffering of Palestinians in the revolt.
   At least 347 Palestinians have died in the nearly 13-month
rebellion. Fourteen Israelis also have died.
   In other developments, Israel Radio said security forces suspect
Palestinians kidnapped and murdered Shmuel Edri, 42, a taxi driver
from the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva.
   Edri's body was found Thursday night at a junction near the
Jewish settlement of Yakir, about 24 miles north of Jerusalem. A
police spokesman said he was shot twice in the chest with a 9mm
pistol.
   Police confirmed they are considering nationalist motivations but
said their investigation has reached no definite conclusion.
   ``All directions in the investigation are still open,'' said the
chief of police in the northern section of the West Bank, Chaim
Malka.
   Police first noted Edri's police record as a possible sign the
murder was criminally motivated, but Malka later told Israel Radio:
``His criminal record was from the 1970s, not the 1980s, and his
crimes were not that great.''
   A police spokesman said Edri's taxi was found 1{ miles from where
he was killed.

<HEAD>Chicago Mayor Admits Late Income Tax Filing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer says he filed some federal
income tax returns late, but says he violated no laws and owed the
government no money.
   Sawyer blamed the late filings in part on his accountant's
frequent hospitalization, but his political rivals were quick to
criticize the delays.
   ``I would never try to escape an obligation to file my taxes,''
Sawyer told television station WBBM, which disclosed the mayor's tax
problems Thursday. ``They were late filing(s) and I admit that, but
they were filed.''
   WBBM reported that Sawyer's return for 1986 was filed more than a
year late, and said he also missed the deadline for filing his 1987
return. Both were filed last summer, the report said.
   The Internal Revenue Service also audited Sawyer's past returns
when he filed the late returns, and collected about $200 in back
taxes, the station said.
   Sawyer was elected by City Council a year ago to succeed Harold
Washington, who died of a heart attack. He is a candidate in the
Feb. 28 Democratic mayoral primary, seeking to fill the last two
years of Washington's term.
   Sawyer said the accountant, whom he did not identify, is a
diabetic who was frequently hospitalized. WBBM said Sawyer's
separation from his wife also left him without some necessary
documents.
   One of Sawyer's challengers, Alderman Lawrence Bloom, said, ``I
file my taxes on time; I think the voters expect everyone to file
their taxes on time, and the mayor should be no exception.''

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate on a work-release program has
been charged with robbing banks on his lunch hour.
   Lawrence Terry Jordan, 39, who worked as a laborer at a state
maintenance complex, was charged Wednesday in two hold-ups Nov. 28
and Dec. 9 in which a man who said he had a bomb stole a total of
$3,230, authorities said.
   Jordan was charged after he began offering cash gifts to friends
and a corrections officer saw a broadcast about the holdups and
recognized him, authorities said.
   Inmates at the maintenance complex are dropped at their work
sites in the morning and picked up in the evening. There are no
restrictions on where they can go to eat, said Corrections
Department spokesman Francis X. Archibald.
   Jordan, who is serving a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, was
transferred after his arrest from a dormitory-type work center to a
prison cell, Archibald said.
   Jordan began his sentence in 1981 and entered the work-release
program in 1984, said Archibald. The spokesman defended the 23-year
program, saying it has had few problems and allows inmates to help
``pay their room and board.''

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Expected To Sign Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union are expected
to sign an agreement Sunday on sharing information on drug abuse and
narcotics trafficking, American officials said Friday.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Secretary
Eduard A. Shevardnadze were to sign the agreement in Paris, said
State Department spokeswoman Catherine Shaw.
   The agreement is a direct outgrowth of the greater openness in
the Soviet Union, which after years of denying it had a drug problem
has been acknowledging greater use of narcotics, U.S. officials said.
   ``In the past two years they have reported increased drug use,
particularly in regard to the soldiers coming back from
Afghanistan'' said Shaw. The last Red Army units are due to leave
Afghanistan by Feb. 15, according to United Nations-sponsored
accords signed in Geneva last May.
   The foundation for the U.S.-Soviet narcotics agreement was laid
last April when the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, John C. Lawn, and the assistant secretary of state
for international narcotics matters, Ann Wrobleski, visited Moscow
to negotiate with their Soviet counterparts.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry delegation visited Washington in
November to iron out details of the agreement, said Shaw.
   ``It is basically an information sharing, technical type of
agreement that hopefully will lead to greater cooperation in
preventing drug trafficking,'' said Shaw.
   No agents of the DEA will be stationed in the Soviet Union, she
said, but it is envisioned that the DEA and the U.S. Customs Service
will cooperate with Soviet law enforcement authorities, she said.
   Senior DEA officials said last summer they expected the agreement
to be signed by the end of the Reagan administration.
   The agreement was to cover four main points, DEA officials said:
   _Exchange of information on drug trafficking and drug routes.
   _Exchange of drug samples. Analysts can determine the region or
nation in which a drug originated by detecting a chemical signature
unique to the substance.
   _Training, with Soviet officials having expressed interest in
learning some of the techniques DEA agents use.
   _Exchange of data on ``precursor chemicals,'' such as ether, used
to process cocaine, and acetic anhydride, used in the manufacture of
heroin.
   In meetings last year, the Soviets told U.S. officials their main
drug problems were hashish and opiates, apparently smuggled from
Afghanistan, along with diverted pharmaceuticals and chemicals made
in clandestine laboratories, said DEA operations chief David L.
Westrate.
   Drug dependence in the Soviet Union has grown at a rate of 50
percent a year, with an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 heavy users,
Soviet officials told Lawn and Wrobleski during their April meeting,
Westrate said in an interview last July.
   Of those, 60 percent were estimated to be under 30 years old.
Among those dependent on drugs, 45 percent used cannabis, mostly
hashish, 35 percent used opiates such as herion and 20 percent used
pharmaceuticals, Westrate said the Soviets told the American
delegation.
   The Soviet drug problem is not rated as serious as that in the
United States, where the DEA estimates there are 11 million cocaine
users and 500,000 herion addicts.

   City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky dropped out of
the mayor's race today, leaving Tom Bradley with no serious
opposition in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term in the
nation's second-largest city.
   Yaroslavsky, 40, said he had concluded he would probably lose to
Bradley. A councilman since 1975, Yaroslavsky said he will instead
seek re-election.
   City Council President John Ferraro said that without Yaroslavsky
in the race, the 71-year-old Bradley should be elected easily to
another four-year term.
   Candidates have until Jan. 14 to file to run in the April 11

   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters today
showed the Security Council large photographs showing what he said
were missiles under the wings of a Libyan jet shot down by U.S.
forces.
   ``We have photographs that show the planes were armed,'' Walters
said as two pictures, about 16-by-20 inches, were passed around.
   ``The missile parts show quite clearly. There were two different
types of missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts
of the fuselage,'' he said in an angry tone of voice.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser refused to look at the
photographs when they were handed to him. He brushed them aside and
told reporters later they are ``all fakes.'' Walters denied it.
   Walters said the pictures were taken from a videotape shot inside
one of the two Navy F-14 jet fighters that shot down two Libyan
MiG-23s on Wednesday over the Mediterranean Sea.
   The U.S. planes ``were aggressively and hostilely challenged by
the Libyan air force,'' he said. The facts and the conversations of
the U.S. cockpit crews ``make it all the more clear that they acted
in self-defense.''
   Libya maintains its jets were unarmed and did not act in a
hostile manner.
   Earlier, the Soviet ambassador told the council the U.S. action
was ``absolutely unfounded'' and erodes the possibilities of peace
in the Middle East.
   ``Nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the United States,''
Alexander M. Belonogov said after the council resumed discussion on
Libya's demand that it condemn the U.S. action. A vote on the
condemnation was not expected before the weekend.
   ``We cannot say the U.S. is entitled to open fire on aircraft of
another state simply because those aircraft have come close to one
another in international airspace,'' the Soviet representative said.
   Belonogov, who has blamed the incident in part on the U.S.
military presence in the Mediterranean, said the Soviet Union would
pull its navy from the waterway if the United States did the same.
   On Thursday, the Pentagon released the videotape it says was shot
from inside one of the U.S. jets. It shows one Libyan plane carrying
four missiles. The videotape showed the U.S. fighters tried
high-speed maneuvers five times to avoid the MiG planes before they
fired.
   Outside the council chamber, Walters rejected suggestions that
the photographs, blow-ups of the videotape, were doctored.
   ``If you want to believe there is nothing here, you can't because
there is something here,'' he said. ``Do you think this is a bouquet
of flowers hanging under the wing?'' he asked reporters.
   The U.S. action was deplored by all those who spoke this morning,
including Brazil, Madagascar, Nepal, Nicaragua and Uganda. On
Thursday, six speakers, representing the Arab League, Burkina Faso,
Bahrain, Cuba, Syria, and Tunisia, condemned the U.S. action.
   Walters, the last on today's list of scheduled speakers, said the
United States resents ``being taught the norms of international
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or
civilian one-party dictatorships.''
   Libya wants the 15-member Security Council, the most powerful
U.N. body, to formally condemn the U.S. military action. Not all the
speakers are from member nations.
   A resolution of condemnation was expected to be vetoed by the
United States and Britain, two of the five permanent council
members. Permanent members, who also include the Soviet Union,
China, and France, have veto power.
   Belonogov said the U.S. military action ``is no way in accord
with the processes which are now occurring in the international
arena. It also is contradictory to the general tendency to shift the
Middle East process from a deadlock, thanks to the beginning of the
American-Palestinian dialogue.''
   ``We cannot agree that the United States should arrogate to
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it
does not like, like Libya. Whatever the pretext, the use of force is
contrary to international law,' he said.
   Libya and the United States clashed sharply over the facts of the
incident when the emergency council session began Thursday.
   Muntasser, who sought the urgent meeting, called the U.S. action
a ``premediated act of aggression and a prelude to large-scale
aggression'' against economic and military installations.
   U.S. representative Herberg S. Okun told the council the U.S.
jets that shot down the Libyans faced ``imminent threat of being
shot down by the intercepting Libyan aircraft.''

   African students boycotted classes at a Beijing
college for a third day Friday to demand China release three
Africans detained after a racial brawl in Nanking.
   The 500 boycotting students at Beijing Languages Institute
demanded protection after Chinese students at the school distributed
anti-African leaflets. The Chinese claim an African male student
assaulted a Chinese woman student there Jan. 1, a charge the
Africans deny.
   The students also called on Beijing to change the Chinese name
for Africa, which literally means ``bad continent.''
   Officials at Beijing Languages Institute met representatives of
boycotting students Thursday and Friday but reached no agreement.
   African diplomats from Beijing arrived Friday in Nanking, where a
Dec. 24 clash between African and Chinese students triggered
protests and racial unrest in several other cities.
   The delegation included Congolese Ambassador Gabriel Emouengue
and Kwadwo Kwakye, acting head of the Ghana Embassy.
   Wills Tembo of Zambia, a student at Nanking's Hehai University,
said he and most of the approximately 140 African students in the
city plan to ask the diplomats to arrange for them to leave China.
   ``We are homebound,'' Tembo said in a telephone interview.
   Also Friday, Hehai University President Liang Ruiju denied
African students' claims the school now requires them to introduce
all Chinese girlfriends to school officials.
   ``It is nonsense,'' Liang said in an interview on state
television. He said the university encouraged friendly exchanges
between Chinese and foreign students, but accused the Africans of
breaking rules by bringing girlfriends to their dormitories.
   He said Chinese students who chanted offensive slogans about
Africans would be criticized and ``educated.'' It was the first
criticism by a Chinese official of Chinese students' behavior since
the unrest began.
   Liang accused some Western media of issuing ``distorted and
fictitious'' reports about the unrest.
   The trouble was caused by African students' dating of Chinese
women. Africans at Hehai tried to bring several Chinese dates to the
school's Christmas Eve dance but, according to officials, refused to
register their names in keeping with regulations.
   A fight broke out in which 11 Chinese and two Africans were
injured by official count.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday three African
students detained by police have admitted they broke the law.
   One accused of seriously injuring a Hehai employee was under
arrest and apparently faces trial. Two others were accused of trying
to ``stir up trouble'' and were given 15 days' ``disciplinary
detention,'' Xinhua said. A fourth detained African was released,
apparently without charges.
   Following the fight, thousands of Chinese students stoned
Africans' dormitories at Hehai and other Nanking schools. Thousands
of young Chinese swarmed through city streets shouting slogans such
as ``Beat the black devils!''
   By Friday, all Nanking's African students had returned to their
schools following a stay at a suburban guesthouse.
   Police forced them to go to the guesthouse Dec. 27 when they
tried to board a train for Beijing. On Saturday, about 400 police
converged on the guesthouse, took four Africans into custody and
forced others to go back to school.
   African students and diplomats said the police attacked the group
at the guesthouse with electric cattle prods and wooden clubs, but
Chinese officials deny that.
   Many African students complain Chinese regularly discriminate
against them.
   Most of the approximately 1,500 African students in China are men
and social contacts with Chinese women frequently cause tension.
They study a wide range of subjects from the Chinese language to
engineering.
   Chinese also resent that Africans, many from countries as poor as
China, receive far better food and lodging than Chinese students.
   Chinese officials deny any prejudice, and say their long-standing
policy of giving scholarships to Africans shows China's solidarity
with the Third World.

<HEAD>Military Won't Transfer Last On-Base Schools to Local Districts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, bowing to opposition in
eight states and Puerto Rico, has dropped plans to transfer to local
jurisdiction the last of its on-base schools for children of
military parents.
   The decision leaves intact the responsibility for financing and
operating 18 schools located inside military bases, primarily in the
South. The schools, the last of a system that once included about
100, serve about 36,000 children.
   The schools are located at bases in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and
Puerto Rico.
   Congress and the Reagan administration have been trying to
transfer jurisdiction over the schools since 1986. The Pentagon
spends about $138 million a year operating them, and administration
officials wanted to save much of that money by shifting the schools
from the Pentagon.
   When jurisdiction is transferred for such schools, known as
Section 6 schools after a section of the 1950 law that set them up,
the local district must take over the cost of operating them. The
district does become eligible for small amounts of aid for educating
the children of servicemen in public schools.
   On Friday, military officials announced they had sent notices to
congressional leaders Dec. 30 ``stating it is not feasible to end
these arrangements at this time.''
   ``Discussions have identified broad-based opposition to
transferring educational responsibility to local school districts,''
the Pentagon statement continued.
   ``While the specific circumstances for each location vary, the
DoD has concluded that the strong opposition of the local
communities that would have to absorb the Section 6 students, the
grave concerns of the military parents that transfers would
compromise the quality of their children's education, and the
substantial economic, logistical and personnel problems associated
with transfers prevent the amicable transfer at this time.''
   The Pentagon statement said that savings from the transfer would
have been ``at best, minimal'' and that if the government ``were to
force local authorities to accept the unwanted transfer of its
students, the military's harmonious relations with its host
communities ... could be endangered.''
   The schools had their genesis back in the 1800s when schools were
constructed at frontier forts out West. Later, after World War II, a
number were established at bases located in rural areas where there
was no public system to provide an education.
   Also, some of the facilities were built because local districts
fought the 1954 desegreation of public schools and the Defense
Department wanted to maintain racially integrated schools.
   In the 1960s, the number of Section 6 schools dwindled as
development near bases made it feasible for local school districts
to operate and as integration took hold in nearby local schools. The
number of on-base schools dropped to 18 in 1973.
   The Pentagon statement said the department would be willing ``to
explore the possibility of future Section 6 transfers if a specific
state is interested.''
   The 18 remaining schools are located at Fort McClellan, Fort
Rucker and Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama; Fort Benning, Fort
Stewart and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia; Fort Campbell and Fort
Knox in Kentucky; England Air Force Base in Louisiana; the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.; Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune in
North Carolina; Fort Jackson, Laurel Bay Marine Base and Myrtle
Beach Air Force Base in South Carolina; Dahlgren Naval Surface
Weapons Center and the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia, and the
Antilles Schools in Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   A judge fined a developer for disturbing the
nest of a pair of bald eagles, an endangered species he claimed took
up residence in his $9 million subdivision after it was 90 percent
complete.
   Stephen M. Fedders was fined $4,000 Thursday and his company,
Flotilla Inc., was ordered to pay $20,000. He also must perform 100
hours of community service in a wildlife protection program under
terms of a plea agreement.
   Fedders pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of disturbing the
nest on Dec. 28, 1987.
   Someone tipped off state wildlife officers that the nest was
disturbed and Fedders was forced to devote 40 of the project's 176
acres as a preserve. The developer claimed the state's demand makes
it impossible to complete or sell his Braden River Lake subdivision
and he is on the brink of bankruptcy.
   Fedders admitted telling workers to continue to work near the
tree where the eagles had nested to try to frighten them off, but
denied destroying the nest. He said he didn't know who rocked the
tree with a bulldozer or who scaled the pine and removed the nest.
   The birds built a new nest, and the agency ordered Fedders to
create a 750-foot buffer zone around the site.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors say they have found a new ``trail to point
the way'' to solving the mystery of sudden infant death syndrome, or
crib death.
   In research published in Saturday's issue of the British Medical
Journal, they say they found ``grossly raised concentrations'' of
immunoglobulins, or antibodies, in the lungs of 16 babies who died
of crib death and who were compared with a control group of babies
who died for other reasons.
   This ``suggests that the respiratory tract is the prime target
organ in the sudden infant death syndrome,'' wrote the research team
headed by Kevin D. Forsyth of Flinders University in Australia.
   Research also showed that many babies had minor breathing
infections in the week before they died, they wrote.
   Forsyth told reporters: ``I think it is certainly a step forward
in the research but it is not a step forward in prevention.
   ``It provides a basis for further investigation and it lays a
trail to point the way we should be looking more carefully.''
   Dr. Pamela Davies, who advises the Foundation for the Study of
Infant Deaths, said experts had realized for many years that
respiratory tract infection was likely to be linked to many of the
deaths. She said the foundation would study Forsyth's findings.

<HEAD>Panel Restores Teaching Credentials of Ex-Defendant In Molestation
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state commission today restored the
teaching credentials of a former defendant in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation case, entitling her to teach deaf and
learning-disabled children.
   The Commission on Teacher Credentialing voted 7-6, with one
abstention, to abide by the opinion of an administrative law judge
who found no reason to withhold Peggy Ann Buckey's credentials.
There was no debate or comment.
   Ms. Buckey, 32, was a teacher in the Anaheim Union High School
District in 1984 when she and six others were charged with molesting
toddlers at the now-defunct Manhattan Beach preschool. The
commission suspended her credentials.
   Charges against Ms. Buckey and four others were dropped in 1986
for lack of evidence.
   The remaining defendants _ Ms. Buckey's brother, Ray Buckey, 30,
and mother, 65-year-old Peggy McMartin Buckey _ are on trial on 65
child molestation counts.
   Ms. Buckey sued in 1987 to regain her secondary and special
education teaching certificates allowing her to teach deaf and
learning-disabled children. She has been working as a paralegal for
her brother's lawyer.
   Judge Ronald M. Gruen, in a ruling issued Thursday, said no cause
exists for denying her credentials.
   The judge, who presided over a hearing that included child
witnesses, sharply criticized testimony offered by the state
accusing Ms. Buckey of child molestation.
   ``It's great,'' Ms. Buckey said of the judge's ruling. ``I'm
overjoyed. It's the first good news we've had in five years.''

   A 120-pound Rottweiler dog named Boo-Boo
Bear has been banished from town by unanimous vote of the Board of
Selectman for allegedly attacking three people, including his owner,
officials said Friday.
   Exile was chosen over execution when owner Kenneth Chambers gave
his word ``as a gentleman'' at a meeting Thursday to never again own
a dog in Milford.
   ``Not even a poodle,'' promised Chambers, a 44-year-old
construction worker and former champion wrestler. ``I'm all dogged
out.''
   If Boo-Boo Bear shows his snout on the streets of Milford, a town
of 32,000 people, 30 miles west of Boston, police are authorized to
capture and destroy it.
   Last month Chambers, who is white, allegedly turned the dog on
two black teen-agers in an attack that authorities said was racially
motivated. Chambers also wielded an ax.
   Town Counsel Gerald Moody said both youngsters sustained minor
injuries. Chambers was charged with civil rights violations and
assault and battery.
   Another Rottweiler owned by Chambers attacked an off-duty police
officer last May. A trial is pending.
   Last month Boo-Boo Bear also attacked Chambers, who was trying to
feed the dog teriyaki steak mouth-to-mouth. The owner took stitches
in his forehead and arm and suffered a slight concussion.
   The dog, which is being held at a Boston animal hospital, is to
be turned over to Chambers' father in Ipswitch after being tattooed
with Chambers' social security number for future identification.

   A minister who preached a sermon hours
after shooting his live-in girlfriend last summer was sentenced
Friday to 15 years in prison.
   The Rev. Jonathan Hamlin, 24, was originally charged with murder
in the July 3 death of Lula Denise Sims, a 24-year-old mother of
three. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter Dec. 5
and was sentenced in Warren County Circuit Court.
   Authorities say Hamlin shot Sims in the head and chest, buried
her body in woods about 40 miles southeast of Vicksburg, and hours
later preached at one of three Missionary Baptist churches he served.
   About a week after Sims was discovered missing, Hamlin led
authorities to her grave.
   Hamlin, who is married and has three children, admitted in his
guilty plea that he had killed Sims during an argument.
   The preacher told the court that Sims fired a .22-caliber pistol
at him. Hamlin said the two then fought over the weapon, which went
off twice more, hitting Sims.

   A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the
convictions and sentences of four United Mine Workers members found
guilty of fatally shooting a non-union coal truck driver in an
ambush during a 1985 strike.
   The four participated in the slaying of Hayes West on May 29,
1985, in Pike County, Ky., federal prosecutors said. They were
convicted in U.S. District Court of endangering human life by
disabling a vehicle used in interstate commerce with reckless
disregard for human life, resulting in the death of West and the
injury of a non-union driver who was helping deliver coal.
   The four also were convicted of carrying a firearm during
commission of a felony. They received prison sentences ranging from
30 to 45 years.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously upheld the December 1987 convictions of James Darryl
Smith, Donnie Thornsbury and his cousin David Russell Thornsbury,
all of Canada, Ky., and Arnold Ray Heightland of Columbus, Ohio.
   The attorney for the defendants, all of whom remain in federal
custody, had sought to have the convictions thrown out. Edwin J.
Walbourn III disputed the prosecutors' definition of ``interstate
commerce'' and said the matter was not within federal jurisdiction
because West's truck did not, and was not scheduled to, carry cargo
across a state line when he was fired upon.
   The appeals court upheld the prosecutors' interpretation of a
federal law used to convict the men that held that West's truck was
part of interstate commerce because it hauled coal destined for
interstate shipment through West Virginia and Virgina.
   Walbourn was in court Friday and unavailable for comment on
whether he would appeal again.

<HEAD>Additional Political Prisoners To be Released</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban government has agreed to release 44
political prisoners it previously said would be exempt from a policy
under which all such detainees would be set free, according to
Western diplomats.
   The government had said initially the 44, many of whom had
engaged in armed insurrection against the regime, were too dangerous
to be released.
   In April, President Fidel Castro had promised to release all the
country's political prisoners, estimated by government officials to
be about 450.
   Since then, about 250 have been released and many have been
allowed to settle in the United States. Of the remaining 200 or so,
about 120 have been interviewed by American officials to determine
whether they wish to emigrate to the United States and their
eligibility for U.S. residency.
   U.S. officials are attempting to arrange interviews with the
remaining 80, who include the 44 who previously had been exempted
from the prisoner release policy.
   Cuban officials have not formally notified the United States
about the changed status of the 44 but did inform the U.S. Catholic
Conference about the new policy in November.
   Castro announced plans to release all political prisoners last
April during a visit by New York Cardinal John J. O'Connor.
   Castro had said the political prisoner release would be carried
out only if the United States agreed to give them residency papers.
   But the Western diplomats, who insisted on anonymity, said a
number prisoners were released even though they expressed a
preference for remaining in Cuba.
   Dissident sources rejected the suggestion that Cuba will be free
of political prisoners once all 450 are released.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said the government
routinely trumps up charges against politically unreliable Cubans
and then incarcerates them with common criminals. They offered no
proof that the government engages in such practices.
   The Western diplomats said they believe there are hundreds of
Cubans who can be described as political prisoners but whom the
Cuban government does not categorize as such.
   Included are Cubans who are serving out jail terms for trying
illegally to escape the island by boat or other means.
   Castro has acknowledged that in the early years of the
revolution, there were as many as 15,000 political prisoners.

<HEAD>Study Indicates Good News For Frequent Flyers Despite Deregulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deregulation has compromised air traffic safety,
but domestic air travel is still so safe that odds are a person
could take a flight every day for more than 29,000 years before
being involved in a fatal crash, according to a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology study released Friday.
   The 1977-86 figures for domestic non-stop flights with
established carriers indicate travelers are at 10 times less risk
today than they were during the 1960s, but the skies could be safer.
   ``One can come up with a very long list of things that make one
nervous about flying, but the good news in that very rarely have
these horrible genies really come out of the bottle,'' said MIT
Professor Arnold Barnett, who compiled the fatality statistics with
Pentagon analyst Mary K. Higgins.
   But Barnett said lax air traffic control, substandard
maintenance, undertrained cockpit crews and aging equipment were all
liabilities associated with airline deregulation.
   The death risk per flight in the absence of deregulation would
have been about 35 percent lower than that actually recorded,
according to the study, which appears in Management Science's
January 1989 issue.
   Barnett also said the record among the approximately 20 carriers
established after the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act was relatively
weak.
   ``The new carriers that came about after deregulation as a group
did not do as well as the more established airlines,'' Barnett said.
``The new entrants pushed the overall risk level for domestic jet
flights up by more than 50 percent.''
   The majority of the upstart airlines, which make up 5 percent of
all domestic flights, have never had a passenger fatality. But the
study showed the new carriers' death risk per flight between 1979-86
was 12 times that of their established counterparts.
   The survey, which included passenger deaths caused by criminal or
terrorist acts, also found international jet flights have become
statistically less risky among industrialized nations.
   About 700 of 3 billion to 4 billion travelers died in domestic
air crashes between 1979-86, Barnett said. Internationally, he
estimated 300 died during the same period in accidents involving
Western carriers, while 1,000 were killed on airlines from
less-developed nations.
   ``With international flights there is a pattern in the numbers,''
Barnett said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``If you
talk about Westernized regions, the international safety records of
their leading flag carriers have been quite good, but when you talk
about carriers in other parts of the world ... they have pretty
consistently been about eight times more risky per flight.''
   He suggested the prognosis for frequent flyers was good.
   ``People seem more nervous about flying these days and I myself
have anxieties, but it is worth noting that it's four or five times
as safe to fly now as it was a decade ago when no one was worrying
at all,'' he said.

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower had a
cancerous polyp removed from his rectum last week and was recovering
today from surgery to remove a polyp, believed benign, from his
colon, hospital officials said.
   The 63-year-old former Texas senator was in good condition today
and ``should expect 100 percent recovery,'' said Dr. R.D. Dignan,
who performed the three-hour operation at Baylor University Medical
Center.
   Dignan said a preliminary test showed the growth to be benign.
Final results are expected Saturday.
   About one foot of Tower's colon had to be removed, according to
Dignan, who said the former senator must spend seven to eight more
days hospitalized.
   Doctors discovered the polyp when Tower underwent a colonoscopy
examination Dec. 27. A rectal polyp was discovered at that time and
immediately removed.
   Tests on that polyp showed it to contain some ``malignant but
well differentiated cells,'' said Steven Habgood, a hospital
spokesman. Such cells are typical of a malignancy in its early
stages.
   Tower, who retired in 1985 after 24 years in the Senate, served
as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and headed the White
House's Iran-Contra investigative panel.
   President-elect Bush named Tower to be defense secretary on Dec.
16.
   Sources close to Tower said he had talked to Bush and several key
senators after the rectal polyp was removed and the president-elect
wished Tower all the best.

<TEXT>
   Fake designer clothes and other imitation brand
name goods are nothing new in Hong Kong, but now the government says
some restaurants are ladling out phony shark's fin soup.
   K.S. Tong, deputy commissioner of the Customs and Excise
Department, said Friday that enough of the imitation product to make
at least 1 million bowls of the prized soup was imported from
Singapore and Japan in the first nine months of 1988.
   The fake product _ a gelatin concoction that costs roughly
one-fifth the price of average-quality shark's fin _ is used in
``majority of lower class restaurants'' that sell the soup, he said.
   An ordinary bowl of shark's fin soup, which aficionados believe
can help preserve one's youth, can cost as little as $5 or less,
Tong said. Top-quality shark's fin soup, however, can run up to
about $35 a bowl.
   Tong believes some restaurants can offer the soup at the lower
prices only by mixing the phony product with the real shark's fins.
   Serving a soup containing a mixture of the gelatin and shark's
fin is not illegal unless the customer specifically requests genuine
shark's fin, Tong said.
   The official said the department and the Consumer Council intend
to conduct a survey to determine how widespread the use of phony
shark's fin is.

   A prison official confessed Friday that he staged an
ambush on himself _ an attack he first blamed on Red Brigades
terrorists _ to try to win a job transfer, the Italian news agency
AGI reported.
   Egidio de Luca, assistant director of Rome's Rebibbia prison, had
said earlier this week that terrorists forced him to stop his car as
he was driving home Tuesday, and shot him in the thigh.
   De Luca had said the attackers belonged to the New Red Brigades
terrorist group and that his bodyguard, Carmine Panicciari, had
chased and shot at them.
   Authorities arrested De Luca and Panicciari on Thursday and
charged them with planning the shooting. Italian media reported
investigators had discovered a notebook in De Luca's briefcase
indicating he had planned the attack on himself.
   Authorities believe De Luca had asked Panicciari or an
unidentified accomplice to shoot him in the leg, the reports said.
   The reports said the prison official was depressed eabout his job
and had recently been pressing his superiors for a transfer from the
prison.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gathered scientific
and cultural figures for a meeting in at Communist Party
heaquarters, Tass said.
   A report issued by the official news agency said Gorbachev spoke
with many writers, editors, film directors, scientists and academics
of different political persuasions, but did not give any details. It
said a report would be published later in the official press.
   Among those present were actor Mikhail Ulyanov and editor Grigory
Baklanov of the monthly literary journal Znamya, whose presentations
to a Communist Party conference in June caused a storm of
controversy.
   Baklanov, Ulyanov and four other artists and scientists signed an
open letter to Gorbachev that was published in last week's edition
of the weekly Moscow News, criticizing a Communist Party
``dictatorship of mediocrity.''
   They said that party members who don't want to follow Gorbachev's
reforms should quit the party.
   The meeting also included Anatoly Ivanov, editor of the
conservative journal Molodaya Gvardiya, and Sergei Mikhalkov,

<HEAD>Family Settles Lawsuit Against Maritime Academy In Son's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a cadet killed by a mob
while on a training cruise on a Portuguese island have settled a
lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, attorneys said Friday.
   Leroy and Grace Blauvelt, the parents of Maine Maritime Academy
cadet Paul S. Blauvelt, 19, sued the academy last June for $350,000,
charging the academy with allowing their son to suffer ``great
physical and mental pain, shock and agony.''
   None of the parties would disclose the amount, but Steven Silin,
an attorney for Blauvelt's parents, said the settlement was fair.
   State law limits recovery against state entities such as the
academy to $300,000, and the settlement reached in December was
``far less than that,'' said attorney Thomas F. Monaghan, who
represents the academy's insurance companies.
   Blauvelt was one of 350 cadets on the academy's ship, State of
Maine, when it docked for a spring training cruise in June 1986 on
Madeira, about 400 miles off the West African coast in the Atlantic
Ocean.
   Midshipmen on shore leave and islanders engaged in a brawl at a
disco. Blauvelt was not involved in the fight, but when he returned
to the dock early in the morning, he was met by a pipe-wielding
gang, pulled from his taxi and beaten.
   The academy freshman staggered away from his attackers and fell
into the harbor and drowned.
   Two residents of Madeira were convicted in absentia in 1987 of
homicide and three others were found guilty of aiding in the crime.
   The Blauvelts' lawsuit charged that the academy failed to provide
adequate security and did not establish or enforce guidelines for
off-ship activities.
   In a statement following the settlement, Maine Maritime Academy
President Kenneth Curtis said ``the death of young person is a
tragedy that can never be forgotten.'' Academy officials declined to
comment further.

<HEAD>State Halts Head Start Program For Turtles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUTCHINSON ISLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sea turtles no longer will be
raised in captivity for release into the ocean with the suspension
of an experimental state Head Start program for reptiles.
   ``No one is sure if we were doing any good,'' said Alan Huff, a
state Department of Natural Resources biological administrator.
``They are not learning the survival skills they should be
learning.''
   But others said the suspension of the 25-year-old Head Start
program in Eastern Florida may endanger the reptiles just as
officials are seeing a rapid rise in the number of turtles hatched
here.
   Jaynie Wright, keeper of the House of Refuge on Hutchinson
Island, where the Head Start program was located, said Friday that
83 hatchlings were observed here in 1988, as compared to three
recently hatched turtles found in 1983.
   Wright said she believes the turtles that were turned loose when
the program began in 1964 are returning to the area, but since
officials did not start tagging turtles until 1974, no one is sure.
It takes 17 to 20 years for a turtle to return home to nest, she
said.
   Huff said the tagged turtles have been found ``anywhere from New
York to the Azores and Argentina.''
   ``What we lack is evidence that those animals are re-entering the
reproductive population in Florida,'' he said.
   There are still hatchling programs in the Florida Keys, India and
South America, Huff said.
   Wright said the reptiles hatched in the wild face dangers ranging
from red ants to disorienting lights from beach condos.
   ``They go for the sea mainly because the moonlight is hitting the
sea,'' she said. ``But when the condo lights are on they don't know
where to go and they've even found some in the mall.''
   But Huff said state resources, including $10,000 that would have
been required to have turtle tanks comply with state environmental
regulations, could be better used elsewhere to help turtles.
   He said the state plans to ``take our very limited resources to
other conservation activities we know work, like developing lighting
ordinances for local communities or helping them develop beach
protection plans.''

<HEAD>First Show in Decades of Avant-Garde Artist Opens in Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two hundred works of avant-garde artist Kazimir
Malevich, long banned because they didn't meet the official idea of
art, were displayed Friday in Moscow's first show in decades devoted
to the artist.
   ``Today is our holiday,'' Yuri Korolyev, director of Moscow's
Tretyakov Gallery told a news conference before the opening the show
at the museum's exhibition hall along the Moscow River.
   Malevich's avant-garde style clashed with the officially approved
socialist realism, which Soviet officials counted on to inspire
people to support their new political and economic system.
   Museum officials said many of the paintings and graphics never
had been displayed in the Soviet Union. In recent years, several
paintings have been shown in exhibits of avant-garde art of the
1920s and 1930s permitted in the freer atmosphere under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Included in the exhibit put together by several Soviet museums
and the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam is Malevich's ``Black
Suprematist Square,'' his most famous work painted in 1914-15, which
is in the Tretyakov collection.
   The painting of a large black square surrounded by a white border
showed many cracks, and museum officials said it was too delicate to
be moved from Moscow. Like almost 90 percent of the works, it has
been presevered for decades by Soviet curators who could not display
it.
   Malevich's theory of suprematism says that a painted shape is not
devired in any way from the outside world, but is its own, unique
creation.
   There are a variety of suprematist works of geometric shapes and
various colors that are placed on the canvas in no clear relation to
each other. No effort is made to give them a three-dimensional
effect.
   Most of the canvases are white with geometric designs in basic
shades of black, red, yellow, green or purple. The black square is
considered the ultimate suprematist work because it has absorbed all
previous painted images.
   The Tretyakov Gallery organized an exhibit of Malevich's works in
1929, but gallery officials said that was the last one devoted to
Malevich until Friday.
   The exhibit includes works that embrace three decades and a wide
variety of styles, from his early impressionist paintings, cubist
works, a series of suprematist paintings following the original
black square, and portraits painted from 1927 until his death in
1935.
   Even though the works included in the exhibit are 60 years old or
older, Korolyev predicted they would ``play a big role in the
continuation of Soviet art.''
   Avant-garde artists of the 1920s were part of a ``great
experiment'' and carried with them the ``great culture of the past''
which contemporary Soviet artists will be able to draw upon, he
said..
   Malevich was born in 1878 in Kiev to Polish parents. Wim Beeren,
director of the Stedelijk Museum, said he knew two other Soviet
masters of that period, Vasily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall, but did
not get along with either. He taught for two years at an art school
founded in Vitebsk, Byelorussia, founded by Chagall, but was forced
to leave because of dislike for his teaching system.
   An exhibition of Chagall's paintings was held in the Soviet Union
in 1987, and several remain on display at the Tretyakov Gallery.
Museum officials said the exhibition of Malevich's works will be
followed by a Kandinsky exhibit.
   Stanislav Ivanitsky, director of the Tretyakov's Soviet Painting
Department, said that while the Soviet Union retains the majority of
Malevich's work, some of the most important paintings are outside
the country.
   Faced with indifference to his suprematist works in the Soviet
Union, he took an exhibit of about 30 paintings to Berlin and Warsaw
in 1927, and left them there. Beeren said seven smaller works
disappeared during the years of Nazi rule, but that his museum
acquired the rest in 1958. It is those paintings his museum
contributed to the exhibit.
   The Soviet Culture Ministry sold two of Malevich's suprematist
works to private collectors in the West in the 1970s. Ivanitsky said
museum officials still were upset about the sale.
   Malevich changed his style after returning from Berlin and began
painting colorful portraits of peasants, workers and sportsmen, many
of them without faces. He never offered an explanation for changing
his style, and the question still is debated by art experts.
   The exhibit was organized by the Stedelijk Museum and Soviet art
officials beginning in January 1988, and was shown in Leningrad
before moving to Moscow.

   Finding money to balance state budgets and to
pay for education and health needs will dominate 1989 legislative
sessions beginning this month in most states, the National
Conference of State Legislatures said Friday.
   Raising taxes will be a significant issue in many legislatures,
the conference said, but it added that there were few indications
major tax increases were likely.
   The conference based the report on its annual survey of major

   Defense lawyers reacted angrily after a
federal jury issued a mixed verdict in a drug trafficking case
against a former Internal Revenue Service agent and a former
district attorney's investigator.
   ``I think it's a compromise verdict, and I think that's unfair,''
said Mark Topel, the attorney for Dennis DiRicco, an IRS agent who
became a tax lawyer.
   ``It's frustrating to go through a long indictment and be
acquitted on all but the last count,'' said attorney William
Brockett, who represented former Alameda County district attorney's
investigator Kevin Leong.
   DeRicco, 40, was convicted Thursday of money laundering and
obstruction of justice but acquitted of seven other charges,
including conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   Leong, 41, was found guilty of urging a witness to lie to a grand
jury. He was acquitted on five other charges, including conspiracy.
   The two had been accused by convicted drug smuggler Alion
Andersson of participating in a cocaine smuggling ring. Andersson
was given a reduced prison term in exchange for testifying against
DiRicco and Leong.
   The defense lawyers complained that the two defendants were
acquitted of a conspiracy charge that included alleged wrongdoing
for which they were convicted. Their motions for a new trial will be
heard Jan. 26.
   If the convictions stand, DiRicco could receive a maximum
sentence of 10 years, and Leong could spend up to five years in
prison.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci will honor
65 servicemen and civilian employees next week with productivity
excellence awards for making work suggestions that saved an
estimated $255.9 million last year.
   The awards, to be presented during a ceremony at the Pentagon
Monday, are considered the Defense Department's highest honor for
individual productivity achievement, the Pentagon said.
   It said individuals cannot be nominated for the award unless
their initiative or idea ``greatly exceeds job expectation and saves
the government at least $1 million.''
   The Pentagon began the program in 1983. It has honored 275 people
who have been credited with saving a total of more than $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of police and paramilitary
troops patrolled the capital and three northern states Friday after
militants threatened to avenge two Sikhs hanged in connection with
the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Sikh shopkeepers closed their doors in New Delhi, Bombay and
across the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab, officials said. A bus was
set afire and two bombs were defused Friday in Punjab, but no
casualties were reported.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot by two Sikh bodyguards Oct. 31, 1984,
apparently to revenge an army raid she ordered on the Golden Temple,
the holiest Sikh shrine. More than 1,200 people died, most of them
Sikhs.
   Satwant Singh, the lone surviving gunman, and Kehar Singh,
convicted of helping plan the assassination, were hanged Friday
morning on the gallows of New Delhi's maximum-security Tihar Jail,
authorities said.
   According to a Home Ministry official, Kehar Singh proclaimed his
innocence but appealed to Sikhs to refrain from retaliatory attacks,
and Satwant Singh, who never denied shooting Mrs. Gandhi, said he
had no regrets.
   As the nooses tightened around their necks, the two men shouted
in their native Punjabi an ancient Sikh battle cry, ``Say the
faithful, God is great!''
   In Amritsar, temporal center of the Sikh faith, residents said
posters pasted on walls overnight threatened widespread killings of
Hindus if the executions took place. The posters, in Punjabi, were
signed by militant Sikhs blamed for 2,440 killings in the northern
state last year.
   Authorities fearing another communal bloodbath deployed troops in
New Delhi and the three northern states.
   At an Amritsar prayer service, Sikh head priest Darshan Singh
Ragi honored the executed men as martyrs and said they would never
be forgotten.
   ``They did the right thing in killing Mrs. Gandhi,'' he told a
gathering of 300 followers.
   The executions, carried out in a light drizzle inside the
prison's gray walls, ended four years of legal maneuvers.
   Shortly before 8 a.m., the two men were taken to an open
courtyard near their cells. Their hands were tied behind their backs
and their legs bound in chains.
   Dressed in white cotton pajamas and wearing yellow kerchiefs over
their hair, they were escorted to the scaffold.
   ``Both men were very calm, very composed and offered no
resistance,'' said the Home Ministry official.
   Black hoods were pulled over their heads and one inch-thick ropes
placed around their necks. Then, on a final signal from prison
Superintendent Jaidev Sarangi, the two hangmen pulled the bolts that
released the trap doors beneath them.
   Relatives of Kehar Singh, 54, waited outside the prison,
including his son Rajinder and wife, Jasbir. They broke down at the
time of the execution. Other relatives raised clenched fists and
shouted the same battle cry, ``Say the faithful, God is great.''
   Police would not permit relatives of Satwant Singh, 30, near the
heavily barricaded prison.
   The two are not related. All male Sikhs take the name Singh,
which means lion.
   Shortly after the two men were declared dead, their bodies were
cremated within the prison compound according to Sikh religious
rites, another Home Ministry official said.
   Prison officials said they feared a funeral procession could be
used to incite violence.
   A magistrate and the doctor who pronounced them dead witnessed
the hangings. Hours before the executions, human rights activists
and opposition politicians appealed to President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to spare the lives of
the condemned men.
   ``The government will rue this day,'' warned opposition leader R.
Hegve.
   Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down in the garden of her official
residence by two of her Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984. One of the
assassins, Beant Singh, was gunned down by other security guards
minutes after Mrs. Gandhi fell. Satwant Singh was arrested after he
recovered from bullet wounds.
   Kehar Singh, Beant's uncle, was arrested and charged with
conspiracy a month later.
   After an eight-month trial in a makeshift courtroom at Tihar
Jail, both were convicted and sentenced to death Jan. 22, 1986. The
convictions and sentences were upheld by the High Court and Supreme
Court.
   In London, several dozen Sikh protesters demonstrated outside the
Indian High Commission and 23 were arrested for obstruction. They
later were cautioned and released, Scotland Yard said.
   Sikh leaders in Britain accused the Indian government of doing
nothing to bring to justice people involved in anti-Sikh riots
following Mrs. Gandhi's death. They claim the riots resulted in
killings of 10,000 Sikhs.
   Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
they are in a majority in northern Punjab state. Sikh militants
began fighting for an independent homeland in 1982, and the movement
quickly acquired violent overtones.

<HEAD>Farmer Is Candidate For Treasurer Of Democratic National Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert A. Farmer, who set a Democratic Party
fund-raising record in 1988, announced Friday his candidacy for
treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.
   Farmer, who was credited with raising nearly $70 million for the
1988 campaign, said he would set a goal of raising at least $100
million for the party over the next four years.
   When asked for his view of so-called soft money, political
contributions outside the limits covering most donations to
candidates and parties, Farmer said, ``The rules are the rules and I
refuse to apologize for raising money at the level of the
Republicans.''
   Would he continue seeking soft money?
   ``Absolutely,'' said Farmer.
   Both parties raised millions of dollars last year from
individuals who gave up to $100,000 each. That money was used for
voter registration drives and other activities defined as
strengthening local parties rather than directly advocating the
election of candidates for president or Congress.
   Individuals are limited to contributions of $1,000 to candidates
for federal office and $5,000 to political action committees. There
is a $20,000 limit on individual contributions to national party
committees.
   Farmer, who headed the fund-raising operation for Michael
Dukakis, said he didn't know if the Massachusetts governor would
seek the presidency again in 1992, but added, ``I don't think he's
going to be a candidate.''
   Sharon Pratt Dixon, the current party treasurer, is not seeking
another term and Farmer is not expected to have serious opposition
for the post when it is filled when the DNC meets next month.

   To the cheers of admirers who donned red bow
ties in his honor, Secretary of State Thad Eure bade farewell Friday
as his 52-year tenure ended.
   The 89-year-old official was in a buoyant mood at a ceremony in
his honor in the rotunda of the state Capitol, where he has occupied
the northeast corner office since 1931. He was clerk of the state
House for five years before his first election as secretary of state
in 1936.
   President Reagan said Eure was the longest-serving state elected
official in the nation's history.
   ``You're going to see me around some more,'' Eure told the crowd
of about 150. ``For all of you Democrats and for all of you
Republicans, I pledge ... that I'm going to spend the rest of my
life helping Democrats get elected to public office.''
   Eure did not seek a 14th term because of his wife's poor health.
   He traded friendly verbal jabs with Republican Gov. Jim Martin,
delighting the crowd that included legislators, members of Congress
and lobbyists.
   Eure said he had served with 13 governors and that none had
``accorded me more courtesies'' than Martin.
   ``I like this man,'' Eure said, putting a hand on Martin's
shoulder. ``I told him that ... I wanted to do everything I could to
help him in any way I could, except one thing: I'd never vote for
him.''
   Students and administrators of Elon College, where Eure is
longtime chairman of the board of trustees, distributed red bow-tie
stickers to people who weren't wearing the real thing.
   The red bow tie is a trademark of the flamboyant Eure.
   Martin read a proclamation declaring Friday as ``Red Bow Tie
Day.''
   The governor said his aides had done research to determine
whether any official had outlasted Eure.
   ``I have to say to you that we found one: Ramses the Great,'' the
governor said as the crowd roared and applauded. ``Ramses the Great
held the same office for 65 years. But you also can be consoled to
know that he was not elected ... to that office. His daddy gave it
to him.''

<HEAD>Girl At Adults-Only Condominium Spared Eviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARGATE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A condominium board has postponed a decision
on whether to evict 9-year-old Jamie Swartz, who moved into her
father's apartment in an adults-only complex while her mother was
dying of cancer.
   Board members decided Thursday night to wait a couple of months
while they consider the implications of a fair housing law that
takes effect in March.
   ``It must be similar to what someone on death row must feel,''
said Jill Swartz, Jamie's stepmother. ``It's not over yet. It's just
a reprieve until they find something else to throw at us.''
   Jamie moved into the complex last April to live with her father,
Lynn, and his new wife, while the girl's 42-year-old mother, Maye
Swartz, was treated for cancer.
   The condo board voted in July to allow Jamie to stay until her
mother finished chemotherapy. She died in September.
   The board threatened to seek eviction in November, but then
allowed the girl to remain through the holidays provided the
two-bedroom condo was placed on the market.
   The Swartzes said there have been few buyers interested in the
condo, purchased three years ago for about $50,000.
   Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the state's Fair
Housing Amendment Act, which takes effect March 12. The law bans age
discrimination in housing with a few exemptions. Among them are
apartment complexes in which 80 percent of the units have a resident
who is at least 55 years old.
   The Viewpointe condo board is not clear if it meets the age
exemption, according to its attorney, Douglas Neway. The board has
scheduled a meeting for Jan. 10 to vote on a proposal to require at
least one resident at least 55 years old in each unit.
   Some condo residents are unhappy with the board's leadership.
   ``I think if they get the 55 or older thing through, they'll be
right back on Jamie's case again,'' said Marcy Esposito, who is
trying to get on the board.
   Esposito and other residents are trying to replace the board at
the condo elections later this month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday
it plans to make permanent the temporary limit on residues of
sulfite pesticides on grapes.
   Grape shippers and importers have been permitted to sell grapes
containing sulfite residues up to 10 parts per million for the past
two years while EPA investigated what the permanent limit should be.
   The agency said it would receive public comments for the next 30
days on making 10 ppm the permanent limit.
   Sulfur compounds have been used on grapes for more than 60 years
to prevent rotting during shipment. Until 1986, no legal residue
limit was in effect because the compounds were listed by the Food
and Drug Administration as ``generally recognized as safe,'' a
status the FDA revoked that year.
   Sulfites can trigger adverse reactions in a small number of
sensitive people, mostly asthmatics.

<HEAD>Saudi Tanker Sinks While Being Towed After Explosion</HEAD>

   A Saudi Arabian tanker split in two and
sank while being towed to port Friday after an explosion and fire
killed six crewmen in the southern Persian Gulf, shipping executives
reported.
   The 36,904-ton Sagheera may have been hit by a drifting mine when
it was rocked by an explosion Thursday during a storm in the Strait
of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf, the executives said on condition
of anonymity.
   They said the vessel's Greek captain, Constantinos Sardinis, was
among six crew members killed and that the Oman coast guard rescued
the other 26 crewmen from lifeboats on Thursday. Two other Greeks
were killed along with three Sri Lankan seamen.
   The vessel split as it was being towed by a tug boat toward the
coast of Oman. Its stern section sank quickly and the forward
section went down several hours later, the executives said.
   The explosion rocked the Sagheera and set it on fire as it was
steaming into the storm-lashed Strait of Hormuz, headed for the
Saudi Arabian port of Mina Saud.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors shipping traffic around the world, reported that an
explosion in the tanker's pump room triggered the fire.
   It did not say what could have caused the blast. U.S. Navy
officers have warned for weeks that mines laid during the Iran-Iraq
war could be torn loose from their moorings during winter storms and
sent adrift into shipping lanes.
   Winds gusted more than 30 mph Thursday, whipping waves as high as
30 feet.
   The stormy weather grounded a small Honduran freighter, the
Moajil-5, off the southern Gulf port of Sharjah.
   An Iranian ferry with about 420 passengers on board sailing from
Sharjah to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas was forced to anchor in
the neighboring port of Ras Al-Khaimah, the shipping executives said.
   The U.S. Navy has estimated as many as 200 mines are still in the
gulf, despite mine sweeping operations by the United States and
other countries.
   Several vessels were hit by mines during the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq
war before a U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. Since
then, no ship has been confirmed to have been hit by a mine.
   The Sagheera, owned by the Dammam-based General Contracting
Importing and Service Enterprises, was hit by Iranian gunboats April
4 last year, but there were no casualties and the ship was only
slightly damaged.

<TEXT>
   The camera system that produced photos of this
week's dogfight between U.S. and Libyan fighters is a relatively new
one whose principal purpose has nothing to do with recording images
of aerial action.
   The system operates with videotape and was installed in the
Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighters starting in the early 1980s.
   But according to Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, the
system's principal purpose ``is to magnify vision to a range of
20-to-30 miles.''
   ``The system is designed to increase the visual identification
range of the pilot,'' Quigley added. ``The pilot can use the camera
system to pick up targets far beyond normal sight.''
   ``Obviously, its second purpose is to serve as a gun camera and
record any action.''
   The spokesman said the installation of target, or gun, cameras in
Navy aircraft is nothing new, dating back to the days of World War
II. The only serious change in the procedure over the past decade
has been the switch from 16mm camera film to the magnetic videotape
now used.
   Cameras also are installed on the Navy's attack aircraft, like
the A-6 Intruder. The Pentagon previously released videotape shot by
A-6's and Air Force F-111 bombers after the U.S. raid on Libya in
1986.

<HEAD>Amtrak, Tower Operator Share Blame For Accident, NTSB Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amtrak train derailment in Pennsylvania was
likely caused by a tower operator who tested for positive for drugs,
and by problems with Amtrak's system of keeping trains off
out-of-service tracks, federal officials said Friday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board divided blame for the
January 1988 accident, which injured 25 people, between control
tower operator Thomas Connor and the passenger line.
   The NTSB report said Amtrak should develop a procedure ``to
prevent locomotives or trains from entering out-of-service track
sections, unless permission has been received from the person in
charge of the out-of-service track ... ''
   Connor, who resigned after the accident, was on duty when the
train struck a work vehicle in Chester, Pa., near Philadelphia Jan.
29. Officials said he let the train to travel on a section of track
undergoing maintenance.
   Connor fled his post, and did not submit to required drug tests
until more than 72 hours after the accident. Marijuana and small
traces of cocaine and methamphetamine were detected in his system.
   The NTSB said Connor, ``because of impairment by drugs or
distraction or both,'' did not hit a switch to let the train cross
to the proper track.
   But the agency also said Amtrak failed ``to adequately monitor
the activities and job performance of the tower operator.'' The NTSB
recommended the line establish standards for the selection, training
and responsibilities of tower operators.
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said he hadn't yet seen the NTSB
report.
   But after being read its conclusions, Jacobsen said he did not
know if the NTSB was aware Amtrak is been phasing out tower
operators.
   ``They're clearly dealing with what was, not what is. It's being
shifted to remote control by computer,'' he said.
   But Jacobsen said the old system was safe, too.
   ``While the system we're moving to has more safeguards, the old
system was a safe system. All one had to do was follow it.''
   Connor, Jacobsen said, ``had standing orders that the track had
been taken out of service (by the dispatcher). We're just lucky in
this situation that no one was killed.''
   An assistant conductor on the train also tested positive for
marijuana, but he was not believed to have played a role in the
accident, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
   The FRA announced the drug test results last February, but it was
left to the NTSB to determine the accident's likely cause.

   The chief court physician to Emperor Hirohito made
an emergency visit to the ailing monarch before dawn Saturday,
authorities said.
   Dr. Akira Takagi was summoned to Hirohito's bedside at 5:30 a.m.
(3:30 p.m. EST Friday).
   Shortly after that, the crown prince and princess, as well as top
Imperial Household Agency officials, had arrived at the palace, the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported. It said the emperor's blood
pressure had fallen, and he was in a ``dangerous'' condition.
   An official of the Imperial Household Agency, who confirmed the
doctor's visit, refused to comment on the 87-year-old emperor's
condition or why the doctor was summoned. He said he did not know
when the next official announcement on the emperor's condition would
be made.
   On Friday, court physicians expressed worry over possible damage
to Hirohito's brain and other organs because his blood pressure was
dangerously low. Despite the report, palace officials had maintained
he was not in a critical state.
   ``His overall condition appears to be weakening,'' Imperial
Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said at a regular press
briefing. ``His kidney and other organ functions may have been
affected slightly.''
   He added that Hirohito had been ``clearly conscious'' and was not
yet in critical condition.
   According to Maeda, Hirohito's blood pressure stood at 68 over 30
for the second-consecutive day Friday. The reading has been well
below 90 since Thursday morning, despite efforts to push it up with
emergency blood transfusions.
   An average systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading is about
120 and a sustained level below 100 can lead to irreversible damage
to the brain and other internal organs due to insufficient oxygen
flow, doctors say.
   ``It is unlikely that his blood pressure will recover
significantly considering his failing health,'' a palace official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Doctors don't seem to be
concerned about the low blood pressure so much as long as it stays
above 70.''
   Hirohito's respiration rate, which jumped to 32 breaths per
minute earlier, eased back to 26 by Friday night, Maeda said, adding
that when physicians applied an oxygen mask to the frail emperor,
Hirohito tried to brush it away.
   The Japanese monarch has been ill since last September with
internal hemorrhaging. He has continued to bleed intermittently
since then and Maeda said physicians again Friday inserted a tube
through the emperor's nose to extract blood accumulated in his
stomach.
   Hirohito is believed to be bleeding in the upper intestinal area,
where he underwent a bypass operation in September 1987. News
reports have speculated he has pancreatic cancer, but the Imperial
Household Agency, which manages palace affairs, has refused to
confirm or deny the reports.
   The monarch has been bedridden at the moat-surrounded Fukiage
Palace since Sept. 19, and is being fed intravenously. He has
consumed only a few spoonfuls of porridge and some fragments of ice
since the onset of the crisis and his weight has reportedly dropped
below 60 pounds, well below the 110 pounds he weighed before falling
ill.
   Doctors have relied on transfusions to treat the emperor and make
up for his blood loss as well as declining physical strength. As of
Thursday evening, Hirohito had received nearly 68 pints of blood,
more than eight times the normal amount circulating in his body.
   Crown Prince Akihito, Hirohito's son, has taken over the
emperor's largely ceremonial duties. Under the constitution, the
emperor has no real political power and his duties consist mainly of
meeting visiting dignitaries and fixing his seal on laws passed by
Japan's Cabinet.

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul on Friday called a special
synod of bishops on the role of the church in Africa, where Roman
Catholicism is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world.
   John Paul, who has visited the continent four times since he
became pope, made the surprise announcement during his noon Angelus
address from his window overlooking St. Peter's Square.
   ``I have the joy to announce an initiative of great importance
for the spread of the Gospel ... I have decided to convene a special
assembly for Africa of the synod of bishops on the theme: `The
church in Africa toward the Third Millennium,''' he said.
   The pope said he was acting on a longstanding request by African
prelates, theologians and lay people.
   ``I invite you to remember with prayers the African continent,
the blessed land that welcomed the exiled Jesus with his family, and
received the message of Christ from the first centuries,'' he said.
   ``Let us pray that the new synodal initiative, with the help of
God, can represent for the universal church and for all the
individual churches in Africa a special moment in the course of
faith of those beloved people, to whom I feel so close.''
   John Paul did not say when or where the assembly would be held
but announced he had appointed an organizing commission of nine
African prelates headed by Cardinal Christian Wiyghan Tumi,
archbishop of Garoua in Cameroon.
   The synod is a consultative body which meets every three years to
inform and advise the pope on various issues. Sometimes the pope
calls a special or extraordinary synod.
   The last worldwide synod of bishops was held at the Vatican in
October 1987 to discuss the role of the laity in church and society.
   Pope John Paul visited Africa in May 1980, February 1982, August
1985 and last September. During the most recent trip, he toured
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.
   He also made a brief unscheduled stop in South Africa when bad
weather forced his plane down there.
   The pope is expected to return to Africa in 1989, probably in
April.
   Africa has the world's fastest growing Christian community. The
Catholic Church there has at least 70 million followers, about 13
percent of the population, with nearly 500 bishops and 19,000
priests.
   By the year 2000, the Vatican says it expects to have 100 million
African faithful, or 18 percent of the population. Roman Catholics
made up just 1 percent of Africa's population a century ago.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge May Delay North Trial If Key Charges Dismissed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge indicated Friday he might delay
the Jan. 31 start of the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L. North
because prosecutors have sought dismissal of conspiracy and theft
counts against the fired National Security Council aide.
   ``All dates now scheduled'' will be reviewed at a hearing Monday
in light of the dismissal motion by independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said in a one-sentence
order.
   Gesell will consider Walsh's dismissal motion at the hearing.
Dropping the two main counts is expected to require significant
adjustments in the documents both sides plan to present in the case.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, defended the Reagan
administration's position to limit disclosure of classified
information in the case.
   The administration's position contributed to Walsh's decision to
abandon the charges that accuse North of illegally diverting more
than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels. Three others are also charged with the same counts, but
their trials have been severed.
   An interagency intelligence group in the administration refused
to permit the release of additional classified material which Gesell
said must be disclosed in order for North to get a fair trial.
   Dropping the conspiracy and theft counts is ``hardly'' going to
provide ``a precedent in every case,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``In every case, there is going to have to be the type of
balancing ... Walsh carried out here,'' he said.
   ``One the one hand, is it more important to go ahead with a
particular criminal prosecution that involves a particular defendant
and a particular offense as against what harm might come to the
country's long-term interests from exposing of sensitive
information?''
   Walsh ``made the decision here to protect this information rather
than go forward with these counts in the indictment that was
returned,'' Thornburgh added.
   Walsh said he also based his decision on North's insistence on
introducing classified information in his defense and on Gesell's
refusal Tuesday to reconsider his order of last month on what
classified information must be disclosed. The judge said the
administration had deleted too much information from the secret
government documents Walsh wants to use as evidence.
   Meanwhile, in a motion filed in federal court, Walsh's office
said North's lawyers are impermissibly trying to increase the number
of classified documents they will be allowed to use at trial to at
least 550.
   Walsh's office plans to use 300 classified government documents
to prosecute North and Gesell has limited the defense to the same
number.
   The prosecution asked Gesell for an order reducing the number of
documents North plans to use.
   If the conspiracy and theft counts against North are dismissed,
12 charges would remain carrying maximum total penalties of 60 years
in prison and $3 million in fines.
   Nine of the 12 counts that would remain focus on North allegedly
concealing from Congress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
his efforts on behalf of the Contras. Four of the nine deal with
alleged concealment of the diversion of money to the Contras from
the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Secord, converting to his own
use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo
Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue in
connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

   Afghan rebel leaders ended talks with
a Soviet diplomat on Friday without reaching agreement on whether
the Soviet-backed Communist Party would play a role in a new Afghan
government.
   Guerrilla leaders, after meeting with Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Yuli Vorontsov, said they believed Soviet troops will stick
to their deadline and pull out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   ``They confirmed this,'' said Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, a guerrilla
leader.
   But guerrilla leaders said the sides still could not agree on the
government that would be left behind once the Red Army ends its
decade-long occupation.
   Mojaddidi, chairman of a loose alliance of seven Pakistan-based
guerrilla groups, said the only agreement that came out of Friday's
talks was ``that we will continue the negotiations after a few
days.''
   Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan in 1979
to replace the faltering communist government with a new one. Troops
remained to quell the anti-communist insurgency.
   Under a U.N.-brokered accord reached in April, Moscow agreed to
end its occupation by mid-February. It said half of its troops had
left by August.
   Vorontsov told reporters when he arrived in Islamabad on
Wednesday that the withdrawal deadline could be delayed if Moslem
insurgents continued fighting.
   ``They asked for a cease-fire several times but we said a
cease-fire is not possible,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we said we can
stop attacking your military forces when they are leaving
Afghanistan.''
   He said the sides also reached an impasse on the role of Kabul's
Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghansitan.
   Despite rebel demands that Moscow stop insisting that the ruling
Communists play a role in a postwar government, Vorontsov continued
to press for party representation, Mojaddidi said.
   ``They want the present regime to participate in the future
government,'' said Mojaddidi. ``But we can't.''
   Guerrilla factions based in Pakistan and Iran agreed before
Friday's talks that Afghanistan's President Najib and his Marxist
party were a stumbling block to peace in Afghanistan.
   Vorontsov refused comment on the talks. He has scheduled a press
conference for Saturday, the final day of his four-day trip. He is
to meet Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan on Saturday.
   The Soviet envoy also is to meet with Pakistan Foreign Minister
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan Friday night at a Soviet-sponsored dinner. The
Soviet Union has said that Pakistan's ardent support for the
guerrillas has worsened the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.
   A Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition he
not be identified, said Pakistan wants to make clear to the Soviets
that there will be a transfer of power in Afghanistan following the
final troop withdrawal regardless of political agreements.
   Whether it is peaceful depends on whether the Soviet Union is
prepared to accept the demise of the Afghan communist party, he said.
   The first round of direct talks between Afghan guerrilla fighters
and the Soviet Union was held Dec. 3-5 in the Saudi Arabian resort
city of Taif.
   The Kremlin has stepped up its political maneuvering for a
peaceful settlement to the Afghan war, shuttling Vorontsov between
Pakistan and Iran, where more than 5 million war refugees live, and
Rome, where the former Afghan King Zahir Shah lives.
   About 17 percent of Afghanistan's 15 million people belong to the
Shiite sect of Islam, which is practiced by most Iranians as well.
The majority of Afghans are Sunni Moslems, like the Pakistan-based
guerrillas.
   The guerrillas announced Tuesday that a council will be
established within weeks to select a transitional government. Each
of the seven parties is to nominate 60 members to this council.
   The Iranian-based Afghan fighters also were asked to name 60
members. A spokesman for the Shiite fighters, Timurpur, said the
guerrillas in Iran have not decided to participate in this council.
   Mojaddidi said Vorontsov accepted the council but ``the council
for them is another thing ... They think the regime will
participate. But we said only Moslem elements could participate, not
non-Moslems.''

<HEAD>Hope and `Sorrowful Eyes' Mix at Armenian Christmas Celebration</HEAD>

   An archbishop of the Armenian church searched for
hope as he observed a somber Christmas liturgy Friday with
``sorrowful eyes,'' following the tragedy in his homeland that
claimed 25,000 lives.
   ``The pain is deep. I saw it with my own eyes,'' Archbishop
Torkom Manoogian of the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America
said during a divine liturgy at St. Vartan Cathedral in Manhattan.
   The church observes Christmas on Jan. 6.
   ``Even though we are mourning, we can still say `Merry
Christmas,''' he said in Armenian. ``We ask God for the grace to be
able to celebrate Christmas through these hard times.''
   The pain of the earthquake that devastated Soviet Armenia on Dec.
7 was felt by those who had gathered. Hundreds of thousands were
left homeless and 25,000 people were killed.
   Relief poured in from around the world, including $3 million a
diocesan spokeswoman said was collected locally. A hangar at Kennedy
International Airport was donated for collecting and transporting
relief supplies, she said.
   The archbishop designated a 40-day period of mourning that ends
Jan. 15; the money for Christmas gifts went to relief efforts;
festivities, including New Year's celebrations, were put off.
   The church's usual children's Christmas party on Saturday will be
replaced by a requiem for the children who died, followed by a
madagh, or memorial meal.
   ``We can't believe the earthquake happened. We may ask where is
God because such a tragedy happened,'' Manogian continued in
Armenian, as translated by the church spokeswoman, Aileen Krikoryan.
   ``God is there in the face of the earthquake.''
   And, the archbishop continued in English, ``people tell us we
should not (celebrate) because something terrible has happened to
our people in Armenia.''
   ``Who can refuse it? Who can say, `Not today, we don't want it.'
Even in our sorrow, we need that grace to carry our heavy sorrow
which is almost unbearable,'' he said, as incense swirled above.
   The archbishop later said he hoped Armenians did not ``fall into
a state of hopelessness.''
   ``We celebrate our Christmas with doleful, sorrowful eyes,''
Manoogian said in an impromtu homily in the church's hall.
``However, those looks are not looks of despair. They are looks of
compassion, and steadfast faith.''
   Among the 100 people or so scattered about the cavernous
cathedral were those who had lost relatives. But Armenians quickly
tell visitors that all Armenians are related.
   ``I'm not particularly religious, but I feel compelled to come in
light of the tragedy. The Armenian church helps us grieve
together,'' said Mendor Ozcelik, a 21-year-old New York resident who
attends the University of Connecticut at Storrs.
   ``The church is more than religion to Armenians _ it's unifying
us in a nationalistic way,'' he said, adding that he attended
services on the first Sunday after the earthquake for the first time
in years.

   Thieves who stole four trailers loaded with
alcoholic beverages, stereo components and clothing got more than
they bargained for _ authorities say the cargo is contaminated with
dangerous pesticides.
   ``Anybody just handling the cartons could be poisoned if they put
their hands in their mouth or eye. The poison may not show up for
weeks,'' said LaVerne Guillen, spokeswoman for the Metro-Dade Fire
Department.
   Three of the trailers, which were stolen over New Year's weekend,
have been recovered, she said Friday. But the first two were
discovered empty.
   The first trailer contained 200 cases of champagne, rum, and
cognac, she said. Two other trailers also contained alcohol, and
authorities warned the public not to buy alcoholic beverages
anywhere except in licensed liquor stores.
   The cartons became contaminated during a September fire at a Dade
County warehouse containing hazardous materials, Ms. Guillen said.
   Authorities are uncertain whether the poisonous chemicals seeped
through the corks of the stolen imported champagne or into the
bottles of rum, brandy and cognac in the cartons, according to Capt.
Tom Wheeler of the state Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Division.
   Ms. Guillen said the cartons were loaded onto the trailers for
shipment to Alabama for disposal. Florida does not allow hazardous
waste to be buried in its landfills, she said.
   One of the contaminants is phenylmercuric acetate. Ms. Guillen
said the ``extremely toxic'' chemical is used as an antiseptic,
herbicide, fungicide and mildewcide for paints.
   Fire department personnel calculated that seven drops to one
teaspoonful of the pesticide would kill a 150-pound person.
   ``They were concerned that the pesticides were in a concentrated
form on the cartons,'' Ms. Guillen said.
   Symptoms of exposure include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
confusion, irritability, hallucinations and slurred speech.
   The recovered trailer that had not been emptied contained an
assortment of things, including drums of pesticide and some
foodstuffs, Ms. Guillen said.

<HEAD>Recruiting Goals Met Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's military services met or exceeded
their recruiting goals for the ninth consecutive year in fiscal
1988, but concern is growing about the future, the Pentagon said
Friday.
   Even though the Defense Department does not need to recruit as
many men and women this year as it did last, ``Delayed Entry Program
participation has declined to the lowest level in five years,'' the
Pentagon said in a new report.
   Moreover, the reduction in recruiting goals should make it easier
to improve the current record-high number of high school graduates
among the volunteers, but that is not happening, the Pentagon added.
   The Delayed Entry Program lets individuals sign up for military
service but delay the start of basic training until a later date or
when specific job openings occur. That pool of individuals is a key
tool for recruiters who need to spread the flow of new enlistments
throughout the year.
   ``With a strong economy and the shrinking pool of youth available
for military service, the services are facing significantly more
competitive market conditions,'' said Grant S. Green Jr., the
assistant defense secretary for personnel.
   ``The services' ability to obtain high-quality volunteers and
retain the best and brightest of them ... will depend upon support
of the Congress and the American people for adequate military
compensation, quality-of-life initiatives and recruiting resources
and incentives.''
   The new recruiting and re-enlistment results released Friday
cover fiscal 1988 _ the 12 months ending last Sept. 30. During that
period, the Pentagon significantly cut its recruiting goals because
of a decision by the administration to reduce the size of the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to accommodate congressional budget
cuts.
   The new report shows 93 percent of the recruits who joined the
military in fiscal 1988 had a high school diploma, exactly matching
the figure reported in fiscal 1987.
   Those results are significantly above the high school graduation
rates for the American youth population as a whole _ roughly 75
percent.
   Re-enlistment results, meantime, were ``satisfactory despite slow
starts in some areas,'' the Pentagon continued.
   The percentages of men and women re-enlisting in the Air Force
and Marine Corps dipped slightly on a percentage basis of those
eligible, but the declines caused no problem because the services
also had reduced their goals in that area.
   All told, the four services recruited 286,700 men and women
between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988, slightly exceeding the
combined objective of 286,400. Of that total, 272,600 were men and
women who had not previously served in the military, while the
remaining 14,100 were individuals returning to the services after
breaks in their military careers.
   Of the 272,600 first-time recruits, 254,000 or 93.2 percent had
graduated from high school.
   Moreover, the recruits who entered the service during the past
year scored unusually well on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, a
special standardized skill exam given all new enlistees. Ninety-five
percent of the recruits scored average or above on the test this
past year, just one percentage point below the all-time record of 96
percent set in fiscal 1986.
   The United States switched to an all-volunteer military in 1973.
After years of trying to establish the system and attract
high-quality recruits, the Defense Department finally met its annual
recruiting objective in fiscal 1980 and has managed to meet or
exceed the annual goals ever since.
   According to the latest report, the Army signed up 115,300 men
and women during fiscal 1988, slightly exceeding its goal of
115,000. The Navy recruited 94,000 individuals, precisely matching
its goal, while the Marine Corps recruiting 35,900 men and women,
matching its goal. The Air Force recruited 41,500 individuals, also
matching its goal.
   Overall, 67 percent of the men and women who were eligible to
re-enlist in their respective services did so in fiscal 1988 _ or
251,300 of the 374,600 eligible. That slightly exceeds the previous
year's tally of 65 percent.
   Of the first-time recruits who joined the military in fiscal
1988, 34,400 were women _ or 12.6 percent _ and 238,200 were men.
That overall percentage for women exceeds the fiscal 1987 rate of
12.2 percent.
   Of the four services, the Air Force continued to attract by far
the most women _ 8,100 out of 41,200 total, or 19.7 percent.
   The report shows blacks comprised 56,500 of the first-time
recruits who joined in fiscal 1988 _ or 20.7 percent, up one
percentage point compared to fiscal 1987.
   The Pentagon said there were 110,500 individuals in the Delayed
Entry Program as of Sept. 30, down sharply from the 123,700 reported
a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Piles of flowers remained outside a
corner market Friday as tearful residents mourned their 68-year-old
grocer, ``everybody's dad,'' shot to death during a holdup.
   ``There isn't a man, woman or child who isn't affected by this,''
said Judy Jarvis, who had joked with Robert Young, owner of the
Santa Fe Market, only hours before his death Thursday.
   ``Without Bob, the Point will never be the same,'' she said.
   Young and his assistant, Brent Moriwaki, 34, were killed by a
still-unidentified gunman who then died, gun in hand, in an exchange
of fire with police, authorities said. Cleophus Clark, 36, also was
shot at the store and remained in serious condition Friday.
   Young ran the small market for 40 years, and customers who laid
candles and created a sad garden outside its door remembered him as
a friend who delivered groceries to the elderly and disabled,
extended credit, and saved bones for dogs.
   Neighborhood kids who stopped for free sesame cookies the San
Francisco resident kept in a tin below the counter knew him as
``Cookie Bob.''
   ``It was like someone walked into your living room and shot your
family,'' said Grey Wolf, an artist whose wood carvings are sold in
the store next to Young's. ``Bob was everybody's dad.''
   Young also served as the banker for Point Richmond, which doesn't
have a bank. For years, he cashed payroll checks for workers at the
nearby Chevron oil refinery.
   Richmond police believe that practice, for which customers said
Young kept tens of thousands of dollars in cash on hand, may have
lured his killer to the Santa Fe Market.
   ``I kept telling him, `Bob, you keep too much money in here.
...Something's going to happen sometime,' '' said Officer Jim
Ingram, also a customer. ``He wouldn't listen.''
   Police and witnesses said the gunman walked into the market
shortly before 1 p.m. and waited in line during the lunch-hour rush.
When he reached the counter, the man said he wanted to cash a check,
then pulled out a .45-caliber pistol.
   ``This is a robbery,'' the man reportedly said before opening
fire.
   The sequence of the shootings was not immediately known. But
Young, shot point-blank in the temple, died before help arrived.
   Moriwaki, an El Cerrito resident Young was grooming to replace
him when he retired, died early Friday from a bullet wound in the
head.
   Clark, of Richmond, remained in serious but stable condition at
John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek. It was unknown if Clark
was a delivery man, customer or both, police said.
   The gunman then fled in a red pickup, said police Lt. Raymond
Howard. Police were uncertain if the suspect took any money.
   A few minutes later another officer, Lou Pereira, spotted the
suspect's truck on a freeway and pulled it over. The gunman fired at
Pereira, who then shot and killed the man, Howard said.
   The suspect, shot twice in the head and upper body, was slumped
behind the steering wheel, the gun still in his right hand. Police
said he carried no identification and the pickup was not registered.
   The southbound lanes of the freeway were closed after the
shooting, causing a traffic jam for several hours.

<HEAD>British Probers Believe Bomb Planted In London, Paper Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British investigators believe the
bomb that exploded aboard Pan Am Flight 103 last month was attached
to the outside of the airliner at London's Heathrow airport, a West
German newspaper reported Friday.
   A spokesman for the government press office in Bonn said he could
not confirm or deny the report.
   The Munich Abendzeitung newspaper said, ``British flight
officials have informed the Bonn Interior Ministry that
investigators now feel that the bomb that caused the Pan Am
explosion shortly before Christmas was affixed to the outside of the
plane at London's Heathrow airport.''
   The brief report, made available to other news media, also said
British officials believe that ``at least 100 people had access'' to
the Boeing 747 in London before it departed and crashed over
Lockerbie Scotland on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and
11 on the ground.
   The newspaper cited West German security sources for its
information.
   Government press spokesman Ulrich Strempel said by telephone: ``I
cannot confirm or deny such a report.
   ``We don't like to comment on reports that simply cite security
sources,'' Strempel said.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz also said he
could not comment on the report.
   ``I find that all this sort of speculation should stop,'' Butz
said. ``I cannot confirm or deny the report.''
   Since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, speculation on how the
bomb was placed on the airliner has been widespread. Flight 103
began in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727, but in London switched to the
Boeing 747 that crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, as it headed to
New York.
   West German investigators repeatedly have said they have found no
evidence that the bomb may have slipped through security checks in
luggage placed aboard the flight in Frankfurt and later transferred
to the Boeing 747.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Citibank Can Operate Subsidiary To Insure Municipal
Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court, in a ruling cited by
the banking industry as precedent-setting, said Friday that
Citibank, the largest bank in the nation, can operate a subsidiary
to insure municipal bonds.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
said the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the chief
regulator of nationally chartered banks, properly permitted Citibank
to purchase the American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp., known as
AMBAC.
   The decision by Comptroller Robert L. Clarke had been challenged
by the American Insurance Association as a violation of the Bank
Holding Company Act. Citibank is owned by Citicorp, a bank holding
company regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.
   The insurance association, after losing in U.S. District Court,
won an appeal. In August, the appeals panel said the Bank Holding
Company Act, and thus Federal Reserve jurisdiction applied. Friday's
ruling, however, reverses that part of the August decision.
   Even though Citibank is a nationally chartered bank, Stephen
Verdier, an attorney with the Independent Bankers Association of
America, said the latest court ruling represents a blow to a
proposal by the Federal Reserve to extend its jurisdiction over the
activities of subsidiaries of state banks owned by holding companies.
   The Fed in November proposed a regulation requiring state banks
owned by holding companies to get its permission before establishing
real estate, insurance and other non-banking operations, even when
state law permits the operations. Banks have opposed the Fed
proposal as a power grab.
   ``The significance obviously goes well beyond whether Citibank
can own an insurance subsidiary. ... It really pulls the rug out
from under the Federal Reserve,'' Verdier said.
   Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures bank deposits and is the primary regulator of
state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve,
said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman was ``quite pleased'' with the
decision.
   ``It tracks very well with his philosophy that banks should be
allowed to expand their activities through bank affiliates or
subsidiaries provided adequate safeguards are set up,'' he said.

   It was a plucky gift, to be sure. When
William Benson returned home from his 50th birthday party, he found
50 pink, plastic flamingos planted in his front lawn.
   The gaudy, pink birds were a gift from Benson's brother, Robert,
of West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Benson said his brother shipped the plastic birds to an uncle and
cousin, who live in nearby Bristol, Wis.
   The two men apparently arrived at Benson's home on the night of
Dec. 16 to drill 100 holes in the frozen ground and stand the
Florida flamingos on their wire legs while Benson was gone.
   Benson said he decided to leave the birds in the ground until his
brother arrived for a visit over the holidays.
   ``I wanted him to see what he had done,'' said Benson, who owns
an oil company.
   But a deep freeze that followed after Christmas left the ground
so hard that the plastic birds will have to wait for the spring thaw
to be removed, Benson said.

<HEAD>Truce Agreed in `Hormone War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. beef and veal treated with hormones will
be accepted in the 12 countries of the European Economic Community
until Jan. 31 if it was shipped before the end of 1988, a spokesman
for U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Friday.
   Cary C. Walker reported the truce in the so-called ``hormone
war'' was approved Thursday, essentially for goods in transit.
   A European ban on imports of such meat went into effect Jan. 1,
affecting U.S. sales worth about $100 million a year. There was an
immediate U.S. reprisal in the form of an additional 100 percent
import duty on a group of food imports, including Danish hams and
sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, worth about the same amount.
   Under the agreement, the United States is also suspending the new
duties on goods if they were shipped before Jan. 1 and arrive in
this country by Jan. 31. Walker said unidentified governments in the
community suggested the truce and the U.S. administration accepted
on condition it apply throughout the 12 countries.
   Hormones are implanted in cows and calves to make them grow
faster. Their use is forbidden in the ECC countries, but there have
been reports of widespread violations.
   The 12 governments maintain that because of the ban, they have
the right under international agreements to also ban imports. Other
exporters of beef to Erope, including Canada and Australia, have
agreed to ship only meat from animals not implanted.
   Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy, said Thursday the import ban is a
restriction on trade disguised as a health measure, which has no
scientific basis.
   Faced with the reprisal, the European Commission -- the joint
executive of the 12 countries -- recommended a counter-reprisal.
Ambassadors representing the 12 governments at community
headquarters in Brussels pared down the commission's
counter-reprisal list on Thursday to about $96 million worth of U.S.
walnuts and dried prunes, peaches, apricots and papayas.
   A decision is due when ministers of foreign affairs from the 12
countries meet in Brussels Jan. 23 for a regular two-day session.
That will be three days after the inauguration of President-elect
Bush.

<HEAD>Rock Hudson's Lover Sues Estate for $11 Million, Says He Wasn't Told
of AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson's young homosexual lover never
learned that the movie star had AIDS until Hudson collapsed in Paris
and told his secretary: ``Take care of the kid. I may have killed
him,'' a lawyer told jurors Friday.
   In his opening statement in an $11 million lawsuit against
Hudson's estate, attorney Harold Rhoden said that secretary Mark
Miller hid Hudson's disease from Marc Christian until the whole
world heard about it.
   ``Marc Christian got a call from Mark Miller in France,'' said
Rhoden. ``He said, `I'm sorry. The movie star told me not to tell
you, I know it's not fair. But I was only following orders.'''
   Then, Rhoden added, Miller said Hudson wanted Christian to fly to
Paris and see a doctor. He quoted Miller as saying: ``Rock told me:
`Take care of the kid. I may have killed him.'''
   Rhoden's version is disputed by attorneys for Miller and the
Hudson estate.
   They contend that the love affair between Hudson and Christian
soured in early 1984 because Christian told Hudson he had sold sex
for money. They allege that Hudson stopped having sex with Christian
and allowed him to stay in his home for the next year and a half
only because Christian threatened to expose the star's homosexuality.
   Rhoden said Hudson hid his disease from his lover and was abetted
in his lies by Miller, who told Christian that the actor had
anorexia, not AIDS.
   ``Rock Hudson, who was 58 at the time he was dying, wanted to
continue enjoying sex with then 29-year-old Marc Christian,'' Rhoden
said.
   ``Mark Miller, to please his boss, conspired to put this young
man's life at risk.''
   Rhoden said the trial's key issue would be whether Hudson had a
duty to warn his sexual partner that he had AIDS and whether
Christian should be compensated for emotional distress and
``enhanced fear'' that he had been infected.
   Attorneys for the estate argue that Christian's fear is
unwarranted because he has tested negative for the AIDS virus and
has no symptoms of the disease.
   Rhoden described for jurors a tender 2{-year love affair which
began when the actor and Christian met at a political fund-raiser in
October 1982. Christian was 28 and Hudson was 56, he said. The actor
called Christian, and soon they were meeting regularly for lunch.
   In early 1983, he said, ``Hudson said he was falling in love with
Christian and that he hadn't felt this way since he was in high
school.'' In April, he said, the two men went away together for a
weekend and the sexual affair began, and by November, Christian had
moved into Hudson's home above Beverly Hills.
   Rhoden said the two men engaged in sex three to five times a week
with neither using a condom. In 1984, he said Hudson developed
symptoms of AIDS _ rashes and sores on his body, profuse sweating at
night and rapid weight loss.
   In June 1984, Hudson was diagnosed as having AIDS, Rhoden said,
but decided not to tell Christian.
   ``Miller said to him: `Are you going to tell the kid?''' Rhoden
said. ``And Hudson said, `No, and under no circumstances are you to
tell Christian. It is my disease and I'll handle it my way.'''
   Shortly before his death on October 5, 1985, Rhoden said
Christian confronted the actor at UCLA Medical Center.
   ``In the hospital, Marc said to Hudson, `I had a right to know.'
Hudson's only response was, `Yeah, you did.'''
   ``If Marc Chrstian had been told, he would not have left Rock
Hudson because he loved him,'' Rhoden concluded. ``But he would not
have committed suicide. He would not have engaged in any further
intercourse with Hudson.''

   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters exhibited
blurred photographs to the Security Council on Friday showing what
he called a heavily armed Libyan MiG-23 and said U.S. jets shot down
that plane and a companion MiG-23 in self-defense.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser called the photographs
doctored and said, ``It is completely fake. It is untrue.''
   Walters later asked reporters: ``Do you think this is a bouquet
of roses hanging under the wing?''
   ``We have photographs which prove that the planes were armed,''
he said.
   Walters passed two photographs around the council chamber, where
Libya has sought an emergency session to condemn the U.S. downing of
its two aircraft on Wednesday. Libya says they were unarmed planes
on a reconnaissance mission over international waters of the
Mediterranean Sea.
   The two enlarged photographs show two views of one of the two
MiGs, the U.S. Mission said. They are labeled ``Libyan MiG-23
Flogger.'' One shows a full view of an aircraft with what the United
States said are two Apex and two Aphid missiles. The other shows a
portion of an aircraft in the lower right corner.
   ``The missile parts show quite clearly,'' Walters said of the
photos, taken from a videotape. ``There were two different types of
missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts ofthe
fuselage.''
   ``We have photographs that show the planes were armed,'' Walters
said. ``You can see for yourself whether there were or were not
missiles.''
   He said the photos were taken by one of the U.S. F-14 Tomcats
that shot down the Libyan aircraft. The black-and-white photographs
were enlarged to about 16 inches by 20 inches and showed blurred
objects under the wing.
   ``Routine operations over international waters ... were
aggressively and hostilely challenged by the Libyan air force,''
Walters said.
   The session, which began Thursday, was expected to discuss a
resolution condemning the U.S. action. Delegates adjourned Friday
evening until 10:30 a.m. Monday. The United States and Britain were
expected to veto any such resolution in any event.
   ``The recordings of the pilots' conversations and the photographs
make it all he more clear that the United States acted in
self-defense,'' Walters said.
   Muntasser at first shunned the photographs and brushed them aside
as they were passed around the council for examination. But he later
said he had examined them and rejected them.
   ``We are in the country of Hollywood,'' he told reporters. ``It
is very well-edited, very well done and it is not true.'' He quoted
The New York Times, which described the videotape as blurred and
indistinct.
   He said the United States could have photographed MiGs in Vietnam
and used other film.
   Muntasser said the Libyan aircraft were not challenging and
threatening the U.S. jets. ``The Americans are provoking us. They
want us to retaliate and then they will attack Libya. That is the
whole reason,'' he said.
   Walters likened the evasive actions of the U.S. pilots to that of
a citizen trying to avoid a mugger: ``If you are walking down a dark
alley and see a man with a pistol walking behind you, you cross the
street and he crosses the street, you recross and he recrosses, you
do it five times and he follows you, you have to wonder if he's
going to hand you a bouquet of flowers. ... That's naive.''
   Walters spoke after representatives of 10 nations, including the
Soviet Union and Nicaragua, condemned the U.S. military action.
   Walters, who spoke sharply and in clear, controlled anger,
rebuked the earlier speakers who criticized the United States.
   ``The United States is not really disposed to receive lessons on
terrorism from a nation like Sandinista Nicaragua,'' he stold the
council. ``Nor is it ready to be taught the norms of international
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or
civilian one-party dictatorships.''
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov called the U.S. military
action ``absolutely unfounded'' and said it erodes the possibilities
of peace in the Middle East.
   ``Nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the United States,''
the Soviet permanent representative said. ``We cannot say the U.S.
is entitled to open fire on aircraft of another state simply because
those aircraft had come close to one another in internaional
airspace.''
   Belonogov also said the Soviet Union would withdraw its navy from
the Mediterranean if the United States does the same.
   The Soviet envoy said the U.S. claim of self-defense ``is
absolutely unfounded.''
   He said he United States has not proved that a Libyan chemical
plant is intended for the manufacture of chemical arms.
   ``We cannot agree that the United States should arrogate to
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it
does not like, like Libya. Whatever the pretext, the use of force is
contrary to international law,' he said.

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl complained Friday about how Washington and U.S. news media have
treated a U.S.-German dispute over what U.S. officials say is a
chemical arms plant in Libya.
   The flap over whether one or more West German companies helped
build the Libyan factory has driven another wedge into a widening
rift between Washington and Bonn. Relations between the steadfast
allies was tested last year by lethal crashes of NATO airplanes on
West Germany territory and U.S. insistence on continuing low-level
training flights there.
   In one of the sharpest public exchanges between the two countries
in recent years, West German politicians and news commentators
singled out the U.S. news media for their reports on the Libyan
plant dispute.
   The New York Times and U.S. News &amp; World Report last weekend
disclosed allegations that West German, Italian and Japanese
companies helped build the Libyan plant about 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli.
   Libya says it is used to make pharmaceuticals, but Washington
says it is a chemical weapons plant. President Reagan has said
military action against the plant is an option.
   Kohl stepped into the fray on Friday when his spokesman told a
news conference that the U.S. treatment of the affair, especially
the way the news media has handled it, had ``not been useful.''
   ``Chancellor Helmut Kohl has let Washington know this by the
appropriate means,'' spokesman Friedhelm Ost added. Ost declined to
disclose the contents of the message, which he characterized as
``urgent and friendly.''
   West German officials said Thursday they had found no evidence of
illegal exports by one company, Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr. They also
said there is no proof that the plant is designed to produce
chemical weapons.
   However, France, Canada and Egypt joined Friday in supporting
U.S. contentions about the plant.
   U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, have
sharply and publicly criticized Bonn for what they describe as
foot-dragging in checking into whether any West Germany companies
helped build the plant.
   But Ost on Friday repeated the West German government's claim
that Washington had failed to respond to Bonn's request for further
concrete information.
   ``The Federal Republic (West Germany) as a nation of laws cannot
operate on the basis of suppositions and suspicion,'' Ost said. ``I
don't want to make any speculation about the possible motivation for
the campaign by a section of the U.S. news media.''
   Kohl told Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to take up the
issue with Shultz at an international conference on chemical weapons
that begins Saturday in Paris, Ost said.
   West German newspapers on Friday carried reports on the growing
tensions between the two countries and the counterattack led by
Volker Ruehe, a top-ranking official in Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union.
   Late Thursday night, the ZDF television network, the nation's
second largest TV network, ran a lengthy news report on the
controversy. Moderator Peter Voss said the harshest allegations were
published in The New York Times, which he described as a
``traditional defender of Jewish interests.''
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Frankfurt reported that
Ruehe suggested closing the Goethe Institute facilities in the
United States if the U.S. news media persist in their ``campaign ''
against West Germany. The Goethe Institute, with offices worldwide,
offers German language instruction and cultural programs.
   ``It was correct to sound the alarm,'' Ruehe told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview Friday. He singled out for special
criticism a New York Times column, which he said had characterized
the affair as West German aid helping Libya to build an
``Auschwitz-in-the sand.''
   The Auschwitz concentration camp, with its gas chambers, was one
of the most notorious death camps of Nazi Germany. From 1940-45,
about 4 million people, mostly Jews, died there.

   President Reagan, saying he felt fine, entered
Walter Reed Army Hospital on Friday to prepare for surgery early
Saturday morning to correct a curvature of his left ring finger.
   The president, accompanied by his wife Nancy, waved to reporters
as he entered the emergency room of the military hospital. Asked how
he felt, the president called out, ``Fine.''
   Due to heavy cloud cover, the president went to the hospital by
motorcade, rather than by helicopter.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the operation is
scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST and doctors expect the president to be
``up and around ... following the operation.''
   The presidential physician, Col. John Hutton, has said Reagan's
arm would be numbed for the two- to three-hour procedure and he did
not expect general anesthesia to be used.
   Reagan will remain at the hospital until Sunday as a
precautionary measure, Fitzwater said, to ``be sure everything goes
well.''
   The surgery, designed to alleviate an ailment known as
Dupuytren's contracture, is considered to be routine and often
doesn't require an overnight stay in the hospital.
   The affliction causes the progressive, and usually painless,
contraction of the fingers and occurs due to a thickening of the
tissue called fascia in the palm of the hand.
   The contracture was minimal when Reagan took office in 1981 but
has progressed enough during the past year to require surgical
treatment, Hutton said.
   Fitzwater said he expected the president to wear ``some kind of
bandage'' afterward, but that the president was expected to be back
to work Monday.
   ``He has a full schedule for next week,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president is to leave office Jan. 20, but the spokesman said
Reagan chose to go ahead with the surgery while still in Washington
because he preferred to make use of the ``experts in this kind of
surgery'' at the military hospital.
   ``He wanted to have it done at Walter Reed. ... After he leaves
office, of course, he's going to California,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman added that Reagan has been putting off the
procedure for some time, even though his doctors had been suggesting
it be done for several months.
   Hutton said the physicians involved, besides himself, would be
Dr. George Bogumill of Georgetown University, a consultant at Walter
Reed; Col. Alan Smith and Maj. Paul Perlik of the Hand Service at
Walter Reed.
   The anesthesiologist will be Lt. Col Charles Gandy. Lt. Col.
Lawrence Mohr of the White House medical unit and members of the
Department of Medicine at Walter Reed will take part as consultants,
Hutton said.

   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday, the government's chief spokesman announced. He was 87.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenzo Obuchi said the emperor died at
6:33 a.m. (4:03 a.m. EST Friday).
   The frail monarch had been in deteriorating health since Sept.
19, when he vomited blood, and had received numerous blood
transfusions since then to counteract internal hemorrhaging.
   The palace said the emperor died of intestinal cancer.
   Kyodo News Service said Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's
oldest son, immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   It said Akihito was taking over three sacred imperial treasures
that symbolize the throne and have been handed down through
generations of emperors.

   Nearly 44 years after he disappeared on a
remote island in Alaska's Aleutian chain, the remains of Cpl. Carl
``Bud'' Houston were returned Friday to a final resting place in
Wisconsin.
   About two dozen relatives and friends attended a brief, private
funeral service for Houston, whose remains were found last summer by
biologists studying geese on the island.
   ``Uncle Bud is finally home and I look forward to meeting him
some day in the hereafter,'' said Jay Gitchel, who was four months
old when his 21-year-old uncle disappeared.
   Although he never met his uncle, Gitchel said older relatives in
the family spoke so fondly of Houston that Gitchel named his son
after him.
   Houston, who grew up in Manitowoc in eastern Wisconsin,
disappeared March 3, 1945, while hiking on Buldir Island, where he
was one of five volunteers assigned to operate a weather station.
   For years, Army officials and the family believed Houston was
caught in a landslide on the coast of the snowy, rugged island. His
body was never found, despite ground and aerial searches by his four
fellow team members.
   Jacqueline Gitchel, Houston's sister and closest surviving family
member, said relatives never thought his body would be found because
it was assumed to be buried.
   But Mrs. Gitchel was surprised to learn last summer that a U.S.
Fish and Wildlife team found a WWII vintage M-1 rifle and skeletal
remains further inland on the 4,250-acre island.
   The remains were found by a woman looking for a stone to pound
tent pegs, Mrs. Gitchel said.
   After an investigation by the Army, military officials confirmed
the remains were Houston's, Mrs. Gitchel said.
   Mrs. Gitchel said she hoped Friday's service at a mausoleum at
the Restlawn Memorial Park in north-central Wisconsin was the final
chapter in her brother's story.
   Mrs. Gitchel, 69, remembered her younger brother as a young man
who liked to hunt and fish. He had worked at a number of jobs, taken
classes at a University of Wisconsin extension and worked at a
Manitowoc shipyard before enlisting in 1942.
   In the Army, he received arctic survival training and was
assigned in 1944 to a weather observation squadron in the Aleutian
islands. Once he volunteered for duty on the remote island, the
family heard little from him because mail was picked up only about
twice a year, Mrs. Gitchel said.
   Mrs. Gitchel said she believes her mother once thought Houston
may have been captued by the Japanese.
   ``I think she was sorry she didn't have a grave to take care
of,'' Mrs. Gitchel said.
   Before he died in 1980, Houston's father talked about going to
see the island where his son died and wrote to shipping companies
asking about passage without luck, Gitchel said.
   ``The father made a real strong effort to get to Buldir. I don't
think he realized how remote it is,'' he said.

   A probe of the worst coal mine cave-in
accident in 2{ years began Friday with a federal official saying
that one survivor saw the accident coming but was too late to save
the three miners who were killed.
   ``He tried to warn the others, but the fall came too quick,''
U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration spokesman Joey Lucas said
Thursday of Roger Wilder, 37, of Cubbage.
   Wilder, who was operating machinery with an overhead canopy and
was not harmed in the accident Wednesday, saw the overhead dipping
and tried to alert the others when the roof caved in.
   Wilder was trapped for about 20 minutes until other miners
cleared fallen rock and shored up the roof, Lucas said. The cave-in
occurred as the men were removing coal about 2,400 feet into the
mine.
   The accident was at Cumberland Valley Contractors Co. Inc.'s No.
2 Mine. The company was formed in late 1986 by Stanley Ditty, David
Howard, Robert Roane and Gerald Burleson, according to Clyde Goins,
their former employer.
   All four ``were well-trained in safe coal mining, and I'd be
surprised to find out if they were doing it any differently,'' Goins
said.
   The new company has a ``somewhat average'' federal mine-safety
record, Lucas said.
   MSHA records show that the No. 2 Mine had five serious and
significant violations in 1987 and four last year. All the most
serious violations MSHA inspectors cited at the mine were corrected.
   During the last MSHA inspection, completed Dec. 15, only one
violation was cited, a non-serious one involving storage of
compressed-gas cylinders, according to records.
   Federal inspectors have cited the mine for safety violations 24
times, but only one, on May 14, 1987, involved roof support.
   ``It has absolutely nothing to do with the accident there this
week,'' said Lucas, who characterized the 1987 violation as ``more
of a paper-work violation.''
   State Mines and Minerals Commissioner Willard Stanley said
Thursday that the state and federal investigations would begin
Friday and a spokesman in his office confirmed they had begun.
   ``We've had no problems with getting anything corrected that
needed to be corrected,'' at the mine, Stanley said.
   The last coal mine accident in which three people were killed was
July 9, 1986, according to Kathy Snyder, a spokeswoman for U.S. Mine
Safety and Health Administration in Arlington, Va.

   WASHINGTON _ Here is the text of President Reagan's statement,
issued by the White House, following the death of Emperor Hirohito:
   ``Mrs. Reagan and I have just been informed that His Imperial
Majesty, Emperor Hirohito, died earlier today. On behalf of the
people and government of the United States, we extend our deepest
condolences to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, to the Imperial
family, and to the people of Japan.
   ``His Majesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous,
and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind
_ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war,
astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and
social changes throughout the world.
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end and leading the Japanese people through a period
of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the
prosperity the Japanese know today and in the close relations our
two nations and peoples now enjoy.
   ``The late Emperor visited the United States in 1975. Nancy and I
enjoyed our several meetings with him, most recently in Tokyo in
1986. We had the pleasure of entertaining their Imperial Majesties,
the former Crown Prince and Princess at the White House in 1987.
   ``While we mourn the passing of His Majesty, we shall long
remember him for his contributions which strengthened the United
States-Japan relationship and set a future course of continued close
and friendly relations.''

<TEXT>
   From commoner to royal consort, Michiko, who becomes
Japan's new empress, has accepted a life in the public spotlight and
devotion to the imperial family.
   Michiko, 54, is a onetime college valedictorian and the daughter
of a wealthy but non-royal flour miller. She fired the imagination
of millions and set imperial precedent when Crown Prince Akihito
handpicked her to be his wife.
   Their storybook romance is enough to rival the courtship of
Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   ``A girl who has both parents living, is good-looking, not too
tall, but slender, able to make witty remarks, a sports and music
lover, and capable of playing hostess at receptions,'' are the
qualities Akihito is said to have specifically sought in his future
wife.
   ``The girl I marry need not be of imperial or noble blood. ...
You may not be concerned about such things, but if a selection is
made from a limited field, I feel the result will take me away
further from the people,'' he reportedly told a friend.
   Michiko was born Oct. 20, 1934, and graduated from the exclusive
Sacred Heart University with a degree in English literature. She is
a fluent English-speaker, an avid tennis player and an accomplished
harpist and pianist.
   They met for the first time on a tennis court in 1957, but it was
not until 15 months and many phone calls later _ imperial protocol
prohibits dating _ that they were wed in a simple Shinto ceremony.
   Michiko and her family initially refused Akihito's proposal made
through his chamberlains. She was packed off to Europe and the
United States to attend a college alumni conference in Brussels
before returning to Tokyo.
   ``I have just spent in my recent world tour all the money my
parents had prepared for my trousseau. Your Highness, can you
consider marrying a girl with no belongings except one suitcase?''
she is said to have asked of Akihito during one of their phone
conversations after her return.
   He fired back: ``Why, certainly, yes, ma'am, I do consider
marrying you even if your possessions amount to just one suitcase.''
   Michiko finally relented, ``not because he is a prince, but
because his sincerity won me over. I do love him,'' she said.
   Akihito's choice ended a six-year hunt by the imperial
chamberlains searching for the perfect wife for their prince.
   Their marriage on April 10, 1959, when he was 25 and she was 24,
was celebrated with much fanfare. Nearly half a million people
gathered to cheer their horse-drawn cavalcade while thousands more
bought their first television sets to watch the ceremonies.
   The government announced an amnesty for some 210,000 people
charged with minor crimes and one newspaper even came out with
flower-scented editions to celebrate the occasion.
   Michiko and Akihito have often travled abroad, representing the
emperor and empress to promote international friendship and good
will. She also attends state functions and is honorary
vice-president of the Japanese Red Cross.
   In March 1986 she underwent surgery to remove a tumor in her
uterus after suffering from anemia. The nature of the tumor was not
made public, but Michiko has resumed an active life, accompanying
Akihito on a state visit to the United States in October 1987.
   On that tour she made a point of seeing Louisa May Alcott House
in Concord, New Hampshire, because the 19th-century author's
``Little Women'' is popular in Japan, and she knew TV coverage of
her visit would show Japanese schoolchildren what the Alcott house
was like.
   In Tokyo, Michiko's life has centered around the crown prince's
Togu Palace near the moated imperial compound.
   ``I have held and will continue to hold important the words of my
father when I left home _ that I should live my life at one heart
with the emperor and crown prince,'' Michiko is reported to have
said.
   In another break from royal tradition, Michiko and Akihito raised
their two sons and one daughter on their own instead of handing them
over to chamberlains and nurses, as Akihito's parents did when he
was 3.
   Michiko always ``sets high value on tenderness in her daily
life,'' Akihito once commented.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog farmers have continued to expand production
but may be easing back a little on expansion plans in the first half
of this year, an Agriculture Department report said Friday.
   As of Dec. 1, the beginning of the new hog marketing year, the
U.S. inventory of hogs and pigs totaled an estimated 55.3 million
head, up 1 percent from a year earlier and 9 percent more than on
Dec. 1, 1986, the report said.
   The breeding inventory was put at 7.04 million head, down 2
percent from a year earlier but still 6 percent more than two years
ago. Market hogs, at 48.3 million head, were up 2 percent and 9
percent, respectively.
   Last year's pig crop was 92.6 million head, up 5 percent from
1987 and 12 percent more than in 1986.
   In the 10 largest states, which account for 78 percent of the
U.S. inventory, the pig crop last September, October and November
was 17.2 million head, down 2 percent from the same period in 1987.
   Looking at future prospects, the report said hog farmers say they
intend to have 5.91 million sows farrow during the first half of the
1989 marketing year, December through May, down 2 percent from
actual births during the same period last year.
   The following list shows the Dec. 1 inventory. The first number,
in thousands, is the total number of hogs in the state, the second
is the Dec. 1 figure's percentage of a year earlier.

   Cambodian President Heng Samrin said
Friday that Vietnam will withdraw the 50,000 troops it says are
still in Cambodia by September if a political settlement is reached
to end the war.
   Heng Samrin echoed previous promises by Vietnam, which said it
would remove its troops earlier than its 1990 target date if
disagreements are resolved through negotiations.
   Unlike Heng Samrin, Vietnam previously has not named a month for
such a withdrawal.
   Resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk was quoted as saying,
however, that Vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are insincere and
that Cambodia's future can be settled only by continued fighting.
   Heng Samrin made the pullout offer in a speech in Cambodia's
capital of Phnom Penh to mark his government's first decade in
power. Vietnam installed the government on Jan. 7, 1979, two weeks
after a full-scale invasion of Cambodia.
   In the speech, broadcast by the official Phnom Penh radio and
monitored in Bangkok, he accused the guerrilla opposition of
prolonging the peace negotiations by making the ``unreasonable''
demand that the Phnom Penh government be dismantled before a general
election is held.
   Heng Samrin repeated that his government wanted a settlement on
the basis of a Vietnamese withdrawal along with measures to prevent
the former fanatical Khmer Rouge regime from retaking power.
   He said that ``to contribute to achieving this solution,''
Vietnam and his government ``have agreed if there is a political
solution, all Vietnamese troops will be withdrawn from Cambodia no
later than September 1989. All the points above should be
implemented with effective international control.''
   Vietnam says it has made annual partial withdrawals of its troops
since 1982. It says the largest came in 1988, when the Vietnamese
military high command, all advisers, and 50,000 soldiers returned
home. Vietnam says the remaining 50,000 troops will be repatriated
by 1990, whether there is a political solution or not.
   The guerrillas' demand that the Heng Samrin government be
dismantled has been one of the major barriers in the peace talks.
   The major peace forums have been meetings in France between
Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen and Sihanouk, and multilateral
talks, the second round of which are scheduled in Indonesia next
month.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said Sihanouk on Jan. 1 sent a note to
countries backing the resistance, telling them that the Vietnamese
troop pullout ``is not real and not unconditional.'' The radio
broadcast occurred Thursday and a text of it was seen in Bangkok
today.
   In the note, Sihanouk said the supposed pullouts were mere
rotations and about 120,000 Vietnamese soldiers remained in
Cambodia, 20,000 of them in the Cambodian army. Also, 40,000 troops
in the the Cambodian army are Vietnamese naturalized as Cambodians,
he said. In addition, nearly 1 million Vietnamese colonizers were
sent to Cambodia from 1978 to 1988, he claimed.
   The radio said Sihanouk ``further said that this issue can be
solved one way only, and that is through the efforts and sacrifices
on the battlefield in Cambodia by Cambodian resistance forces which
are intensifying their activities against the Vietnamese
aggressors.''

   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters exhibited
blurred photographs to the Security Council on Friday showing what
he called a heavily armed Libyan MiG-23 and said U.S. jets shot down
that plane and a companion MiG-23 in self-defense.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali Sunni Muntasser called the photographs
doctored and said, ``It is completely fake. It is untrue.''
   Walters later asked reporters: ``Do you think this is a bouquet
of roses hanging under the wing?''
   ``We have photographs which prove that the planes were armed,''
he said.
   Walters passed two photographs around the council chamber, where
Libya has sought an emergency session to condemn the U.S. downing of
its two aircraft on Wednesday. Libya says they were unarmed planes
on a reconnaissance mission over international waters of the
Mediterranean Sea.
   The two enlarged photographs show two views of one of the two
MiGs, the U.S. Mission said. They are labeled ``Libyan MiG-23
Flogger.'' One shows a full view of an aircraft with what the United
States said are two Apex and two Aphid missiles. The other shows a
portion of an aircraft in the lower right corner.
   ``The missile parts show quite clearly,'' Walters said of the
photos, taken from a videotape. ``There were two different types of
missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts ofthe
fuselage.''
   ``We have photographs that show the planes were armed,'' Walters
said. ``You can see for yourself whether there were or were not
missiles.''
   He said the photos were taken by one of the U.S. F-14 Tomcats
that shot down the Libyan aircraft. The black-and-white photographs
were enlarged to about 16 inches by 20 inches and showed blurred
objects under the wing.
   ``Routine operations over international waters ... were
aggressively and hostilely challenged by the Libyan air force,''
Walters said.
   The session, which began Thursday, was expected to discuss a
resolution condemning the U.S. action. Delegates adjourned Friday
evening until 10:30 a.m. Monday. The United States and Britain were
expected to veto any such resolution in any event.
   ``The recordings of the pilots' conversations and the photographs
make it all he more clear that the United States acted in
self-defense,'' Walters said.
   Muntasser at first shunned the photographs and brushed them aside
as they were passed around the council for examination. But he later
said he had examined them and rejected them.
   ``We are in the country of Hollywood,'' he told reporters. ``It
is very well-edited, very well done and it is not true.'' He quoted
The New York Times, which described the videotape as blurred and
indistinct.
   He said the United States could have photographed MiGs in Vietnam
and used other film.
   Muntasser said the Libyan aircraft were not challenging and
threatening the U.S. jets. ``The Americans are provoking us. They
want us to retaliate and then they will attack Libya. That is the
whole reason,'' he said.
   Walters likened the evasive actions of the U.S. pilots to that of
a citizen trying to avoid a mugger: ``If you are walking down a dark
alley and see a man with a pistol walking behind you, you cross the
street and he crosses the street, you recross and he recrosses, you
do it five times and he follows you, you have to wonder if he's
going to hand you a bouquet of flowers. ... That's naive.''
   Walters spoke after representatives of 10 nations, including the
Soviet Union and Nicaragua, condemned the U.S. military action.
   Walters, who spoke sharply and in clear, controlled anger,
rebuked the earlier speakers who criticized the United States.
   ``The United States is not really disposed to receive lessons on
terrorism from a nation like Sandinista Nicaragua,'' he stold the
council. ``Nor is it ready to be taught the norms of international
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or
civilian one-party dictatorships.''
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov called the U.S. military
action ``absolutely unfounded'' and said it erodes the possibilities
of peace in the Middle East.
   ``Nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the United States,''
the Soviet permanent representative said. ``We cannot say the U.S.
is entitled to open fire on aircraft of another state simply because
those aircraft had come close to one another in internaional
airspace.''
   Belonogov also said the Soviet Union would withdraw its navy from
the Mediterranean if the United States does the same.
   The Soviet envoy said the U.S. claim of self-defense ``is
absolutely unfounded.''
   He said he United States has not proved that a Libyan chemical
plant is intended for the manufacture of chemical arms.
   ``We cannot agree that the United States should arrogate to
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it
does not like, like Libya. Whatever the pretext, the use of force is
contrary to international law,' he said.

   Hungary will resume diplomatic ties with
Israel within four months, a state news agency reported on Friday.
   Hungary would be the first East European nation to resume full
ties with Israel since all Soviet bloc nations except Romania broke
off relations over the Middle East War in 1967.
   The news agency MTI, in a report from Tel Aviv, quoted
unidentified sources close to the Israeli Foreign Ministry as saying
Israel and Hungary will establish full ties within four months.
   Hungarian Agriculture Minister Jeno Vancsa is visiting Israel. He
met Thursday with Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir and handed over
messages from Communist party leader Karoly Grosz and Premier Miklos
Nemeth, Hungarian media said.
   Hungary's increasingly close ties to Israel were believed to be
behind a New Year's Eve terrorist threat to blow up a plane of the
Scandinavian airline SAS. The threat was telephoned to Budapest
police, prompting a Europe-wide terrorist alert on SAS flights.
   State radio said Friday that unidentified Palestinian terrorists
had threatened to attack John's Hospital, Budapest's oldest
hospital. It said the threat came in a phone call to the hospital,
but gave no details.
   Hungarian reporters for the daily Magyar Nemzet newspaper said
hospital administrator Gyoergy Toeroek told them the hospital had
been sealed off since late Thursday as a precaution.

   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday of intestinal cancer. He was 87.
   The government's chief spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenzo
Obuchi, said the emperor died at 6:33 a.m. (4:33 p.m. EST Friday).
   Shoichi Fujimori, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency,
told a nationally televised news conference that Hirohito died of
cancer of the upper duodenum.
   The frail monarch, who urged his country to surrender after the
atomic bombing of Japan by the United States in the closing days of
the war, had undergone intestinal bypass surgery in September 1987.
At the time, his doctors said a growth blocking his intestine was
not cancerous.
   On Sept. 19, 1988, the emperor vomited blood and remained in
serious condition after that with internal bleeding, but until the
death announcement, the household agency refused to confirm local
news reports he was suffering from cancer. Japanese custom is not to
let cancer patients know they have the disease.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's eldest son, immediately
ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne. At a ceremony scheduled for 10
a.m., he was to take over three sacred imperial treasures that
symbolize the throne and have been handed down through generations
of emperors.
   Two rising-sun flags on the Imperial Palace were lowered to
half-staff, the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges suspended their
usual half-day's trading Saturday and Japan headed into a mourning
period that followed much quiet preparation as the emperor lingered
on his deathbed for 3{ months.
   The government said Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno would continue
his trip to Europe, where he is attending a conference on chemical
weapons in Paris. In September, Uno canceled a trip to Washington
and the United Nations because of Hirohito's illness.
   The association governing sumo wrestling, the unique Japanese
sport that was one of Hirohito's favorite diversions, said it would
postpone until Monday a tournament scheduled to start Sunday.
   The palace set up a place where people could sign a condolence
register, and a trickle of people started to arrive before 9 a.m.
   Cabinet members, wearing morning coats, assembled to decide a
name for the new emperor's reign.
   Hirohito's reign was known as Showa, and year Showa 64 on the
Japanese calendar had begun on Jan. 1.
   Akihito, his wife Crown Princess Michiko, 54, and other members
of the imperial family had arrived at the palace at 5:40 a.m., soon
after chief court physician Akira Takagi rushed in to attend
Hirohito.
   The world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. _ passed
automatically to Akihito.
   The regalia he was to receive, consisting of a sword, jewels and
a mirror, were said in legend to have been handed down from the sun
goddess, the imperial family's mythic ancestor.
   Hirohito's funeral, likely to be held in about six weeks, will be
a massive event to mark the figurative and literal turning of an
era, since years in Japan are numbered from the start of his reign
in 1926.
   Akihito's formal coronation will take place in about two years if
his father's pattern is followed. But the pattern is so old _
Hirohito reigned for 62 years and 13 days _ and Japan is so
different now that precedent may not be followed.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government will be under
pressure to handle the passage correctly, to honor Hirohito properly
without giving too much rein to those who want to restore the
pre-war imperial aura of divinity.
   Hirohito's reign covered almost half the turbulent times of
forced modernization, repeated warfare and a vigorous rise from the
radioactive ashes of World War II that together have made Japan a
formidable world force since it was pried out of its island
isolation in the 1850s.

<HEAD>State Department Confident West Germany Taking Assertions Seriously</HEAD>

   The State Department expressed confidence
Friday that West Germany is taking seriously and fully investigating
American assertions that West German firms have helped Libya build a
chemical weapons production plant.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley repeated the U.S.
declaration that the plant represents a ``serious danger.''
   She said: ``We and other governments are seeking to deny Libya
the foreign assistance we believe is essential for full development
of this capability.''
   Mrs. Oakley said that the U.S. information on the role of foreign
companies in assisting the Libyan chemical weapons effort is
conclusive.
   ``With regard to West Germany, we are confident that it is taking
the information we have provided very seriously and is investigating
fully,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``It has in the past year vigorously
pursued and prosecuted such cases.''
   ``With regard to the Libyan CW program, we understand that the
appropriate West German authorities are still conducting their
investigations,'' she said.
   ``As with other countries with which we have talked regarding
this problem, this is an ongoing matter. West Germany has also
announced that it is reviewing its export control laws. We
understand an interim report on this subject will be presented to
the cabinet soon.''
   The comment came in the wake of news reports quoting unnamed U.S
officials as complaining that West Germany was not moving fast
enough to respond to the American appeal for cutting off technical
assistance and critical material which might help Libya go into
actual production of chemical weapons.
   Mrs. Oakley was asked about a West German statement that the
United States was running an ``unhelpful'' media campaign to put
pressure on the Bonn government.
   ``I don't have any comment on that,'' she replied. ``I think that
I have addressed it, that we have full and close cooperation with
the government of West Germany, and we fully expect that to
continue.''
   She was asked whether her statement on behalf of the State
Department had been requested by Bonn to ``clear West Germany's
name'' and to end complaints of ``West Germany bashing.''
   ``That would not be accurate at all,'' Mrs. Oakley replied. ``I
don't think we're in any position of bashing any country. We're
working closely with the West German government, other interested
governments on this issue. We'll continue to bring to their
attention relevant information that assists in their ongoing
investigations.''
   ``It's our understanding that the West German investigation is
not yet complete, that they're continuing to investigate, and we
remain in touch with them on the matter,'' she said.
   President Reagan, interviewed Friday on CBS television, defended
Wednesday's action by U.S. warplanes in shooting down two Libyan
MiGs over the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``That was self-defense, and now it's proven by film of the
planes in the air, that their planes were not disarmed,'' Reagan
said. `` Their planes were carrying weapons, missiles and so forth,
and they were the ones that when our pilots changed the direction,
altitude and so forth, they followed every time ... finally, it is
so apparent that you don't wait for them to push the button because
then you die.''

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias backed by
Syria and Iran battled with artillery and rockets in west Beirut and
south Lebanon on Friday, ignoring a plea by Iran's president to stop
fighting.
   Police said four people were wounded in midday clashes that
pitted the pro-Syrian Amal militia against Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
   After dark, fighting spilled into residential districts in
Syrian-controlled west Beirut, breaking a 5-week-old truce in those
areas.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed throughout the capital long
into the night.
   A police spokesman said combat with mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades centered in the old Jewish quarter of Wadi Abu Jmil, in
Azarieh and the former downtown commercial district near the Green
Line which divides Moslem west from Christian east Beirut.
   No immediate word on casualties emerged from west Beirut. It was
the first serious violence there since November, when 40 people were
killed and 87 wounded in Shiite militia street fighting.
   In south Lebanon, the two sides dueled with mortars, 106mm guns
and rocket-propelled grenades in Iklim el-Tiffah, a former
apple-growing district, a police spokesman said.
   The battle centered around Jbaa, Ein Bouswar, Jarjou and
Louwaizeh, which are mostly deserted villages on the edge of
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' north of its border with
Lebanon. The fighting dwindled into sniper fire and occasional
rocket blasts before sundown, said the police spokesman, who cannot
be identified under standing regulations.
   He said two of the wounded are Amal militiamen and another is a
Hezbollah fighter. The fourth casualty, a 21-year-old woman, was
wounded when a stray shell fell near her house in Jbaa.
   In Tehran, President Ali Khamenei of Iran said ``vengeance will
not solve anything in Lebanon,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   ``I address our Lebanese brothers in Amal and Hezbollah to end
the bloodshed,'' Khamenei was quoted as saying by the news agency,
monitored in Nicosia.
   ``If any of the two groups sees violations and attacks from the
other group, they should disregard it,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Khamenei accused the United States and Israel of instigating the
clashes between the militias, which are struggling for dominance of
the 1 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Friday's clashes shattered a two-day-old lull in the fighting
that began Dec. 31 in the slums of Beirut and in southern Lebanon.
   At least 29 people were killed and 76 wounded in five days of
fighting with artillery, mortars and automatic weapons before Syrian
troops stopped the violence in Beirut.
   Syria, which maintains an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, considers
the country its sphere of influence. There are no Syrian troops in
southern Lebanon.
   In May, the Syrians deployed 7,500 troops in Moslem-controlled
west Beirut and 4,500 soldiers in the slums of south Beirut to halt
a three-week bloodbath between Amal and Hezbollah that killed nearly
300 people and wounded 1,000.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
the U.S. downing of two Libyan jet fighters this week has ``poisoned
the atmosphere'' of an international conference on chemical weapons
that opens Saturday.
   He called the incident over the Mediterranean ``unacceptable''
upon arriving at Orly airport Friday.
   There has been speculation that the conference risks being
dominated by U.S. charges that Libya is building a chemical weapons
plant. Nations will strive at the five-day meeting, the largest such
gathering ever held, to revive the taboo on the proliferation of
chemical weapons.
   At least 141 nations are attending the conference, about 80 of
them led by their foreign ministers, according to French officials.
   Earlier Friday, France, Canada and Egypt joined Britain in
supporting U.S. contentions that Libya is developing poison gas in a
factory at Rabta, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, a senior U.S.
official said.
   Shevardnadze told reporters, ``It is very important that 1989
begin with a major event like the Paris conference.''
   Asked about the downing of two Libyan MiG-23s on Wednesday by two
U.S. F-14s, the Soviet minister said he felt the incident ``poisons
the atmosphere on the eve of the Paris conference.''
   Shevardnadze also said American accusations about a Libyan
chemical weapons plant were out of order.
   ``Without proof, no government has the right to present such
accusations,'' he said.
   However, the U.S. official reported added agreement among U.S.
allies that Libya under Col. Moammar Gadhafi now is developing
chemical weapons in its own factory.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in Paris for the
conference, has said he will try when he meets Shevardnadze on
Sunday to persuade the Soviets about the nature of the plant and ask
their help in closing it.
   The U.S. official, briefing reporters under rules that barred
disclosing his name, said foreign ministers Michel Rocard of France,
Joe Clark of Canada and Esmet Abdel-Meguid of Egypt all told Shultz
in separate meetings Friday they did not doubt the Libyan plant was
engaged in producing chemical weapons.
   Shultz said Thursday the plant had not yet actually produced
poison gas.
   President Francois Mitterrand, apparently trying to bring the
conference back to its original intent, told reporters Thursday
night that ``at the moment, there is no ban'' on producing chemical
weapons.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol bans only the use of chemical weapons.
   The conference aim is to reaffirm the Geneva Protocal and press
delegates now meeting in Geneva to resolve problems blocking
agreement on a universal accord that would forbid use, production
and stocking of chemical arms.
   ``Chemical weapons do not constitute weapons of dissuasion,''
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France wrote in Friday's edition of
the newspaper Le Monde. ``As we know, they do not stop war, just
underline its horrors.''
   Shultz said Thursday on the plane to Paris that the conference
``is a conscience-raising operation to get people to see the
seriousness of the problem of the use of chemical and biological
weapons.''
   The opening session is likely to be tense, with Shultz facing
Foreign Minister Jadallah Azzuz al-Talhi of Libya in the meeting
hall at the headquarters of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
   The United States has not ruled out a military strike against the
Rabta factory.
   U.S. officials say the downing of the Libyan jets fighters was in
self-defense and not linked to the chemical factory issue.
   The United States plans to appeal to industrialized nations to
deny chemical weapons technology and expertise to Libya and approve
economic sanctions to nations that use toxic arms, U.S. officials
have said.
   Shultz indicated to reporters the United States may be willing to
work out a deal with Libya that would not require destroying the
plant.
   Gadhafi insists pharmaceuticals were being manufactured at the
complex. But Shultz contends he has adequate evidence to support the
U.S. allegation.
   Capability to produce chemical weapons, which U.S. officials say
has spread to about 20 countries, will be a primary topic at the
conference.
   Britain said Wednesday night that an independent investigation
led to the conclusion that poison gas was under development at the
Libyan plant.
   Still, West Germany and a number of other countries, where firms
are suspected of assisting Libya, were skeptical.
   Shultz was expected to meet Saturday with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   In Moscow on Thursday, Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, deputy chief
of Soviet chemical weapons troops, gave his country's first
acknowledgement that Libya may be able to manufacture chemical
weapons, but he said such weapons would be in quantities too small
to wage war.

<HEAD>Noriega Answers Letter From Ousted President Delvalle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has
responded to a letter from ousted President Eric Delvalle that
proposed talks to solve Panama's current political crisis.
   Head of state Manuel Solis Palma told reporters Friday that
Noriega, Panama's de facto leader and the commander of the Defense
Forces, answered Delvalle's letter Thursday. Solis Palma refused to
reveal what Noriega wrote.
   It was the first official reponse to the letter Devalle sent
Noriega from Washington D.C. on Dec. 27. The letter, printed on
Panamanian Embassy stationary in Washington, was given to The
Associated Press by Noriega opponents on condition of anonymity.
   The letter was sent six days after Delvalle met with
President-elect George Bush and outgoing President Reagan.
   ``We can and should carry out a serious and expeditious
negotiation to establish preliminary base for the national
reconstruction and open the way for Panama's recovery,'' the letter
said.
   In February 1988, Delvalle tried to fire Noriega after he was
indicted by a federal grand jury on drug trafficking and money
laundering charges.
   The National Assembly then ousted Delvalle, replacing him with
Solis Palma, the education minister. The United States continues to
recognize Delvalle as Panama's president and has imposed economic
sanctions against the country in an attempt to force out Noriega.
   Delvalle said in his letter to Noriega that Panama's economic and
political crisis has created serious problems for its citizens
because the government no longer has the funds to provide basic
public services.
   Delvalle signed the letter ``president of the Republic of
Panama''.
   Raul Saint Malo, a counselor at the Panamaian Embassy in
Washington, told the AP in a telephone interview this week that the
letter was sent by way of the Vatican Embassy in Washington to the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   Diplomatic sources have said Delvalle has returned to Panama and
is in hiding.

   Bomb experts from Czechoslovakia will help Britain
determine whether a Czech-made plastic explosive blew up Pan Am
Flight 103, the Foreign Office said Friday.
   Yasser Arafat was quoted as telling a Saudi newspaper that his
Palestine Liberation Organization had ``plenty of important
information'' on the Dec. 21 bombing, which killed all 259 people
aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground.
   Also Friday, tighter security measures aimed primarily at U.S.
airlines went into effect at all British airports, including more
rigorous luggage searches.
   Part of Heathrow's Terminal 3 departure building was evacuated
for 20 minutes Friday while bomb squad officers checked an
unattended black plastic bag near the Air-India check-in desk. It
turned out to be harmless.
   In the Scottish town of Lockerbie, where parts of the wings and
fuselage fell, police said 20 more bodies were released to relatives
Friday, bringing the total released so far to 196.
   Searchers have recovered 242 bodies and are hunting for 28 others.
   A West German newspaper, Munich Abendzeitung, said British
aviation authorities believe the explosive that blew up the Boeing
747 was placed aboard the flight in London, rather than in
Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated.
   The report said investigators believe the bomb was attached to
the outside of the aircraft while it was at London's Heathrow
airport.
   West German government press spokesman Ulrich Strempel said: ``I
cannot confirm or deny such a report.''
   NBC News quoted U.S. government sources as saying British
investigators believe the bomb was in the front cargo hold of the
aircraft, indicating the bomb may have been in luggage that came
from Frankfurt or that someone in London slipped it in with
Frankfurt luggage.
   A British Department of Transport spokesman late Friday dismissed
the reports.
   ``We don't know what the bomb was made of. We don't know where
the bomb was placed in aircraft, nor indeed do we know ... at which
airport the bomb was placed on board,'' said the spokesman, whose
name cannot be used under standing regulations.
   Flight 103 began in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727, then changed
planes in London before departing for New York.
   Arafat was quoted by the newspaper Al-Madina as saying the PLO
was ``cooperating with a number of European states and the United
States in a joint international bid to expose the perpetrators.'' He
did not elaborate.
   Czechoslovakia has offered to send experts to join the forensic
investigation, and ``the British government are grateful for this
offer,'' the Foreign Office said. The Czechoslovak experts are
expected next week.
   Czechoslovakia is a major manufacturer of Semtex but has disputed
charges that it may have made the explosive that downed the jumbo
jet.
   In Prague, Czechoslovakia on Friday reiterated to British Embassy
charge John MacGregor that it ``unequivocally opposes all forms of
terrorism and has never supplied weapons, explosives or any other
material to any terrorist organization,'' the official news agency
CTK reported.
   Orange-colored Semtex can be detected only by extremely
sophisticated monitoring machines still undergoing tests in the
United States. Britain says it has asked Czechoslovakia five times
to make Semtex more easily detectable, and until now has received no
response.
   Anti-terrorism experts and U.S. State Department officials say
Syria and Libya have obtained Semtex from Czechoslovakia and passed
it on to terrorists. Transport Secretary Paul Channon announced
stepped-up security checks on cargo, mislaid luggage and cabin bags
following a crisis meeting Thursday of the National Aviation
Security Committee in London.
   News reports have said authorities are investigating, among
others, a Frankfurt-based Palestinian terrorist group affiliated
with Ahmed Jibril's hardline Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Jibril on Friday denied involvement. ``We are not involved. We
renounce and reject all such acts,'' he said on ABC News.

<HEAD>Winter Storms Dump Snow Across Much Of The North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter storm socked the mid-Atlantic region on Friday, dumping
up to 5 inches of snow, and a new storm blasted through the West,
creating blizzard conditions in Idaho, where gusty winds whipped
snow to cut visibility to zero.
   A low pressure system over the Ohio Valley was absorbing Atlantic
moisture, bringing snow from New York City to Philadelphia and
Washington, D.C., Friday afternoon.
   Winter storm warnings issued from southeast Pennsylvania through
northern New Jersey into Long Island, where inland areas could
receive 6 inches of snow.
   Snow was falling throughout New York City. Two inches of snow was
on the ground at La Guardia Airport Friday afternoon. In Washington,
D.C., up to 5 inches of snow fell.
   In Philadelphia, snow was heavy Friday afternoon, falling at a
rate of an inch an hour. Three inches of new snow hit Philadelphia
in the morning. Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, up to 4 inches were
reported at West Chester, Harrisburg and Lansdale.
   In New Jersey, up to 4{ inches of snow fell at Pitman, 3{ at
Verga, Marlton and Hammonton.
   The low pressure system over central Wyoming was developing into
a major winter storm.
   In southeast Idaho, blinding snow was reported as winds gusted to
47 mph at Pocatello. Snowfall ranged from 2 inches at Magic Valley,
to 3 to 5 inches across the southwest, and up to a foot in the
mountains.
   Utah's western valleys got up to 6 inches and as much as 18
inches fell in the Wasatch Mountains.
   In north central Monatana, 8 to 10 inches of snow were reported.
Up to 6 inches of snow fell across the valleys of the eastern slopes
and southwest Montana.
   Snow was widespread this afternoon from the northern Rockies
through the northern Plains into northern and central Minnesota.
Winter storm warnings were issued for the western half of North
Dakota.
   Wind advisories were issued for the mountain and desert areas of
Southern California. Wind gusts of 40 mph were forecast, making some
road travel dangerous.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
above zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 85 degrees at Laredo and McAllen,
Texas.
   Saturday's forecast called for a major winter storm from the
central Plains into the upper Great Lakes, producing widespread snow
and gusty winds from the upper Mississippi Valley into central
Nebraska; scattered snow across the northern Plateau and the
northern Rockies; widespread rain from northern lower Michigan into
southwest Iowa, changing to snow before evening; showers and
thunderstorms scattered from the Tennessee and middle Mississippi
Valley; rain scattered from the Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes into southern New England; snow scattered through northern New
England; and rain was spotty along the central Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast from 10 degrees below zero to 10
above from the northern Rockies into the northern Plains; in the
teens from the northern Plateau into northern Colorado into
northwest Minnesota, and across northern Maine; in the 40s and 50s
along the Pacific Coast into Southern California and southern
Arizona; from the 40s into the 60s from southern New Mexico and west
Texas into the lower Ohio Valley; in the 70s from southern and
eastern Texas to the southern Atlantic coast; with 80s across
southern Florida and extreme southern Texas; and in the 20s or 30s
throughout the rest of the nation.

   The government of President Virgilio
Barco opened peace talks Friday with leftist guerrillas, government
sources said.
   The talks come after Barco, a civilian president, announced Sept.
1 an offer of free political activity to rebels who give up their
weapons. A newspaper reported last month that the April 19th
Movement, known as M-19, intended to do so.
   Official sources said on condition of anonymity that presidential
adviser Rafael Pardo traveled Friday to a mountainous area of
southern Colombia to meet with M-19 leader Carlos Pizarro. They gave
no details.
   The government and the guerrillas reportedly made initial
contacts over the past few weeks.
   M-19 has carried out the most notorious guerrrilla attacks in
Colombia in recent years. They included the kidnapping of about 50
diplomats at the Dominican Republic Embassy in 1980 and the attack
on the Palace of Justice in 1985 in which 85 people were killed,
including 11 Supreme Court justices.
   But M-19 has been inactive for the last six months. It takes its
name from the date of a 1970 presidential election that dissidents
say was fraudulent. Another guerrilla group, the communist-leaning
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, announced a unilateral truce
with the government last month and asked Barco to open peace talks.
   The government says the revolutionary forces have repeatedly
violated the truce and that they attacked a cement factory and
killed four executives Thursday.
   An estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas operate in Colombia.

   Japan's Emperor Hirohito was a highly
respected and dedicated marine biologist whose contributions to his
field will be ``virtually immortal,'' other scientists said after
his death.
   ``The poor man didn't really get to do what he wanted to do. He
had to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal human
being,'' Robert Hessler, a professor of biological oceanography at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, said Friday.
   Hirohito died Saturday (Friday in U.S. time zones) of intestinal
cancer. He was 87.
   He was an expert on invertebrate marine animals, and a world
authority on hydrozoans, which are small creatures related to sea
anemones and corals and which look something like mossy plants, said
William ``Barnacle Bill'' Newman, another biological oceanographer
at Scripps.
   The emperor wrote or co-wrote at least 12 books on hydrozoans.
   Hessler said Hirohito was very competent in classifying marine
animals he collected during summers in Sagami Bay, south of Tokyo.
The emperor published his last book on hydrozoans, part of his
series of volumes on the sea animals of the bay, shortly before he
became ill, Newman said.
   ``The fauna of Sagami Bay is one of the best known in the world
because of his efforts,'' Newman said by phone from Scripps, which
is part of the University of California, San Diego.
   ``While it's not the kind of thing that ever makes the front
page, that kind of science is virtually immortal because the
descriptions that are made and the names assigned to these newly
described animals will last forever,'' Hessler said. ``People will
be consulting them centuries from now.''
   Hirohito spent hours, often working far into the night, in his
laboratory at the palace in Tokyo. Sometimes he collected specimens
at the royal summer home on the seashore south of Tokyo and gathered
fungi in the palace gardens.
   ``He was very dedicated in his interest,'' Hessler said. ``He was
no dilettante.''
   When Hirohito toured Scripps on Oct. 9, 1975, during his only
U.S. tour, he spent about an hour in the laboratory with Hessler and
Newman, although Hessler said they had expected to spend a full day
with him.
   ``Then all the administrators got into the business'' and
insisted on guiding the emperor on various tours, Hessler recalled.
   ``We entertained him for about an hour in the lab, where he
studied hydrozoans and other things,'' Newman recalled. ``He was
very down to earth. ... He was very impressed and would `ooh' and
`aah' when we showed him something very exciting and new. They had
to drag him away when his time was over.''

   Prepared by the emperor's extended illness, Japanese
people reacted calmly to Hirohito's death Saturday, and many
businesses and shops remained open.
   Thousands of people began lining up at the Imperial Palace in
central Tokyo after the emperor's death was announced early Saturday
to sign registries expressing their condolences.
   ``Of course it's a shock. I had hoped that the emperor would live
as long as possible,'' said Masakichi Koizumi, 69, one of those in
line. ``But it was inevitable.''
   Television newscasters changed into dark clothing as an
expression of mourning, and all stations were expected to cancel
advertisements and regular programming for at least a day.
   Stock exchanges canceled their regular half-day Saturday sessions
and some factories shut production lines, but banks announced they
would remain open. Department stores and chain stores also said they
would keep regular hours.
   Subways and trains remained crowded with commuters and shoppers,
but some offices decided to close at midmorning.
   Tokyo Disneyland said it would remain open, but would reduce the
volume of music by 50 percent.
   The Japan Sumo Association said the 15-day sumo wrestling
tournament scheduled to begin Sunday would be postponed by one day,
and the horseracing association said races would be canceled for two
days.
   Government officials called for six days of national mourning and
announced the cancellation of government-sponsored festive events,
but said Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno would not return immediately
from a trip to Europe, where he is attending a conference on the
elimination of chemical weapons.
   After the emperor fell gravely ill on Sept. 19, Uno canceled a
trip to Washington and the United Nations.
   At that time, Japan was hit by massive cancellations of concerts,
festivals, weddings, diplomatic visits and other events as part of a
wave of ``jishuku,'' or ``self-restraint.'' People and government
officials initially were unsure how to react.
   ``The sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has
left me grief-stricken,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a
statement Saturday. ``Our sincere prayers for his recovery were in
vain, and I am at a loss for words.''
   Despite continuing controversy over the emperor's role during
World War II, when he was officially commander in chief of the
nation's armed forces, Takeshita said Hirohito ``ardently wished for
world peace and the well-being of the people, and devoted himself to
these ideals in his daily life.''
   Hirohito's fifth daughter, Takako Shimazu, said her father had
``battled gallantly'' against his illness. ``I hope he now will be
able to rest peacefully,'' she said.
   ``He lived for as long as he could,'' said Shizue Otsuki, 69, a
shopkeeper. ``I cried as soon as I heard he had passed away.''

   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday of intestinal cancer. He was 87.
   Hirohito was born April 29, 1901, first son of Crown Prince
Yoshihito, who became the Emperor Taisho in 1912 upon the death of
the Meiji emperor. Hirohito, called Prince Michi as a boy, was taken
from his parents and raised by nurses and chamberlains to become
emperor.
   Hirohito's reign covered almost half the turbulent times of
forced modernization, repeated warfare and a vigorous rise from the
radioactive ashes of World War II that together have made Japan a
formidable world force since it was pried out of its island
isolation in the 1850s.
   With no direct political power, Hirohito is known to have made
only one major decision of state: to tell his generals and
ministers, who were deadlocked on the Allies' surrender demand even
as Japan reeled from two atomic bombs, that the people had suffered
enough.
   Hirohito in 1972 surpassed the record for a long-reigning
Japanese emperor set by his grandfather, the Meiji emperor, whose
tenure was 45 years.
   In 1982 Hirohito became the oldest living monarch in the world
when King Sobhuza of Swaziland died at age 83.

   The nation's fifth recipient of an abdominal
transplant of multiple organs died Friday, and experts said her
swift decline shows that the procedure for replacing the digestive
system is still in its infancy.
   Three-year-old Rolandrea Dodge was with her parents, Brandon and
Cyndi Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., when she died of multiple organ
failure at 4:45 p.m. at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The little girl was attached to a respirator and had been in very
critical condition. ``She really was a tremendous fighter,'' said
Lynn McMahon, a hospital spokeswoman. ``Her system just eventually
shut down.''
   Rolandrea, better known as Rolly, received a new liver, pancreas,
stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine Nov. 29. Her
name was placed back on the transplant waiting list Wednesday night.
   All five transplanted organs were rejected by the girl's natural
immune system, Ms. McMahon said. Because the procedure has been
performed so few times, doctors are not sure why the transplant
failed.
   Dr. Marc Rowe, the hospital's chief of pediatric surgery, said
tests showed on New Year's Eve that Rolly's small intestine was
being rejected by her body's immune system. It's not immediately
known whether any of the other four transplanted organs were
rejected or, if so, to what degree, he said.
   ``We're in areas that are essentially uncharted,'' he said.
``What we're doing is making tentative steps and then very carefully
analyzing where we've been and what we've learned before we make any
decision about the next one, when we'll do one or whether we'll do
one.''
   The deaths of the first four patients and Rolandrea's decline
were ``very disappointing,'' said Dr. James W. Williams, director of
transplantation at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago, in an interview before Rolandrea's death.
   ``But this is what happened in the early days of liver
transplantation,'' he added.
   ``Every organ that's been transplanted has had its early
problems. There are hurdles that you have to go over and along the
way you have to learn from everything that's been done in order for
things to progress,'' agreed Dr. Tony D'Alessandro, a transplant
fellow at the University of Wisconsin.
   ``The surgeons who are working with this case are, at this point,
feeling defeated,'' Ms. McMahon said earlier Friday. ``However,
that's not to say they would abandon the concept of multiple organ
transplants.''
   Rolandrea was born with intractable secretory diarrhea, a
disorder that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and
liquids. She spent virtually all of her short life in hospitals.
   Earlier Friday, Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh described Rolly's chances of survival as slim. Starzl
pioneered liver transplants and performed the nation's first
multiple abdominal organ transplant in 1983. That first patient, a
6-year-old girl, lived only a few hours.
   The nation's latest such patient, Calvin Oliveira, 14 months, of
Deerfield Beach, Fla., was doing well Friday despite a seizure
earlier in the week and a bout of pneumonia, D'Alessandro said. The
boy received a small intestine and liver Dec. 31 at the University
of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, questions the legitimacy of the
procedure.
   ``Even if it worked well and people were living with a good
quality of life, I'm still not sure there are enough potential
donors,'' Caplan said. ``It's very rare to have someone with five
good organs.
   ``I'm also not sure society is going to view giving them all to a
single person is the best thing to do. I don't. I think if you can
spread the organs to more people, that is what should be done. The
ethical principle should be to save the most lives.''
   Intestines are particularly difficult to transplant, according to
D'Alessandro, because of the extremely technical nature of the
surgery, the lack of biological markers indicating organ rejection,
and the bowel's ability, unique among organs, to counterattack the
patient's immune system.
   Williams has performed such operations on two children. One died
three days after surgery. The other survived 3{ months.
   He is seeking a third transplant candidate with short gut
syndrome, a potentially fatal intestinal deformity, and whose liver
is failing as a result of intravenous feedings. Those were the
problems experienced by the world's longest survivor of a
multi-organ abdominal transplant, Tabatha Foster, 3{, of
Madisonville, Ky.
   Tabatha died last May, six months after receiving five organs at
Children's Hospital.
   ``This is an awful, devastating, hopeless condition in these
children and the truth is there isn't any treatment for them,''
other than transplantation, Williams said.

<HEAD>Arias Says Summit Should Be Postponed To Give Bush Time To Formulate
Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias on Friday said
the Jan. 15 summit of Central American nations should be postponed
until February to give President-elect George Bush time to develop a
policy for the region.
   But officials from some of the participating countries said they
still planned to attend the two-day gathering in El Salvador.
   Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for spearheading a regional
peace plan, called on his counterparts in Honduras, Guatemala,
Nicaragua and El Salvador to delay their meeting.
   He added that it would be helpful to wait under after the Feb. 2
inauguration of President Carlos Andres of Venezuela and ask his
country's support in the peace process.
   The presidents had planned to discuss reviving the regional peace
plan they signed in 1987.
   Arias said the Central American leaders should give Bush, who
takes office on Jan. 20, and James Baker III, his designated
secretary of state, time to consider U.S. policy in Central America.
   ``It would be worth it to postpone the meeting until February,
after the inauguration of Mr. Bush,'' Arias said. He spoke at a
press conference Friday after giving reporters copies of a letter he
sent to the other Central American leaders.
   While the administration of President Reagan ``didn't fully
understand the plan for peace in Central America,'' Arias said ``the
statements of Mr. Baker make it appear that there is a commitment to
give diplomatic support to resolving the conflicts in Central
America.''
   The United States has financed the rebels trying to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist government. It is backing the governments of El
Salvador and Guatemala in their conflicts with leftist rebels and
considers Costa Rica and Honduras strong allies.
   In addition to sending the letter, Arias said he telephoned
presidents Joses Azcona Hoyos of Honduras and Jose Napoleon Duarte
of El Salvador, as well as vice presidents Sergio Ramirez of
Nicaragua and Roberto Capio of Guatemala.
   Arias said he was unable to contact Nicaraugan President Daniel
Ortega, who was in Cuba for the 30th anniversary celebration of the
communist island state's revolution.
   Arias said he did not ask the Central American leaders what they
thought of his proposal, but simply told them why he thought the
meeting should be postponed.
   There was no immediate reaction to Arias' proposal from Nicaragua.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez said that despite Arias'
proposal, Honduran officials still planned to attend the meeting.
   ``Honduras still has the good will to participate in the
presidents' meeting,'' said Lopez.
   In Guatemala, Vice President Roberto Campio Nicolle said he would
do everything he could to see the summit takes place as planned next
week in El Salvador.
   Duarte said he knew nothing about Arias' proposal. ``If there is
information like that, I don't have it,'' Duarte told reporters on
Friday. ``I'm still preparing for the meeting.''
   In August 1988, Arias told reporters that it was urgent that the
Central American leaders meet in January because ``it is dangerous
to let the time pass by.''

<HEAD>Iran Minister Talks of Improved Tehran-Moscow Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's deputy foreign minister said on
Friday after returning from a special mission to Moscow that
Iran-Soviet relations have taken a turn for the better, Iran's
official news agency reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Mohammad Javad Larijani spoke at a news conference after delivering
a special message to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from
Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Larijani returned home Thursday.
   Although the contents of Khomeini's letter were not revealed,
Larijani said the message praised Gorbachev for his bold new
leadership style, for his decision to pull troops out of
Afghanistan, and for permitting more religious freedom, IRNA said.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, on Thursday quoted
Khomeini's son and confidant, Ahmed Khomeini, as saying the letter
also urged Gorbachev to seriously study Islam.
   The Soviets agreed to help complete the Ramin and Beheshti power
plants, left unfinished when Soviet technicians were pulled out
during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Last month, Iran said it will resume supplying natural gas to the
southern Soviet Union through a pipeline shut down in 1980 over a
price dispute.
   Ranking Soviet officials have shuttled to Tehran in recent months
to enforce Moscow's commitment to strengthening ties with Iran.
   A visit to Tehran by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Sheverdnadze
is under consideration.

<HEAD>Bush To Give Congress His Deficit-Cutting Ideas, Supports Pay Hike
for Now</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: To CORRECT Ross' dates from 1966 to 1986, subs 27th graf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush said Friday he will unveil
ideas for reducing the deficit to a special joint session of
Congress after his inauguration.
   And while expressing support for President Reagan's decision to
back a 50 percent pay increase for members of Congress and other top
federal officials, Bush said he may revisit the question when he is
president.
   ``I don't know whether we can afford anything other than to get
this deficit under control,'' he said.
   Bush's transition office later announced Bush will nominate
Lawrence S. Eagleburger as deputy secretary of state and has
selected his national security adviser, Donald P. Gregg, as
ambassador to South Korea.
   Eagleburger is a Henry Kissinger protege who is currently
president of Kissinger Associates, the consulting firm founded by
the former secretary of state.
   The Gregg nomination could spark controversy because of Gregg's
role in the Iran-Contra affair while serving on Bush's vice
presidential staff, which he joined in 1982 after retiring from the
Central Intelligence Agency.
   The transition office also announced a string of other
appointments to top State Department posts and several prominent
ambassadorships, including the nominations of Henry E. Catto, a
former White House protocol chief, as ambassador to Great Britain,
and Vernon A. Walters, the outgoing United Nations ambassador, as
ambassador to West Germany.
   There was no word from Bush on when he will fill his last two
Cabinet-level vacancies, energy secretary and drug-czar, and aides
said he still has not made up his mind.
   Bush, fielding questions from reporters at the start of a meeting
with small business executives, also said the Iran-Contra prosecutor
Lawrence Walsh ``did the right thing'' in moving to drop two key
charges against Oliver North because of national security concerns.
   ``It's the proper suggestion. And I think he properly found that
there are legitimate national security interests that need to be
protected. ... '' said the vice president, who last week was
subpoenaed by North's lawyers to testify in the case. ``I think he
did the right thing.''
   On budgetary matters, Bush said that with his proposed ``flexible
freeze'' on spending, ``some things will go up and then some things
must be offset by going down. We're going to hold the line as we
reduce the spending side of this budget ... without raising our
taxes.''
   But as for the pay increase, he said, ``I am vice president and I
will be supportive of what the president decides. I've done that for
seven and eleven-twelfths years and I don't plan to change now.''
   ``When the ball is in my court and the buck is stopping on my
desk, I may have something else to say about matters of this
nature,'' he added.
   Asked for details of his flexible freeze, Bush replied, ``I'll
tell you when I take my message up to a joint session of the
Congress.''
   Bush will not make a formal State of the Union address until next
year, but aides say they expect the new president to address
Congress a few weeks after the Jan. 20 inauguration.
   In doing so, he will be following the example of Reagan, who
wentbefore Congress to appeal for his tax and budget cuts in
February 1981, a few weeks after replacing Jimmy Carter.
   Reagan is sending Congress a lame-duck, $1.2 trillion budget for
fiscal 1990 on Monday. Administration officials say it will hold the
deficit to $92 billion in part by cutting domestic programs by more
than $30 billion.
   ``I won't have time to submit a budget this thick,'' said Bush,
holding his hands a foot apart. ``But I will have time to analyze
the president's proposals _ a budget, incidentally, that will go up
there without raising taxes _ and say, `Here's what I'll add here
and take off a little there,' something of that nature.
   ``But it will be done. After I become president I will, as I've
said all along, wrestle with that problem and then send the message
up to the Hill and that will start the process.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the Reagan
budget will propose eliminating 80 programs, many of them survivors
of past Reagan hit lists.
   ``I hasten to emphasize that this is a Reagan administration
budget and not a Bush administration budget,'' said Fitzwater, who
will also be Bush's spokesman. Bush will make some alterations and
change some spending priorities, Fitzwater said, ``but this is not a
good-cop, bad-cop exercise.''
   The flurry of appointments announced Friday include five top
positions at the State Department under Bush's secretary of
state-designate, James Baker III. Eagleburger was undersecretary of
state for political affairs from 1982-1984, the department's No. 3
job.
   Others nominated for State Department posts are:
   _Robert B. Zoellick, a former Treasury official under Baker, to
be counselor. He served as issues director for Bush's campaign.
   _Margaret D. Tutwiler, to be assistant secretary for public
affairs and spokeswoman for State. She is a former assistant
Treasury secretary who also served under Baker at the White House.
   _Janet G. Mullins, assistant secretary for legislative affairs.
She is currently director of congressional-relations for the
president-elect and was deputy national political director and media
director of his campaign.
   _Dennis B. Ross, director of the policy planning staff with
ambassadorial rank. He was Bush's national security adviser during
the campaign and a member of the National Security Council staff
from 1986 to 1988.
   The transition office also announced Bush is keeping M. Alan
Woods as head of the Agency for International Development and
nominating Joseph Verner Reed Jr. as chief of protocol. Catto is
currently vice chairman of H&amp;C Communications, which operates a
network of television stations.
   All the appointments except Ross required Senate confirmation.
Reed does not have to be reconfirmed.
   With the latest figures showing unemployment at a 14-year low of
5.3 percent, Bush was asked if there was room for further
improvement in the jobless rate.
   ``There's a lot of things where we can help in an effort to move
unemployment lower. But one way to not do that is to slow the
economy down by going out there and raising taxes,'' he said.
   Bush also metwith New York Mayor Edward I. Koch to discuss the
war on drugs, AIDS, housing and other issues.
   Koch said Bush asked him for suggestions on a drug czar, and the
mayor recommended former Education Secretary William J. Bennett and
U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab.
   Bush surprised his wife Barbara on their wedding anniversary by
taking her out to dinner with friends at a posh Italian restaurant,
Tiberio's, Friday night, followed by a trip to the nearby Kennedy
Center to see the play, ``Sheer Madness,'' a Bush spokeswoman, Alixe
Glen, said.

<HEAD>Woman Testifies Hedda Nussbaum Abused Lisa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedda Nussbaum, the lover of a man on trial for
the murder of a 6-year-old girl he illegally adopted and the
prosecution's key witness, once flung the girl several feet and
slapped her, a witness testified Friday.
   ``I told Hedda that if she ever struck that child like that again
in my presence, I would (retaliate violently),'' said the witness,
Marilyn Walton.
   Ms. Walton, 38, a cabaret singer from Dallas and longtime friend
of the defendant, Joel Steinberg, appeared as a defense witness to
rebut Ms. Nussbaum's testimony that she never abused Lisa Steinberg.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree
murder in the beating death of Lisa, who was illegally adopted from
an unwed Long Island teen-ager.
   Lisa was taken unconscious from Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She was hospitalized and died of a brain
hemorrhage three days later.
   Steinberg told police he did not hit the child, and his lawyers
are suggesting that Ms. Nussbaum could have struck the fatal blow.
   Ms. Walton said the slapping incident occurred on a very cold day
in February 1983 after Ms. Nussbaum refused to let her and Lisa into
the building where Steinberg lived after they had gone to get ice
cream.
   The two finally were able to get in and went to the third-floor
apartment. Ms. Nussbaum opened the door and seemed angry, Ms. Walton
said.
   Ms. Nussbaum grabbed Lisa by the collar of her coat and yanked
her, the witness said. ``Lisa's body went pretty far across the ..
.'' Ms. Walton said before being interrupted.
   An objection by Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro was
sustained.
   ```Pretty far' is a characterization,'' Judge Harold Rothwax told
Ms. Walton. ``Just tell us what happened.''
   ``She flung Lisa,'' Ms. Walton replied. ``I saw Lisa look
stunned. I saw her almost lose her balance. I said, `Hedda, What are
you doing?'''
   ``Hedda raised her hand,'' the witness went on. ``Lisa was
squirming and she told her to stop. Lisa still squirmed and she (Ms.
Nussbaum) came down like that (bringing her hand down forcefully)
and hit her on the neck.''
   ``I went over to Lisa,'' Ms. Walton said. ``I tried to shield
her.''
   She said the child ``looked dazed; she recoiled; she looked
frightened; she backed away.'' At this point, Ms. Walton said, she
threatened Ms. Nussbaum.
   Steinberg then entered the apartment, Ms. Walton said. ``Hedda
suddenly became very docile,'' she said. ``It was as if nothing had
happened.''
   Ms. Nussbaum was intially charged with murder in Lisa's death
along with Steinberg. Charges against her were dropped and she
became a prosecution witness.
   Ms. Walton said Steinberg and Lisa had a ``loving father-daughter
relationship.''
   ``Did you ever see him hit her?'' asked Steinberg lawyer Adrian
DiLuzio.
   ``Not once.''
   Trial resumes Monday at 10 a.m. in Manhattan's State Supreme
Court.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers Dead, 31 Hurt In Grenade Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers hurled hand grenades
at a group of marching policemen in a black township east of
Johannesburg, killing two officers and wounding 31, police said
Friday.
   The grenades were thrown over the wall surrounding the municipal
police station in the Kathlehong township as the police were
participating in a parade Thursday night, police said.
   Both slain policemen were black, as are 30 of those injured,
police said.
   Militant anti-apartheid activists frequently target black
policemen for attack, saying they are collaborators with the
white-dominated government.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but security officials
have blamed virtually all such attacks on the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   In an unrelated event, a handcuffed black prisoner died during an
escape attempt on Thursday, police said.
   Police said Daniel Qobolo, 33, a resident of Sebokeng township
south of Johannesburg, appeared in magistrate's court on Tuesday on
a break-in and theft charge. On Thursday he accompanied two local
detectives to participate in crime investigations, including ``the
pointing out of certain spots.''
   The police had no further explanation of what was being
investigated.
   Police said Qobolo was handcuffed with his hands behind his back,
but tried to escape.
   ``Whilst running away, he fell and lost consciousness,'' the
police statement said. It added that he regained consciousness but
died a short while later in the police vehicle.
   Police are investigating the incident, and a government
pathologist is conducting the autopsy. It is the second death of a
black prisoner in police custody in recent weeks.
   In another development, two gasoline bombs damaged the
Johannesburg house of Irwin Manoim, a co-editor of the
anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper, his mother Berthel Manoim said.
   Manoim was not at home at the time of the pre-dawn attack Friday,
and two friends sleeping at the house were not injured, Mrs. Manoim
said.
   One of the two people staying at the house was Obed Bapela, who
is on trial for treason, but has been released on bail, she said.
   The Weekly Mail, which is oriented toward white liberals, is
considered one of the country's most aggressive and best written
newspapers. The government suspended the Weekly Mail for the month
of November, but it has since resumed publishing.

   Officials say Emperor Hirohito's state funeral will
closely follow precedents set 62 years ago when his father, Emperor
Taisho, died and was buried 45 days later.
   ``Although there have been many changes since then, including
major changes in the constitution, in practical terms there won't be
many alterations in the funeral rites,'' a palace official said
before Hirohito's death Saturday.
   If those precedents are followed, there will be at least 61
different ceremonies, rites and court appearances extending over at
least two years. Many are directly linked to the Shinto religion,
for which the emperor by tradition serves as chief priest.
   Hirohito was considered a living Shinto god until he renounced
his divinity after World War II and his status was changed to merely
a ``symbol of the state'' in the postwar constitution imposed by
U.S. occupation authorities.
   Of the 61 ceremonies, the grand state funeral, or ``taiso no
rei,'' is expected in about 45 days, and will be one of three rites
officially sponsored by the government.
   The others are the ceremony held Saturday in which the new
emperor received the imperial regalia and seals, and his first
audience with government officials, scheduled for Monday.
   The other ceremonies and rites are to be conducted by the
imperial household, in legal conformity with the constitutional
separation of religion and state.
   Officials say Hirohito's body will be placed in a casket two or
three days after his death. The formal state funeral in about 45
days is likely to include a procession of top officials and foreign
dignitaries to a royal burial ground. Palace officials say he will
not be cremated, in a departure from common practice in Japan.
   At the time of Taisho's death, 6,000 people marched in the
procession, and 1.5 million watched. The day of the funeral is
likely to be declared a national holiday.
   Government officials avoided discussions of funeral arrangements
before Hirohito's death, believing that it was inappropriate while
he was still battling his long illness.
   But the palace official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Imperial Household Agency was ``closely studying the
ceremonies in the past,'' and would base the observances after
Hirohito's death on them.
   ``The 45-day period following the death of Taisho was probably
related to the extended time required for foreign dignitaries to
travel to Japan, since only boat transportation was available
then,'' he said. ``But we generally are using the precedents of the
past.''

   Three military helicopters
fired rockets and machine-gun rounds Saturday at dissident Moslems
holed up at a military camp where they repulsed two earlier
government attacks.
   The military launched the attacks after the defense chief said
the dissidents had killed a general they took captive and may have
killed a second officer.
   The government sent the helicopters in the wake of its ground
attack earlier Saturday with recoilless rifles and automatic weapons
that failed to dislodge up to 60 Moslems from the garrison. There
were no immediate reports on casualties from Saturday's assaults.
   Before the ground attack, Brig. Gen. Braulio Balbas said
government forces hoped to capture the renegades and regain full
control of the garrison by the end of the day.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ruled out further
negotiations with the Moslems, saying they killed at least one of
two hostages taken Thursday in this Mindanao Island city about 560
miles south of Manila.
   But Mayor Vitaliano Agan said the leader of the dissidents,
Patrolman Rizal Alih, sent word through relatives that he wanted to
surrender.
   Alih and about 14 supporters seized the camp's headquarters
building on Thursday and took Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, regional
commander of the Philippine Constabulary, and his chief of staff
Col. Romeo Abendan hostage after eight of them were ordered to
surrender and face murder charges in a 1984 incident.
   Dozens of Moslem soldiers and others joined Alih's group, using
weapons looted from the camp armory.
   On Friday, de Villa ordered his troops to storm the garrison
after he received reports that Batalla had been slain by his captors.
   De Villa said he also feared Abendan had been killed.
   During Friday's attack, tanks and armored personnel carriers,
with guns blazing, smashed through the gates ahead of marines and
commandos flown here from Manila.
   But the troops were forced to withdraw after the Moslems returned
fire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers. They disabled at
least one armored vehicle.
   Officials said at least five people were wounded in Friday's
attack. Balbas said the Moslems had suffered casualties too, but he
was unable to give a figure because sniper fire prevented troops
from canvassing the grounds.
   De Villa said troops monitoring the captors' radio communications
heard them chanting Moslem prayers associated with imminent death
and concluded the gunmen were ready to die rather than surrender.
   ``They're ready to run amok,'' de Villa said. ``They will not
leave that place anymore. They will die fighting.''
   But Agan quoted Alih's relatives as saying Alih wanted to
surrender to the mayor and a Moslem city official because he had
lost two brothers in Friday's fighting.
   Negotiations broke down Friday after Alih failed to provide
evidence that Batalla was alive. Alih had said the general was safe,
but de Villa told reporters Friday that Batalla was probably killed
Thursday when the hostage incident began.
   Alih was charged but acquitted in the November 1984 slaying of
Mayor Cesar Climaco. Three weeks after Climaco's death, seven people
were killed in a marine raid on Alih's home.
   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batalla
received permission to arrest Alih. Batalla ordered Alih and eight
others detained. All of them could be charged with murder or
conspiracy to commit murder.
   In an apparently unrelated incident, military sources said six
marines were killed and two others were wounded Saturday during an
attack by Moslem rebels on Basilan island, about 10 miles to the
south.
   A military report said two rebels were also slain.
   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which has
population of 59 million. Half of Zamboanga's residents are
Christian and half Moslem.

<TEXT>
   Judit Polgar of Hungary, the
highest-ranked 12-year-old chess player in history, won the
prestigious Hastings Challengers Tournament on Friday, and experts
hailed her as a future world champion.
   ``I was deeply impressed,'' said grandmaster Michael Wilder of
Princeton, N.J., the current U.S. champion.
   ``Never in history has anyone of this age played nearly this well
_ not Bobby Fischer, not Garri Kasparov, not even close. It's scary
to think about what she already accomplished.''
   At the closing ceremony, tournament director Stewart Reuben
introduced Miss Polgar as a ``future world champion.''
   She defeated Glenn Flear, a British grandmaster, in the final
round of the 99-player tournament to seize first place with eight
points out of a possible 10.
   Her result overwhelmed that of another prodigy whom she also
beat, 14-year-old Matthew Sadler of England who came in second with
7.5 points.
   A win scores one point and a draw half a point.
   The Challengers field included four grandmasters and a host of
international masters from around the world.
   Miss Polgar now qualifies for next year's Premier Tournament at
Hastings, an eight-player event featuring the world's leading
grandmasters. This year's Premier finishes Jan. 14 and is led by
England's Nigel Short, the world's third-ranked player.
   Following a year of stunning victories, the International Chess
Federation on Thursday declared Miss Polgar the world's
highest-ranked female player on their ranking lists, which are
updated every six months.
   On a joint list of men and women she would share 55th place with
two men and ahead of most of the 270 grandmasters in chess.
   Miss Polgar is the youngest of a remarkable trio of three sisters
from Budapest who appear likely to break the male domination of
chess.
   At November's Chess Olympiad in Salonica, Greece, the four-member
Hungarian women's team, which included the three Polgar sisters,
defeated the Soviets and took the gold medal in the separate women's
competition.
   The sisters' parents, Laszlo and Klara Polgar, educate their
children at home, having given up their professions to do so. Polgar
is a psychologist and his wife a teacher.
   After her final win in Hastings, a south England resort that was
staging its 64th Chess Congress, Miss Polgar and her mother went to
see the movie, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' before the closing
ceremony.
   Red-haired Judit told The Associated Press she was pleased with
her results but had missed the company of her sisters, Szofia, 14,
and Zsuzsa, 19.
   Asked how she managed to combine modesty in interviews with
crushing performances over the chess board she replied: ``It's
better than the other way.''
   All three sisters speak several languages. Judit speaks English
and Russian as well as her native Hungarian. From the age of five
the sisters have concentrated on chess and languages.

<HEAD>New Orleans Tax Official Indicted In Under-Reporting Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former city tax official was charged Friday
in connection with a scheme to under-report millions of dollars in
taxes for about 80 businesses in this financially strapped city,
prosecutors said.
   Barry T. Bergeron was charged with two counts of mail fraud, one
count of extortion and one count of federal income tax evasion,
according to the indictment returned Friday.
   If convicted he faces up to 35 years in jail and a $112,000 fine.
   According to the indictment, Bergeron, a former city revenue
collection supervisor, prepared fraudulent business tax returns in
exchange for monthly payments. U.S. Attorney John Volz would not
specify the amount of the payments.
   ``The city taxes uncollected would probably be in the millions,''
Volz said.
   New Orleans is particularly strapped for cash. To erase a $30
million deficit for 1989, the city council has had to cut spending
and raise taxes.
   Volz indicated that a plea bargain had been struck with Bergeron,
but would not elaborate. No arraignment date has been announced.
   Volz said that the government could have charged Bergeron with 80
counts of mail fraud _ one for each of the businesses with which he
dealt _ but did not.
   None of the 80 business owners were indicted, but Volz said the
investigation is continuing and that his office is also looking at
possible involvement by city elected officials.
   In June, a federal court jury convicted former city tax collector
Brian Eastwold of extortion, mail fraud and obstruction of justice
for taking bribes to reduce a business owner's sales tax liability.
   The first count of mail fraud stems from Bergeron's mailing of a
city sales tax form to the Ideal Food Store.
   The second mail fraud charge involves a scheme to help some
grocery store owners in redeeming unused merchandise cents-off
coupons for about $66,000. Volz said that some of the stores in
Bergeron's coupon scheme also were involved in under-reporting their
income.
   The indictment says Bergeron under-reported the businesses'
income on federal and state tax returns.
   Bergeron is also charged with under-reporting his and his wife's
joint 1987 income by $30,088. Volz refused to connect that money
with the payments Bergeron allegedly received from the business
owners to prepare their taxes.
   ``People will repay what they owe,'' Volz said when questioned
about possible proceedings against the business owners.

   A woman accused of beating her 10-year-old
son with a metal pipe to get money for cocaine was arraigned Friday
on assault, theft and child endangerment charges, police said.
   Police said Joanne Oliphant, 29, beat her son, Jermaine, until he
gave her $11 he earned washing cars. She then left him in their home
while she went out searching for a drug dealer, police said.
   Miss Oliphant was arraigned on charges of aggravated and simple
assault, terroristic threats, endangering the welfare of a child,
robbery, receiving stolen property, recklessly endangerment and
weapons offenses, police said.
   She faces a Jan. 11 hearing in Philadelphia Family Court.
   Her son walked three blocks from his home to a hospital after the
alleged beating Wednesday, and was transferred to St. Christopher's
Hospital for Children, where he was in good condition Friday,
officials said.
   The beating occurred after the boy returned from a day of washing
cars for tips in the neighborhood with $11 in his pocket, according
to police.
   Miss Oliphant admitted nothing after her arrest, saying the child
had caused the injuries himself, according to police.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. made no move Friday to
clear up a discrepancy between his contention that he has passed
drug tests the past five years and his doctor's statements that he
doesn't remember such tests.
   Barry, who is under federal investigation in connection with a
drug case targeting a former city employee, kept out of the public
eye Friday, spending the day in his office while reporters pressed
his aides for the mayor's medical records.
   He said Thursday, ``I've taken a drug test five years in a row''
as part of routine physical examinations. ``I've released them twice
a year.''
   However, spokesman John White said he knew nothing of any such
drug tests. And Barry's physician, Vincent J. Roux, said much the
same thing.
   ``I'm not sure I have ever given the mayor a drug test,'' Roux
told WUSA-TV. ``I don't remember.''
   Roux said he would not release the mayor's medical records
without Barry's authorization.
   Spokesman White said Friday that Barry was aware of repeated
requests for release of the records, but he added that he had no
idea whether the mayor would make the documents public.
   Barry, who has repeatedly denied drug use, is facing the worst
political crisis in his decade as mayor of the nation's capital
after disclosure of the fact that he had been visiting the former
city employee, Charles Lewis, at a Washington hotel at a time city
police were arriving to try and make an undercover drug buy from the
man.
   Police left when they learned Barry was at the hotel, authorities
have said, and a federal investigation is under way. Barry has
denied interfering with the city's drug probe, but has acknowledged
calling an assistant police chief who was supervising the drug
investigation. Barry said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   White had said that Barry's physical examinations included urine
samples, but one medical expert said Friday that more than a routine
test would be needed to find indications of drug use.
   ``The drug tests are so specific, drugs won't show up there
unless the doctor is looking for them,'' said Dick Bast, senior
technical adviser at the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Information in Rockville, Md. ``They would not show up in a
normal urinalysis.''
   Most physicians do not have the sophisticated equipment and
labratory facilities necessary to conduct exhaustive drug tests from
urine samples, Bast added.
   Lewis, in his first public comments since the incident, was
quoted as saying the media was conducting ``a smear campaign''
against him and Barry.
   Lewis' comments came in an interview with the Virgin Islands
Daily News. Parts of the interview were published in Saturday's
editions of the Washington Post.
   Lewis denied in the interview that he had offered drugs to the
hotel housekeeper, as she has allegedly told police.
   ``I wasn't selling nothing, I wasn't enjoying nothing and neither
was the mayor,'' Lewis was quoted as saying.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya said Friday that 14 U.S. jets
attacked the two Libyan fighters shot down this week over the
Mediterranean, not two U.S. planes as Washington says.
   Meanwhile, warplanes in position for takeoff appeared on the
tarmac at Tripoli's airport, and soldiers guarded the fortress of
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who was reported to fear a U.S. attack.
   A Western diplomat said he was told that Gadhafi had ousted his
military chief, but he said the report could not be confirmed. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rajab Abou Dabbous, secretary of the Libyan information ministry,
told a news conference Friday evening that the U.S. account of
Wednesday's air attack was ``a fabrication.''
   He said 14 U.S. jets were involved and that the shooting was
premeditated. U.S. officials have said two U.S. jets fired after the
Libyan MiG-23s pursued them.
   ``The truth is that 14 (U.S. planes) _ count them _ attacked two
Libyan planes on a normal reconnaissance flight,'' said Dabbous.
   Libyan television broadcast similar charges.
   Libyan officials say the planes were unarmed reconnaissance
craft, but U.S. officials have produced video footage that they say
shows missiles on the Libyan planes.
   The atmosphere in Tripoli was tense, and many residents took
flight. The Western diplomat compared the mood in the city to the
days surrounding a U.S. raid on Libya in April 1986.
   Gadhafi has not been seen or heard from since Wednesday, when he
vowed to challenge the United States over this week's air battle.
   Tensions between the United States and Libya already had been
high because of U.S. allegations that a plant outside Tripoli was
designed to manufacture chemical weapons. Libya says the plant is
for manufacture of pharmaceuticals.
   The diplomat said he received a telephone call Friday from ``a
usually credible source'' saying Gadhafi had dismissed his military
chief, Col. Abu Bakr Younis Jaber.
   However, the diplomat said he was unable to confirm the report
and added that such rumors have circulated before. He said Gadhafi
reshuffled the military a few weeks ago, but it was unclear if the
military head had been affected.
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said Wednesday that Gadhafi fired
his military chief to tighten control over the military in
anticipation of a U.S. assault.
   Diplomats in the capital said if true, the report could mean
Gadhafi feared his top military leaders might resist his orders in
the heat of an attack.
   The military chief, who like Gadhafi holds the highest rank in
the Libyan military, is one of a handful of survivors of the clique
that supported Gadhafi's 1969 coup, which overthrew the
Western-backed monarchy.
   At least two MiG-23 jet fighters sat at Tripoli's airport Friday,
poised to enter the takeoff runway. On Thursday, no military planes
were seen on any runway.
   Soldiers with machine guns and protected by sandbags guarded the
fortified complex of offices and housing where Gadhafi makes his
headquarters in Tripoli. As usual, tanks with mounted anti-missile
guns were parked inside.
   The compound, ringed by 25-foot concrete walls topped by barbed
wire, was a target of the 1986 U.S. raid. Gadhafi's whereabouts were
not known.
   The Western diplomat said that on Friday, as the capital closed
for the Moslem Sabbath, rumors circulated the United States bombed
the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta, 60 miles outside
Tripoli.
   The fears of a U.S. attack prompted many Tripoli residents to
leave the city.
   President Reagan has said he would not rule out military action
against the disputed plant.
   The diplomat also said he believed there were ``contacts between
the United States and Libya through a third, neutral country that
has sufficient relations with both'' since the air battle. He
declined to name the country or provide further details.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed Thursday that
Libya has attempted some back-channel contacts with the United
States recently, but she refused to define the substance of the
messages or how they were transmitted.
   ABC News reported Friday that Gadhafi last week asked Italy's
foreign minister to relay to Reagan a proposal to work out a deal so
the United States would not bomb the plant.
   The New York Times reported Saturday that two weeks before the
planes were shot down, the Reagan administration rejected an offer
from Saudi Arabia to mediate between the United States and Libya.
   The diplomat said the government was sending many civilians to
visit or stay at the plant, including schoolchildren.
   According to Libyan media, doctors and nurses have been holding a
sit-in at the factory to ``defend'' it, and demonstrations have
occurred there frequently in recent days.
   The diplomat said the government apparently wanted to ensure that
in the event of a raid, the plant would appear to be a civilian
target.

<HEAD>Treasurer's 11th Hour Buying Of South African Stocks Irks Apartheid

   Michigan officials followed the letter, but
not the spirit of divestiture when they went on an 11th-hour buying
spree, snapping up South African-related stocks days before a ban on
such investments took effect.
   Treasurer Robert Bowman ordered the December purchases on behalf
of the state's $15.7 billion pension fund. They came just before a
new law went into effect on New Year's Day and banned new
investments of state pension funds in companies with South African
ties.
   ``It makes me sick. It clearly goes against the spirit of the
law,'' said Thea Todd, co-coordinator of the Michigan Leadership
Coalition for South Africa Divestment.
   ``He didn't violate anything, that's clear, but if he were
clearly in the spirit of it, he wouldn't go out and buy right at the
end,'' said state Sen. Dan DeGrow, a sponsor of the measure designed
to protest apartheid.
   The stock buy was part of $902 million in purchases made through
a fund that buys in a single package all 478 stocks listed on the
Standard and Poors 500 index, Bowman said, adding that three-fourths
of the stocks listed in the index have no South Afican ties.
   A review of the index indicated at least 94 companies were on a
list released by Bowman last week of companies believed to have
South African ties and are now off-limits for state investments.
   ``The goal was not, of course, to buy companies that would
ultimately be proscribed, but this is our last chance to buy the
index fund,'' he said Wednesday.
   ``The spirit of the law wasn't violated because the treasurer
didn't cherry pick any specific stocks and buy them. To violate the
spirit of the law would be to go out and buy index firms we knew had
South African ties,'' said Robert Kolt, Bowman's spokesman.
   Topping the list of stocks bought of companies with South African
ties was IBM, $34,469,961 worth. Others included General Electric
Co., $19,374,122; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., $14,986,177;
General Motors Corp., $12,514,653; Ford Motor Co., $12,075,821.
   Bowman said the state had been in and out of the Standard and
Poors fund over the last 18 months and he decided in December to
beef up its stake in the stock market.
   ``We moved money into the index fund. It's a way to move a lot of
money into the stock market and bet on the stock market,'' Kolt
said, adding that the treasurer's office has a responsibility under
the law to maximize the return on its investments, as well as divest
of South African stocks.
   Thomas Scott, a spokesman for Gov. James Blanchard, who endorsed
the law, said Bowman's actions don't indicate the administration
lacks commitment to divestiture.
   ``The governor expects and has no reason to believe otherwise
that the divestiture law he and Treasurer Bowman pushed for will be
carried out according to the full spirit and letter of the law,''
Scott said.
   The new law bars the pension fund from buying stock in companies
that have ties to South Africa, and gives it five years to sell off
stock in those companies, which totals $5 billion.
   The law also applies to 45 municipal pension funds.

   A 16-year-old boy was fatally shot
Thursday on the playground of a junior high school as students and
faculty members watched, authorities said.
   Edward Burnett, a ninth-grader at Henderson Junior High School,
died shortly after being shot in the chest with a .22-caliber gun,
officials said.
   Willie J. Standley, 19, of Little Rock, was charged with
first-degree murder in the slaying of Burnett, Lt. Bert Jenkins
said. He said no charge would be filed against a second person taken
into custody.
   Jenkins said authorities were unable to come up with a motive for
the shooting at point-blank range. He said officers found a gun
believed to be the murder weapon.
   The shooting occurred 10 minutes before the start of school, said
Julia McGehee, a school district spokeswoman.
   ``There were supervisors on the grounds, not very far from where
he was killed and there were no indications of anything untoward at
all. They were unloading the buses as usual,'' Ms. McGehee said.
   Some parents picked their children up from school early, and the
school was providing counselors for others. But school was to remain
in session.
   ``We have sent in extra nurses. Students have been and are being
notified of the tragedy. We have counselors and have brought in
extra people,'' Ms. McGehee said.
   The district also brought in counselors in November 1987 when
when two children who were students in the district were shot to
death in their home with other relatives.
   ``We know tragedy can strike and it can traumatize children who
knew the victim. We're trying to do all we can to work through this
situation,'' she said.

   The Pentagon has released photographs and a
dramatic audio tape of the U.S.-Libyan dogfight over the
Mediterranean that it says prove its pilots were provoked and acted
reasonably in downing the Libyan planes.
   The photographs, although of poor quality, show at least one of
the two Libyan MiG-23 fighters carried missiles. The Libyan
government has claimed both its planes were unarmed.
   The cockpit audio tape clearly records the pilot of the lead U.S.
Navy F-14 Tomcat citing each of five attempts to maneuver away from
the approaching Libyan jets, then, along with a second F-14,
shooting down the MiG-23s.
   Libya has asserted that the incident Wednesday was connected to
growing American complaints that a Libyan chemicals plant is being
readied for full-scale production of poison gas. President Reagan
has said he would not rule out a military strike against the plant,
which Libya claims is merely a medicine factory.
   The Pentagon said there was no link between the factory dispute
and the air battle, which it said began while the Navy Tomcats were
flying a routine protective patrol for the aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy well off the Libyan coast.

   The debate between the United States and Libya over
an alleged chemical weapons plant may overshadow a 140-nation
conference on the use of poison gas and other chemical arms. Such
weapons have been called a poor nations' atomic bomb.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and a Libyan delegate plan to
attend the opening session Saturday, and tension is expected.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France said his government hopes
the five-day conference will not ``deviate from its agenda'' because
of the shooting down Wednesday of two Libyan jet fighters by U.S.
Navy planes.
   Delegates are expected to discuss changes in the 1925 Geneva
Protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemical
weapons. The document does not forbid making the weapons and has no
enforcement provisions.

   President Reagan will lend his support to a 50
percent pay raise for members of Congress and other federal
officials that one opponent called the ``greatest salary grab in
government history.''
   The raise will increase the pay for members of Congress and
federal judges to $135,000 a year unless both houses of Congress
reject it by Feb. 8.
   The president also will urge Congress to abolish outside income
such as speaking fees, as the Commission on Executive, Legislative

   A plan to save billions of dollars by closing
dozens of military bases around the country goes before Congress
after being approved ahead of schedule by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   The House and Senate must deal with the plan in its entirety,
approving or rejecting it. The congressional resolution would then
go to the White House. Senate and House leaders have predicted
Congress will approve the plan.
   Carlucci told reporters Thursday that U.S. military leaders
strongly endorsed what he called a ``unique opportunity'' to save
money.
   ``We just have to move ahead and do this,'' Carlucci said. ``We
have not closed a base since 1978. And I think that fact speaks for
itself. We need to step up to the plate here.''

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ An unemployed ex-minister who said he
was too proud to go on welfare and expected God to provide has been
charged with murder in the starving of his 14-year-old son, who was
found dead weighing 69 pounds.
   Larry Cottam and his wife, Leona Cottam, were charged Thursday
with criminal homicide in the death of their son, Eric, who
authorities said had not eaten in at least three weeks and weighed
about 80 pounds less than normal.
   Dr. George E. Hudock, Jr., Luzerne County coroner, ruled the
teen-ager's death a homicide.
   ``I don't hold God responsible,'' Larry Cottam said Thursday
night from Mercy Hospital, where he and his wife and their
12-year-old daugther, Laura, were listed in serious condition with
malnutrition. ``The error was on my part, not God's.''

   Authorities today hanged two Sikhs for

condemned men said before going to the gallows that he wished he
could be born ``again and again and each time lay down my life for
this.''
   Meanwhile, thousands of troops in New Delhi and nearby states
braced for reprisal attacks by Sikh militants. Police in New Delhi
said some Sikhs stoned buses near the prison but there were no
reports of casualties.
   Satwant Singh, Mrs. Gandhi's bodyguard, and Kehar Singh were
pronounced dead less than half an hour after they were taken from
their tiny cells on death row and marched to the rain-soaked gallows
at New Delhi's Tihar Jail, a police official said.
   Supreme Court justices on Thursday turned down appeals by Satwant
Singh, who was the only one of the two assassins to survive, and
Kehar Singh, convicted of helping plot the murder.

<HEAD>Finns Celebrate 500 Years Of Literature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first book arrived in this arctic
nation 500 years ago and Finns apparently have decided reading is an
ideal way to spend long, dark winters that keep them indoors most of
the time.
   ``No other country places such emphasis on literature,'' said
Marja-Leena Rautalin of the Finnish Literature Society. ``It's
obvious everywhere you look. Foreign writers and critics who visit
us are constantly surprised.''
   Celebrations pegged to the arrival in 1488 of a volume written in
Latin and printed for the Finns in Germany were held throughout 1988
and into January.
   She said the extent of the anniversary celebrations reflected
widespread interest: ``It wasn't just another highbrow cultural
event. It also worked at the grass-roots level.''
   Four of five adults in Finland read a daily newspaper. More than
83 million books are borrowed annually from 20,000 public libraries
in a nation of fewer than 5 five million people.
   The government subsidizes writers and several literary prizes are
awarded each year. The Finlandia Prize, the largest, is worth the
equivalent of $23,500.
   Nearly 9,000 books are published each year, which the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization says is the most
in the world per capita. UNESCO statistics for 1986 put the number
of titles per 10,000 inhabitants at 17.7, compared with 1.2 in the
United States.
   About half the books published are translations, most from
English.
   Although the numbers are impressive, poet and social critic Paavo
Haavikko worries about timidity in publishing and the national
penchant for concensus.
   Haavikko, who won the 1984 Neustadt Literature Award from the
University of Oklahoma, published an eight-poem series in a leading
magazine in December defining the political climate in Finland as
``corrupt.''
   In an interview, Haavikko said: ``It's not 500 years of the
Finnish book that has been celebrated, but a couple of hundred years
of a closed and stagnant publishing trade.
   ``Yes, we could say the publishing trade is doing okay, but that
does not necessarily mean we can print what we want. There is an
unwritten agreement to keep one's mouth shut, and self-censorship
prevails in this consensus country.''
   During the observance, a new magazine called The Reader appeared,
promoting literature and reading. Ms. Rautalin said schools and
kindergartens arranged programs around the theme and companies held
writing competitions.
   An exhibition at the National Museum in Helsinki was to have
closed at the end of 1988, but drew record crowds and was extended.
   ``We have had some 40,000 visitors during the four months of the
exhibition,'' curator Kirsti Melanko said.
   Finland's first book was the ``Missale Aboense,'' in Latin and
named for Abo, a southwestern city now called Turku.
   Turku, the provincial capital when Finland was part of Sweden,
was the focus of the 500th anniversary celebrations. Plays and
celebrations were held at its 14th-century castle and there were
special services at Turku Cathedral.
   Except for Latin publications for church use, most of the
earliest books were in Swedish. The first Finnish primer appeared in
1543 and a Finnish prayer book was issued the next year.
   Finnish publishing was small-scale for centuries, consisting
mainly of scholarly and religious works. By the early 19th century
only 18,000 works had been printed, just 2,500 of them in Finnish.
   That number of new titles now arrives at the main Helsinki
University Library every two months.
   Efforts began in the early 1800s to create a national culture and
Finnish-language literature.
   J.V. Snellman, a statesman and politicial philosopher, and Elias
Lonnrot, a physician and folk historian, founded the Finnish
Literature Society in 1831.
   Lonnrot roamed the marshes and forests of Karelia, an eastern
region now partially in the Soviet Union, setting down its myths and
folk songs.
   The result was The Kalevala, his epic work, which was published
in 1835 and had a major influence on Finnish music and arts.
Sibelius drew on it for his symphony ``Finlandia,'' and other
artists used its ideas and themes.
   Longfellow employed the meter of Kalevala verse in ``The Song of
Hiawatha,'' published in 1855. The Kalevala is compulsory reading in
Finnish schools.

<DATELINE>PAPHOS, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed 100 exquisite
mosaic floors of mythological and geometric design from the glory
years of Paphos as a rich Roman trading port, and may find as many
more.
   British soldiers discovered the first floor, depicting Hercules
about to attack a lion, while digging an air-raid shelter in 1942.
They covered it up again.
   The mosaics, made of thumbnail-sized cubes of sawn stone called
tesserae, decorated wealthy Cypriot homes when Paphos was the
capital of the eastern Mediterranean island more than 2,000 years
ago.
   ``They were the ancient equivalent of a fitted carpet, and a
status symbol'' of the rich ``in the rooms where they entertained,''
said Demetrios Michaelides, the government archaeological officer in
charge of the 950,000-square-yard site.''
   He said in an interview there may be ``more than another 100
mosaics on the site.''
   A second chance find 20 years after the soldiers uncovered
Hercules and the lion led to systematic digging by archaeologists.
   They unearthed a mansion filled with mosaics and called it the
House of Dionysus because the god of wine and revelry was prominent
in the decorations.
   Three other mansions with spectacular mosaic floors have been
found in recent years, one so lavish it eventually was identified as
the palace of the Roman governor.
   ``It's surprising to find a highly developed mosaic art in Cyprus
at a point when it was really one of the empire's provincial
backwaters,'' said Christina Kondoleon, professor of art at Williams
College of Williamstown, Mass., who is publishing a book on the
discoveries.
   ``The designs are lively and creative. ... Mosaicists copied each
other and used pattern books, but these are often original, with a
very wide color range,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Naturalistic figures are surrounded by borders in floral and
geometric designs that are based on classical architecture and
intended to give a three-dimensional effect.
   Scholars agree the mosaics were made of local stone by craftsmen
influenced by the sophisticated styles of mosaic workshops in
Antioch on the coast of nearby Syria.
   Michaelides said many were laid during a period of great
prosperity in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries.
   One of the finest shows Orpheus, a mythological musician whose
playing was said to tame wild beasts, seated on a rock performing
with his lyre for an audience of animals _ a tiger, leopard, deer
and several others.
   It measures 13{ feet by 16 feet, 4 inches. The colors are a
subtle range of grays, pinks and browns.
   A later series, again of Dionysus and his followers in luminous
colored robes, dates from the middle of the 4th century, when
Christianity was gaining adherents in Cyprus.
   Ms. Kondoleon said the Dionysus mosaics ``are certainly making an
anti-Christian statement, reasserting the old pagan values.''
   The Paphos mosaics have become the island's biggest tourist
resource, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year, but it will
be years before all are on show.
   Michaelides said the ``difficulties and expense of conserving and
displaying mosaics mean you can't go out and dig one up whenever you
want.''
   Gauze and sacking are glued to a mosaic to keep the tesserae in
place, then it is cut out of the ground.
   Last summer, the Orpheus mosaic was lifted in one piece by
experts from the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, who
rolled it around a wooden drum to help keep it intact.
   ``Usually you cut the mosaic up in panels on the site and
reassemble it later, but this way there's less danger of damaging
it,'' Nicholas Stanley Price, the archeaologist who supervised the
operation, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   He said the team will return this spring to unroll the mosaic and
place it on a special epoxy resin base to reduce humidity before it
goes on display.

   So how will journalist-personality David Frost
make the new syndicated newsmagazine ``Inside Edition'' different
from those other shows relegated by critics to the ``trash TV'' heap?
   ``I think the accent will help,'' he chuckled through a
cigar-smoke haze. Indeed, there is that clipped, British way of
making everything sound ever so more important than it perhaps, in
point of fact, is, as it were.
   Frost, who made a twice-weekly commute for ``That Was the Week
That Was'' back in the 1960s, will have an easier time of it this
time _ he'll commute only weekly between his home outside London and
the Manhattan studios of ``Inside Edition.'' Thanks to the
supersonic Concorde, time zones and a helicopter from JFK Airport,
he boasts, ``I can leave my house in the country at 8:30 in the
morning and be at my office at `Inside Edition' at 10.''
   During an interview, Frost was positively buoyant, bouncing
around his hotel apartment overlooking Central Park, from telephone
to room-service tray and back to the dining table. But an English
reporter doing a profile piece who had flown in with him that
morning seemed a bit foggy.
   ``Inside Edition,'' a half-hour, weekly series, premieres
tonight. It is the first news effort from Roger and Michael King,
the kings of syndication whose King World distributes ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' ``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   King World announced ``Inside Edition'' shortly after the highly
touted ``USA Today: The Television Show'' premiered in September to
universally bad reviews and seemed bound shortly for syndication
oblivion. The daily ``USA Today: The Television Show'' was picked up
by stations in a whopping 95 percent of the country weeks before its
premiere, proving there was a big market for a new, syndicated
newsmagazine.
   The timing of the King World announcement of ``Inside Edition''
was not coincidental. But GTG Entertainment has not folded the ``USA
Today: The Television Show'' tent. The show has been retooled and
renewed for another season in an attempt to salvage a $40 million
investment.
   Nevertheless, ``Inside Edition'' has been picked up in 71 percent
of the country, and King World calls it ``the hottest-selling
midseason replacement in the history of syndication.''
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' had an impressive cast of
behind-the-scenes characters: former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker,
Gannett and former NBC ``Today'' show producer Steve Friedman.
   The Kings have matched Frost with the producers of Fox's
successful ``A Current Affair.''
   Frost first arrived on these TV shores in the fab '60s as host
and co-creator of the satirical ``That Was The Week That Was.'' He
has maintained his television presence in this country as host of
the syndicated ``Spectacular World of Guinness Records,'' the
``Spitting Image'' network specials and the syndicated ``The Next
President'' series in which he conducted in-depth interviews with
every 1988 U.S. presidential candidate.
   Frost has retained his hip, tongue-in-cheek image from the days
of ``TW3,'' but he made the serious-interview hall of fame in 1977
when he elicited an apology to the nation for Watergate from former
President Nixon.
   Since then, he has conducted one-on-one interviews with numerous
world leaders, including most recently Britain's Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. That interview was excerpted on NBC's ``Today''
show, on which Frost is a contributor.
   In addition to tapping Frost for ``Inside Edition,'' the
observant Kings grabbed John Tomlin and and Bob Young, the producers
of ``A Current Affair,'' an impertinent, sensationalistic, seedy
newsmag with a saving edge of self-mockery.
   Frost hopes the producers will bring to ``Inside Edition'' some
of that self-mocking quality. But he calls the new show ``a cross
between `A Current Affair' and `20-20,''' ABC News' quite serious
magazine show.
   ``Inside Edition'' ``does concentrate on people rather than
issues, it's popular journalism in that sort of sense,'' Frost said.
   ``It's not `This Week with David Brinkley,' or something like
that. It hopes to be popular journalism. But every subject it covers
will hopefully be reflected through the prism of good judgment, as
it were.''

<HEAD>Another Year of Traditional Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the most easily definable characteristic
of those individuals and institutions making up the U.S. economy
today is a feeling of angst. It is pervasive.
   It has been going on for years now, and headline writers have
just finished packaging it for still another year. You've seen the
type: ``Economists relieved by 1988, worry about slump in 1989.''
   Those fears have accompanied six years of uninterrupted expansion
during which more people have been put to work than ever in American
history, more profits made, more dividends paid. Inflation has been
restrained throughout.
   No matter. There are big budget deficits, trade deficits, bad
loans, shaky financial institutions, high but apparently still
insufficient taxes, rising interest rates, threats of trade wars and
more to deny anyone a sense of ease.
   As a result, optimistic economic forecasters dare not rely on
their data but instead issue forecasts with asterisks of protective
qualification. To them, the White House is always overly optimistic;
it's a rule of the game.
   On Wall Street, bullish brokers tell clients to be fully
invested, and then issue cigarette-package caveats. And in industry,
in automobiles, for instance, they lay plans for a big year but
worry about high interest rates.
   Individuals worry about the possibility of higher utility bills,
higher interest rates on their variable mortgages, higher taxes
(only 20 percent of that credit card interest is deductible this
year _ half last year's rate).
   For the most part, these nervous imprints on the brain are the
very ones everyone had a year ago and the year before that.
Indelibly impressed, they are now set for another year of carrying
tensions and fears, realistic or not.
   In contrast, however, there are some very good reasons for
Americans to accept some satisfication and relief.
   The economy, for instance, is stronger at the beginning of 1989
than almost anyone could have forecast one year ago and retained
respectability. The worst did not happen in 1988; the economy
improved rather than deteriorated.
   In spite of all the psychological hangups, growth reached more
than 3.5 percent and the expansion reached a peacetime record of
more than six years. Moreover, that growth was in business capital
investment and exports, sectors that the country needed to
encourage. And it came without major complications.
   The stock market didn't crash again, as feared, and now it looks
a lot stronger than a year ago. Corporate profits rose sharply, and
so price-earnings multiples shrank to just a little more than
one-half their precrash peaks.
   The foreign-debt crisis that threatened the stability of the
nation's largest banks is now far less a problem. With some strong
profits, banks have raised reserves against losses. Suspended
interest payments have resumed.
   While far from being corrected, the merchandise trade deficit has
been improving. And it cannot be assumed, in spite of fears, that
the seemingly insurmountable federal budget deficit won't be
controlled in a few years.
   Even the possibility of higher interest rates doesn't generate
quite the fear it might have a year ago. There is a greater
awareness of the dangers of personal debt; people seem to be a bit
more saving and conservative.
   Nobody expects very big things from the economy this year, and
they didn't last year either. And, in fact, ``big'' things didn't
happen _ merely a steady accumulation of good little things and an
absence of disasters.
   That angst, everything considered, might be the steadiest
governor the economy can have.

   ``Mississippi Burning,'' the new movie
that depicts the murders of three civil rights workers 25 years ago,
may never play in the small Mississippi farm town where the bloody
episode took place.
   ``Some people have asked me to show it but I've also had church
groups threaten to boycott me if I do,'' says Lula Ellis, the owner
of Philadelphia's only movie theater. ``I haven't made up my mind.''
   Folks in Philadelphia, population 6,800, are ambivalent about
having to relive one of the most sensational events of the civil
rights era.
   Even Cecil Price, the former Neshoba County sheriff's deputy who
went to prison for his role in the 1964 slayings of James Chaney,
Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, said he hasn't decided whether
he will see the Orion Pictures film, scheduled to be released across
the country next weekend.
   ``I'm trying to lead a different life now and I just wish all
that stuff hadn't been dredged up again,'' said the 52-year-old
Price, who served four years of a six-year sentence.
   ``I'm sure everybody involved wishes it had never happened,'' he
added. ``We just want to forget about it.''
   Philadelphia Mayor Charles McClain echoed those sentiments.
   ``I think most people know what happened here,'' McClain told a
visiting reporter. ``Why don't you all just let us alone?''
   McClain, who operates a local funeral home, said many changes
have taken place in Philadelphia during the past quarter century. He
cited the county's integrated school system, the black city
policemen and firemen, and the city's black alderman _ there also
are four whites on the City Council _ as evidence that Philadelphia
is not the same place it was when the murders occurred.
   ``People here don't understand why Philadelphia is being singled
out. Govs. George Wallace and Ross Barnett, the whole region, was
standing up to what was happening back then. There were all those
busloads of Northerners coming down here, telling us what do to ...''
   ``Besides,'' he continued, ``it was just coincidence that the
murders happened here. The people who were killed were outsiders and
the people who did it were, too. It's as if a jetliner had crashed
here and the people of Neshoba County were held responsible.''
   But retired special agent Joseph Sullivan, who led the FBI
investigation into the murders, has another view of the case.
   ``Neshoba was an incredibly closed and racist county,'' he said,
when contacted at his Manhattan home. ``The county's law enforcement
officers knew what was happening, the blacks and Indians in the
county were almost supine, and practically none of the whites in
Philadelphia would cooperate with us in solving the case; we found
that almost every adult white male in the county had connections
with the Ku Klux Klan.''
   Sullivan said he recently had seen ``Mississippi Burning'' in New
York.
   ``It's a good cowboys-and-Indians movie but bears little
resemblance to what actually occurred,'' he said. ``If anybody wants
to know what really happened they should read Florence Mars' book.''
   The book, ``Witness in Philadelphia,'' was published in 1977. The
author, now 65, was one of the few Philadelphia residents who would
cooperate with the FBI.
   ``It was clear something terrible was happening in
Philadelphia,'' she said last week, while recalling the days when
practically the entire county was involved in a conspiracy of
silence.
   Mars, a member of a prominent Neshoba County family, testified
before the federal grand jury investigating the murders. She also
spoke out against the Klan and urged local officials to acknowledge
what had happened in Philadelphia.
   As a result, the Klan staged a boycott of her stockyard that
forced her out of business.
   Mars says there have been many tremendous and positive changes in
her community since the Jim Crow days when blacks were likely to be
beaten or even hanged for angering a white person. But she also says
some people steadfastly refuse to admit the community did anything
wrong.
   ``Of the 18 people that eventually were arrested and charged in
the case, nine were from Neshoba County,'' she noted. ``And that
included the sheriff, the sheriff-elect and the chief deputy.''
   The other nine were from the Meridian and Laurel, to the south of
Philadelphia.
   ``And they were invited to come into the county,'' observed
Beatrice Cole, an 85-year-old black woman from nearby Mt. Zion. She
still vividly recalls watching a group of Klansmen beat her husband
nearly to death on the night of June 16, 1964, just five days before
the murders of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.
   ``We had just come out of church and the whites were waiting for
us,'' she said. ``They thought we'd been having a meeting with
Schwerner to talk about registering Negroes to vote but it was just
a regular church meeting, that's all.''
   The Klansmen, some wearing black robes, dragged her husband, J.R.
``Bud'' Cole, from his car and began beating him with clubs.
   ``I got down on my knees a few feet away and started praying,''
Mrs. Cole said. ``The leader saw me and told the others not to kill
my husband.''
   Later that night, the Mt. Zion Methodist Church was burned to the
ground.
   ``Nothing was ever done about the fire, nor about the beating of
my husband,'' Mrs. Cole said. ``That's the way things were.''
   The Coles did meet with Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney on the
21st. The three had come to Mt. Zion from their home base in
Meridian to investigate the burning of the church.
   Earnest Kirkland, who lives near the Coles, was the last friendly
face that the three workers were to see.
   ``They ate Sunday dinner at my parents' house that afternoon,''
Kirkland said. ``Then they gave me a ride down the road to a
friend's house and headed back to Meridian, but they never made it.''
   What happened was that Price had been tipped off that the three
were in the county. He arrested them on a traffic charge and took
them to the Neshoba County Jail.
   Chaney, a 21-year-old black man, was from Meridian. Schwerner,
24, and Goodman, 20, were from New York. Goodman, a summer
volunteer, had arrived in Mississippi the previous day.
   After being held for several hours the three prisoners were
permitted to post bond. But when they left the jail, escorted by
Price, a Klan group intercepted them, killed them and buried their
bodies in an earthen dam on the outskirts of town.
   The FBI found the bodies 44 days after the killings. They were
guided by a tip from an informant who was paid $30,000.
   The informant was never identified.
   ``But everybody was suspicious of everybody else,'' Mars
recalled. ``And for months everybody was watching to see if anybody
bought a new car or started spending money they shouldn't have.''
   When the state of Mississippi failed to prosecute the case, the
federal government stepped in and charged 18 men with conspiring to
violate the victims' civil rights. Eventually, seven were convicted
and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years.

   Lawrence Rainey, the Neshoba County sheriff at the time of the
murders, was acquitted. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in
the case of E.G. ``Hop'' Barnett, the sheriff-elect.
   Rainey now works as a security guard in Meridian. Barnett is
retired, and Price is employed as a driver at a Philadelphia
trucking company owned by Olen Burrage, on whose land the bodies
were found.
   Burrage, who was among those tried and acquitted, declined to
discuss the case, as did Barnett.
   But Rainey, who is employed by a black-owned company, still
maintains his innocence. He said the news media have always
portrayed him as a racist but as sheriff he merely upheld the law,
as he saw it.
   Rainey, who was hounded from several jobs by the NAACP, also said
he doesn't expect ``Mississippi Burning'' will cause him any
problems, given that he is employed by a black man now.
   Carolyn Goodman, Andrew Goodman's mother, says she thinks a
greater effort should be made to remember what happened in
Mississippi 25 years ago ``so nothing like that will ever happen
again.''
   The city of Philadelphia, however, has done nothing to
commemorate the deaths. Mayor McClain says he sees no need for any
observations or monuments ``since the victims were all outsiders.''
   ``Really, there isn't much talk about what happened any more,''
said Earnest Kirkland, now 55. ``The only white person who ever
mentioned it to me was a young boy out at the plant where I work.
   ``He asked me, `Did it really happen?' I started to tell him to
go ask his daddy but I just said, `Yeah, it really happened.'''

<TEXT>
   With the same visions of stardom that carried
scores of farm girls to this town in years past, foreign investors
today are migrating to Hollywood to make it big in the entertainment
industry.
   Japan's Sony Corp. has been trying to purchase film studio MGM
for months without success. British broadcaster Television South PLC
acquired television producer MTM Enterprises for $310 million in
July. Australian businessman Alan Saffron bought film producer
Atlantic Entertainment Group on Dec. 13.
   And just last week, a group of Japanese investors committed $50
million to build a small movie studio here.
   Numerous other overseas buyers, flush with cash and bolstered by
strong currencies, have their checkbooks unholstered, waiting for
the right moment to join Southern California's movers and shakers.
   ``I predict that over the next three to five years, you're going
to have two or three major studios change hands,'' said Steve
Rosenberg, president of entertainment consulting firm Rose Media.
``I truly believe that the Japanese will at least own one of them,
and maybe the Germans will own another.''
   ``You get the glamor and glitter to some extent but there are
also investment characteristics,'' said Nancy Schwalb, whose Star
Partners arranges limited participation in films such as ``A Fish
Called Wanda.''
   Investors from Austraia, Japan, France and Canada, Schwalb said,
``are interested in the industry because it's so strong and they
appreciate the growth.''
   Even though the film industry is enjoying record profits, several
large and small film studios are desperately in need of money.
``There are a lot of companies in serious trouble or potentially
serious trouble,'' said Charles Meeker, head of the entertainment
division at law firm White &amp; Case.
   Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures, for one, has floundered recently
and is rumored to be for sale. MGM sits dead in the water. Atlantic
Entertainment, just purchased by Saffron's KVC Video for an
undisclosed sum, was left destitute by box-office busts like ``Patty
Hearst'' and ``1969.''
   Yet the continuing deregulation of European television and the
boom in overseas VCR sales (60 percent of Japanese homes have VCRs)
have created a nearly insatiable demand for U.S. programming.
   American television shows and movies _ even domestic bombs like
``Airwolf'' and ``Rambo III'' _ have a remarkable ability to draw
audiences in most foreign countries.
   ``There's a major change in the regulatory environment in Europe
and there's an excess of Japanese capital looking for a home,'' said
Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. ``The combination of those two things means that
(foreign money) will move toward the domestic film business.''
   Entertainment-industry investments give electronic manufacturers
an unbeatable opportunity to create full-service companies. Sony's
recent $2 billion purchase of CBS Records, for instance, yielded a
firm with both hardware (record, tape and CD players) and software
(the Epic, Columbia and Portrait record labels).
   ``We're looking at Hollywood because of our interest in video,
precisely the same reason we looked at CBS Records because of our
interest in audio,'' said Michael Schuloff, Sony's vice chairman.
   Following Sony's model, Japan entertainment conglomerate Tokuma
Group has opened a Los Angeles office, scouring the city for related
investment opportunities.
   ``Mainly we are now looking for video rights ... for movies to
show in Japan,'' said Hiro Iijima, general manager of Tokuma's North
American operations. ``In the future, we would like to get
theatrical (motion picture), television and home video rights.''
   The easiest way to do that, of course, is to buy a studio already
owning such rights.
   The foreign equation can work both ways. A few leading
programmers _ Disney, NBC _ have begun spreading their franchises
overseas. So far, though, the advances have been tentative. ``But I
think you're going to see the successful U.S. studios make major
moves into foreign markets,'' Meeker said.
   Yet blindly snapping up an entertainment rilous
as attending a Jerry Lewis film festival.
   Sony Pictures, a tiny movie company now disguised as SVS Films,
has yet to become a successful producer. Sony removed its name from
the enterprise whencompany is as pe its releases (including a low-budget
slasher
film called ``Party Line'') threatened to tarnish Sony's golden
corporate image.
   SVS' latest theatrical release, an exploitation film called
``Vicious,'' will not establish Sony as a high-brow producer. The
movie, playing in just a handful of theaters, is described by the
entertainment newspaper Variety as ``ludicrous,'' a ``violent
cheapie'' featuring a ``vulgar screenplay.''
   ``(Entertainment) is clearly more risky (than other loan
investments), but that's not to say that it's necessarily
outrageous,'' said William Newby, assistant vice president in the
entertainment industry department at National Westminster Bank USA.
   ``You can't always apply typical accou

<BYLINE>FOOD VICTORY: Millionaire Health Crusader Poorer But Consumers
Richer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   OMAHA, Neb. _ A multimillionaire is $2 million poorer, but he's
convinced American consumers are richer as the result of his one-man
quest to rid food of highly saturated tropical oils he calls poison.
``It's a story of the little guy against the giant and the giant is
backing down,'' says Omaha businessman Phil Sokolof, who spends
almost all his time on his anti-cholesterol campaign.

   Retailers who expected only a modest pickup in their Christmas
business got a big _ and welcome _ surprise as consumers, caught up
in the holiday spirit, shopped with renewed enthusiasm in December.
   Analysts said Thursday that holiday sales were higher than
expected, rising in a range of 6 percent to 7.5 percent, an
improvement over the 6 percent gain forecast before the start of the

<HEAD>Retailers Enjoy a Strong Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The holiday spirit reawakened in consumers this Christmas,
sending shoppers into the stores and giving retailers their best
performance in nearly two years.
   ``Sales were very strong,'' Walter Loeb, a retail industry
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said Thursday after the nation's
largest general retailers announced their sales results for December.
   ``Retailers had sales above their own expectations,'' he said.
   Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
agreed, saying, ``It turned out to be a good Christmas,''
   Analysts estimated industrywide sales rose in a range of 6
percent to 7.5 percent, an improvement over the 6 percent gain
forecast before the start of the season.
   The outcome came as a surprise because retailers, mired in a
sales slump since early 1987, expected their customers to continue
shopping cautiously this season. Consumers, burdened by debt and
paying more for services and necessities, have been forced to cut
back on their retail outlays.
   But, as it turned out, ``consumers are in a mood to spend,'' said
analyst Monroe Greenstein at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   This Christmas contrasted with the 1987 holiday season, when
retailers were forced to slash prices to lure reluctant consumers
into the stores.
   Strong gains were evident in all segments of the industry, even
at the higher end of the economic scale. Neiman-Marcus Group Inc.
said sales at its stores open at least a year _ known as same-store
sales in the industry _ were up a strong 12.2 percent from December
1987.
   Apparel retailers continued their comeback from a year-long sales
slump. Limited Inc., a leading clothing retailer, said its
same-store sales soared 28 percent.
   But even with a good Christmas, many retailers will show
lackluster full-year sales when fiscal 1988 ends later this month.
Several storeowners have had trouble keeping up with inflation,
which increased at a rate of 4.4 percent for much of the year.
   The analysts said the companies nevertheless should have
favorable fourth-quarter earnings because they stocked their shelves
conservatively and had fewer price markdowns than a year ago.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., predicted
retailers would post earnings increases of 10 to 15 percent for the
quarter. The final quarter is crucial for retail companies because
they generally earn half their annual profits during this period.
   Industry watchers were split over whether consumers would
continue their December shopping spree into 1989. Economists monitor
consumer spending as a barometer of economic health because it
accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall December sales rose 12.1 percent, while its sales for the
cumulative 48 weeks were up 7.1 percent. Sears' same-store sales
were up 8.4 percent for the month and 3.2 percent for the fiscal
year to date.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate measure of a company's performance than figures that
include sales from new stores. Not all retailers report same-store
sales.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales were up 10.7 percent for the
month, and 6.5 percent for the year to date. Same-store sales rose
6.8 percent last month and 2.8 percent so far this year.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 31 percent in
December and 29 percent so far this year. The discount retailer
reported same-store sales gains of 14 percent for the month and 12
percent for the year to date.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales fell 1.5 percent for
the month and 0.2 percent for the 48 weeks. Same-store sales were
down 3.6 percent in December and 1.7 percent for the year to date.
   Penney attributed its recent sales decline to the fact it had
discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year. Penney
said it would have recorded a gain if sales from the discontinued
items had been excluded from its year-earlier results.
   Greenstein, of Bear Stearns, said Penney may also have been too
conservative with its inventory, leaving its stores with too little
merchandise.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales picked up 12.6 percent
during December and 14.3 percent for the year to date. Its
same-store sales rose 6.6 percent for the month and 2.7 percent for
the 48 weeks.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 30 percent
last month, and 18.7 percent for the year to date. Same-stores sales
were up 10 percent in December and 3.5 percent so far this year.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported overall sales increases of 14.7
percent for the month and 12.3 percent so far this year. Woolworth
said its same-store sales rose 9.3 percent in December and 6.4
percent for the 48 weeks.
   Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. said its sales rose 7.6 percent in December
and 4.4 percent so far this year.
   The results were from the biggest general merchandise and apparel
retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the
federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers,
supermarkets or restaurants.

   Technical factors and optimism about OPEC's new
production-cutting agreement have helped push oil futures prices
higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate oil, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose
34 cents to close Thursday at $17.42 a barrel. The contract lost 28
cents on Wednesday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the February
contract for home heating oil closed at 53.47 cents a gallon, up
0.82 cent, after falling 0.58 cent Wednesday.
   February wholesale unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.05 cent in
the previous session, ended up 0.08 cent to 47.40 cents a gallon.
   Jerry Samuels, an energy analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., attributed the stronger market tone to a combination of
technical factors and general optimism that the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will adhere to new
output quotas that took effect Jan. 1.
   ``The market appears to be giving OPEC the benefit of the doubt,
at least until we see the actual production figures,'' Samuels said.
   On the technical side, he said, the market was boosted by the
fact that WTI has remained above $17 a barrel.

<HEAD>Speculator Pleads Innocent, Wants to Get Back into the Takeover Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After pleading innocent to fraud charges,
takeover speculator Paul Bilzerian said he hopes to clear his name
and resume hunting for companies to buy.
   ``My role going forward was to have been, and should still be, to
look for further acquisitions,'' Bilzerian told reporters Thursday
after his arraignment in federal court in Manhattan.
   Bilzerian, which is also chairman of Singer Co., was indicted
Dec. 21 by a federal grand jury on a dozen felony counts linked to
four failed takeover situations in 1985 and 1986. The charges are
part of a network of securities fraud prosecutions tracing
indirectly back to the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal that
broke more than two years ago.
   The 38-year-old financier's lawyer, Arthur Mathews, told
reporters his client will be cleared.
   ``Mr. Bilzerian is innocent. It's unfortunate these charges were
brought. It's burdensome to defend them, but they will be defended
and he will be vindicated,'' Mathews said.
   After Bilzerian entered his plea, he was ordered to entrust his
passport to Mathews. He was freed on a $500,000 personal
recognizance bond pending trial, scheduled for May 1 before U.S.
District Judge Robert J. Ward. The trial is expected to last six to
eight weeks.
   None of the charges relate to Bilzerian's takeover of Singer, a
defense contractor he acquired a year ago for $1.06 billion after a
protracted struggle.
   That takeover marked Bilzerian's first major acquisition, and he
has since been selling off parts of the company. Bilzerian told
reporters Thursday that his indictment is ``really not having any
impact on Singer.''
   A former real estate speculator who resides in Tampa, Fla.,
Bilzerian is one of the most prominent figures to be implicated thus
far in an expanding federal crackdown on securities trading abuse.
   He was accused in the indictment of a pattern of violations that
helped him amass millions of dollars in wealth through hostile
takeover maneuvering aided in part by Jefferies &amp; Co., a Los Angeles
brokerage that allegedly bought stock on Bilzerian's behalf under a
secret, illegal arrangement.
   The companies allegedly targeted by Bilzerian were Hammermill
Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co., Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. and Armco Inc.
   Evidence for the indictment was partly supplied by Boyd L.
Jefferies, founder of the Jefferies brokerage, who himself was
implicated in securities fraud in early 1987 by Boesky, the
now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidence in exchange
for lenient treatment.

<HEAD>Pressure Intensifies on Top Drexel Financier To Capitulate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pressure is mounting on Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond financier Michael Milken to strike a
plea deal with prosecutors who have been investigating his financial
dealings.
   Sources familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition
they not be identified, confirmed on Thursday press reports that his
firm agreed to expel him and withhold his 1988 compensation as part
of its record settlement of criminal fraud charges.
   Milken, one of the most powerful financiers of the 1980s, is
expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges shortly
unless he agrees to plead guilty in exchange for more lenient
treatment.
   But Milken has repeatedly asserted innocence.
   Drexel, which had stood by Milken for more than two years in
asserting innocence, agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from
its links with the now-imprisoned inside trader Ivan F. Boesky.
   The nation's fifth-largest investment firm said it would pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution, admit guilt to six
felony counts and cooperate in the government's expanding probes of
Wall Street corruption, in effect making Drexel a source of evidence
against Milken.
   The financier has faced tremendous pressure to reach a plea
agreement because of Drexel's reversed position. But lawyers said
his expulsion from a firm he helped build into a powerhouse,
compounded by the withholding of compensation due him, provided even
more of an incentive for him to capitulate.
   ``The pressure mounting on Milken is just so intense now,'' said
one former assistant U.S. attorney now in private practice in New
York. ``He's getting it from all directions.''
   Milken is said to be one of the wealthiest investment bankers in
the country, but forfeiture of his lucrative annual compensation
from Drexel could seriously crimp his legal warchest for fighting
criminal charges.
   He has never disclosed his annual compensation but once was
quoted as saying he has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in
taxes and given millions more to charitable foundations.
   Milken and his small team of aides reportedly earned more than
$250 million in annual bonuses alone in 1986. He also is said to own
a 6 percent interest in Drexel, which is privately held but
extremely profitable. It was unclear how his expulsion from the firm
would affect that stake.
   Drexel's settlement of criminal charges, reached Dec. 21 with the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, was contingent on a Jan. 10
settlement of parallel civil charges against Drexel filed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Senior emissaries from Drexel have been meeting with SEC officers
in Washington to negotiate the settlement, where terms of Milken's
departure were said to be reached. A source familiar with those
discussions said Thursday they have been ``without acrimony and
positive in spirit.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the SEC was
seeking to alter the structure of Drexel's operations in so-called
junk bonds, the high-yield debt securities pioneered by Milken into
a $175 billion market.
   Quoting unspecified sources, the Journal said SEC negotiators
want Drexel to transfer supervision of the junk-bond unit, which is
based in Beverly Hills near Milken's home, to New York where Drexel
is headquartered.
   In addition, the Journal said the SEC wants to approve a
compliance officer that would monitor Drexel's trading operations
and other activities.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on any aspect
of the negotiations with the SEC. Kenneth Lerer, a public relations
executive who speaks on Milken's behalf, also declined to comment.
   SEC spokesman Chiles Larson said the enforcement agency was not
commenting on the Drexel matter.

<TEXT>
   A top lawyer defending GAF Corp. against stock
manipulation charges hammered away at the credibility of the
government's star witness, who admitted he'd discarded records that
documented the alleged crime.
   Defense attorney Arthur Liman's grilling of former securities
broker Boyd Jefferies dominated Thursday's session in the trial of
GAF and one of its senior officers, now in its third week at
Manhattan federal court.
   The defense also repeated an earlier request for a mistrial on
grounds the government withheld evidence suggesting a key document
was tampered with. U.S. District Judge Mary J. Lowe declined to rule
on the mistrial motion and gave no indication when she would do so.
   The trial has attracted widespread interest because GAF and vice
chairman James Sherwin are the first defendants in a federal
crackdown on securities fraud to reach the trial phase. They have
vowed to vindicate themselves.
   In addition, GAF also is the first industrial concern implicated
in a network of criminal probes emanating from the 1986 downfall of
inside trader Ivan F. Boesky, now serving a three-year prison term
for securities fraud.
   The trial also marks the court debut of Jefferies, himself a
victim of Boesky's disclosures to federal prosecutors. Jefferies is
the lead witness in the GAF case and at least two other prosecutions.
   He has claimed his Los Angeles brokerage, Jefferies &amp; Co.,
arranged to manipulate up the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in
late 1986 at the behest of GAF, which had abandoned a takeover
attempt of the larger chemical company and wanted to sell its chunk
of Carbide at a maximum profit.
   Jefferies testified earlier this week that Sherwin had guaranteed
his brokerage against loss for the alleged manipulation. Jefferies
ultimately lost about $40,000 and Sherwin promised to pay it through
a phony invoice for investment banking charges, the broker testified.
   Under Liman's cross-examination, Jefferies admitted he'd thrown
out records kept on legal-size yellow pads of the transaction after
he was implicated in securities fraud by Boesky. Jefferies agreed to
turn state's evidence on March 16, 1987, about five months after the
alleged manipulation took place.
   ``Yes they (the legal pads) were thrown out,'' Jefferies said.
``My secretary and I cleaned out my office on March 30, 1987.''
   He described it as a routine housecleaning.
   Under further questioning, Jefferies said he couldn't remember
why the alleged agreement with GAF wasn't included in details of a
plea bargain he made with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
federal prosecutors.
   The 58-year-old broker resigned from Jefferies after Boesky
implicated him in securities fraud. Jefferies himself has agreed to
plead guilty to two felony counts, for which he could face a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.

   The Ford Thunderbird Super Coupe has been named
Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 1989, the first time the
prestigious announcement has been made at a Detroit auto show.
   Selection of the Thunderbird SC on Thursday represents the third

honor.
   The supercharged Thunderbird, which went on sale in December
after months of media exposure, was chosen because it ``offers
everything a personal luxury car buyer could ever want ... speed,
style, comfort, convenience and value,'' the magazine said in its
February issue.
   The car is built at Ford's Lorain, Ohio, assembly plant beside
the Mercury Cougar.
   The magazine's 1986 car of the year was the Ford Taurus, and in
1987, it was the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe. Last year, the award went

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in
December, a 14-year-low, with the service sector leading the way in
the creation of 279,000 new jobs, the government reported today.
   In its final unemployment report of the Reagan presidency, the
Labor Department said the jobless rate dropped 0.1 percentage point
from November, reaching 5.3 percent for the third time this year.
   The unemployment rate hit 5.3 percent in June and October. That
was the lowest point since it was 5.1 percent in May 1974.
   The department said that 3,798,000 jobs were created in 1988, the
most since 1984, when employers reporting adding 3.95 million people
to their payrolls.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said 3 million
of the new jobs last year were on the service side of the economy,
including 700,000 in retail trade.
   The stock market had rallied on Thursday in anticipation of
today's jobless report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.86 points on
Thursday to 2,190.54, surpassing its 1988 closing peak of 2,183.50
reached Oct. 21.
   It was the highest level for the Dow Jones industrial average
since it stood at 2,246.74 on Oct. 16, 1987, the day before it lost
508 points on what became known as ``Black Monday.''
   The December sales gains reported by the large retailers exceeded
many analysts' expectations.
   They estimated industrywide sales rose in a range of 6 percent to
7.5 percent, an improvement over the 6 percent gain forecast before
the start of the season.
   ``It turned out to be a good Christmas,'' Jeffrey Edelman, a
retail industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said.
   The outcome came as a surprise because retailers, mired in a
sales slump since early 1987, expected their customers to continue
shopping cautiously this season. Consumers, burdened by debt and
paying more for services and necessities, have been forced to cut
back on their retail outlays.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall December sales rose 12.1 percent, while K mart Corp. said
its overall sales were up 10.7 percent for the month.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 31 percent in
December but J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales fell 1.5
percent for the month.
   Booming year-end car and truck sales at General Motors Corp. and
a jump in car sales at Ford Motor Co. contributed to overall
increases in domestic sales of cars and light trucks in 1988.
   Manufacturers said sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks
averaged 44,477 a day in the Dec. 21-31 period, up 20.7 percent from
the same period in 1987.
   For the year, domestic car and light-truck sales reached 11.7
million, averaging 38,060 a day in 1988, up 7.5 percent from 1987.
   Imported car and light truck sales in 1988 slumped to 3.7
million, an average of 12,087 a day, compared with 4.1 million, or
13,229 a day, in 1987.
   Combined domestic and foreign car and light truck sales totaled
15.4 million in 1988, up from 14.9 million in 1987 and approaching
the 15.7 million of 1985, the second-best sales year ever. The
record year was 1986, when 16.3 million vehicles were sold.

   The North American International Auto Show may be
intended as a showcase for domestic and foreign automakers, but
gadgets also on display _ such as compact disk players, television
sets and other electronic devices _ are themselves a tribute to high
technology.
   Recent advances in computer chips are the reason for the
explosion of gadgets being exhibited alongside the 700 or so
vehicles at the season's first automotive show.
   Dozens of cars have on-board computers that buzz, flash or beep
to tell drivers about engine performance, fluid levels and the
climate inside and outside the vehicle. Without chips, these gadgets
wouldn't exist.
   One of the most complicated items is an optional video display
screen inside an Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo that can help a driver
keep track of dozens of things, ranging from how much oil is in the
crankcase to what appointments he has scheduled the next day.
   By touching the screen at the center of the dashboard, a driver
or passenger can change the radio station, alter the temperature in
the car or learn the compass direction in which the car is traveling.
   But the screen doesn't come cheap. It's a $3,000 option that,
until May, can be had for $2,000. There's a mock up of a front seat
and dashboard in the Oldsmobile exhibit in Cobo Hall here so
show-goers can see how it works.
   Other cars, including some made by the Acura division of Honda,
have odometers that can figure mileage left in a trip and fuel
economy.
   One of the cars getting the most attention at the show is the
Lexus LS400, a luxury car by Toyota Motor Corp. slated to go on sale
beginning this fall.
   In the trunk, on the right side, is a compact disk player that
can hold up to six CDs. On the dashboard are controls for the unit,
which is a standard feature on a car expected to retail for about
$40,000.
   ``I think you're seeing a tremendous amount of minor changes,''
analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York said Thursday
while at the show, which opens to the public Saturday and runs
through Jan. 15.
   He and other analysts have said that overall, 1989 model cars and
trucks don't offer much that is new. But big changes are due in the
1990s, they said.

<HEAD>Former Securities President to Cooperate in Stock Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal probe arising out of shady dealings
that surfaced during the market crash of October 1987 has taken the
government's crackdown on securities fraud in a new direction,
officials say.
   The crackdown that began in 1986 already has resulted in several
well-publicized cases of insider trading and other securities abuse.
   But the stock market crash unveiled a new breed of manipulators,
according to authorities who on Thursday described the case of
Stanley Aslanian Jr., 29, former president of a now-defunct
securities firm, the Haas Securities Corp.
   Stocks pushed by the company surged during the Oct. 19, 1987
crash, but then the company faltered and the investigation began
once ``Haas went out of business nine days'' after the crash as
customers complained, Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Lieb said.
   Now, officials say he has promised federal investigators he will
assist their probe of his firm's actions.
   ``The heady days of pre-Oct. 19 gave birth to this case,'' his
lawyer, Kalman Gallop said. ``It is probably one of 1,000 tragedies
from that day.''
   The stock manipulation undertaken by the 75-year-old company with
12,000 customers and four offices nationwide is indicative of
similar problems in the industry, authorities said.
   ``We have seen a proliferation of these kinds of activities since
the crash,'' James C. Esposito, an assistant deputy director of the
FBI, said at a news conference at U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's
Manhattan office.
   Most of the notable securities cases have stemmed from the
insider trading scandal that started with the guilty plea of Dennis
B. Levine in 1986.
   The new investigation by the FBI, Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. attorney's office begins with Aslanian, who
was expected to plead guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to
one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud by manipulating
stock, Giuliani said.
   The defendant faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in
fines.
   Giuliani said he hoped Aslanian's deal would ``encourage others
to do what Mr. Aslanian did. It's a very significant and helpful
thing to do.''
   Haas Securities went out of business Oct. 28, 1987, after
Aslanian was involved in manipulating millions of dollars worth of
stocks, officials said.
   Gallop said Haas Securities is now in Chapter 7 liquidation
proceedings in Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
   Gallop said ``millions and millions of dollars'' were involved
but profits could not be easily determined. Aslanian declined to
comment.
   Lieb said the case involved the manipulation of four stocks: TS
Industries from the Salt Lake City area; Big O Tires; Flores de New
Mexico and Cliff Engle Ltd.
   The information alleges that the scheme lasted from June 1985
until November 1987.

   The stock market gained ground today, extending
the early-1989 rally that has carried the Dow Jones industrial
average to its highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.60 points to
2,197.14 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 524 up, 250
down and 441 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.47 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in December from
5.4 percent the month before. Accompanying data showed a 279,000
increase in nonfarm payroll employment.
   The report signalled persistent strength in the economy, and did
nothing to relieve expectations on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign to keep
inflation from reviving.
   However, the numbers were pretty much in line with advance
estimates on the Street, and thus came as no great surprise to
traders.
   Analysts said portfolio managers at investing institutions were
continuing to buy stocks to put some of their large cash reserves to
work at the start of a new year.
   Among the blue chips, General Motors rose { to 84|; Eastman Kodak
] to 45|; International Business Machines \ to 122{, and General
Electric ] to 45.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.55 to 158.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .19 at 309.61.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.86 to
2,190.54, surpassing its 1988 closing high of 2,183.50 reached on
Oct. 21.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 821 up, 604 down and 512 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 174.04 million shares, against 149.70
million in the previous session.

   Chinese software developers will write programs
for overseas customers in a joint venture with a U.S. conglomerate
that was launched Friday.
   UniHorn Inc., a San Francisco-based subsidiary of Unison Inc.,
joined with six institutes of the Chinese Aerospace Ministry and
China Great Wall Industry Corp., which is trying to sell Chinese
satellite-launching services.
   The venture is called Astro-UniHorn Computer Technology Co.
   The research institutes have several thousand people who already
have developed software that ``is very interesting and can be
commercialized and shows a lot of potential,'' UniHorn Vice
President James H. Spear Jr. said.
   The joint venture will develop and package the software for
international markets, including the United States, Spear said.
Projects will include software that enables computers to do
engineering design work, called computer-aided design, he said. He
refused to give specifics.
   Although Great Wall Industry Corp. is trying to sell Chinese
satellite-launching services abroad, the joint venture does not plan
any projects in aerospace or missiles, Spear said.
   ``We're not focused that way and we don't believe our Chinese
partners are focused that way,'' he said. He said UniHorn sought out
the Chinese partners because of their low-cost expertise.
   The research institutes have had their budgets cut in recent
years and are interested in doing outside work, Spear said, adding
that the venture also could help develop China's infant computer
industry.
   Most Chinese computer-related companies have merely adapted
foreign hardware and software.
   Unison has four other joint ventures in China, including the
Great Wall Hotel in Beijing, one of the city's largest hotels
directed at foreign tourists.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures prices opened a bit
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade but wheat futures
retreated slightly, reflecting nervousness about next week's
Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report, which is due out on Wednesday afternoon, will contain
the government's first estimates of 1989 planted acreage plus new
grain-surplus tallies and the final 1988 crop production numbers.
   Analysts said the early strength in the soybean market stemmed
from strong spot prices for soybean meal, possibly linked to new
purchases by the Soviet Union.
   The USDA has denied rumors that it plans to expand to 20 million
metric tons the maximum amount of U.S. grain the Soviets may
purchase annually under the long-term grain agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   But analysts say such an expansion is almost certain, since the
Soviets already are approaching the current maximum of 16 million
metric tons.
   ``Our sources feel there is a high probability the maximum will
be extended,'' said Steve Freed, a grain market analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``We feel it's a done deal.''
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.47 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to { cent higher with March at $2.87 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to \ cent higher with March at $2.45 a bushel; soybeans were 3\
cents to 5{ cents higher with January at $8.17 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in February at 73.42 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .05 cent lower to .22 cent higher with January at 84.67
cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 47.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent
to .30 cent higher with February at 44.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed higher on Thursday.

   William Collins PLC said Friday it would recommend
shareholders accept a takeover bid by publisher Rupert Murdoch's
News International PLC which values the British publishing company
at $725 million.
   News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp., has
provided Collins with assurances of editorial independence which it
had sought in exchange for recommending the takeover bid.
   ``Collins will remain free to pursue its existing editorial
policy of publishing authors with a wide variety of beliefs and
views,'' News International said in a statement.
   News International said it controls 54 percent percent of
Collins' voting stock and has offered $15.84 a share for the
remainder of the Collins shares it doesn't already own.
   News International originally bid only $527 million for Collins,
an offer scorned by the publisher as ``ludicrously low.''
   But Murdoch raised his offer by 37 percent to $725 million
following an identical rival bid by Groupe de la Cite, France's
second largest book publisher.
   Groupe de la Cite approached News International on Wednesday with
an improved offer for Collins on condition the Murdoch group would
sell its voting stake in Collins. But News International refused and
the French firm withdrew its offer.
   News International, a publisher of newspapers and magazines in
Britain, first gained a major stake in Collins in 1981 in an earlier
takeover attempt.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said early Thursday that
he would not refer the News International bid to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, which has the power to prevent mergers deemed
harmful to competition.
   Bryan Gould, the opposition Labor Party's trade and industry
spokesman, called on the government Friday to halt the takeover and
refer Murdoch's entire media empire to the commission.
   ``Government indifference to Rupert Murdoch's bid for the
publishers Collins underlines once again that Tory media supporters
are immune from any normal competition policy,'' Gould said in a
letter to Young.
   ``Press, media and publishing businesses are already far too
concentrated in this country, with Rupert Murdoch the worst
offender,'' he said.
   Murdoch's media empire spans the globe, with television,
newspaper and magazine interests concentrated in the United States
and Britain.
   Murdoch owns five national newspapers in Britain, the Times of
London, The Sunday Times, Today, News of the World and The Sun, and
has interests in satellite television.
   Around midday on the London Stock Exchange, News International
shares were up 1 penny (2 cents) at 214 pence ($3.85), while Collins
shares were off 12 pence (22 cents) at 870 pence ($15.66).

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose
Friday, boosted by more speculative buying and another jump in the
dollar.
   The major dollar-earning companies turned in another strong
performance as the U.S. currency rose sharply following the release
of U.S. employment data in the afternoon.
   Dollar stocks provided a firm underpinning for the market, which
was otherwise preoccupied by another bout of speculative buying in
the leading shares.
   Various rumors about the progress of General Electric Co. and
Siemens AG's joint 1.7 billion pound bid for Plessey Co. prompted
heavy trading in General Electric's and Plessey stock. The stores
sector, which has suffered recently from higher British interest
rates, also saw active trading.
   The FT-SE 100 index closed 11.8 points, or .66 percent, higher at
1811.3.
   The Financial Times 30 share index closed 9.8 points higher at
1481.3. Volume was a moderate 456.2 million shares, up from 448.0
million shares a day earlier.
   The market opened on a nervous note as Chase Manhattan announced
it would withdraw from trading in British equities.
   Several U.S. brokerage firms recently have trimmed their British
operations, citing low trading volume following last year's stock
market crash and strong competition among market makers in the wake
of the Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial
markets.
   Last month, Citicorp and Smith Barney Harris Upham International
Inc. said they were cutting back their equity trading operations in
Britain. The market managed to shake off the Chase news, helped by
the stronger dollar. After some uncertainty before release of U.S.
employment data, the market climbed to the day's high in the
afternoon.
   GEC, which is not related to the U.S. company of the same name,
closed 4 pence higher at 202 pence amid heavy trading.
   A total 16 million GEC shares changed hands before the close.
Trading was also active in GEC options. More than 3,000 GEC
contracts were traded, the second most heavily traded stock on the
options market Friday after British Gas.
   Plessey shares advanced 4 pence to 228 pence after GEC@Siemens
entered the market for the first time since launching their bid to
purchase 5 million Plessey shares, less than 1 percent of the total.
   The Financial Times 500 share index was 1019.89, up 6.80.

<HEAD>Mutual Funds In '88: Bad Year For Gold, Good For Growth Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold bugs lost their shirts in 1988 but investors
in small, fast-growing companies scored healthy gains, according to
a tally of the best- and worst-performing mutual funds.
   The Kaufmann Fund scored the year's biggest gain, 58.6 percent,
through a strategy of picking small companies that showed potential
for rapid growth.
   In contrast, 15 of the worst-performing mutual funds invested in
gold mining companies or other companies involved in gold and
precious metals.
   The fund at the bottom of the list, American Asset Yield, which
lost 54.6 percent, was an exception to the gold rule. The fund, with
assets of less than $100,000, tried to focus on companies that pay
big dividends.
   The results are from a quarterly survey by Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. The tally assumes that investors reinvest all
dividends and capital gains distributions that the funds pay out.
   Of the 20 categories, the top 15 were closely bunched in
performance, with average growth ranging from 11.05 percent for
health and biotechnology funds to a high of 18.99 percent for
small-company growth funds.
   ``While there were some exceptions, in general, 1988 was a
remarkably normal year,'' said A. Michael Lipper, the firm's
president.
   The only category that declined in 1988 besides gold was
adjustable rate preferred funds, which fell 2.30 percent, far less
than the average decline oof 14.54 percent for gold-oriented funds.
   Gold funds are notoriously erratic: In 1987, the year of the
stock market crash, they outperformed all others to post a 35.66
percent gain.
   The Kaufmann Fund, although it came out on top for 1988, has an
erratic history. The 2-year-old fund has slightly more than $5
million in assets, and more than half its assets are in less than 10
stocks, the Wall Street Journal said Friday.

   West Virginia's securities division said
Friday it will use subpoena powers if necessary to force Wall Street
brokers to reveal how much in commissions they made from a state
fund that lost an estimated $212 million in 1987.
   In addition, the state is asking the Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate possible wrongdoing in the case, state
securities chief Jack Hall said.
   ``We mean to look closely at the relationship between the brokers
and the people who conducted the transactions. There were a
tremendous number of trades conducted and a large amount of
commissions generated,'' Hall said. ``I'm going to attempt to find
out how much in the way of commissions were generated.''
   Hall said he has forwarded to the SEC substantial amounts of
material concerning the losses in the consolidated investment fund
in April, May and June 1987.
   By Dec. 31, 1987, the fund had $1.78 billion, but it had
undergone sales during the year of $80.5 billion. Treasurer A. James
Manchin said his office did not keep a record of the commissions
made by the 42 brokerage firms handling transactions during that
period.
   State Republican Party Chairman Edgar ``Hike'' Heiskell suggested
on Dec. 20 that the U.S. attorney's office investigate whether the
fund was being ``churned,'' a brokerage term used to describe
massive purchases and sales that produce no profit for the
portfolio, but handsome commissions for brokers. Churning is illegal.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey has confirmed his office is involved
in the investigation.
   Hall said his office began calling brokerage houses Friday to
tell them he wants the information.
   Hall said he will follow his initial telephone call with a
letter, asking each broker to send the commission information within
five to 10 days.
   ```We're going to demand they be forthcoming on all
transactions,'' Hall said.
   Hall said the SEC is reviewing material he sent to the office to
determine ``whether federal securities laws have been violated.''
   The independent auditing firm Touche Ross &amp; Co., which initially
uncovered the losses in November, is expected to make its final
report public in mid-January. The Legislature's Commission on
Special Investigations also is investigating the losses.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
the early-1989 rally that has carried the Dow Jones industrial
average to its highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips rose 13.21 points to
2,203.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 951 up, 478 down and
508 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in December from
5.4 percent the month before. Accompanying data showed a 279,000
increase in nonfarm payroll employment.
   The report signalled persistent strength in the economy, and did
nothing to relieve expectations on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign to keep
inflation from reviving.
   However, the numbers were pretty much in line with advance
estimates on the Street, and thus came as no great surprise to
traders.
   Analysts said portfolio managers at investing institutions were
continuing to buy stocks to put some of their large cash reserves to
work at the start of a new year.
   Among the blue chips, General Motors rose 2 to 86[; Eastman Kodak
[ to 45]; Procter &amp; Gamble 1 to 86|, and General Electric { to 45[.
   National Medical Enterprises jumped 2{ to 24|. The company said
it plans to spin off its Hillhaven Corp. subsidiary, which operates
nursing homes.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.96 to 158.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.53 at 310.95.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 134.24 million shares with an

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher
Friday in a mostly technical rally on the Chicago Board of Trade
while grain futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Soybeans advanced despite forecasts for a rainy weekend in the
South American soybean belt, where a recent dry spell had prompted
concern about the newly planted crop.
   In addition to bullish technical market signals, soybean buying
was spurred by expectations that next week's Agriculture Department
crop report will underline the tight supply situation caused by the
past summer's drought, analysts said.
   ``The stocks-to-usage ratio is one of the tightest in the last 30
years,'' said Mickey Luth, soybean market analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   The USDA report, which will be released Wednesday afternoon, will
contain the government's first estimates of 1989 planted acreage
plus grain-surplus tallies and the final 1988 crop production
numbers.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 2} cents lower to { cent

<HEAD>Honeywell Bull Cutting About 1,600 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Bull Inc. announced Thursday it is
cutting 1,600 jobs in the United States, a reduction analysts said
reflects weakening demand for the company's large mainframe
computers.
   The cuts will reduce the company's workforce about 6 percent and
will include manufacturing and administration jobs at several plants
in Massachusetts and in Phoenix, Ariz., Honeywell Bull said.
   The company said it hopes to achieve the cuts through early
retirements and attrition in addition to layoffs. It said 900
employees are eligible for early retirement at the Billerica-based
company.
   Honeywell Bull will have a worldwide workforce of 18,100 after
the cuts.
   Analysts said the cuts reflect a decline in the mainframe
computer market, geared toward sophisticated scientific applications
used principally in defense and aerospace industries.
   ``It's a recognition of what's going on,'' said Jeremy
Tennenbaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
``When all is said and done the market for scientific computers
outside the Defense Department and big aerospace companies has yet
to take off.''
   ``The weakness of federal demand for large systems means it's
going to be tough sledding for everyone in the industry, especially
if you're a new entrant,'' he said.
   Honeywell Bull said the reductions are not linked to an ongoing
ownership restructuring of the company, which was formed in March
1987 as a joint venture of France's Groupe Bull, Honeywell Inc. of
Minneapolis and NEC Corp. of Japan.
   Groupe Bull last week acquired 22.6 percent of the company from
Honeywell, giving it a 65.1 percent ownership. Honeywell owns 19.9
percent and NEC 15 percent.
   Honeywell Bull President Roland Pampel said the layoffs,
scheduled to be completed by mid-March, were taken to try to improve
the company's competitive position by cutting costs and improving
productivity.
   Pampel, who took over Honeywell Bull last July, said the change
marks a continuing consolidation. ``We're streamlining it, reacting
to things we must do from a productivity point of view,'' he said in
an interview.
   Pampel denied that the change indicated a slump in the mainframe
market, and said a new line of computers introduced in November was
``very well received by customers.''
   Honeywell Bull, which moved to Billerica last September, has
offices in the United States, Italy, the Great Britain, Canada,
Australia, Mexico and Asia. It reported 1987 profits of $17.4
million, less than 1 percent of revenues of $2.06 billion.
   Honeywell allied with Groupe Bull and NEC to take advantage of
the similar computer designs of all three companies. In the 1960s,
when Japan and Europe were minor forces in the computer industry,
Honeywell had licensed designs to the two companies.
   The three parent companies remain independent apart from
Honeywell Bull, which is completing a restructuring expected to
include a name change.

<HEAD>Millionaire Health Crusader Poorer But Says Consumers Richer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillionaire is $2 million poorer, but
he's convinced American consumers are richer as the result of his
one-man quest to rid food of highly saturated tropical oils he calls
poison.
   ``It's a story of the little guy against the giant and the giant
is backing down,'' said Omaha businessman Phil Sokolof, who spends
almost all his time on his anti-cholesterol campaign.
   The 66-year-old Sokolof poured $2 million into nationwide
newspaper advertising in an effort to persuade the public to stop
buying foods high in saturated fat because of tropical oils, chiefly
coconut oil and palm oil.
   Saturated fats increase blood cholesterol levels, which can lead
to heart attacks.
   Sokolof has claimed victory over four major food processors _
Kellogg's, Sunshine Biscuits, Pepperidge Farm and Keebler.
   Keebler became the latest corporate trophy head in Sokolof's
health crusade when its president announced Wednesday that all
tropical oil, lard and beef fat would be removed from Keebler
products.
   ``I think it's great for the American public that thousands of
lives will be extended because there are now four major companies
that are reformulating literally hundreds of products to eliminate
tropical oils,'' he said.
   Sokolof, who blames high cholesterol for a near-fatal heart
attack he suffered 22 years ago, said he is honored to be referred
to by health news writers as ``America's No. 1 cholesterol fighter.''
   ``I think I got that title because it is vacant. There is no
Ralph Nader of the cholesterol world,'' he said.
   His ad campaign targets foods that are high in saturated fats,
yet portrayed as healthful through such label claims as ``no
cholesterol,'' ``low-salt,'' ``non-dairy'' and ``made with 100
percent vegetable shortening.''
   ``You can say it has no cholesterol, but if you eat palm oil and
coconut oil, they turn into cholesterol inside your body,'' Sokolof
said.
   ``Amost everyone has known that fatty meats and ... most dairy
products are high in cholesterol and saturated fat. But they didn't
know about coconut oil and palm oil. Hopefully they do now.''
   Keebler President Thomas Garvin told the Washington Post that the
change in his company's food formulas had no connection with
Sokolof's campaign. He accused Sokolof of sensationalizing the issue.
   Brian Dobson, a spokesman for Sunshine Biscuits, made similar
comments when he announced last month that Sunshine would eliminate
palm oil and palm kernel from its cookie and cracker products.
   Sokolof, however, said he was confident his full-page ads warning
of the ``poisoning of America'' helped put public pressure on the
corporations to respond to consumers' concerns.
   ``It's pretty coincidental that four of the majors did that
within two months of my first ad, isn't it?'' he asked. His favorite
example is Kellogg's and its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal.
   ``To start with, they (Kellogg's corporate officers) said I was
irresponsible. They said I was practicing quackery. Then two weeks
later they called and asked to take them out of the ads because they
were going to take tropical oils out of the cereal,'' he said.
   Sokolof's biggest single-day expenditure was $140,000 to place
full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
   He also advertised in the New York Times and New York Post, but
some newspapers, including the Washington Post, objected to the term
``poison'' and refused to run the ads.
   His initial advertising blitz in November singled out Kellogg's
Cracklin' Oat Bran, Sunshine's Hydrox cookies, Pepperidge Farm's
Goldfish crackers, Keebler's Club crackers, Nabisco's Triscuit
crackers, Procter &amp; Gamble's Crisco shortening and three non-dairy
coffee creamers _ Coffee Swirl from Kraft, Carnation's Coffeemate
and Borden's Creamora.
   ``There is still a long way to go. Nabisco has 50 products with
coconut or palm oil,'' Sokolof said.
   Sokolof declined to discuss his wealth, except to confirm he is a
multimillionaire and say that the $2 million expenditure has not
placed much of a dent in his net worth.
   The energetic widower describes himself as a workaholic.
   He made his fortune in his father's Omaha-based construction
business, Phillips Manufacturing Co. He founded the National Heart
Savers Association in 1985, supporting it largely through his own
contributions.
   His name became synonymous with the fight against fatty foods
after he offered free cholesterol tests on Capitol Hill. His
promotional packets include endorsement letters signed by dozens of
congressmen and senators.
   ``People who get involved with our campaign actually feel like
they have been misled and deceived by the food giants,'' he said.
   ``They can go to their food pantry and find three or four of
these products and throw them away. ... You and I can't control
world peace, but we can control what we eat.''

<HEAD>Thunderbird: Car of the Year Tough to Get</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. proudly boasts about receiving
Motor Trend's Car of the Year award for its new Thunderbird SC. But
don't fall in love with the car just yet _ only a few hundred of
them are available.
   The rest are delayed while Ford replaces defective crankshafts.
   Television advertisements, touting Ford as the winner of the
Motor Trend award in three of the last four years, carry a
disclaimer that the cars are available only in limited quantities.
   ``It's kind of ironic,'' said Christopher Merriman, a Ford dealer
in Flat Rock, Mich. ``But Ford is sticking to its original plan not
to bring the car out until it's ready.''
   Large supplies of the Thunderbird Super Coupe won't be available
until March, Ford Division General Manager Thomas Wagner said
Thursday.
   ``There's very few on the road today, but they are for sale out
there,'' he said.
   Max Jurosek, the company's vice president for car product
development, said during testing last August and September it was
decided that a forged iron crankshaft, instead of a cast iron one,
should be used in the Thunderbird SC and the Mercury Cougar XR7,
both of which are made at Ford's plant in Lorain, Ohio.
   ``The variability of the cast process meant we were getting a lot
of scrap,'' Wagner said. ``We wouldn't use them all.''
   Crankshafts change the up-and-down motion of pistons into rotary
motion that goes to wheels. Forged crankshafts, which are stamped
into shape, are stronger and more expensive than cast crankshafts,
shaped by pouring molten metal into molds.
   Crankshaft castings were produced by Ford at a factory in Canada.
The forged crankshafts are being made by Sumitomo Metal Co. in Japan.
   Sumitomo began shipping the forged crankshafts to Ford this month
and will deliver at least 50,000 a year, said Kiyoshi Imanishi,
sales and marketing manager for the Japanese company.
   Ford spokesman Bert Serre said 390 XR7s and Super Coupes were
built before the end of last year, and most were distributed inside
the company. Wagner said the cars with cast crankshafts pose no
safety problem.
   Ford officials said dealers have ordered about 25,000 Super
Coupes and 3,000 XR7s.
   Jack Nerad, executive editor of Motor Trend, said the magazine
wasn't aware of the crankshaft problem when it gave Thunderbird the
award, but it would have made no difference because ``our Car of the
Year test is not a durability test.''

   Northwest Airlines said Friday it has cut as
much as $50 off its lowest fares between Minneapolis-St. Paul and 19
U.S. destinations for a limited period.
   Tickets can be purchased at sale prices anytime through Jan. 31
for travel to be completed by midnight Feb. 28, said Jim McKeon,
district sales manager.
   To qualify for the lowest fares, passengers may fly anytime
during off-peak hours, which are noon Mondays through noon Thursdays
or noon Saturdays to noon Sundays.
   Northwest also reduced peak period discount fares for travel
during the remainder of the week. Seats, which are limited, must be
reserved at least seven days before travel, and passengers must stay
at their destinations over a Saturday night. Tickets are not
refundable.
   As examples of the savings, McKeon said roundtrip tickets to San
Antonio, Texas, are now available for $208, $50 off the lowest
discount fare. Seats to Fort Walton Beach, Fla., are $208 roundtrip,
$50 off the lowest discount, and roundtrip tickets to Austin, Texas,
are reduced by $50 to $208.
   Senior citizens at least 62 years old save an additional 10
percent off the sale fares.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Sharply; Gold Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply for a third straight day
Friday as traders interpreted comments by a West German official as
being bullish for the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices fell. In New York trading, Republic National Bank
quoted a bid of $406.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST,
down from $408.25 late Thursday. Gold also declined on overseas
markets.
   The dollar surged after Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of the
Bundesbank, said the West German central bank had not intervened
recently to influence exchange rates.
   Dealers said Schlesinger's remarks were taken to mean the central
bank did not intend to defend certain exchange levels, which would
allow the dollar to gain against the West German mark.
   However, the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve did enter the
market Friday to stem the dollar's rise against the mark, said Dan
Holland, an assistant vice president at Discount Corp. But the
dollar still put in a strong performance.
   On Thursday, Schlesinger said the Bundesbank would maintain a
slightly restrictive monetary policy to thwart inflationary
pressures in the West German economy. Those comments had a different
effect on the dollar, putting a slight damper on its rally that day.
   Holland said the Labor Department's announcement Friday that
civilian unemployment in December dropped from 5.4 percent to 5.3
percent had no effect on the dollar.
   However, foreign currency dealers said the dollar gained on the
news because it indicated strength in the U.S. economy and raised
the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates.
   Friday was the third consecutive day of strong gains for the
dollar. It began its advance Wednesday following news that U.S. jet
fighters had shot down two Libyan war planes over the Mediterranean
Sea.
   The British pound lost more than 4.5 cents against the dollar in
three trading sessions in London, where one pound cost $1.7797 late
Friday, cheaper for buyers than late Thursday's $1.7970. Sterling
also declined in New York, slipping to $1.7780 from late Thursday's
$1.7940.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late prices, included: 1.8170 West German marks, up from 1.7985;
1.54825 Swiss francs, up from 1.5380; 6.1985 French francs, up from
6.1415; 1,331.00 Italian lire, up from 1,318.50; and 1.19725
Canadian dollars, up from 1.9025.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late rates,
included: 1.8140 West German marks, up from 1.7955; 1.5475 Swiss

Dutch guilders, up from 2.0220; 1,330.50 Italian lire, up from

   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 125.97 Japanese yen, up
from Thursday's late 124.50. In London late Friday the dollar traded
higher at 126.40 yen, and in New York, it rose to 126.725 yen from
late Thursday's 125.975.
   Although gold prices fell, the metal remained resilient, traders
said, and was helped by increasing demand from Middle East buyers
worried about the U.S.-Libyan situation.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid $405.75 a troy
ounce, down from $407.75 on Thursday. The closing price in Zurich,
Switzerland, was $405.50 bid, down from $407.20.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at a bid $410.44, down from
$410.94.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $406.30 a
troy ounce from $407.90 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.97 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Thursday and the metal's lowest level since March
1987. However, silver edged higher on the Comex in New York, closing
at $5.988 a troy ounce in comparison to Thursday's $5.965.

<HEAD>GM's Smith: More Concerned Now than a Year Ago About '89</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith said
Friday his concern about the health of the U.S. automobile industry
in 1989 _ particularly the second half _ is growing.
   ``I'm more concerned now than I was a year ago,'' Smith said
before speaking to a luncheon meeting of the Economic Club of
Detroit. ``A year ago, we were predicting a good market and I felt
confident about it.
   ``I feel pretty good now about the first and second quarters,''
he added. ``I'm very concerned about the third and the fourth
quarter ... because we've got a new administration down there and I
hope that they solve that deficit problem.
   ``It's a more acute problem now. It's been festering for a year.''
   The 1988 calendar and model years were among the best in
automobile history with more than 15 million cars and light trucks
sold. Analysts and officials for GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have predicted a slower sales year in 1989.
   On other matters, Smith:
   _Said GM was negotiating with officials of the Soviet Union about
vehicle and component production in Russia. But he said no agreement
was close.
   ``I would hope all of us (GM, Ford and Chrysler) could sign an
agreement with the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   _Welcomed Nissan Motor Corp.'s and Toyota Motor Corp.'s new
luxury car lines being prepared for the U.S. market.
   ``I don't see that this is competition any different than
before,'' Smith said. ``If I had one wish, it would be that they
built (the cars) in the United States.''
   _Said quality and technology has improved in the U.S. auto
industry so much lately ``that if the Japanese market were to really
open up to us, we'd have an excellent competitive opportunity
there.''
   _Denied a report in Friday's Wall Street Journal that an
agreement had been reached with Toyota to produce pickup trucks at
the GM-Toyota plant in California. ``We are negotiating with them,
but we have not reached an agreement,'' he said.
   But when asked if an agreement to make such a vehicle at the New
United Motor Manufacturing Plant in Fremont, Calif., was close,
Smith said flatly, ``Yes.''
   _Called on the government to let industry take the lead in
environmental and safety issues. Smith suggested economic incentives
for companies to spur efforts to clean up the environment and
provide a safe workplace.
   ``Certainly, in a free society, you want to control people as
little as possible,'' he said, ``in our own society, that means
leaving most economic decisions to the marketplace.''

<HEAD>Steep Copper Sell-Off Linked To Exchange Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a sell-off linked to profit-taking and the dollar's
strength against the British pound.
   On other markets, coffee futures also plunged; cotton was sharply
higher; energy futures rose; precious metals, livestock, meat, grain
and soybean futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Copper settled 3.4 cents to 7.2 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in March at $1.36 a pound. Copper for spot delivery settled
at $1.478 a pound.
   Analysts said there had been no change in the bullish supply and
demand factors that helped boost the price of spot copper to a
record $1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8.
   ``There's no fresh news to account for the decline,'' said Peter
Cardillo, an analyst with the brokerage firm Josephthal &amp; Co. in New
York.
   New York-based analyst James Steel of Refco Inc., a large
commodities brokerage company, said the copper market was pressured
by arbitrage selling linked to the dollar's strength against the
pound.
   Copper futures are traded in dollars on the Commodity Exchange
and in pounds on the London Metal Exchange. When the shifting
exchange rate makes the dollar worth more in pounds, as happened
Friday, large-scale players can profit by simultaneously selling
copper on the Commodity Exchange and buying the same amount of
copper in London.
   ``They actually end up with a flat position (on the copper
market) but they make money on the currency exchange,'' Steel said.
   Analysts said the dollar was boosted by rising U.S. interest
rates, continuing tension in the Mediterranean and by the Labor
Department's announcement that civilian unemployment in December
dropped from 5.4 percent to 5.3 percent.
   The dollar's gain drew a negative reaction in the gold market but
silver futures advanced on perceptions that recent declines were
unwarranted, analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $2.20 lower with February at $408.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 2.7 cents higher with March at $6.075
a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures finished sharply lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange on speculative selling tied to bearish technical
market signals, analysts said.
   ``The fact that the market failed to push through the highs of
the last couple of days undermined the bullishness from a technical
perspective,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Coffee settled 3.5 cents to 5.25 cents lower with March at
$1.5772 a pound.
   Cotton futures surged in the final 20 minutes of trading on the
New York Cotton Exchange but analysts could cite no particular
reason for the advance.
   Cotton settled .50 cent to 1.69 cents higher with March at 59.82
cents a pound.
   Most energy futures rose modestly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 10 cents
higher with February at $17.55 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent to
.13 cent higher with February at 53.60 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent lower to .32 cent higher with February at
47.72 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures ended narrowly mixed ahead of the
Agriculture Department's quarterly U.S. hogs and pigs report.
   In the report, which was released after the close of trading, the
USDA estimated the nation's hog-and-pig herd at 55.3 million head as
of Dec. 1, a 1 percent increase over 1987's figure. The number was
slightly below most analysts' pre-report estimates and analysts said
they expected pork futures to open higher on Monday.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
February at 73.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower
to .08 cent higher with January at 84.35 cents a pound; live hogs
were .43 cent lower to .17 cent higher with February at 47.12 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with February at 44.45 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures closed moderately higher Friday in a mostly
technical rally on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures
finished narrowly mixed.
   In addition to bullish technical signals, soybean buying was
spurred by expectations that Wednesday's USDA crop report will
underline the tight supply situation caused by the past summer's
drought, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 2} cents lower to { cent higher with March at
$4.48} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with
March at $2.89 a bushel; oats were 2\ cents lower to \ cent higher
with March at $2.42} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6} cents
higher with January at $8.17} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures settled slightly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The contract for March delivery of the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index settled .40 point higher at 283.40. Each point is
worth $500.

<HEAD>Partners Approve Restructuring; CEO To Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partners of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., one of the best
known Big Eight accounting companies, voted to restructure the
organization and choose a new chief executive officer, the company
announced Friday.
   The overhaul is intended to update the 75-year-old firm and
better meet its clients' changing needs, said Duane R. Kullberg,
managing partner and chief executive officer.
   Kullberg, 56, is stepping down after nine years at the head of
Arthur Andersen, but will remain a partner.
   ``I think the decision (to choose a new CEO) comes from the fact
that we have a new beginning,'' Kullberg said. ``I think the system
needs a new start. It's time to pass it on to somebody else.''
   The first step in the transition will be nominating a new board
of 24 partners and choosing a new chief executive, company officials
said.
   The 2,200 Arthur Andersen partners approved the restructuring at
their annual meeting here. The move divides the company into two
branches: audit-tax practice and management consulting practice.
   ``What we've done, I think, is to create a new global partnership
model for the 21st century, and we think we've come there first and
I would reasonably expect others would copy,'' Kullberg said.
   With 231 offices in 49 countries, Arthur Andersen provides
accounting, audit, tax, management information consulting and
professional education services. The company recorded $2.8 billion
in fiscal 1988 revenues.
   The restructuring will allow Arthur Andersen to more easily bring
experts from anywhere in the world to work on a given account, as
opposed to the current, more localized operation, Kullberg said.
   ``Our clients operate globally and they need to be supported
globally,'' he said.
   Company officials said the restructuring plan was devised over
the past three months by a special task force of partners. It was
reviewed by the executive committee and board of partners in a
series of regional partners' meetings last December.
   Under the plan, the audit-tax and management-consulting practices
each will be headed by its own managing partner and will be
responsible for much of its own staff support. The change gives
individual partners more managerial discretion close to where the
client is served, Kullberg said.
   Each practice will be divided in three operating areas: the
Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and the Asia-Pacific
region.
   All the operations will be linked as a network under the
administration umbrella of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., Societe
Cooperative, which will be headed by a single chief executive
officer.
   ``Our practices in Europe and in Asia have already proven the
effectiveness of this method of operation,'' Kullberg said. ``By
adopting a structure that will further facilitate individual
initiative on a worldwide basis, clients everywhere will gain the
benefits.''
   Kullberg said some of Arthur Andersen's 44,000 employees may be
relocated under the restructuring, primarily managers.

   Unemployment dipped to 5.3 percent in December,
the government said Friday, matching a 14-year low as President
Reagan's eight years in office neared an end.
   The jobless rate averaged 5.5 percent for all of last year, down
from 6.2 percent in 1987.
   The Labor Department said December's civilian unemployment rate
was down 0.1 percentage point from November, hitting 5.3 percent for
the third time in 1988, the lowest level since the 5.1 percent of
May 1974.
   Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 new
jobs last month, bringing to nearly 3.8 million the number of jobs
created during the year, the most since 1984's total of 3.95
million, the department said.
   The report had little impact on Wall Street, where traders had
predicted the numbers, and the stock market posted a modest gain.
The unemployment figures did nothing to relieve expectations that
the Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign to
keep inflation from reviving.
   ``It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear,''
said economist Roger Brimmer of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting service. ``With the economy continuing to operate
at these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is,
inflation is going to keep creeping up.''
   Average hourly earnings, however, remained unchanged for the
third consecutive month at $9.45. This statistic is closely watched
for signs of inflation, but wage growth from December 1987 to
December 1988 was just 3.4 percent, behind the inflation rate of 4.4
percent.
   ``The economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are not
accelerating very much right now,'' said Washington-based economist
Michael K. Evans. ``But I still think there is higher inflation
ahead, perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it. We
could get a big jolt in inflation in January.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the figures ``indicate that the longest peacetime expansion
continued through its 73rd month. ... The economy is on a strong
footing and proceeding moderately and smoothly.''
   President-elect Bush, who takes over for Reagan in two weeks,
used the occasion to repeat his no-tax pledge.
   Asked whether the government could do anything to bring
unemployment down further, Bush was not specific but said: ``There's
a lot of things where we can help in an effort to move unemployment
lower. But one way to not do that is to slow the economy down by
going out there and raising taxes.''
   When Reagan took office in January 1981, unemployment was 7.5
percent. It rose to 10.8 percent late in the 1981-82 recession, the
highest level in four decades, before beginning to decline.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said 3 million
of the new jobs last year were on the service side of the economy,
including 700,000 in retail trade. More than 400,000 were in
manufacturing and 300,000 in construction.
   Rebounding exports helped in manufacturing, particularly the
machinery industry. Factory workers continued to average four hours
of overtime a week in December.
   Of the 279,000 new jobs in December, 107,000 were in the business
and health services industries. Retail trade added 52,000 new jobs
for the month, most of them in department stores during the
Christmas season.
   Manufacturers reported adding 34,000 people to their payrolls in
December, well behind the 85,000 monthly gain they averaged in
October and November.
   The department said the number of jobless people fell by 9,000 to
6,554,000 last month. It reported there were 950,000 ``discouraged
workers'' _ people who want jobs but are not included in the
unemployment rate because they have given up looking for work in the
belief that none is available. That figure has been constant since
early 1987.
   The number of workers employed part-time because they cannot find
full-time work also was unchanged over the past year, remaining at
5.3 million.
   An alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the
1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the United
States was also 5.3 percent last month, unchanged from November.
   The unemployment rate among adult men and adult women remained
unchanged at 4.4 percent in December. Joblessness among teen-agers
rose from 14.1 percent in November to 14.8 percent.
   The Labor Department said unemployment rates among other
demographic groups were:
   _Blacks, 11.6 percent, up from 11.2 in November.
   _Black teen-agers, 29.3 percent, down from 29.9.
   _Hispanics, 7.6 percent, down from 8 percent.
   _Whites, 4.6 percent, unchanged.

<HEAD>Broker Pleads Guilty; NASD Punishes Him and Colleague</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A broker described by U.S. prosecutors as the
lead witness in a broad new anti-fraud campaign pleaded guilty
Friday to conspiracy stemming from the manipulation of four stocks
before and during the 1987 market crash.
   The guilty plea by Stanley A. Aslanian in Manhattan federal court
came as the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington
said it had suspended and fined him and a colleague for manipulating
the four stocks and quoting phony prices in the securities of at
least three other companies.
   The NASD, the self-regulatory agency that runs the
over-the-counter market, called the punishment a major disciplinary
action that reflected a heightened crackdown on fraud and closer
cooperation with law enforcement authorities.
   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been leading
a criminal investigation of Wall Street corruption for more than two
years, said Thursday in disclosing the Aslanian case that it was
first result of probes into market irregularities brought to light
by the Oct. 19, 1987 crash.
   The prosecutor praised Aslanian for agreeing to cooperate in
implicating others and said, ``we hope this will deter people from
similar activity and encourage others to plead guilty to help clean
up these problems.''
   Several firms and individuals were said to be under investigation
but Giuliani would not identify them.
   Aslanian, 29, is the former president of the now-defunct Haas
Securities Corp., which folded shortly after the crash. It is now in
liquidation proceedings under federal bankruptcy law.
   He was released without bail after pleading guilty before U.S.
District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram, who set a tentative sentencing
date of March 29. He faces a maximum punishment of five years
imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
   Assistant prosecutor Peter Lieb said the sentencing date might be
postponed because Aslanian may be required to testify, a common
plea-bargain arrangement for cooperating witnesses.
   Aslanian's attorney, Kalman V. Gallop, told reporters: ``He's
been cooperating and will continue to cooperate. We hope his age and
naivete _ getting involved with a lot of high-pressure people _ will
have some ameliorating effect.''
   His guilty plea stems from four over-the-counter stocks
manipulated by Haas Securities in what the government called a
fraudulent scheme to keep the prices artificially high and dupe
investors into purchasing them.
   The scheme unraveled after the stock crash when Aslanian and
unidentified co-conspirators could no longer inflate the prices of
the stocks, which included Flores de New Mexico, TS Industries, Big
O Tires and Cliff Engle.
   At least part of the evidence used in the criminal case came from
the NASD, which said in a separate announcement Friday that it had
suspended Aslanian for five years and fined him $100,000.
   In addition, the NASD said Eugene K. Laff, former Hass chairman,
had been suspended for two years and fined $15,000.
   ``This is the kind of case we are serious about pursuing,''
Daniel M. Sibears, associate director of the NASD antifraud section,
said in a telephone interview. ``It's an area where we know there
has got to be more focus.''
   An NASD statement on the violations said that besides the
manipulation outlined in the criminal case, it had found Aslanian
and Leff responsible for bogus price quotes in over-the-counter
securities of Fountain Power Boat Industries, Satellite Auction and
Eagle Entertainment.
   John Pinto, executive director of the NASD compliance department,
said in a telephone interview that the quick disposition of the
Aslanian case reflected a broadening level of cooperation between
law enforcers and the self-regulatory organizations that scrutinize
the financial markets.
   ``It's come together over the past year,'' he said. ``All the
agencies have gotten to know each other's people and departments and
capabilities.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose Friday, pushed up by a stronger
dollar and a government report showing the nation's employment is in
line with expectations.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 21-32 point,
or about $6.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 9.03 percent
from 9.08 percent on Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilian
unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in December, tying a 14-year
low, from 5.4 percent in November. During the final month of 1988,
279,000 new jobs were created.
   Analysts said the job growth was no stronger than expected and
tended to ease concerns that the economy might be overheating.
Investors also focused on figures showing that average wages
remained flat at an average of $9.45 an hour.
   ``That gives some support to the notion that we have a strong
economy but it hasn't set off a new inflationary spiral yet,'' said
Carol Stone, an economist with Nomura Securities.
   Bond prices also got a boost from the rising dollar. Foreign
exchange dealers attributed some of the currency's strength to the
employment report because it indicated strength in the U.S. economy
and raised the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates.
   Market observers had said before the jobs report was released
that bond investors feared a substantial increase in non-farm jobs
would set off a new round of inflation, which erodes the value of
fixed-income securities such as notes and bonds.
   Inflationary pressures in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve
to tighten credit by boosting interest rates.
   But Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment and
mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham, said that while
a number of factors point to a stronger economy, a number of other
indicators suggest the economy is slowing down.
   While interest rates, including the prime lending rate, could
increase slightly over the next few weeks, ``short-term rates are in
the process of cresting and we will see them begin to fall as more
signs of an economic slowdown begin to show,'' Front predicted.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
and intermediate government issues rose 1-32 point, intermediate
maturities were 1-16 point to 5-16 point higher and long-term issues
gained between 7-32 point and | point, accordig to the financial
information service Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.22 to 1,128.32.
   Corporate issues also were higher. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate
bonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced 0.93 to
293.68.
   The Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index of 40 long-term bonds was
unchanged at 91 6-32 and a yield of 7.78 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 8.55 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 8.27 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were 8.96 percent as the discount remained unchanged at 8.47
percent. Yields on one-year bills were 9.17 percent as the discount
fell 2 basis points to 8.50.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9 1-16 percent late Friday, up from 815-16
percent late Thursday.

   The annual Consumer Electronics Show, an
electronic Disneyland for adults, opens Saturday with 1,450
exhibitors touting wares ranging from camcorders and computers to
TVs, video games and adult flicks.
   Between 90,000 and 100,000 members of the multibillion-dollar
industry are expected to view exhibits in four locations covering
space the size of 17 football fields.
   Industry executives say they are looking for a big year in their
diverse industry, despite concerns about the economy.
   ``We keep hearing talk of inflation, recession,'' show spokesman
Tom Lauterback said Friday. ``But we've come off a sensational
Christmas. The mood here is very positive, very upbeat.
   ``There's nobody singing the blues here,'' Lauterback said.
   The hottest news at this year's show is home automation,
Lauterback said.
   ``We've developed a language which allows your appliances to
speak with and control one another,'' Lauterback said. ``The system
can do things as simple as turning on a light by remote control, or
as complex as having your dishwasher assess when rates are down,
maybe not doing the dishes until 3 a.m.
   ``Items such as cellular phones will allow you to start your
appliances at any time, any place,'' Lauterback said.
   Home automation is still in its infancy, but is being
standardized to the point where various products will soon be
working off each other, Lauterback said.
   ``Another hot category will be `pocket smarts' _ portable
computers that may be as small as credit cards,'' Lauterback said.
``They may serve as memo pads, dictionaries, a thesaurus, etc.''
   Many of the products on display during the show's four-day run
will be popping up on dealers' shelves later this year.
   Products range from electronic watches to satellite earth
stations, home office equipment, audio and video hardware and
accessories, car and home security systems, computer games,
telephone products, watches, video camcorders, compact disc players
and color TVs.
   ``We'll sell 20 million color TV sets this year,'' Lauterback
said.
   The number of exhibitors is a record for the 17th annual winter
event. A summer Consumer Electronics Show is held annually in
Chicago.
   Those attending the show will include nearly 5,500 foreign
buyers, manufacturers and electronics experts from 70 countries,
including the Soviet Union and China.
   Corcoran said this year's show will see growth in areas such as
home office products and ``edutainment,'' or
education-entertainment, with the amount of exhibit space tripling
in some categories.
   The show, which is closed to the public, is produced by the
Electronic Industries Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade
association that represents most electronics manufacturers.
   This year's show is expected to provide a $100 million boost for
the Las Vegas economy. This show and the Comdex computer show in the
fall are the city's two largest conventions.

<HEAD>Consolidated Natural Gas, Japanese Company Enter $245 Million Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Natural Gas Co. said Friday it has
formed a joint venture with a Japanese company to buy natural gas
and oil properties in the Gulf of Mexico for $245 million in cash.
   Consolidated said its subsidiary, CNG Producing Co., will hold a
60 percent interest in Houston-based Mark Producing Inc. and will
operate the newly acquired oil and gas fields. Japex Corp., a unit
of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd., will hold a 40 percent
stake.
   Mark Producing has extensive natural gas and oil properties in
the Gulf of Mexico, including one well listed by the Department of
the Interior as holding the industry record for the highest daily
gas production rate recorded for the Gulf, Consolidated said.
   The deal includes the acquisition of proved and estimated
reserves of approximately 190 billion cubic feet of natural gas and
some 5 million barrels of oil on approximately 178,000 acres in the
Gulf.
   In 1988, the properties produced about 600,000 barrels of oil and
more than 25 billion cubic feet of gas, the company said.
   Pittsburgh-based CNG is one of the nation's largest producers,
transporters and distributors of natural gas, operating primarily in
the northeastern United States.
   ``This acquisition is a near-perfect fit with the existing
offshore operations of CNG Producing Co.,'' said George A. Davidson
Jr., Consolidated's chairman and chief executive officer.

   A judge Friday upheld a controversial
Polaroid Corp. employee stock ownership plan, effectively blocking a
hostile $2.6 billion takeover bid by Disney family-owned Shamrock
Holdings Inc.
   The ruling by Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger of Delaware Chancery
Court comes more than two months after the companies squared off in
court over the validity of the stock plan, which was unveiled just
before Shamrock's bid for the instant camera pioneer.
   ``Looks like they won,'' said William Relyea, a Polaroid analyst
with Eberstadt Fleming Inc. in New York. ``It just raises the odds
even higher that Polaroid is safe in the hands of management.''
   Shamrock, based in Burbank, Calif., maintained that Polaroid
enacted the 10-million-share, $300-million stock plan specifically
to block the takeover. Polaroid said it was a long-planned effort to
benefit employees.
   In a 53-page ruling, Berger said the employee stock ownership
plan, or ESOP, was partly defensive in nature but not unfair to
shareholders or workers ``and should not be invalidated.''
   ``It is structurally fair in its voting and tendering provisions
and I do not find either the timing of its implementation or its
possible anti-takeover effect objectionable under the facts of this
case,'' Berger wrote.
   ``This is a defensive device _ assuming it is one _ that is
designed to and appears likely to add value to the company and all
of its stockholders,'' she added. ``It does not prevent stockholders
from receiving or considering alternatives.''
   Shamrock spokesman John Grimaldi said the company would not
comment until reading the decision.
   The decision all but blocks a takeover because it puts 14 percent
of Polaroid stock in the hands of employees. Under Delaware takeover
law, a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of a
target's outstanding shares for control. Polaroid is incorporated in
Delaware.
   Polaroid, which was founded by Edwin H. Land in 1938 and
introduced instant snapshots 10 years later, also faces the
favorable prospect of a trial in federal court in Boston to
determine how much it will receive of a $5.7 billion damages request
against Eastman Kodak Co. for patent infringements.
   Polaroid closed Friday at $38.25, up 50 cents, in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Shamrock on July 19 made a friendly but unsolicited $40-a-share
bid for Polaroid. It later made a hostile $42-a-share offer valuing
the company at $2.6 billion that Polaroid has urged its shareholders
to reject. The takeover hinged on the outcome of the trial.
   Polaroid President I. MacAllister Booth said in a statement: ``We
are, of course, delighted with this result as it supports what we
regard as a key component of Polaroid's future.''
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern wholly owned by the
family of Roy E. Disney, the animator's nephew, had said it would
purchase Polaroid shares under the $42 offer if the stock plan was
invalidated.
   The company, which already owns about 5 million shares of
Polaroid, now is faced with acquiring a controlling interest under
the $40 offer, a proposition analysts said was almost impossible.
Shamrock can appeal the ruling to Delaware Supreme Court. Polaroid
has about 71.6 million shares outstanding.
   Even if Shamrock threatens to acquire close to the 85 percent,
Polaroid could turn to a ``white squire'' who could buy 2 percent or
3 percent and secure the company's defense, analysts said.
   ``Unless they can find some hole in the way the judge has ruled,
it seems the the odds favor Polaroid on appeal,'' said Eugene Glazer
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Without the reversal of that ESOP, it
becomes very difficult for Shamrock to acquire Polaroid under
Delaware law.''
   Both the timing and intent of the employee stock plan were at
issue in the Delaware trial in October. Polaroid announced the plan
in July just one day before a scheduled meeting with Shamrock.
   Polaroid said its board of directors envisioned a 5 percent ESOP
in March before increasing it to 14 percent at its July meeting. The
company said the plan was undertaken to increase worker motivation
and that Polaroid had talked about an employee stock plan as long as
15 years ago.
   Ms. Berger said the timing, changes in the allocation of the
shares and other actions ``all had to have been motivated, at least
in part, by a desire to add one more obstacle to Shamrock's
potential acquisition bid.''
   But she said the plan would not harm workers' productivity.
   Polaroid's employees, a majority of whom signed a petition
opposing Shamrock's bid, are paying for the ESOP shares with a 5
percent pay cut. Polaroid had to borrow $285 million to fund the
plan.
   The decision and the upcoming Kodak trial, scheduled to begin Jan
17 in U.S. District Court, mark a turnaround for Polaroid, which has
struggled in the last decade as the popularity of instant
photography has declined.
   The company late last year completed a reduction of 1,700 jobs in
a major corporate restructuring. Polaroid now employs 8,300 people
in the United States.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Polaroid reported losses of
$15.1 million on sales of $1.33 billion, compared to earnings of
$76.3 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $1.25 billion in the
same 1987 period.

   Intense negotiations between troubled Eastern
Airlines and its largest union, in a contract dispute for more than
a year, began Friday under the direction of the chairman of the
National Mediation Board.
   Management negotiators headed by Tom Matthews, senior vice
president for human resources, and Machinists negotiators led by
District 100 President Charles E. Bryan began meeting Friday morning
behind closed doors at a Key Largo, Fla., resort. No deadline has
been set. A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hotel
rooms have been reserved for two weeks.
   Little progress was made in the first day of talks, sources said.
   Chairman Walter Wallace of the National Mediation Board flew here
Thursday from Washington to oversee the talks, which will continue
daily late into the night, unless Wallace and mediator Harry
Bickford decide the two sides are making no progress.
   A federal declaration of an impasse would trigger a 30-day
cooling-off period, after which the 8,500-member union could strike
and management would impose its own work conditions.
   The principals promised to work for a settlement in the current
talks.
   ``Mediators are always optimistic, but we have a ways to go,''
said Bickford, who's directed the mediation since Jan. 26. Mediation
began then after the two sides' negotiations stalled.
   Wallace's presence adds to the pressure on the negotiators to
settle. Such a high-level entry into the mediation usually wouldn't
come until the 30-day cooling-off period.
   ``He's here to add his expertise to the effort,'' Bickford told
The Miami Herald.
   ``As always, we want to avoid a work disruption,'' Bryan said
earlier.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said management wants a
settlement, although Eastern executives have been lobbying for
months for declaration of an impasse. They say setting a 30-day
deadline will get the talks moving.
   The two sides have been $200 million apart since July. The
Machinists' last offer called for a $50 million raise; the company
asked $150 million in wage concessions, mainly from the
non-mechanics such as baggage handlers and janitors who make up
about half the Machinists union.
   Union leaders have suggested Eastern wants a strike so it can try
to break the union. But Eastern officials say they want to end
public perceptions that the airline is beset by labor strife and get
on with cost-cutting needed to reduce losses that totaled $233.7
million for the first three quarters of 1988.

   President Reagan on Friday enthusiastically
endorsed a proposed 50 percent pay raise for members of Congress and
other top federal officials, saying ``the door to service'' in the
nation's government must be open to Americans regardless of their
financial status.
   Reagan tossed the politically sensitive pay plan to Congress
after writing lawmakers that government jobs should not be ``the
province only of the wealthy.'' He also urged lawmakers to abolish
the much-criticized honoraria system that permits them to earn
appearance fees from special-interest groups.
   The pay increase will become law automatically unless each house
of Congress rejects it by Feb. 8 _ 30 days from Reagan's formal
budget submission on Monday.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who normally sets the
chamber's agenda, said Friday that he would ``neither encourage nor
prevent a vote'' on the pay issue.
   He added that ``if the pay raise takes effect, there will be a
ban on speaking fees and certain other forms of outside income. The
exact provisions for the severe tightening of outside earning
limitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations.''
   In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has
promised a vote.
   In maneuvering two years ago, Congress allowed a 15.6 percent pay
raise to take effect. That time, the Senate voted 88-6 to reject the
increase. The House permitted enactment, then took a meaningless
voice vote against the increase.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, has said he thinks Wright ``is committed
to making sure there is no vote.'' Tauke has proposed legislation
requiring Congress to vote on any pay raise, while delaying
enactment until the next Congress.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., called the pay raise
preposterous and said he had asked Senate leaders to schedule an
early vote on a resolution of disapproval.
   ``The founding fathers meant for members to vote affirmatively
for pay raises, as a means of ensuring accountability,'' Humphrey
said. ``Instead, we have a system which violates the spirit of the
Constitution, if not the letter, by severing all accountability.''
   Reagan chose not to modify a presidential commission's
recommendation that members of Congress and federal district judges,
who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000.
   The speaker's annual salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000,
and that of majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.
   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would get
raises from their current $99,500 a year to $155,000.
   Reagan's proposal would raise a president's annual pay to about
$350,000 from the current $200,000, where it has stood since 1969.
However, such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of a
constitutional prohibition on raising a president's pay during his
term.
   President-elect Bush said Friday he supported Reagan's decision,
but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president.
   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,
Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything than
to get this deficit under control.''
   Reagan wrote Congress: ``We must ensure that the door to service
remains open to Americans who must work to support their families,
educate their children and save for their retirement.''
   Addressing honoraria, Reagan said the fee system ``undermines
public faith in the integrity of senior federal officials,
particularly in the legislative branch. Congress should move
immediately to enact legislation that takes a comprehensive approach
to the problems posed by honoraria, including payments for articles,
speeches and appearances, and other forms of financial benefits.''
   Under the system, senators can pocket up to 40 percent of their
salaries in honoraria _ $35,800 for the rank-and-file members _
while House members can hold on to 30 percent, or $26,850 for the
rank-and-file. Fees over that amount go to charity.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
legislative subcommittee, said he was pleased with Reagan's decision.
   ``This is a pay raise for all the top-level federal officials ...
but, of course, we (Congress) take all the heat,'' he said.
   Fazio said he believes the Senate is likely to reject the raise,
as it has in past years when the House allowed pay hikes to take
effect.
   On Thursday, the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union delivered
petitions to the White House, saying they bear the names of 13,000
people who oppose the raise.
   The group's executive vice president, David Keating, said
``Congress is hoping to batten down the hatches and weather a 30-day
storm of opposition.
   ``The public is not going to give up after 30 days. They will
just get more angry at congressional double-dealing on the pay raise
issue.''
   Keating also said Reagan has a personal stake in his
recommendation because his pension would rise by 56 percent if the
pay raise is approved. He said the pension is tied to Cabinet
salaries.
   The pension increase from $99,500 to $155,000 annually also would
apply to former Presidents Ford, Carter and Nixon, Keating said.
   ``No employee of the federal government should be able to name
his own pension before retirement. Yet, that's exactly what
President Reagan has done,'' Keating said, adding that Reagan and
the three former presidents should refuse the increase.
   A White House press spokesman, B.J. Cooper, said the taxpayer
union figures were accurate, but had no comment on the call for
Reagan to refuse the increase.
   ``The president was not aware of that when he approved the pay
raise,'' Cooper said. ``I don't know whether it would have changed
his decision, the other factors being so overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Tyson Boosts Offer for Holly Farms To $1.2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. sweetened
a hostile takeover offer for Holly Farms Corp. to $1.2 billion cash
Friday, a move that appeared to push it closer to acquiring the
rival after a two-month brawl.
   It was the third time Tyson has sweetened the price and came a
week after the company won a court ruling that at least temporarily
prevented Holly from completing a friendly merger with ConAgra Corp.
to escape Tyson's overtures.
   In a sign Holly was willing to negotiate, the company said it
would consider Tyson's $60-a-share offer, raised from $54 a share or
$1.1 billion. Holly also said it would ask if ConAgra wished to
amend the merger proposal, a stock swap that has been valued by
securities analysts at about $1 billion.
   Holly said its board of directors would deliberate on the matter
at a special meeting next Wednesday and had urged the two potential
acquirers `to submit their best proposals before that meeting.''
   The developments pushed Holly's stock price up $2 a share to $60
in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Tyson fell 37{ cents a
share to $16.50 in the over-the-counter market where its shares
trade. ConAgra was unchanged at $29.75 a share on the NYSE.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., is the nation's leading poultry
company, producing more than 2 billion pounds a year. Omaha-based
ConAgra turns out about 1.5 billion pounds, and Memphis-based Holly
about 1.2 billion pounds.
   A Tyson acquisition of Holly would give it a major share of the
lucrative market for poultry, which is growing in popularity over
other meat.
   The latest chapter in the struggle followed a ruling last week
from a chancery judge in Delaware, where Holly Farms is
incorporated, that the proposed Holly-ConAgra merger wasn't in the
best interest of Holly shareholders because it didn't give them an
opportunity to consider Tyson's offer.
   The judge, ruling in a suit brought by Tyson's, prevented Holly
and ConAgra from acting on a merger agreement reached Nov. 17.
   Tyson said that other terms and conditions of the increased offer
will be described in documents that are to be mailed shortly to
Holly Farms shareholders.
   Tyson's attempt to buy Holly Farms began with a friendly offer
for about $900 million in cash and stock. After Holly Farms rejected
the offer, Tyson began pursuing a hostile takeover attempt with a
$52-a-share offer that was later raised to $54 a share.

<HEAD>Airbus: New Orders in 1988 Of Nearly $7 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Airbus Industrie announced Friday that it received
firm orders for 161 passenger planes in 1988 valued at almost $7
billion.
   In a statement issued by the European aircraft consortium,
Chairman Jean Pierson said the sales were ``totally in line with,
and even better than, what I had forecast at the beginning of 1988.''
   A breakdown showed that the new orders covered 45 of the group's
widebodied A300 and A310 jets, and 116 of its single-aisle,
twin-engine A320 planes.
   In addition, new commitments for 13 of its A340 and A330 jumbo
jets that are currently under development were recorded during the
year.
   Deliveries by the consortium in 1988 totaled 61 jets, including
45 widebody jets and 16 A320s. The planes were valued at about $2.7
billion.
   The delivery schedule for 1989 includes 48 widebody planes and 65
A320s for an unspeciifed value.
   Airbus said its firm order book totaled 512 widebodied jets and
74 of its A320s at the end of 1988.
   The consortium is made up of Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt, Boelkow-Blohm of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC
and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. It didn't provide
figures for sales, deliveries and firm orders for 1987.

<HEAD>Soviet Ambassador Hopes for General Trade Agreement Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union hopes to reach a general trade
agreement soon with a consortium of seven U.S. companies, the Soviet
ambassador to the United States said Friday.
   Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin, visiting Detroit as a guest of Ford
Motor Co., said trade talks are continuing with the consortium and
other companies, including General Motors Corp.
   ``The relationship was particularly good with Ford,'' he said.
   Ford officials have said they are negotiating with the Soviet
Union over making cars near Gorky in an existing plant or in a new
one. Officials have said the talks involve assembling a version of
Ford's West German-built Scorpio.
   ``We have some difficulty in our relations with Ford,'' Dubinin
said. ``Also we have contacts with General Motors, as you know, but
not on such a scale as we are projecting now with Ford.''
   Dubinin's comments came before a luncheon, at which GM Chairman
Roger Smith was guest speaker.
   The ambassador, his wife and other Soviet officials planned to
attend a private reception held by Ford Chairman Donald Petersen
before going to a black-tie charity dinner in conjunction with the
North American Auto Show, which opens to the public on Saturday.
   ``To buy an autocar in the Soviet Union is a double problem,''
Dubinin said. ``First of all, you have to have money and secondly
you have to have (a buyers) card to buy.
   ``We have a good production of cars in the Soviet Union, but we
have to modernize.''
