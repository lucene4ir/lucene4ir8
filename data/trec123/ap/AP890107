   Here are brief profiles of the individuals
indicted Friday in connection with the federal government's
investigation into Pentagon fraud and the three figures who pleaded
guilty to charges stemming from the probe.
   _Stuart E. Berlin, the only government employee indicted in the
case, headed the ship systems engineering branch of the Naval Air
Systems Command from October 1986 until he was reassigned by the
Pentagon in June 1988. Berlin, a Navy procurement specialist, faces
charges of accepting bribes in exchange for providing classified
information. Court documents say Berlin provided information to
Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp.,
of Greenlawn, N.Y.
   _William L. Parkin, an Alexandria, Va., defense consultant,
worked in the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project from 1977 to 1983.
According to affadavits released last week, Parkin was hired by
Hazeltine to get inside information from the Pentagon that would
allow the company to compete for a $15.9 million contract for
battlefield equipment. The indictments said Teledyne agreed to pay
Parkin's firm $160,000 to obtain inside information in obtaining a
Navy contract.
   _Fred H. Lackner, a Woodland Hills, Calif., consultant, has
worked for a number of aerospace companies, including Northrop
Electronics in Hawthorne, Calif., Stromberg Carlson Corp. in Winter
Park, Fla., then a unit of General Dynamics and later a division of
United Technologies and the Systems Development unit of Unisys. The
indictment said Lackner and Berlin struck an agreement that Berlin
would help Teledyne Electronics win a contract in exchange for money.
   _Joseph Colarusso, 58, is a former senior vice president of the
Hazeltine Corp., a division of Emerson Electronics Co. Colarusso,
who worked at the Greenlawn office, joined Hazeltine in 1959 and was
appointed senior vice president in 1984. He resigned on Dec. 1,
1988. Colarusso pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud
the government and commit wire fraud.
   _Charles Furciniti, 54, is a former marketing representative of
the Hazeltine Corp., who held the title of vice president. He worked
for the company for 20 years, resigning in May 1988 to take a job
with another firm. Like Colarusso, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to defraud the government and commit wire fraud.
   _Michael Savaides, 41, is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist for
Teledyne. According to the government, Savaides had a financial
relationship with Parkin. Affadavits showed that Parkin, Berlin and
Savaides had planned at one time to divide $150,000 from Teledyne.
   _Other Teledyne employees named in the indictment are George H.
Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer.

<HEAD>House Speaker Takes No Position On Pay Raise Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speaker Jim Wright, who normally has strong
influence over the House agenda, says he will ``neither encourage
nor prevent a vote'' on a 50 percent pay raise proposed for
Congress, judges and top executive branch officials.
   While Wright declined to take a stand Friday on the politically
risky pay plan, he said lawmakers would ban speaking fees and
certain other outside income for themselves if the proposal were
enacted.
   The large pay raise was recommended by a presidential commission
and endorsed Thursday by President Reagan, who will formally send
the proposal to Congress with his budget plan on Monday.
   ``We must ensure that the door to service remains open to
Americans who must work to support their families, educate their
children and save for their retirement,'' the president wrote
Congress in a letter explaining his position. Reagan also proposed
an end to the often-criticized outside income system for members of
Congress.
   The raise will become law automatically unless each house of
Congress rejects it by Feb. 8 _ 30 days after Reagan's budget
submission.
   ``I think that the speaker (House Speaker Jim Wright) is
committed to making sure there is no vote,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke,
R-Iowa, who has proposed legislation requiring Congress to vote on
any pay raise, while delaying enactment until the next Congress.
   Wright said Friday, ``I will neither encourage nor prevent a
vote. Regular procedure will be followed.''
   Regular procedure normally means legislation would go to a
committee, be the subject of hearings, and return to the House floor
after committee approval. Such a process normally takes far longer
than 30 days.
   Referring to outside income for lawmakers, called honoraria,
Wright said, ``If the pay raise takes effect, there will be a ban on
speaking fees and certain other forms of outside income-earning
limitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations.''
   In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has
promised a vote.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., called the pay raise
preposterous and said he had asked Senate leaders to schedule an
early vote on a resolution of disapproval.
   Reagan chose not to modify the presidential commission's
recommendation that members of Congress and federal district judges,
who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000.
   The speaker's annual salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000,
and that of majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.
   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would get
raises from their current $99,500 a year to $155,000.
   Reagan's proposal would raise a president's annual pay to about
$350,000 from the current $200,000, where it has stood since 1969.
However, such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of a
constitutional prohibition on raising a president's pay during his
term.
   President-elect Bush said Friday he supported Reagan's decision,
but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president.
Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,
Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything than
to get this deficit under control.''
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers
Union, said Reagan has a personal stake in his recommendation
because his pension would rise by 56 percent if the pay raise is
approved. The pension is tied to Cabinet salaries.
   The pension increase from $99,500 to $155,000 annually also would
apply to former Presidents Ford, Carter and Nixon.
   Keating said Reagan and the three former presidents should refuse
the increase.
   A White House press spokesman, B.J. Cooper, said the taxpayer
union figures were accurate, but had no comment on the call for
Reagan to refuse the increase.
   ``The president was not aware of that when he approved the pay
raise,'' Cooper said. ``I don't know whether it would have changed
his decision, the other factors being so overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Report: Budget Will Include Boost For AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal funding for AIDS programs would expand by
30 percent while Medicare and Medicaid would be restrained under a
health and human services budget the Reagan administration will
submit to Congress on Monday, a published report said.
   The New York Times in its Saturday editions reported that the
$424.4 billion budget for the Department of Health and Human
Resources amounts to $22.8 billion more than the department got in
1988.
   More than half of the budget, $260 billion, would be spent on
Social Security, which would receive $13 billion more than is now
spent to cover an increase in recipients and a 3.6 percent
cost-of-living boost, the Times said.
   The proposed expenditures are subject to revision by
President-elect George Bush after Jan. 20 and by Congress, although
Bush has said he would not make cuts in Social Security, which goes
to more than 40 million Americans.
   For AIDS, the Reagan administration recommended spending $2.5
billion, including $1.6 billion for research, education and
prevention and $925 million for treatment and other assistance for
AIDS victims.
   The administration proposed $106.1 billion for Medicare, an
increase of $10 billion, but still $3.5 billion less than would have
occurred under current law. It proposed $36 billion for Medicaid, a
boost of nearly $2 billion but $2 billion less than under current
law, the Times said.
   Medicare is the health insurance program for 31 million older
Americans and 3 million other disabled persons and Medicaid is a
federal-state health program for the poor.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Filed against New Political Asylum Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central American immigrants filed suit
against the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday,
demanding that the agency once again let them travel to their U.S.
destinations to apply for asylum.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Brownsville, seeks
to reverse INS rules of Dec. 16 that made it impossible for most
asylum-seekers to leave south Texas or work while waiting 30 days
for approval or denial of their claims.
   ``It would allow the asylum applicant to have the interview and
the adjudication of the asylum claim heard and decided by the INS
office nearest their intended residence in the U.S.,'' said Robert
Rubin, who heads the national Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project
for the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs.
   A hearing has been set for 9 a.m. Monday on their motion for a
temporary restraining order. INS officials in Washington declined
comment on the lawsuit because they had not seen it.
   Most Central Americans enter the United States illegally in the
Brownsville area of the lower Rio Grande Valley, the nearest land
point to Central America.
   Officials with the INS' Harlingen District said nine personnel
were added Friday, bringing the total of Harlingen asylum
adjudicators to 16, and will speed up processing and eliminate a
backlog.
   The lawsuit accuses the INS of imposing a policy change without
allowing public comment; of denying aliens access to the asylum
process and access to counsel; and improperly restricting the right
to work.
   It cites the case of a 69-year-old Nicaraguan woman who said she
slept outside the INS office in Harlingen for three nights to keep
her place in line, then was told she needed a fingerprint card. She
said she then walked four miles to the Harlingen Police Department
to obtain the prints, then returned to the INS office where she
again slept outside to keep her place.
   Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in Harlingen were allowed to
travel to their U.S. destinations to apply for asylum, often Miami
or Los Angeles.
   INS officials said they adopted the new procedure in Harlingen to
reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb abuses of the
system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum cases.
   They also said the new procedure apparently has begun to deter
frivolous claims, with the more than 2,000 claims a week in early
December reduced to about 1,000 a week since Dec. 16.
   Those who previously would have traveled out of the area are
staying in places such as the condemned Amber Motel in Brownsville,
on the border 25 miles south of Harlingen, and a squalid, makeshift
campsite where several hundred people have carved out spaces in the
brush.

<HEAD>South African Granite Scrapped For Bus Tunnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's transit and sewage authority is giving
up $480,000 of granite it bought for a downtown bus tunnel because
the stone came from South Africa, the agency announced.
   ``It would violate the spirit of our policy and would be an
affront to the community'' to use the granite, executive Alan Gibbs
told the Metro Council Thursday.
   The granite _ enough to cover 24,000 square feet _ is sitting in
supply yards in Italy, where it was cut.
   ``We're going to have to eat the cost,'' said David Kalberer,
superintendent of the $430 million tunnel project. Metro hopes to
sell the granite for scrap to recoup some of the cost, he added.
   Seattle Mayor Charles Royer agreed with the decision.
   ``This could be a serious affront and embarrassment for lots of
people,'' he said.
   The Metro Council banned the purchase of South African goods
because of that country's policy of racial segregation, or
apartheid, after a county councilman and city councilman protested
the use of South African steel in tunnel work in 1987.

<HEAD>First Man To Register Under New Law Now Too Old To Be Drafted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first man since the Vietnam War to get
through eight years of draft eligibility without being called to
arms said something was missing from his 26th birthday celebration.
   ``I'm proud within myself about it. I wish I had an award or
something though. That would have been nice. Maybe a plaque to hang
on the wall,'' said Joseph Frank.
   Frank, the first 18-year-old to sign up and be processed by the
Selective Service System after draft registration was revived in
1981, turned 26 on Friday. That made him too old to be called up
even if Congress and the president reactivate the draft, according
to Selective Service officials in Washington.
   ``I didn't have to go active and I'm glad about that,'' Frank
said. ``But if it was God's will I would have gone. It's a blessing
to be a soldier for this country.''
   Frank said he had no idea he was the first man in the country to
register when he did so. He said he just followed the law and signed
up.
   ``I wasn't worried about being drafted when I was 18. I don't
think I even thought about it, but if it had happened it would have
just happened. When I turned 21 I got more worried about it,'' Frank
said.
   The draft was stopped in 1973 after the end of the Vietnam War,
but registration was revived on Jan. 5, 1981. Federal law requires
every man to register with Selective Service within 30 days of his
18th birthday.

<HEAD>Airlines Asked To Replace Rivets On Older 727s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is recommending that
airlines replace tens of thousands of rivets on more than 600 older
Boeing 727 passenger jets.
   In a proposed directive issued Friday, the Federal Aviation
Administration also urged the carriers to adopt special inspection
procedures until the rivet work is done.
   The repairs are not expected to disrupt air service because most
of the work will be done on a timetable that could stretch over as
long as four years, FAA officials said.
   The proposed directive is the result of increasing concern about
cracking on older commercial jetliners. It is similar to an order
issued last October for older Boeing 737s.
   A final order will not be issued until after a brief period to
allow public and industry comment.
   The FAA estimated the repairs and extra inspections of 623 older
Boeing 727s will cost the airlines $35.7 million.
   In a separate action Friday, the FAA broadened a previous
directive for special inspections of older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s
to include any aircraft with at least 45,000 landings.
   Last November, the agency told airlines to conduct repetitive
inspections using the electronic ``eddy current'' method of all
DC-9s that have had more than 55,000 landings because of concern
about possible cracks in the fuselage skin.
   But the agency said since then it has discovered cracks on more
than 20 aircraft that had between 45,000 and 52,000 landings,
prompting the special precautions for the additional aircraft.
   The agency said 476 DC-9s belonging to U.S. air carriers would be
affected by the new directive.
   Under the order, airlines must conduct repetitive eddy current
inspections of the fuselage skin as well as an area just over the
wings on the DC-9s. The inspections must be conducted at least every
5,800 landings.
   The proposed directive on the Boeing 727s requires that airlines
over the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets on each
plane, depending on the model of 727 involved. It said the
``countersunk'' rivets now on the planes is believed to cause
cracking under some circumstances, while the substitute
``button-head'' is less likely to do so.
   The FAA said cracks on both the 727 and 737 aircraft have been
traced to a ``cold bonding'' process that was used in the earlier
models of the plane to bind sheets of fuselage skin together. That
method was discontinued in later models.
   The agency said it plans to order eddy current testing and
increased visual testing of the Boeing 727 on a regular basis until
the rivets can be changed.
   Last October, the FAA ordered thousands of rivets replaced on
older Boeing 737s to help guard against cracking.
   There have been a number of incidents during the past year in
which large cracks developed on older aircraft.

   Inmates at the Youthful Correctional
Offender Institution rioted for about two hours Friday, but
corrections officers and police tactical units stayed on overnight,
authorities said.
   Three inmates and one corrections officer were injured in the
uprising and there was ``minimal damage'' to the lockup said Kathy
Drake, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections in Atlanta.
   Ms. Drake said she did not know what set off the disturbance or
how many inmates were involved. Despite the name of the facility,
the average age of the 970 inmates at the prison is 24, according to
Ms. Drake.
   Ms. Drake said the injured officer, who was not identified, broke
his hand, apparently by slipping and falling. The injury, she said,
``was not in contact with an inmate.'' She did not have details of
the inmates' injuries.
   Five tactical units of 18 officers each were called in to help
stop the uprising, which began about 4:45 p.m., apparently in
sympathy with a disturbance at a nearby state prison earlier this
week.
   The riot, which broke out around 4:45 p.m. with inmates damaging
and breaking property, Ms. Drake said.
   The crowd control officers used tear gas to halt the uprising in
the Kemper Building, one of three units comprising the lockup, Ms.
Drake said.
   ``When they did (use tear gas), they immediately began to quiet
down. It then spilled over into the Holly Building (a second
unit),'' she said.
   Tear gas was not used in the second unit, because the situation
there was not as severe, Ms. Drake said. ``There was no damage done.
It was mostly a lot of yelling, a lot of cussing,'' she said.
   Because the tear gas spread beyond the Kemper Building, about 100
inmates could not be returned immediately to their cells, and were
held in a yard until the gas clears, Ms. Drake said.
   Two tactical units from Milledgeville, in central Georgia about
25 miles east of Macon, and one from Reidsville remained on the
scene, Ms. Drake said, adding that the Department of Corrections
would begin an internal investigation into the disturbance.
   If the inmates who were responsible are identified, they would be
segregated from the rest of the prison population and would face
administrative charges, she said.
   Friday's uprising marked the second disturbance at a Georgia
prison this week. On Tuesday, inmates rioted at Rivers Correctional
Institution in Milledgeville, an incident officials called the most
serious in the state in 10 years.
   More than 900 inmates participated in the earlier incident, with
three officers and three inmates injured and $300,000 in damage
reported.

   Dave Winfield is suing his boss, George
Steinbrenner, for more than $1 million that the star outfielder
claims the New York Yankees owner owes to his foundation for
fighting drug abuse.
   In a lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court, Winfield
charged that Steinbrenner has not complied with a stipulation of his
contract to pay $300,000 a year to the David M. Winfield Foundation.
   Steinbrenner, in a statement, said an investigation of the
foundation discovered ``numerous questionable practices'' that would
be outlined in a counter-suit to be filed Monday.
   ``I just wish he had chosen another course, but there can be no
turning back now,'' said Steinbrenner, who has been publicly feuding
with Winfield for several years.
   Kenneth E. Warner, Steinbrenner's attorney, said the Yankees'
suit will allege excessive limousine expenses of more than $40,000
over a two-year period, excessive and disproportionate management
and administrative costs and other items.
   Winfield's suit seeks $450,000 that he says Steinbrenner owes
going back to Sept. 1, 1987, plus the balance owed for the duration
of the player's 10-year contract, for a total of $1,050,000.
   A Winfield Foundation statement said it was the third time the
foundation has had to sue Steinbrenner for non-compliance. In 1982
and 1983, Steinbrenner paid the full amount owed, it said.

   Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple
Computer Inc., has briefly set aside his floppy disks to spin record
discs.
   The 33-year-old entrepreneur this week made his third appearance
on San Jose-based KSJO-FM, acting as substitute co-host of a morning
drive-time program, said station manager David Baronfeld.
   ``Our audience is between 22 and 38,'' said Baronfeld. ``He
reaches that upper end. They can react to a guy like Steve who grew
up listening to Santana and the Doobie Brothers.''
   Wozniak is an avid collector of vintage rock 'n' roll albums and
also organized two ``US Festivals,'' high-tech concert festivals
that married modern music with computer technology.

   Pauline Collins, who played the saucy maid Sarah
on the British television series ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' will make
her Broadway debut in a one-woman comedy about a middle-aged English
housewife.
   ``Shirley Valentine,'' written by Willy Russell, author of the
play and film ``Educating Rita,'' concerns a housewife who dreams of
a life beyond the kitchen sink.
   The show, which was a success in London last winter, will open
Feb. 16 at the Booth Theater after a week of previews, said Philip
Rinaldi, a spokesman for the show.
   Collins will appear under a special exchange agreement between
American and British Actors' Equity associations that will allow
American Kathleen Rowe McAllen to appear in London this spring in

   The Hard Rock Cafe is going to try again to
persuade a city commission to allow a ``walk of fame'' on the
sidewalks surrounding the French Quarter rock 'n' roll eatery, a
spokeswoman said.
   ``They plan to resubmit their proposal, and for the moment have
pledged that the St. Louis Street side be dedicated to native New
Orleans musicians such as Fats Domino,'' said spokeswoman Barbara
Hutson in a news release Friday.
   The restaurant sought permission from a committee of the Vieux
Carre Commission on Thursday to install 10 to 12 brass plaques,
emblazoned with stars, as tributes to musicians who have visited the
Hard Rock.
   Similar sidewalk plaques have been installed at Hard Rock Cafes
in New York, Chicago and other cities.
   All five members of the Vieux Carre Commission's architecture
committee, expressed displeasure with the idea. The commission is
charged by the city with guarding the historic beauty and
architectural integrity of the French Quarter _ the oldest section
of the Mississippi River port city.
   Among the complaints: the quarter should not be home to memorials
for the living and sidewalks should not be used for advertising.

   Leading senators are demanding Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh explain why the Reagan administration refused to
release classified information deemed important to the Iran-Contra
case against Oliver L. North.
   The Reagan administration's position on the secrecy question
contributed to a move by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh earlier
this week to have two key charges against North dropped.
   Thornburgh on Friday strongly defended the administration's
refusal to allow the release of more classified material in the
North case, saying that dropping the conspiracy and theft counts is
``hardly'' going to provide ``a precedent in every case.''
   The attorney general said the question is whether it is more
important ``to go ahead with a particular criminal prosecution'' as
opposed to ``what harm might come to the country's long-term
interests'' by exposing sensitive information.
   An interagency intelligence group in the administration refused
to permit the release of additional classified material which U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said must be disclosed in order for
North to get a fair trial.
   Walsh then decided to abandon the charges that the former White
House aide illegally diverted more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Three others are also
charged with the same counts, but their trials have been severed.
   North still faces 12 other charges. His trial is scheduled to
begin Jan. 31.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act ``requires a full
explanation to the congressional committees ... as to why''
conspiracy and theft charges against North ``could not be tried
without disclosing classified information,'' said the chairmen of
the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees.
   In a letter to the attorney general, the senators asked
Thornburgh to include the explanation in his next semiannual report
on the operation of the law, which was passed by Congress to prevent
defendants from using ``graymail'' to scuttle their prosecution.
   The letter came from Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and William
Cohen, R-Maine, respectively chairman and vice-chairman of the
intelligence panel and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who chairs the
Judiciary Committee.
   Gesell on Monday is expected to grant Walsh's motion to drop the
two counts against North.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act requires the attorney
general to report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary
committees any time criminal charges are dismissed on grounds that
continued prosecution in open court would jeopardize national
security.
   The lawmakers acknowledged that Walsh, not the Justice
Department, had decided to seek dismissal of the two central charges.
   But they said the CIPA reporting provision was enacted ``to
provide an opportunity for Congress to review, as appropriate,
circumstances of this sort.''
   Such reviews are needed to ``ensure that decisions not to
prosecute alleged criminal conduct were, in fact, prompted by
legitimate national security concerns.''

   Amtrak and a control tower operator who tested
positive for drugs share the blame for a Boston-bound train
derailment that injured 25 people, says the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   The operator, Thomas Connor, fled the control tower after the
January 1988 accident in Chester, Pa., and later tested positive for
marijuana and small traces of cocaine and methamphetamine.
   The NTSB said in a report Friday that Connor, who resigned after
the accident, let the ``Night Owl'' train travel on a section of
track undergoing maintenance. The train struck a work vehicle.
   The NTSB said Connor's failure to hit the proper switch so the
train could cross to the right track was the result of ``of
impairment by drugs or distraction or both.''
   The agency said Amtrak shared responsibility with Connor for the
accident. It said the passenger line should develop a procedure ``to
prevent locomotives or trains from entering out-of-service track
sections, unless permission has been received from the person in
charge of the out-of-service track ... ''
   Amtrak also failed ``to adequately monitor the activities and job
performance of the tower operator,'' the agency said.
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said Friday that he had not yet
seen the NTSB report.

   A program that included paid work leaves and
avoiding physical exertion cut the premature birth rate at a French
hospital by a third, but its cost-effectiveness is debatable,
researchers say.
   Participants could take longer leaves than the six-week paid
leave available to French women before their due date, said
researcher Emile Papiernik.
   For example, a woman whose job involved a lot of standing might
begin the leave 10 weeks before the due date, said Papiernik,
chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the
University of Paris, South.
   The program also included teaching women to avoid physically
taxing situations at home like moving a household, and to follow
such steps as sitting rather than standing when washing clothes,
Papiernik said Friday in an interview.
   It also stressed close relationships with caregivers, he said.
The overall goal was to reduce physical exertion that triggers the
uterus to contract during pregnancy.
   A study of more than 16,000 deliveries at the hospital found that
while premature deliveries stood at 5.4 percent of live births for
1971-74, they decreased to 3.6 percent for 1979-82.
   The study could not demonstrate statistically that work leaves
themselves made a difference, but they probably helped, Papiernik
wrote in a book about the research.
   But an American expert said the French approach would incur
``inappropriate and unnecessary costs'' in the United States because
most participants would have had full-term pregnancies anyway.
   Most women at risk for premature births carry their fetuses to
term, and physicians cannot predict with great accuracy who will
deliver prematurely, said Paul MacDonald of the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
   MacDonald also said many women may not want to pass up economic
and psychological benefits of working.
   He and Papiernik spoke at a seminar sponsored by the March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.
   Some 350,000 American babies every year are born more than three
weeks before the end of the normal 40-week term, the foundation
says. They account for 70 percent of infant deaths, and are at risk
for such problems as cerebral palsy, seizure disorders, mental
retardation, and impairments of vision and hearing.

<HEAD>President Lauds Japanese Emperor For Role In Ending WWII</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ President Reagan mourned the death of Emperor
Hirohito of Japan, saying he played ``a truly heroic role'' in
ending World War II hostilities between his country and the United
States.
   ``On behalf of the people and government of the United States, we
extend our deepest condolences to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor,
to the Imperial family, and to the People of Japan,'' the president
said in a statement released by the White House shortly after the
annoucement of the emperor's death Friday.
   Reagan said the emperor's 62-year reign ``spanned one of the most
tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the
history of mankind _ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a
most vicious war, astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic
political and social changes throughout the world.''
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end and leading the Japanese people through a period
of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the
prosperity the Japanese know today and in the close relations our
two nations and peoples now enjoy,'' Reagan said.
   The president recalled the late emperor had visited the United
States in 1975, and that he and his wife Nancy had ``enjoyed several
meetings with him, most recently in Tokyo'' in 1986. The statement
also noted the first couple had entertained the former Crown Prince
Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko at the White House in 1987.
   ``While we mourn the passing of His majesty, we shall long
remember him for his contributions which strengthened the United
States-Japan relationship and set a future course of continued close
and friendly relations,'' the president said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that because there
will be a waiting period before Hirohito's funeral, the decision on
whom to send would be up to the incoming administration of George
Bush.
   Bush sent letters of condolence to both Hirohito's son, Akihito,
and the prime minister of Japan, Noboru Takeshita, said Sean Walsh,
a press aide in the vice president's office.
   Bush met the late emperor once on a 1982 visit to Japan. Akahito
visited Bush at his home during a trip to the United States last
year. The two played tennis together on that occasion.
   Bush's office did not release the text of the letters. Walsh said
Bush conveyed ``his sincerest condolences'' to Akahito on the death
of his father, and expressed similar sentiments in the letter to the
prime minister.

<HEAD>The Biggest Decision of a 62-Year Reign _ Surrender in World War
II</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Obit-Hirohito, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: First available for Saturday AMs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one
overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to
defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific
conflict in World War II.
   Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito
became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and
steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology. He was the
last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
   But in his first 20 years, the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as
a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.
   The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so
intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who
became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of
25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign ``Showa'' _
``enlightened peace.''
   The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no
significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military
adventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it was his first effective
decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific
conflict.
   On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb
devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the
second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of
Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the
sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.
   Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on
until annihilation?
   Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and
obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular
leader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of his
sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of
families who lost everything in air raids.
   ``I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he
said. ``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to
relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is
burdened.''
   Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji,
whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese
isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers:
   ``The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.''
   In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break with
tradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 _ the first time
ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally
announced the decision to surrender.
   He told the ravaged nation that ``the war situation has developed
not necessarily to our advantage.''
   Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped
trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A.
MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. It was the first time
Hirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls
on the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and became
its postwar governor.
   On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperor
publicly renounced his divinity. It was a choice that enabled
Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured
that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had
demanded.
   It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this
gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a
``living god.''
   The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that
of a kind uncle.
   He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. He
possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several
species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on
hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.
   In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular
comic book series.
   Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to
Japan.
   A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in
March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled
supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should
be abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
   From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the people
to rebuild.
   The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said
Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling
times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery
from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.
   Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito
remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.
Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited
from speaking on any controversial subject.
   Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-old
imperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to be
reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one
role, that of emperor.
   His education came as Japan surged into the modern world. The
feudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died,
Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmly
committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to the
grave.
   Hirohito studied government and law with private tutors. When he
was 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad _ the first time
any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside
Japan.
   Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations. He was also
received by Pope Benedict XV.
   The young man handled money for the first time, paying his own
fare on the Paris subway. He developed a passion for bacon and eggs
and it became a lifelong breakfast habit. A palace chamberlain said
in a 1980 interview that Hirohito shunned Japanese food ``unless it
is forced on him by an unwitting host.''
   Hirohito also acquired a preference for Western clothes. He was
never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace
official confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own a
kimono.
   Hirohito became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his father
became a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five years
later and was formally enthroned in 1928.

<HEAD>Senator Puts Off Mideast Trip After Questions Raised About Aide</HEAD>

   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., has postponed a
trip to the Middle East after approval was withdrawn for his chief
political fundraiser to accompany him as a temporary staffer on the
Senate payroll, a spokesman said.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the new Appropriations Committee chairman,
withdrew approval for Earl Katz to make the trip after receiving an
inquiry about the arrangement.
   DeConcini had been scheduled to leave today for a 12-day trip to
nine Mideast countries. Spokesman Robert W. Maynes said Katz had
arranged the trip and it now would be postponed.
   Katz, a retired Phoenix-area real estate investor who has been
DeConcini's chief fundraiser and Middle East adviser for years, was
being placed on the Senate payroll for 21 days so he could arrange,
and go on, the trip, Maynes said.
   Katz planned to repay his $115 salary to the government and pay
as much of his expenses as he could, the spokesman said.
   The Post reported that a spokeswoman for Byrd said that committee
tradition did not permit members of a senator's personal staff to
make trips on committee business without approval from the majority
leader.
   Katz was placed on the payroll temporarily so he could travel on
military aircraft and get an official passport and visas, Maynes
said.
   ``I'm not exactly sure why Sen. Byrd as the majority leader
approved it in December and then as chairman of the Appropriations
Committee unapproved it today,'' Maynes said.
   DeConcini had planned during his trip to discuss his opposition
to arms sales to the Arab countries. The State Department hoped
officials in those countries might persuade the senator to be less
vociferous in his opposition, Maynes said.
   Katz has traveled with DeConcini to the area twice before,
although those trips did not involve military transportation.

   In the 44 years since he survived a
massacre of Americans at a Japanese prisoner of war camp in World
War II, Glenn McDole had often wondered what happened to his
Filipino rescuers.
   A balky telephone answering machine almost cost him a chance to
find out. But thanks to the persistence of a Wisconsin nurse named
Mary Anne Ancheta, McDole finally has been able to track down the
guerrilla band that saved him.
   Forty-four years ago, Mrs. Ancheta was Mary Anne Major, a
7-year-old whose father ran a guerrilla camp in the Philippines;
McDole was a young Marine who was brought into the camp with malaria.
   ``He was shaking like a leaf, he had the chills,'' she said
Friday. ``I remember him, although I didn't remember his name.''
   Last month, she noticed an article about a reunion of American
prisoners of war in the Philippines, saw McDole's name and called
his home on New Year's Eve. But the tape on his answering machine
ran out and he didn't get her last name or phone number.
   Publicity about his request to have ``Mary Anne'' call again
resulted in a story in a Green Bay newspaper Wednesday. Mrs. Ancheta
saw it and called McDole on Thursday.
   ``I saw it at 11 at night and it was too late to call. I couldn't
sleep and I called the next morning,'' she said. ``I felt like I
have known him all that while. It's overwhelming. I'm so glad to
know he's alive and well after all that ordeal.''
   For McDole, the conversation recalled December 1944, when he and
about 150 other Americans were held by the Japanese in Palawan
Prison.
   He had been there 33 months when American forces staged an
invasion nearby.
   ``They made a feint to come toward us but turned away,'' McDole
recalled. ``That's when the Japanese decided to annihilate the group
of prisoners. They had us down in trenches, and they threw in
gasoline and torches. The ones who climbed over the edge were
machine gunned.''
   McDole's trench was the one nearest to a 60-foot cliff
overlooking a bay.
   ``We had started digging through anyway, and we knocked the side
of ours out and went over the cliff. I think 20, 25 of us made it to
the beach, but some of them panicked and they were gunned down.
   ``I got pinned down and hid under a pile of garbage. I stayed
there all night and part of the next day. I thought I was the only
man of the 150 to be alive. You do a lot of praying and crying, and
I knew that if I didn't make it, nobody would know what happened.
They (the Japanese) would probably blame it on our own planes.''
   Of the 150 prisoners, 11 escaped and six were brought to the
guerrilla camp run by Maziro Major, now 88 and retired in Manila
after a career in the Army.
   ``It turns out he was educated in Kansas, which is where he met
his wife,'' McDole said. ``They were wonderful to us. They saved our
lives.''
   The rebels protected and healed the Americans for a month, when
they were picked up by a Navy sea plane. The two groups never made
contact again.
   Mary Anne eventually became a nurse in the office of her husband,
Dr. Valentino Ancheta, in Algoma, Wis., while McDole, 67, is now
chief of the patrol division of the Polk County sheriff's office.
   McDole said he, too, was overwhelmed by the call. ``It's brought
back some of the concerns of what happened to the family. I've
thought about them all a lot. Then all of a sudden, boom, you get a
call and I find out the captain is still alive and this is his
daughter. I'm going to get a letter off to the captain today. I feel
real good.''
   ``All these years, I had been hoping to meet one of those men,''
she said. She and McDole said they both hope to attend a reunion
next December.

   Throughout his lifetime, Emperor Hirohito reigned
behind the wide moats and imposing stone walls of the vast Imperial
Palace grounds in central Tokyo. During his 62-year reign, only once
did an exclusive interview with him appear in print.
   The Imperial Household Agency zealously protects the imperial
family from intrusions, but granted the unique interview to a
persistent American journalist shortly before Hirohito's 1975 visit
to the United States.
   Bernard Krisher, Tokyo bureau chief for Newsweek Magazine from
1968 to 1980, kept his campaign secret from competitors.
   ``Ever since I came here I waited for an occasion to persuade the
Imperial Household Agency to grant me an interview,'' Krisher, now
chief editor of Focus, a Japanese-language magazine, told The
Associated Press.
   For six months after the announcement of Hirohito's trip, Krisher
spent about half his time meeting with lower- and middle-level
officials. ``I knew they couldn't help me, but I asked them not to
oppose or discuss my campaign,'' Krisher said.
   Finally persuaded that an interview before the emperor's U.S.
visit would be worthwhile, Imperial Household Agency officials
relented. Krisher was permitted to meet the monarch at the Imperial
Palace for 32 minutes. Although he was asked to submit questions in
advance, Krisher was allowed to ask other questions.
   The emperor described his overseas tours _ to Europe in 1921 and
with Empress Nagako again in 1971 _ as the happiest times of his
life. ``My happest expectation is looking forward to our trip to the
United States,'' Hirohito told Krisher.
   ``As to my view of Americans, they seem to have very clear-cut
views; they are always straightforward, pragmatic and realistic; I
believe they are a people who are very easy to be friends with,''
the emperor said.
   During his two-week visit with the empress, Hirohito met
government officials and farmers and dined with Hollywood stars. He
had said the visit was the fulfillment of a 50-year-old dream.
   Although Hirohito admitted to a desire ``deep in my heart'' to
become a common man and to be closer to his people, he also
expressed his belief that ``most Japanese still have a respect for
the imperial family.''
   The imperial tradition has survived for centuries in Japan, he
said, ``because, throughout history, the imperial family has always
given first thought to the welfare of the people.''
   The next emperor, Hirohito's son Crown Prince Akihito, ``may have
his own ideas, but it has always been the tradition of the imperial
family to act for the benefit of the people so I am also looking
forward to such an attitude on his part as well,'' he said.
   The emperor hesitated to name influential people in his life, but
did speak of his grandfather the Emperor Meiji. During the Meiji era
(1868 to 1912), Hirohito's grandfather played an important role in
introducing public education and in modernizing his mostly
agricultural nation.
   ``I always have kept his deeds in my mind,'' Hirohito said.
   The emperor said the saddest time of his life was during World
War II. Unable to watch his people suffer further after the atomic
bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hirohito accepted Allied
surrender terms in August 1945, urging his nation to ``bear the
unbearable.''
   ``At the time of the termination of the war, I made the decision
on my own. That is because the Prime Minister failed to obtain
agreement in the Cabinet and asked my opinion. So, I stated my
opinion and then made the decision according to my opinion,''
Hirohito told Krisher.
   The emperor has never made a direct public admission that he
opposed the war, maintaining that the constitution would not permit
him to do so.
   ``Now at the time of the outbreak of the war and also before the
war, when the Cabinet made decisions, I could not override their
decisions,'' he said.
   Krisher's interview went to press soon after he met Hirohito.
About a week later, the emperor met with a small group of foreign
reporters, who had been outraged when the exclusive Newsweek article
appeared. ``Nothing could top that interview,'' Krisher said.

   Once a familiar figure who often accompanied Emperor
Hirohito in his travels, Empress Nagako in recent years has been
confined to a wheelchair and seldom makes public appearances.
   The 85-year-old empress married Hirohito, who died Saturday,
nearly 65 years ago and would have celebrated her anniversary later
this month.
   Born March 6, 1903, Nagako was the daughter of Imperial Prince
Kuniyoshi Kuni. She was brought up in Tokyo, attending the elite
Peer's School for Girls.
   She later received instruction from two American Quakers,
Elizabeth Vining and Esther Rhoads, who were credited with inspiring
many of the democratic changes which permeated the private life of
the imperial family. Mrs. Vining also tutored Crown Prince Akihito
to his fluent English.
   At age 15, Princess Nagako was one of several prospective brides
selected for Hirohito, then crown prince.
   He chose her over the objections of some powerful court
officials, including the Fujiwara family that traditionally supplied
imperial brides. They tried to stop the engagement by producing
medical records of color blindness in her mother's family, but
doctors disputed the claims and Hirohito made it clear he already
had decided.
   Once betrothed, the couple met only nine times during their
six-year engagement. The wedding, set for 1923, was postponed after
the Great Kanto Earthquake in September left much of the capital
burned and in ruins. They were wed in an elaborate ceremony on Jan.
26, 1924.
   On Christmas Day in 1926, Nagako became empress of Japan when
Hirohito succeeded to the legendary Chryanthemum Throne on the death
of his father, the Taisho emperor.
   Married longer than any imperial couple in Japan's history, she
called him ``okami,'' or honorable master, and he affectionately
referred to her as ``Naga-miya,'' Naga from her name and miya
meaning princess.
   She gave birth to seven children. The first four were all girls,
and court officials urged Hirohito to take a concubine to ensure
there would be a male heir to the throne.
   But the emperor refused, and the next child was a boy, Crown
Prince Akihito, who was born on Dec. 23, 1933. Prince Hitachi was
born in 1935 and a fifth daughter in 1939.
   Two of their children died, a daughter during infancy and the
eldest child, the former Princess Teru, at age 35 in 1961.
   The empress enjoys writing 31-syllable poems called ``waka,'' and
plays the piano, violin and koto, a 13-stringed Japanese instrument.
   She studied painting under two of Japan's most respected artists,
signing her work ``Toen,'' or Peach Garden. Collections of her works
have been published in two volumes, and an exhibition of her
drawings was held when she and Hirohito traveled to Washington in
1975.
   According to custom, she spent most of her time with her husband
and family at the moated imperial palace in central Tokyo or their
mountain and seaside villas.
   She kept busy with various indoor duties, including newspaper
clipping for the emperor and keeping track of greetings to foreign
dignitaries, imperial household officials say.
   Confined by a back ailment and hip problems to a wheelchair, the
empress in recent years has rarely appeared in public. But her
smile, graceful wave and devotion to her husband have made her a
familiar, grandmotherly figure to the Japanese.

<HEAD>Transplant Experts Hopeful Despite Another Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Multiple abdominal organ transplants are still
in the early stages of development where failure is common, but hope
remains high despite the death of another toddler following the
risky surgery, experts say.
   ``We're in areas that are essentially unchartered,'' said Dr.
Marc Rowe, chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh. ``What we're doing is making tentative steps and then
very carefully analyzing where we've been and what we've learned
before we make any decision about the next one, when we'll do one or
whether we'll do one.''
   The fifth of six children in the country to undergo a multiple
abdominal organ transplant died Friday. Three-year-old Rolandrea
Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., survived six weeks with a transplanted
liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and portion of a large
intestine, and was awaiting another set of organs.
   Four other recipients died shortly after the transplants, and the
sole survivor, Calvin Oliveira, 14 months, of Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
was doing well Friday, despite a seizure earlier in the week and a
bout of pneumonia, said Dr. Tony D'Alessandro, a transplant fellow
at the University of Wisconsin.
   The boy received a small intestine and liver Dec. 31 at the
University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison.
   ``Every organ that's been transplanted has had its early
problems,'' D'Alessandro said. ``There are hurdles that you have to
go over and along the way you have to learn from everything that's
been done in order for things to progress.''
   The death of five patients is ``very disappointing,'' said Dr.
James W. Williams, director of transplantation at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   ``But this is what happened in the early days of liver
transplantation,'' he said.
   Rolandrea, better known as Rolly, was with her parents, Brandon
and Cyndi Dodge, when she died in the hospital's intensive care unit.
   The child's chances of withstanding another five-organ
transplant, providing a suitable donor could have been found, began
to dwindle Friday as her condition swiftly deteriorated. Her name
was placed back on the transplant waiting list Wednesday, four days
after tests showed her small intestine was being rejected by her
body's natural immune system.
   Doctors do not know whether any of the other four organs
transplanted Nov. 29 were rejected or to what degree, Rowe said.
   The child was born with a disorder that prevented her intestines
from absorbing food and liquids.
   The nation's first multiple abdominal organ transplant was
performed in 1983 by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh, who pioneered liver transplants. That first patient, a
6-year-old girl, lived only a few hours.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, questioned the ethics of the operation.
   ``Even if it worked well and people were living with a good
quality of life, I'm still not sure there are enough potential
donors,'' Caplan said. ``It's very rare to have someone with five
good organs.
   ``I'm also not sure society is going to view giving them all to a
single person is the best thing to do. I don't,'' he said. ``I think
if you can spread the organs to more people, that is what should be
done. The ethical principle should be to save the most lives.''
   Intestines are especially difficult to transplant because of the
extremely technical nature of the surgery, the lack of biological
markers indicating organ rejection, and the bowel's ability, unique
among organs, to counterattack the patient's immune system,
D'Alessandro said.
   The longest survivor of a multiple organ abdominal transplant,
Tabatha Foster, 3{, of Madisonville, Ky., died last May, six months
after receiving five organs at Children's Hospital.
   ``Unfortunately, many, many children are in desperate need of
having this sort of operation,'' Rowe said. ``We can't possibly
think about the success and failure. What we're thinking about is
trying to have a child who has a fatal disease ... and trying to
have them live and have a good life.''

   Akihito, who becomes Japan's first emperor to ascend
the Chrysanthemum Throne as a human and not a living god, has
quietly transformed the cloistered monarchy into a popular symbol of
the people.
   The gray-haired Akihito has waited 55 years to take up the
imperial mantle. A gracious, self-effacing man schooled among
commoners, he has spent those years maturing with his country.
   As Hirohito lay dying, the prince assumed the full roster of the
emperor's official duties on Sept. 22.
   The prince's daily shuttles from his residence near the forested
imperial compound to Hirohito's deathbed drew swarms of
photographers. Whether in predawn darkness or afternoon drizzle,
Akihito's face showed the same stoic deference to the ailing
monarch, and court physicians listening outside the imperial chamber
reported quiet conversations between father and son.
   Akihito took on the imperial duties once before as Hirohito
recuperated from intestinal bypass surgery in September 1987. He
retained a few responsibilities but returned most after the
emperor's recovery. Those duties include affixing the imperial seal
to government laws and appointments, opening sessions of parliament
and receiving foreign ambassadors.
   To these the prince has added frequent visits to factory
openings, festivals and various observances across Japan. And with
numerous trips abroad as his father's proxy, he has almost
single-handedly brought Japan's monarchy into the global age and the
eye of a curious public.
   ``I want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen,
reliable insight and knowledge,'' he once reportedly told a friend.
``I want to shake up the imperial protocol system.''
   Akihito set his most spectacular imperial precedent with his
marriage in 1959 to a commoner. Michiko Shoda was the beautiful,
cultured daughter of a wealthy miller, and the young prince courted
her by phone in a widely reported romance that was conservative, but
refreshingly typical.
   The match shocked the imperial retinue and thrilled the public.
Hirohito gave his consent and the couple married after a cavalcade
that drew 500,000 gawking subjects onto the streets of Tokyo.
   Akihito and his princess produced three children: Prince Hiro,
who at 28 is next in the imperial succession; Prince Aya, 22, and
19-year-old Princess Nori. They broke another imperial tradition
with their decision to raise the children by themselves.
   Born Dec. 23, 1933, as a militaristic Japan geared for growing
confrontation in Asia and the Pacific, Akihito was shuttled among
the imperial family's countryside villas when American planes began
firebombing Tokyo in the closing months of the war. He was still
short of his 12th birthday when his father's armies were crushed and
the nation suffered the ultimate defeat in 1945.
   At the urging of U.S. occupation officials, Hirohito also
surrendered the divinity that had been the birthright of every
Japanese monarch, and agreed to a new constitutional role as ``the
symbol of the state and of the unity of the people, deriving his
position from the will of the people.''
   Akihito took his role seriously. ``The imperial family should
always be passive,'' he has said. ``The most important thing is the
will of the people.''
   Having inherited a centuries-old legacy of passive monarchs, his
job may have been made easier. The prince, who was invested as heir
to the throne in an unprecedented public ceremony in 1952, soon set
off to represent his father on state visits around the globe,
including the coronation of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   With Michiko he has visited at least 41 countries in 22 official
trips to ``deepen understanding mutually and promote friendship
between the peoples,'' he has said.
   Akihito shares his father's proclivity for science and is a
respected scholar of gobiid fish, a mudsucker. He holds membership
in the Ichthyological Society of Japan and the Linnean Society of
London.
   ``He wants the imperial family to remain a cultural symbol of the
nation,'' his longtime chamberlain, Yasuo Shigeta, told The
Associated Press, and has encouraged his children to take up
specialties.
   He sent his first-born to study at Britain's Oxford University,
explaining, ``If (Hiro) remains in the country, he cannot know even
what the common people routinely experience.''
   ``As a matter of fact, I rode a bus for the first time when I
went to London.''
   Akihito speaks fluent English and has acted as his father's
interpreter in meetings with foreign dignitaries. He inherited his
mother's tutor, Elizabeth Vining, a Quaker from the United States.
   Mrs. Vining recalled once asking her youthful pupil what he
wanted to be when he grew up. Replied the prince, ``I will become
emperor.''
   Recent polls show his subjects welcome the career choice. A
nationwide newspaper poll in 1987 showed more than 80 percent of the
public wants to keep the imperial system.

<HEAD>California Tobacco Tax Hike Means Coughing Up More Cash for Smokes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: First available for Saturday AMs</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California smokers and smokeshop owners are
fuming over a week-old tobacco tax increase that boosts the cost of
a pack of cigarettes from a vending machine to $2 or more.
   The tax, approved by voters in November and effective Jan. 1,
jumped from a dime to 35 cents on a pack of cigarettes and raised
the price of cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff and pipe tobacco by 42
percent.
   ``They're leaving here screaming,'' said Mike Mustafa, a clerk at
Mike's Grocery in San Francisco. ``They're saying `No way.' They
storm out the door. They think it's only me raising the price. I
tell them, `You voted for it.'''
   The hike makes California's tobacco tax one of the nation's
highest. Minnesota's tax of 38 cents a pack on cigarettes is tops;
by contrast, North Carolina, where tobacco is the leading cash crop,
charges a mere 2 cents a pack.
   The tax increase coincided with price increases from many
wholesalers and a new federal tax of 45 cents a pound on tobacco.
Some manufacturers are charging 75 cents a pound more for pipe
tobacco and 5 to 15 cents more for each cigar.
   A pack of regular domestic cigarettes that sold for about $1.50
two weeks ago is now selling for $1.75 over some counters, $2 to
$2.25 in vending machines and $3 at Candlestick Park concession
stands.
   At one smoke shop, the price of a 14-ounce package of pipe
tobacco jumped from $10.56 to $18.16.
   The tax is expected to generate $650 million in revenue to be
spent for health care for the indigent, research on smoking-caused
diseases, smoking prevention education and fire prevention. It was
approved by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin.
   American Tobacco Institute spokesman Walker Merryman in
Washington, D.C. said no one really knows how many people may cut
back on smoking or quit, but the longterm economic impact on the
industry undoubtedly will be negative.
   ``I think it's a brutal tax. You don't see this sort of tax on
alcohol,'' said Judy Adami, whose family has run the Smoke Shop at
Bank of America headquarters in San Francisco for 18 years.
   Cigarette sales are down, Adami said, but faring even worse are
high-quality cigars. Cigars that sold for about $63 a box a year ago
are about $100 now.
   She blamed the declining sales on the tax increase, New Year's
resolutions by many smokers to quit and end-of-the-year stockpiling.
   Adami said many customers are stoic: ``The answer I get is, `This
will separate the men from the boys.'''
   ``It was amazing how many cigarettes we were selling during the
last week of the year,'' said Joe Singleton, owner of Ramona Village
Market and Liquor in Chino, south of Los Angeles. ``The
manufacturers couponed their products. With everybody stockpiling, I
think they did pretty good at getting rid of their old inventory.''
   At a tobacco shop in El Cerrito, about 15 miles east of San
Francisco, an owner who asked not to be identified said he sold only
two packs of cigarettes between New Year's Day and late Thursday.
   ``This is a state tax that is killing me and killing me,'' he
said, adding that he may shut down unless business improves. He
contended that election advertising for the proposition stressed
taxes on cigarettes alone.
   Bob Wharton, a Smokewatchers International director and longtime
leader of stop-smoking clinics, doubted that higher prices affect
the habits of hardcore smokers.
   ``The biggest thing that motivates people to stop smoking is peer
pressure ... more than all the health scares, surgeon general's
warnings or price,'' he said.
   At The Tinder Box Tobacco Shop in Glendale near Los Angeles, a
woman who asked not to be named said, ``My mother told me if it was
$2 a cigarette, she'd still smoke.''
   Researchers at the National Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta issued a report Thursday saying that smoking is more of a
mark of the poor and less educated and has declined across all
educational groups.
   The researchers also said fewer than 10 percent of college
graduates will smoke in the year 2000, but at least 30 percent of
those with no more than a high school education will.
   More than 50 million Americans smoke. Smoking-related deaths
claim 390,000 lives in the United States annually, according to
Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman with the American Cancer Society
in New York.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush says he will go before a
joint session of Congress soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration to
spell out his idea of a ``flexible freeze'' on spending to bring
down the federal budget deficit.
   Bush, who still has two Cabinet-level vacancies to fill,
announced a series of nominations for top ambassadorships and State
Department jobs Friday, including the selection of his longtime
national security adviser, Donald P. Gregg, as ambassador to South
Korea. He also named Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a protege and
associate of Henry Kissinger, as his choice for deputy secretary of
state.
   The Gregg nomination could spark controversy because of the
involvement of the former career Central Intelligence Agency officer
in the Iran-Contra affair while serving on the vice president's
staff.
   Bush was spending this weekend out of the public eye, with no
indication of when he will name an energy secretary and appoint a
drug-czar.
   The president-elect surprised his wife Barbara on their 44th
wedding anniversary by taking her out to dinner Friday night with
friends at a posh Italian restaurant, Tiberio's, followed by a trip
to the nearby Kennedy Center to see the play, ``Sheer Madness,'' a
Bush spokeswoman, Alixe Glen, said.
   Earlier Friday, Bush told reporters he will unveil ideas for
reducing the deficit to a special joint session of Congress after
his inauguration. He gave no specific date.
   While expressing support for President Reagan's decision to back
a 50 percent pay increase for members of Congress and other top
federal officials, Bush said he may revisit the pay question when he
is president.
   ``I don't know whether we can afford anything other than to get
this deficit under control,'' he said, adding that when ``the buck
is stopping on my desk, I may have something else to say'' about it.
   Eagleburger was a career foreign service officer who rose to the
No. 3 job in the State Department, undersecretary for political
affairs, in 1982 before retiring in 1984 to join Kissinger in a
consulting business. He is currently president of Kissinger
Associates, Inc.
   The transition office also announced Bush will nominate Henry E.
Catto, a former White House protocol chief, as ambassador to
Britain, and Vernon A. Walters, the outgoing United Nations
ambassador, as ambassador to West Germany.
   Bush, in a brief exchange with reporters, said Iran-Contra
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh ``did the right thing'' in moving to drop
two key charges against Oliver North because of national security
concerns.
   ``I think he properly found that there are legitimate national
security interests that need to be protected,'' said the vice
president.
   Bush will not make a formal State of the Union address until next
year, but aides say they expect the new president to address
Congress a few weeks after the Jan. 20 inauguration.
   Pressed for details of his proposed spending freeze, Bush
replied, ``I'll tell you when I take my message up to a joint
session of the Congress.''
   Reagan is sending Congress a lame-duck, $1.2 trillion budget for
fiscal 1990 on Monday. Administration officials say it will hold the
deficit to $92 billion.
   ``I won't have time to submit a budget this thick,'' said Bush,
holding his hands a foot apart. ``But I will have time to analyze
the president's proposals _ a budget, incidentally, that will go up
there without raising taxes _ and say, `Here's what I'll add here
and take off a little there,' something of that nature.''
   The 1990 budget year begins Oct. 1 of this calendar year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan will propose
eliminating 80 programs, many of them survivors of past Reagan hit
lists.
   ``I hasten to emphasize that this is a Reagan administration
budget and not a Bush administration budget,'' said Fitzwater, who
will also be Bush's spokesman. Bush will make some alterations and
change some priorities, Fitzwater said, ``but this is not a
good-cop, bad-cop exercise.''
   Friday's Bush appointments include five top positions at the
State Department under Bush's secretary of state-designate, James A.
Baker III.
   In addition to Eagleburger, the others nominated for State posts
are:
   _Robert B. Zoellick, a former Treasury official under Baker, to
be counselor. He served as issues director for Bush's campaign.
   _Margaret D. Tutwiler, to be assistant secretary for public
affairs and spokeswoman for State. She is a former assistant
Treasury secretary who also served under Baker at the White House.
   _Janet G. Mullins, assistant secretary for legislative affairs.
She is currently director of congressional relations for the
president-elect and was deputy national political director and media
director of his campaign.
   _Dennis B. Ross, director of the policy planning staff with
ambassadorial rank. He was Bush's national security adviser during
the campaign and a member of the National Security Council staff
from 1986 to 1988.
   The transition office also announced that Bush is keeping M. Alan
Woods as head of the Agency for International Development and
nominating Joseph Verner Reed Jr. as chief of protocol.
   All of the posts except Ross's require Senate confirmation. Reed
does not have to be reconfirmed.

   In a modest tent surrounded by crumbling
palaces where Ethiopian emperors reigned for 250 years, a United
Nations official appealed for funds to rebuild the grandeur of this
Marxist state's feudal past.
   ``These sites are part of our universal cultural heritage,''
UNESCO chief Federico Mayor told Western ambassadors, international
donors and representatives of other U.N. agencies Thursday. ``The
history of this region is as imposing as the historical remains are
impressive.''
   The director-general of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization arrived in Ethiopia's capital
Wednesday to dramatize the need for $14.5 million for Ethiopia's
10-year program to restore palaces, monasteries, castles and other
monuments that UNESCO has declared heritages of mankind.
   Mayor immediately flew to Gondar, 285 miles northwest of Addis
Ababa, a city graced by palaces and castles built by emperors who
ruled between 1632 and 1868.
   Palaces such as Gondar's Ras Beit are in need of restoration
because they have been used continuously for two or more centuries.
Ras Beit is an 18th century edifice used as offices of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam's government.
   Some monuments were nearly destroyed in warfare between different
dynasties and in resistance to foreign invasions. Others fell into
disrepair because of neglect.
   In need of repair are the 11 fantastical churches hewn from rock
in northern Lalibella town, monasteries around Lake Tana, the source
of the Blue Nile, and the granite-carved obelisks of Axum which once
rose 13 storys high.
   Axum's tallest obelisk, an intricately carved stone column that
once stretched up 100 feet, has fallen. The tallest still standing
is more than 75 feet high, the height of a 10-story building.
   They were built when a a flourishing kingdom existed around 500
B.C. in Axum, 341 miles north of Addis Ababa in wartorn Tigray
province. The king and his subjects embraced Coptic Christianity in
330 A.D. During the Middle Ages this kingdom gave way, through
palace feuds and intrigues, to others in the south.
   However by 1636, Gondar had become the capital of centralized
authority in the mountainous region, giving Ethiopia a political
entity long before European colonization.
   Mayor said Ethiopia's monuments ``are treasures, a legacy of
civilizations spanning more than 40 centuries.
   ``Anyone who sees the state into which the masterworks have
fallen would shudder and move into action to preserve these and
other jewels of Ethiopia's past for the common enrichment of present
and future generations,'' he said.
   He appealed to the international community to contribute money,
equipment and services for the restoration.
   The 50-state Organization of African Unity announced from its
Addis Ababa headquarters the first donation of $10,000 to help
restore treasures of one of the continent's most ancient
civilizations.
   Ethiopian Culture Minister Ghirma Yilma said his country's rich
cultural history had attracted scholars from many parts of the
world. Ethiopian artifacts and art are to be found in museums all
over the world, he noted.
   Ghirma said the government, established after a 1974 coup ousted
the late Emperor Haile Selassie, was keen to see the ancient
monuments restored.
   Gondar, Lalibella and Axum form the Ethiopian Tourist
Orgnization's ``northern historic route.'' However, tourism there
has been handicapped since the rebel Tigrean Peoples' Liberation
Army took up arms against the government 14 years ago, demanding
more autonomy for the province.
   Mayor took issue with reporters who asked whether money spent on
restoration of ancient monuments could not be better spent on people
affected by natural calamities like the droughts and famines which
intermittently afflict the East African nation.
   ``Guaranteeing opportunities to learn about and share our common
heritage is also indispensable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tower In Good Condition After Colon Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The physician who operated on former Sen. John
Tower said the colon surgery shouldn't interfere with his serving as
secretary of defense in President-elect George Bush's cabinet.
   ``Sen. Tower is in excellent health and he should expect a 100
percent recovery,'' Dr. R.D Dignan said Friday. ``And I see no
reason whatsoever why he can't pick up where he left off.''
   Dignan and other doctors removed a polyp and a one-foot section
of Tower's colon during a three-hour operation Thursday. The polyp
and section of colon appear to be benign, doctors said, although
final reports from an analysis of the growth and tissue were not
expected to be available until today.
   There is little chance of previously detected malignant cells
resurfacing, Dignan added.
   Tower, 63, appointed defense secretary-designate by Bush on Dec.
16, was listed in good condition Friday night, hospital officials
said.
   The former Republican senator is expected to remain hospitalized
another seven or eight days, and Dignan has recommended that he rest
in Dallas another four or five days after being released.
   Doctors discovered the colon polyp Dec. 27 when physicians
performed a colonoscopy and removed a cancerous rectal polyp they
had discovered in November.
   ``All of the malignant cells from the rectal polyp have been
removed and there is nothing but a high likelihood that a cure has
been achieved. I think it would be the remotest possibility that he
would have any additional trouble,'' Dignan said.
   Dignan said the surgical procedure is standard for a broad-base
polyp and similar to surgery performed on President Reagan.
   Physicians also removed lymph nodes and a small portion of
Tower's small intestine.
   Tower must return for regular examinations to insure that other
polyps do not develop, but will not be expected to make any changes
in his diet or take any prescription medicine.
   Tower, who retired in 1985 after 24 years in the Senate, served
as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and headed the White
House's Iran-Contra investigative panel.

<TEXT>
   When Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender
over the radio in 1945, his voice, until then unheard by commoners,
shocked a nation battered by countless bombings and exhausted by a
war it could not win.
   But later in his reign, the emperor's voice and appearances on
television became part of the nation's yearly routine, showing the
transformation of Hirohito's role from aloof god to gentle symbol.
   Retired shopkeeper Tadashi Fujii recalled the emperor's Aug. 15
announcement: ``When I heard the broadcast I just didn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it was the emperor.''
   Said Fujii, 65, then in the Imperial Navy, ``Some people thought
he was a god. We were educated to think of him as a deity, but when
we heard his voice on the radio with all the static, many of us were
just relieved that (the war) was all over, that we could go home.''
   When Hirohito assumed the throne in 1926, the ancient idea that
the emperor was a direct descendant of the sun goddess had been
rejuvenated and hammered into the minds of the Japanese by
19th-century reformers who sought to overthrow feudalism and justify
their ``modern'' approach to government.
   The reformers realized that though the emperor and imperial
family have rarely wielded power, no government has been able to
rule without their tacit approval.
   Historians agree that the emperors of Japan have not held real
power since the ninth century. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 is
named after the Meiji emperor, but he was then only 15, and it was
his ministers who made all the changes that created modern Japan.
   The reformers' constitution of 1889, on paper at least, declared
Hirohito's grandfather, the Meiji emperor, to be sacred, inviolable
and the supreme authority in all matters of government.
   Wartime militarists built on the god-emperor image, turning it
into impetus to keep the nation fighting. In the war's final days,
Hirohito did assert himself, telling generals: ``I cannot bear to
see my innocent people suffer any longer.''
   The postwar constitution, largely imposed by U.S. occupation
authorities, redefined the emperor's role. He became ``the symbol''
of the state and of the people. The emperor himself told the nation
he was not a divinity in 1946.
   During the Allied occupation, Gen. Douglas MacArthur chose to
deny a request by the emperor to step down and take responsibility
for the war, opting instead to get him out among the people to help
create an egalitarian society.
   The emperor responded in 1946 by embarking on a 165-day trek
around the country, covering all provinces but Okinawa.
   ``His travels in the provinces right after the war played a key
role in boosting morale and unifying the Japanese,'' said Toshiaki
Kawahara, a journalist and author specializing in the imperial
family. ``He met the people, talked to them.''
   And the imperial will as interpreted by MacArthur continued long
after the occupation ended in 1952 and Japan took control of its own
destiny.
   ``The emperor served as a symbol and a uniting factor in the
nation's redevelopment,'' Kawahara said.
   By opening the Chrysanthemum Throne to an extent never before
seen, Hirohito's postwar reign also symbolized the nation's growing
democratization, Kawahara said.
   Each year since 1958, to celebrate the New Year and Hirohito's
birthday on April 29, the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo
were opened to swarms of Japanese seeking a glimpse of the monarch,
who would wave and give a short speech.
   One year after these public appearances began, the emperor
allowed his son, Crown Prince Akihito, to marry a commoner. The
break with tradition greatly enhanced the popularity of the imperial
family.
   But direct contact with common Japanese became more infrequent as
Hirohito aged.
   The ambivalence of the nation's young people toward the emperor
and the imperial system was reflected by a 25-year-old office
worker, Toshiko Kodama, who said: ``I feel nothing but pity for him.
He was so weak.''

<HEAD>Wave of Polish Sailors Jumps Ship in Boston</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish trawler captain who was afraid his sailors
might try to jump ship in Boston Harbor refused to enter the port,
but 16 crewmen determined to flee their homeland simply hopped
aboard a refueling barge.
   The sailors' decision to jump ship Thursday was the latest in a
wave of defections that immigration officials say is unusual and
puzzling. Forty-eight sailors, all members of Poland's banned
Solidarity union, have fled from three Polish fishing vessels in
Boston in the last month, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials said.
   ``Ship jumping is a very common occurrence in all U.S. ports. But
even so, I don't remember hearing of these kind of numbers,'' said
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the INS in Washington.
   Jervis said he could not understand the defections, because ``if
anything, things in Poland have improved in recent years.''
   The sailors, who applied for political asylum Friday, said the
decision was easy, the opportunity difficult.
   Between bites of pepperoni pizza at Boston's Polish-American
Club, Tadeusz Waliszewski, 36, said he had been thinking for more
than two years of defecting to the United States and decided to make
the jump as soon as the trawler Kantar reached Boston from Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
   However, he and his shipmates feared their chance might slip away
when the captain canceled a two-day shore leave for the 57-man crew
and refused to enter Boston's inner harbor.
   ``He said there would be no leave, because they were worried
about more defections,'' Waliszewski said through an interpreter.
``So he stayed out in the harbor, but he had to send for a fuel
barge.
   ``At that point, when we saw the barge coming, we went to the
captain and told him there were 12 of us who were going to defect,
no matter what,'' he said. ``We asked for our passports and other
documents. He refused to give them to us ... but we were determined
and we just took our bags and left.''
   Andrei Kryzianowka, 27, said the captain warned the defectors
that their families in Poland would face hefty fines, but he did not
physically try to block them.
   ``Even if the captain had wanted to, he couldn't have gotten
anyone to help him,'' Kryzianowka said.
   Not all the defectors got away at once.
   The barge pulled away after the first dozen men had jumped onto
it. The other four jumped ship when it returned three hours later.
   Polish-American families have offered to take the sailors in
while the INS reviews their applications for political asylum, said
Cathryn MacInnes, an immigration consultant to the city.
   All the sailors will receive temporary work permits, but
permanent asylum will be granted only if they can prove they would
face persecution upon their return to Poland, said Timothy A.
Whelan, deputy director of the INS in Boston.
   Thirteen Polish sailors who fled two vessels after docking in
Boston in January 1988, were granted political asylum by April under
what the federal government considers an expedited process, Ms.
MacInnes said.
   Waliszewski said most of the sailors left wives and children
behind, but are hopeful that their families will be allowed to join
them eventually.
   ``Of course, it's very hard,'' he said. ``I did talk about it
with my wife, but at this point she doesn't know I actually am here.
We all have families, and we're all thinking about them now.''

   Citibank, the largest bank in the nation, can
operate a subsidiary to insure municipal bonds, says the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
   In a precedent-setting ruling, an appeals court panel said Friday
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the chief regulator
of nationally chartered banks, properly permitted Citibank to
purchase the American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp., known as AMBAC.
   The American Insurance Association challenged the decision by
Comptroller Robert L. Clarke and lost in the U.S. District Court
here. The association won a decision by an appeals panel in August
but Friday's decision reverses that part of the ruling.
   Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures bank deposits and is the primary regulator of
state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve,
said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman was ``quite pleased'' with the
decision.

   727s.
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Aviation Administration. wants
airlines to replace thousands of rivets on more than 600 older
Boeing 727s. The goverment also wants them to initiate inspection
procedures until the modifications can be completed.
   The FAA estimated Friday that the repairs and extra inspections
of 623 older Boeing 727s will cost the airlines approximately $35.7
million.
   The proposed directive on the Boeing 727s requires that airlines
over the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets,
depending on the model of 727 involved. It said the ``countersunk''
rivets now on the planes are believed to cause cracking under some
circumstances, while the substitute ``button-head'' is less likely
to do so.
   The proposed FAA directive is similar to an order issued last
October for older Boeing 737s. A final order will not be issued
until after a brief comment period.

   The United States and Libya engaged in a
verbal dogfight in the Security Council over the authenticity of
photos that Washington says prove a Libyan MiG was armed when it was
shot down by U.S. jets.
   The U.S. envoy said Friday the photographs clearly show a Libyan
aircraft armed with missiles, not _ as he put it _ ``a bouquet of
flowers.'' He said the U.S. pilots acted in self-defense after using
evasive air maneuvers five times to try to avoid the approaching
jets.
   The Libyan envoy called the photographs ``fakes ... fabricated
pictures ... directed in a Hollywood manner'' by actors and clever
editors. Libya says the planes were unarmed reconnaissance craft.
   The already bad relations between the United States and Libya
worsened in recent weeks with U.S. assertions that Col. Moammar
Gadhafi's government is ready to begin production of chemical
weapons in a desert factory outside Tripoli. Libya says the plant is
designed to make pharmaceuticals.
   Washington's U.N. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters dramatically
exhibited two blurred photographs Friday that he said showed
missiles under the wings and fuselage of one of the two Soviet-built
MiG-23s shot down by two U.S. F-14 Tomcats on Wednesday over
international waters of the Mediterranean Sea.
   U.S. officials say they believe the other plane was similarly
armed.
   The photographs were passed around the council during the
session, which Libya had sought in order to condemn the United
States. The session adjourned until Monday morning.
   The United States and its British ally are expected to veto the
resolution of condemnation drafted by the 101-nation Non-Aligned
Movement.
   About 25 speakers, mostly from Arab and non-aligned nations, have
denounced the U.S. action in the U.N. session. No one has supported
it, but U.S. allies have not yet spoken.
   Libya says the U.S. government wants to provoke a Libyan
retaliation so it can launch a full-scale attack.
   U.S. planes raided two Libyan cities in 1986 to retaliate for
purported Libyan support of terrorism in connection with the bombing
of a West German disco frequented by U.S. servicemen.
   A spokesman for Libyan Information Minister Rajab Abou Dabbous
said Friday that 14 U.S. planes _ not two _ attacked the Libyan
craft.
   The United States says the photographs were taken from videotape
of the encounter made by the pilot of one of the U.S. aircraft. It
says they show two views of a single aircraft armed with Aphid and
Apex missiles.
   However, not everyone was convinced on Friday. Soviet Ambassador
Alexander M. Belonogov told the council that the U.S. military
action was ``absolutely unfounded.''
   He said the photographs were blurred and added, ``It's immaterial
whether the Libyan planes carried any missiles or were just pure
reconnaissance planes. ... We cannot recognize the right of a
military plane of one country to shoot down a military aircraft of
another country just because they both happen to be very close to
each other in international airspace.''
   ``I'm not going to get into a hassle over the quality of image,''
Walters retorted after Libya criticized his evidence. ``The
important thing is that U.S. aircraft made five evasive maneuvers to
turn away from the oncoming MiGs.
   ``If you are walking down a dark alley at night and you see a man
who has a gun, and you cross the street and he crosses the street,
you slow down and he slows down, you speed up and he speeds up,
you've got to realize that he's not coming to present you with a
bouquet of flowers,'' said Walters.
   He said the U.S. planes were on a routine mission and acted in
self-defense.
   However, the Libyan envoy reminded the 15-member council that in
July a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian commercial airliner in the
Persian Gulf because crewmen mistakenly believed it to be an
attacking warplane. All 290 people on the plane were killed.
   ``We are in the country of Hollywood,'' he told reporters. ``It
is very well edited, very well done _ and it is not true.''

<HEAD>Skyjacker Who Spent 5 Years In Cuban Prison Gets 5 More In U.S. Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who hijacked a jetliner to
Cuba and spent five years in prison there has been sentenced to
spend another five years in a U.S. prison.
   Robert Richter, 31, of suburban Chicago, received the sentence
Friday from U.S. District Judge William Zloch, who rejected a
federal probation officer's recommendation to let Richter remain
free on probation.
   Richter hijacked an Air Florida flight from Fort Lauderdale on
July 7, 1983, when he was 26 years old and reportedly fascinated
with Cuba.
   Less than 24 hours earlier, the U.S. government said it had
received word that Cuba was cracking down on hijackers and that any
sky pirates landing there could expect to spend 50 years in a Cuban
prison.
   When Richter returned to the United States in June, he pleaded
innocent to U.S. charges. He later changed his plea.
   Richter's odyssey began when he boarded Air Florida Flight 8 at
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. He used a fake bomb
to force the crew to take the Boeing 737 to Havana instead of Tampa,
its scheduled destination. Air Florida is now defunct.
   Richter was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years
in prison. He probably would still be in the prison in Cuba if not
for the efforts of his father, Chicago businessman John Richter.
   Neither Richter's father nor the FBI have discussed how Richter's
release was achieved. But the FBI has insisted that the U.S.
government was not involved in the negotiations.
   Since his return from Cuba, Richter has been free on a $250,000
bond signed by his father, and has worked for his father's business.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has turned south
Texas into a detention camp with a ruling that prevents Central
American immigrants from traveling to other areas to apply for
asylum, a lawsuit contends.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Brownsville,
seeks to reverse Immigration and Naturalization Service rules of
Dec. 16 that made it impossible for most asylum-seekers to leave
south Texas or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial of
their claims.
   ``In essence, South Texas has been transformed into a de facto
detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says the
lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of Central Americans and other
asylum-seekers in the INS Harlingen District at the southern tip of
Texas.
   Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in Harlingen were allowed to
travel to their U.S. destinations to apply for asylum, often Miami
or Los Angeles. INS officials said they adopted the new procedure in
Harlingen to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb
abuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum
cases.
   At least 30,000 Central Americans passed through the area last
year, according to INS figures. Most of them enter the United States
illegally in the Brownsville area of the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
the nearest land point to Central America.
   ``Due to the new policy to process these cases in Harlingen,
severe backlogs have been created and hundreds of refugees are
forced to sleep overnight on the sidewalk outside the INS office so
as not to lose their place in line,'' the lawsuit said. ``Many are
sleeping in empty lots and eating from garbage bins. Many are
traveling with small children who also are forced to endure winter
elements without shelter.''
   The lawsuit names U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and
INS Commissioner Alan Nelson as defendants.
   INS officials in Washington declined to comment.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville has agreed to
hear a motion Monday for a temporary restraining order, said Robert
Rubin, managing attorney for the Immigrant and Refugee Rights
Project for the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs.
   The order would again allow asylum-seekers to pursue their cases
at their destinations, where the attorneys said many have families
and friends to help them.
   The lawsuit accuses the INS of implementing a policy change
without publishing it in the Federal Register for public comment; of
denying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel;
and improperly restricting the right to work.

   Prosecutors in the Pentagon procurement
investigation say an initial 27-count indictment is just the start
of an expected wave of court activity in the prosecution phase of
Operation Ill Wind.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia
said the pace of the investigation that began more than two years
ago is moving with unprecedented speed, given the complexity of the
case.
   ``In the next few months you will see a great deal of additional
activity,'' he said.
   On Friday, a federal grand jury filed the first charges in the
procurement case, accusing a defense contractor, a Navy employee and
five other men with crimes including conspiracy, bribery and theft
of government property.
   Hudson, who is leading the nationwide investigation into the
Defense Department's $150 billion-a-year purchasing system, said the
indictment ``strikes at the very heart'' of alleged corruption in
the procurement process.
   Kenneth Walton, an FBI official, said the ``No. 1 priority'' of
the bureau's white collar crime program is fraud in the Defense
Department.
   The 86-page indictment focuses on activities alleged to have been
undertaken by Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a branch
of Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, and three men: Navy procurement
specialist Stuart E. Berlin and private consultants Fred H. Lackner
and William L. Parkin, a former Navy acquisitions official.
   Specifically, the indictment charges that Teledyne and three of
its officers agreed to pay Parkin $160,000 to assist them in
obtaining a Navy contract related to radar worth $100 million.
   The indictment contends Parkin paid Lackner, a California-based
private consultant, who ``in turn paid Stuart E. Berlin ... for his
assistance in manipulating the procurement process to insure that
the ... contract was awarded to Teledyne,'' Hudson said.
   Berlin participated in various decisions within the Navy
affecting the contract and is accused of giving Teledyne advance
information so the company could tailor its bids, Hudson said.
   If convicted of all charges, Berlin, Parkin and Lackner could
face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $5.5
million each, Hudson told a news conference. Teledyne faces a fine
of up to $6.5 million.
   Also named in the indictment were Teledyne employees George H.
Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer. They could face
confinement ranging between 50 and 85 years and fines of up to $2.5
million if convicted on all counts.
   The overall conspiracy charge says the defendants worked together
to defraud the Navy and the Air Force, to bribe a public official,
to make false statements and to commit wire fraud.
   In advance of the indictment, Teledyne's attorney, Thomas Patten,
said the company had been offered a deal by the government but was
unsatisfied with the terms. Attorneys for Parkin and Lackner have
contended their clients did nothing wrong and would be vindicated in
court.
   Before the indictment was returned, another company, Hazeltine, a
division of Emerson Electric Co., agreed to plead guilty in U.S.
District Court to conspiracy to defraud the United States,
conversion of government property and making false statements to the
government, company attorney Scott Muller said.
   Under terms of the agreement Hazeltine, which is cooperating with
the government, agreed to pay fines of nearly $2 million, including
court costs.
   Two former Hazeltine employees, Joseph Colarusso, 58, who was the
company's senior vice president, and Charles Furciniti, 54, who was
a marketing representative, also pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud.
   The maximum sentence they could face is five years in jail and a
$250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton set sentencing
for March 17.
   Michael Savaides, 41, an employee of Teledyne Electronics,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. He, too, could be
sentenced to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Prosecutors said those pleading guilty had agreed to cooperate
with the government in exchange for reduced charges. All had a
relationship with Parkin and Lackner, the consultants who allegedly
paid bribes to Berlin.
   Investigators said Hazeltine hired Parkin to obtain inside
information from Pentagon employees that would allow the company to
compete for a $15.9 million contract for battlefield equipment.
   Hazeltine said in a statement that it ``has already taken
additional steps to enforce its longstanding requirement of ethical
business behavior and to guard against such incidents in the
future.''
   Federal agents used telephone wiretaps in the case, which was
first made public last June when agents searched offices and homes
of people suspected to be involved.
   At the Pentagon, defense officials said the Navy is ``reviewing
all information released in connection with the indictments
announced ... by the Justice Department to determine any necessary
action regarding Navy programs, personnel, contractors or
consultants.''

<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A former minister charged in the
starvation death of his son did not buy food with the $3,700 he was
saving for God, but never gave the money to the church, either,
police and church leaders said.
   Larry and Leona Cottam were charged Thursday with murdering their
son, Eric, 14, who was found by police Wednesday in the Cottam's
modest Nuangola home, just outside Wilkes-Barre in northeastern
Pennsylvania. The 5-foot-10 teen-ager weighed 69 pounds.
   Police said they found no food in the house, but Cottam turned
over $2,131 in cash, two $50 savings bonds, a savings account book
showing a balance of $1,281 and a checkbook showing a balance of
$263.
   Cottam told police the family had not eaten since Nov. 22.
   ``Larry Cottam said he did not spend the money because it did not
belong to them,'' according to an affidavit by state Trooper James
J. Henry Jr. ``He stated that the money was `tithe' money and
belonged to God.''
   Cottam told police all four family members had discussed using
the tithe to buy food but decided against it, according to the
affidavit.
   Frank Kowalski, first elder at the Seventh-day Adventist church
near Nuangola, said Cottam had not paid a tithe to the church since
the family moved to Nuangola from the Pittsburgh area in 1985.
   Pastor Paul Jensen, who works at the church's state headquarters
in Reading, said tithes are standard for Seventh-Day Adventists, but
not at the expense of a believer's family.
   ``We don't believe in starving people,'' Jensen said. ``We don't
believe you should neglect your family for your tithe.''
   Seventh-day Adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the
Bible as their sole rule of faith and practice.
   Cottam, 39, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor was fired from
his job as a truck driver in March.
   The couple and their 12-year-old daughter, Laura, were listed in
serious condition Friday with varying degrees of malnutrition,
dehydration and vitamin deficiencies.
   In addition to the criminal homicide charges, the Cottams face
two counts each of recklessly endangering another person and two
counts each of endangering the welfare of children.
   They could get the death penalty if convicted on the homicide
charge.
   Officials from the Luzerne County Children and Youth Services
filed a petition Friday to take custody of Laura Cottam.
   Cottam was hired as pastor of four local Seventh-day Adventist
churches six years ago.
   He was transfered to Pittsburgh when he couldn't get along with
the congregation, Kowalski said. He lost the post in 1985 and his
pastor's license with the church, and the family moved back to
Nuangola.
   ``I think they took the Lord and tested him to the extreme,''
said Kowalski. ``You know, I know, everybody knows food don't fall
out of the sky.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned
today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation
to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic
pre-eminence.
   Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87, however, was decidedly
cool in several Asian countries, including South Korea, which
endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
   While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, a
government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment,
considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan
relationship.''
   The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said, ``We have
complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year
rule over Korea during his reign.''
   A leading newspaper in Seoul, The Joong-Ang Daily News, wrote
that Hirohito's death ``reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced
period and ... humiliation. ... Hirohito is the symbolic figure who
must assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterous
crimes to the Korean people.''
   Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist
south in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that
began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.
   There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese
government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between
Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United
Evening News said:
   ``Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of
Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity
with Hirohito's death. ... Chinese suffered the most from the
Japanese invasion.
   ``It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United
States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to
China to show his sorrow.Now, Hirohito has died. We may not want to
collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful
historic lessions.''
   In the United States, President Reagan said in a statement, ``His
Majesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet
at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind _ an
age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war,
astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and
social changes throughout the world.
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision
to end World War II.
   In New Zealand, Prime Minister David Lange said Hirohito's death
marks the end of an era.
   ``During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent
period in Japan's modern history to the stability and prosperity of
today,'' Lange said.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines sent condolences to
the imperial family and her foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, a
Japanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised Hirohito as
``a stabilizing factor'' in the creation of a democratic Japan.
   ``He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmly
committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals,''
Manglapus said.
   Condolences also came from King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar of
Malaysia to Hirohito's oldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, who
immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia paid his respects in a
message to Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita: ``Throughout
his long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his
people. Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a
new age, our thoughts are with you.''
   But Bruce Ruxton, an official of the Returned Services League,
which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, said
there would not ``be too many tears shed around the world.'' He
described Hirohito, whose role in the war has been debated, as ``one
of the worst war criminals.''
   Marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarch's
life _ his 12 books published on hydrozoa, or sea animals. Robert
Hessler of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., said Hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined role
as leader.
   ``The poor man didn't really get to do what he wanted to do. He
had to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal human
being,'' Hessler said.

   The majority of public television
stations will carry national prime-time programs on the same night
beginning this fall.
   The move is intended to assist viewers confused by Public
Broadcasting Service programs appearing on different nights in
different cities, said Bruce Christensen, president and chief
executive officer of PBS.
   ``(It's) a move to a coherent national schedule,'' Christensen
said at a television critics convention.
   Ninety percent of PBS stations will reserve two hours Sunday
through Thursday night for designated national programs, Christensen
said. Individual stations are free to run national programs at any
time between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the specified night.
   The goal of the same-night schedule, Christensen said, is to
capitalize fully on PBS program reviews appearing in national
publications and, therefore, improve slumping PBS ratings.

   A book containing H.G. Wells' ``The Time

too soon. It was due 18 years ago.
   The paperback book, which also included Wells' ``War of the
Worlds,'' was returned along with a letter via mail by Ronald L.
Sklaver of Los Angeles, who found it at a bargain bookstore in Rome,
said librarian Melba Herrmann.
   ``It is now your turn to sell it on a bargain shelf,'' he wrote.
``It's too bad that Wells' time machine didn't work or we could know
how the overdue book ended up in Rome on a bargain shelf.''
   Sklaver's letter said he came across the book at an English
language bookstore. He said it took him two months to read it and
then he decided to return it.
   On the library's fine schedule of 5 cents per day for overdue
books, the 6,716-day period would have come to $335.80. However, the
maximum fine is $5 so whoever checked the book out in 1970 need not
worry.
   The librarian said there are no records of who borrowed the book.
   The library paid 95 for the book, Ms. Herrmann said.
   Ms. Herrmann said she planned to write Sklaver a letter of thanks.

   The proud father of newborn quintuplets says he's
taking it in stride and is ready to man the diaper brigade.
   ``It's one of those cases where whatever happens, you make the
best of it,'' Billy Wilson, 34, of Auburn Hills, said Friday at a
press conference.
   The quints, nine weeks premature, were born by Caesarean section
over a period of two minutes starting a 6:37 p.m. Thursday to Mary
Jo Wilson, 30.
   Cameron Patrick, Anthony Michael, Shelby Nicole, Rebecca Irene,
and Elizabeth Ashley ranged in weight at birth from 2 pounds, 9
ounces to 3 pounds, 7 ounces.
   All five and their 30-year-old mother were listed in stable
condition, doctors at Sinai Hospital said.
   A beaming Wilson, wearing all five of the babies' identification
bracelets on his wrist, said while he may not be prepared for
rearing five babies at once, he has some experience.
   ``I changed more diapers on Brad than Mary did,'' the diesel
mechanic for General Motors Corp. said of the couple's 2{-year-old
son.
   The incidence of quintuplets is one in 65.6 million without the
use of fertility drugs, according to a hospital fact sheet.
Estimates on the chances of multiple births range from 6 percent to
30 percent when fertility drugs are used, as in the Wilsons' case,
Schwartz said.
   Mrs. Wilson is handling the ordeal well, nurse Lisa Hahn said.
   ``She has a very good sense of humor,'' Hahn said. ``Basically,
she has to.''

<HEAD>New Emperor's Reign To Be Known As `Heisei'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's new imperial era was formally named
``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for Emperor
Akihito's reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,
the government announced today.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi announced the new name,
which will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends Japan's 2,600-year-old
Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Emperor Hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-month
illness. He was 87.
   His oldest son, Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded him.
   ``Heisei'' was chosen for Akihito's reign because the word,
consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning of
achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a statement.
   ``I think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the
coming `new age,''' Takeshita said.
   The new era officially begins Sunday, with this year becoming
Heisei 1. The name was approved by Takeshita's Cabinet today, and
Akihito signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal
effect.
   Reflecting Japan's postwar democratic constitution, private
citizens were included for the first time on the council that
recommended three names for the new era to the Cabinet. The group
also included Cabinet ministers, Imperial Household Agency officials
and scholars.
   The opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight.
   Hirohito's reign, which began Dec. 25, 1926, was known as Showa,
the era of ``enlightened peace.'' By the Japanese calendar, this
year was Showa 64.
   During the Showa era, Hirohito saw his nation plunge into World
War II and suffer history's first atomic attack, announced its
surrender, and later saw it rise to economic superpower status.
   On the death of Hirohito, Japan's longest-reigning monarch,
Akihito succeeded automatically to the throne, becoming the 125th
emperor in the world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same
family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C.
   In a ceremony a few hours after Hirohito died, Akihito received
three sacred treasures _ a sword, jewels and the imperial seal _
that have been handed down through the centuries.
   Other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years,
ending with the formal enthronement.
   A debate over naming the eras of Japan's emperors had flared
between opposition parties and the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party, which revived the era-naming clause in 1979 after it was
dropped from the postwar constitution.
   The Socialist Party and the Communist Party favor the exclusive
use of the Western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the
constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the Japanese
people.
   The era-naming tradition was imported from China, and reflected a
belief that the sovereign controlled time itself.

   Most of the 94 Haitians intercepted by the U.S.
Coast Guard on a 30-foot wooden sailboat off the Florida Keys have
been detained until a judge decides whether they should be deported,
authorities said.
   The Haitians, who told officials they had spent 15 days on the
boat, were rescued Friday after it ran onto rocks off the coast of
Grassy Key near Marathon, the Coast Guard said.
   ``This is the largest number of Haitians to get here in nine
years,'' said Perry Rivkind, district director of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service in Miami.
   Three of the refugees were treated at Fishermen's Hospital in
Marathon. One woman had gone into labor, one man had suffered a
possible heart attack and another man had fainted, Rivkind said.
   Rivkind said there were ten pregnant women and three children in
the group.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito played a major role in ending
World War II between Japan and the United States, according to
documents in Washington archives.
   President Reagan paid tribute to the actions of Hirohito in
helping to end the the hostilities and leading the Japanese people
through reconstruction after the mikado died on Friday.
   The Japanese account of Hirohito's role in the last days of the
war was first made public when the State Department in 1969 issued
the 1945 volume in its continuing series of U.S. diplomatic
documents. Historians regard his acts then as one factor influencing
the U.S. decision against including the emperor among Japanese
leaders prosecuted for war crimes.
   One lengthy report to Washington describes the Hirohito as
changing his customary practice of acquiescing in all decisions of
others to put the brakes on a futile war effort that was out of
control.
   After the collapse of Germany it was obvious to Japanese leaders
that the war was lost but ``the force of militarism and the momentum
which was carrying the war along were like a bicycle rolling down
hill without brakes: there was no way to stop it and the army itself
did not know how to give up,'' said the November, 1945, account of
the Japanese version of events leading to surrender.
   Max W. Bishop, a political adviser to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the
supreme allied commander, wrote the report quoting a long
conversation with Hisatsune Sakomizu, who was chief cabinet
secretary under Japan's last wartime Prime Minister, Kantoro Suzuki.
   Suzuki, an admiral, had been Hirohito's aide-de-camp for six
years and had a personal friendship with the emperor, unlike the
earlier Prime Minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, who was later convicted of
war crimes and hanged.
   Thus Hirohito for the first time ``was able to express his true
feelings through the prime minister,'' Bishop quoted Sakomizu as
saying.
   On August 9, the day Nagasaki was bombed in history's second
atomic attack, Suzuki decided that nuclear weapons and the Soviet
Union's entry into the war provided needed justification for ending
the conflict. ``The emperor agreed that the war should be brought to
an end on the basis of the (allied) Potsdam declaration,'' the
account said.
   It continued: Six top leaders discussed accepting Potsdam and
deadlocked. Prime Minister Suzuki, the navy and foreign ministers
favored acceptance provided only that the emperor was retained. The
war minister and the army and navy chiefs of staffs insisted on two
other conditions -- that allied forces not occupy Japan and that
Japan be allowed to bring home its forces without surrendering them
abroad.
   Unable to get the customary consensus, Suzuki went to the
emperor, who called an Imperial Conference at 11 p.m. Deadlock
continued, with the prime minister supported 4-3.
   ``Always before it had been the custom for a conference to reach
a decision without directly involving the emperor,'' but because of
the close division Suzuki asked him to decide, said the report.
   Bishop said Sakomizu quoted the mikado as speaking out for peace
and giving his reasons:
   ``1. From the very start of the war, the plans and information of
the military had been far removed from the facts of the true
situation;
   ``2. That to continue the war would mean the destruction of the
Japanese people and the country and would also be disastrous to
world civilization. and...
   ``3. Termination of the war in this manner at this time was in
accordance with the will of God and the destiny of the world.''
   Early Aug. 10, the imperial government messaged acceptance of
Potsdam with the understanding that the emperor would be retained. A
reply three days later said the ultimate form of government would
depend on the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.
   Suzuki favored immediate final acceptance but most of the
military again ``unalterabily opposed.'' Hirohito on his own
initiative called another Imperial Conference for Aug. 14 at which
he asked all to accept his decision to issue an imperial rescript
ending the war.
   It was readied at 11 p.m. and the emperor decided on his historic
broadcast directly to the people.
   Sakomizu also gave details of already-known unsuccessful moves by
diehard army officers to prevent the broadcast by sealing off the
palace during the night of August 15, attacking the prime minister's
official residence and burning the homes of Suzuki and Baron
Kiichiro Hiranuma, the privy council president who had favored peace.
   On August 16 the stunned populace for the first time heard
Hirohito's voice declare that the war ``has developed not
necessarily to Japan's advantage,'' and was over.

   A tip prompted by a television show led to
the South Pacific arrest of a fugitive charged with poisoning his
wife eight years ago in Michigan, officials report.
   David Richard Davis, 44, was apprehended without incident by
authorities Friday on the island of American Samoa, Michigan State
Police and the FBI announced Friday.
   An unidentified tipster who saw NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries''
in the United States on Dec. 28 contacted police Tuesday, said
Detective Sgt. Donald Brooks, of the State Police. The show was
aired the next evening in Samoa.
   Davis is accused of killing his wife, Shannon Mohr Davis, in 1980
with a fatal injection on the couple's farm in Wright Township in
Hillsdale County, about 100 miles southwest of Detroit.
   At the time, Davis told police that his wife fell off a horse,
hit her head and died. Medical examiners, however, found in her body
traces of a muscle relaxant that is nearly impossible to detect.
   They also found Davis had taken out several insurance policies
worth a total of $250,000 just before his wife's death.
   Shannon Davis' father, Robert Mohr, said in a telephone interview
from his Toledo, Ohio, home that he hadn't lost hope that Davis
would be apprehended some day.
   ``We've never, ever given up hope. We just figured one day he
would make a mistake,'' said Mohr.
   Davis was arrested at the airport in Pago Pago, the American
Samoa capital and business center of the territory, about 2,300
miles south of Hawaii. In addition to the first-degree murder charge
in Hillsdale County, he was charged with federal flight to avoid
prosecution.
   Authorities said Davis was a pilot for several island airlines.
   FBI spokesman Harlan Frymire said Davis' arrest was uneventful.
   ``He at first denied his identity,'' Frymire said. ``By a stroke
of luck, Davis didn't see the show.''
   Davis was using the name David Myer Bell in Samoa, Michigan
Attorney General Frank Kelley said. He added it was uncertain how
long it would take before Davis was returned to Michigan. Davis
could waive extradition.
   Frymire said Davis, who had taken a new identity and had
remarried, lived in American Samoa for the past four years.
   ``He wasn't your typical fugitive,'' he said. ``Apparently, he
had posed as a doctor, nurse and even as a harpsichord player.''
   Frymire said Davis was expected to be brought to Honolulu on
Sunday. He said Davis probably would be arraigned before a U.S.
magistrate on Monday.
   American Samoa is the only U.S. territory south of the equator.
An estimated 38,000 people live in its seven islands. Davis was last
seen in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Dec. 24, 1981.

<TEXT>
   Feuding Shiite Moslem militias battled
with mortars and machine guns in Beirut's violence-scarred streets
and the hills of south Lebanon today despite a call by Iran's
president to end the weeklong fighting.
   Four people were killed and 12 wounded in battles between the
Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, police
said.
   Syrian troops intervened in Moslem west Beirut to impose a
precarious cease-fire in the capital.
   A police spokesman said three combatants were killed and eight
wounded in the fierce street battles that spilled into the battered
commercial district of Moslem west Beirut.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said a Hezbollah fighter was killed and four people wounded in
artillery and mortar exchanges in south Lebanon.
   By police count, 33 people have been killed and 92 wounded since
the Shiite clashes flared Dec. 31.
   Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in nine months of
intermittent fighting between the two factions, who are battling for
dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran appealed Friday to both factions
to end the bloodshed.
   ``Vengeance will not solve anything in Lebanon,'' Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Khamenei as saying in Tehran.
The dispatch was monitored in Cyprus.
   The thud of exploding shells and the crackle of automatic weapons
fire echoed across Beirut during the night as Amal militiamen staged
hit-and-run attacks against Hezbollah positions near the western
edge of the Green Line that divides Beirut into Moslem and Christian
sectors.
   Hezbollah responded by firing mortars into Amal-controlled
districts of west Beirut to ease the pressure on its fighters, the
police spokesman said.
   Syrian troops armed with AK-47 assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades moved into the contested sector before
dawn to enforce a cease-fire, he reported.
   The clashes were the heaviest fighting between the Shiite
factions in west Beirut since Nov. 27, when the Syrians imposed a
cease-fire after six days of violence in which 40 people were killed
and 87 wounded.
   In south Lebanon, Amal gunners fired howitzers at Hezbollah
fighters in the villages of Jbaa, Jarjou, Arab Saleem, Louwaizeh and
Ein Bouswar on the northwestern edge of Israel's self-proclaimed
``security zone,'' which runs along Lebanon's southern border.
   Hezbollah fired mortars into Amal supply lines.
   ``No change of positions was reported in the region,'' the police
spokesman said, who noted that the southern fighting died down early
today.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is made up of Shiite fundamentalists
loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The more secular Amal,
Syria's main surrogate in Lebanon, rejects Iran's religious
influence over Lebanon's Shiites.

<HEAD>Afghan Official: King Can Play Role But Najib Won't Quit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior member of Afghanistan's
Soviet-style ruling party said today that deposed King Zahir Shah
could play a role in ending the Afghan war but President Najib would
not resign.
   Najmuddin Kawyani, one of 14 Politburo members of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan, accused anti-government guerrillas
of blocking efforts to form a broad-based government.
   Leaders of the Afghan Moslem resistance, who have been meeting
this week in Pakistan with the Soviet first deputy foreign minister,
Yuli Vorontsov, vehemently reject the participation of Najib and his
party in any future government.
   ``Najib will not resign, and we have not heard any such thing
from Moscow,'' Kawyani told a news conference at the Afghan Embassy
in New Delhi.
   Najib told Western journalists in Kabul last month he was willing
to do anything to bring peace to his country as Soviet forces
withdraw, but he avoided saying whether that included resigning.
   Kawyani, who comes from Najib's own Parchami faction of the
party, said: ``I must emphasize that without the participation of
the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, peace is impossible.''
   Asked about Zahir Shah, the deposed monarch whom Vorontsov met in
Italy last month, Kawyani said:
   ``The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan is of the view
that the ex-king, Zahir Shah, can play a role in a political
settlement of Afghanistan. ... We're waiting for him to express a
point of view. We're interested in a settlement. The return of Zahir
Shah does not mean a return of the monarchy.''
   Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud,
who was killed five years later in the coup that installed the
Soviet-backed government. In 1979, Soviet troops intervened in
Afghanistan to help defend the government from Moslem guerrilla
attacks.
   In the last few years, the party has sought to distance itself
publicly from its Marxist beginnings, but the Moslem resistance
movement, composed of seven Pakistan-based parties and eight
Iran-based parties, routinely refers to the party as ``godless
communists.''
   Zahir Shah is increasingly mentioned as the only Afghan leader
with sufficient stature to serve as even a symbolic leader.
   Vorontsov met resistance leaders in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 3,
giving the guerrillas the Kremlin's first public recognition as a
negotiating force for Afghanistan's future.
   The guerrillas have been fighting Kabul's government since the
1978 coup. With arms supplied by the United States, Pakistan, China
and several Arab nations, the guerrillas also attacked Soviet forces
that numbered 115,000 a year ago.
   The Soviets started withdrawing troops last May under a
U.N.-sponsored accord signed in Geneva. The remaining 50,000 Red
Army soldiers are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by Feb. 15 under
the accord.
   Kawyani, in his late 30s with a black mustache reminiscent of
Josef Stalin, accused the United States and Pakistan of violating
the Geneva Accord by continuing to arm the guerrillas.
   He demanded Pakistan stop providing shelter for the guerrillas.
The seven mujahedeen parties based in Pakistan openly maintain
offices in Peshawar, 20 miles from the Afghan border.
   ``A council of peace should be formed from all the involved
parties,'' Kawyani said. ``Another option is an international
conference under the auspices of the United Nations.''

<TEXT>
   The grandson of Soviet revolutionary leader
Leon Trotsky, back from his first visit to the Soviet Union in a
half-century, said the Soviet attitude toward his grandfather is
full of contradictions.
   However, Esteban Volkow Bronstein said the fact that he was
granted a visa indicated a slight improvement in his grandfather's
status.
   Volkow said Friday that he spent five days in Moscow last month
visiting Alexandra Zakharonavna, his half-sister and Trotsky's
granddaughter.
   ``She's very gravely ill with cancer,'' said Volkow.
Nevertheless, he said, they had a happy reunion. Volkow said he
hadn`t seen his sister since he fled the Soviet Union with his
mother in 1931, when he was 5 years old.
   Volkow was living with Trotsky in Mexico City when the former
head of the Red Army was assassinated on Josef Stalin's orders on
Aug. 20, 1940.
   Trotsky, born Lev Davidovich Bronstein, was one of the leaders of
the October 1917 revolution that established the Soviet Union, but
he lost a power struggle with Stalin and was exiled in 1929.
   Under Stalinism, Trotsky was deemed a non-person, reviled in the
Soviet Union.
   It was only recently that Trotsky's reputation began to be
revived as Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost gathered steam.
   Trotsky's name is now sometimes mentioned in public and he is
described as an enemy of Stalin rather than an enemy of socialism
and the revolution.
   Last year, the Soviet Supreme Court rehabilitated a son, Volkow's
uncle Sergei Sedov, who was executed on Stalin's orders in 1937. The
court ordered all charges against Sedov dropped.
   Volkow said he traveled to Moscow shortly after the earthquake
last month that devastated Armenia, killing about 55,000 people.
   ``We had trouble getting seats, there were so many people flying
to Moscow to help,'' said Volkow.
   He said in addition to visiting his sister, he met with about 500
members of a group formed in Trotksy's memory. He said he was also
interviewed on videotape by Ogonyonk, the magazine on the leading
edge of glasnost.
   ``I don't know if they'll broadcast the videotape,'' he said. ``I
think it was for use sometime in the future.''
   Volkow, a retired chemical engineer, believes his grandfather's
role in the founding of the Soviet Union should not be distorted or
hidden.
   Volkow also said he left the Soviet Union at such a young age
that he remembers almost nothing. He now considers himself a Mexican
and said Moscow was extremely cold.
   ``It was all snow,'' Volkow said.

<HEAD>Storm Whips Northern Plains with Winds, Heavy Snow</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A storm whipped strong winds and heavy snow into the northern
Plains early today, dumping up to a foot of snow in North Dakota,
while another storm moved off the Northeast coast leaving behind
accumulations of up to six inches.
   The storm centered over the western edge of the central Plains
produced snow and strong winds from the central Rockies to the
northern Plains, with the heaviest snowfall in North Dakota and
Minnesota.
   Fargo, N.D., had at least 12 inches and Fergus Falls in western
Minnesota received up to 10 inches.
   Temperatures dropped into single digits and below zero along the
country's north-central tier and strong northerly winds produced
wind chill readings of 30 to 50 degrees below zero in the western
Dakotas.
   The winds were expected to cause drifting of snow and reduce
visibilities to near zero in some areas.
   The storm was expected to move into the Mississippi Valley later
today, and winter storm warnings were in effect today for much of
North Dakota, northeastern South Dakota and Minnesota. Winds up to
45 mph and as much as 18 inches of snow were expected in places.
   To the south, the storm was slinging freezing rain from southern
South Dakota across northwest Iowa into southern and central
Wisconsin.
   Snow also fell in northern portions of Arizona and New Mexico,
with Gallup, N.M., receiving 4 inches.
   Winter weather was winding down in the Northeast after a storm
hit the mid-Atlantic states and southern New England with freezing
rain and snow.
   The heaviest snowfall was in New Jersey, where Audubon recorded 6
inches. New York City received 4 to 6 inches and flights at John F.
Kennedy International Airport were delayed by up to three hours
Friday evening.
   Warmer air was moving in behind the storm, and dense fog and some
drizzle extended from the southern and middle Atlantic Coast states
to the Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys. Visibility was near zero
in parts of Iowa, Missouri and Ohio.
   Friday's high was 90 degrees at Laredo, Texas. Several places
throughout the south set or tied record highs for the date, with
Atlanta and San Antonio setting new marks of 73 and 84 degrees,
respectively, and Houston and New Orleans tying their record highs
of 80 and 79 degrees, respectively.
   Today's forecast called for snow from Upper Michigan across the
upper Mississippi Valley to the northern Plains and upper Missouri
Valley, as well as in the Rockies and mountains of central Arizona.
Rain was forecast along the Oregon coast, and showers and
thunderstorms were predicted for the rest of the Great Lakes, the
lower Ohio Valley, the middle Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee
Valley to the central Gulf Coast.
   Highs were predicted to be below zero or in single digits from
the western edge of the northern Plains to the northern Rockies; in
the teens and 20s from northern New England to Upper Michigan,
Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska, the remainder of the Rockie;
in the 30s and 40s from central New England to New Jersey, across
the remainder of the Great Lakes, the central Mississippi Valley,
Kansas, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles and the northern half of
the Pacific Coast; in the 70s from the South Carolina coast to
northern Florida and along the central Gulf Coast to south central
Texas; and in the 80s in southern Texas and much of the Florida
Peninsula. Highs elsewhere were predicted to be in the 50s and 60s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 16 degrees below zero at
Houlton, Maine, to 74 degrees at Brownsville, Texas.

   Japan will bury Emperor Hirohito after weeks of
ceremonies that will follow closely the rituals and pageantry of his
father's funeral 62 years ago.
   The formal state funeral is planned for Feb. 24, Kyodo news
service reported, quoting government sources. There was no immediate
government announcement.
   Hirohito died today from intestinal cancer. He was 87.
   Ceremonies to purify the mausoleum where Hirohito's body will
lay, to enshrine his spirit and to mark the departure of the
imperial hearse from the palace for the burial site are among 29
funeral rites planned.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will head a committee to decide
funeral details.
   Hirohito's father, Emperor Taisho, was buried 45 days after his
death on Dec. 25, 1926, in an elaborate garden ceremony that
included a funeral march of 6,000 people.
   ``Although there have been many changes since then, including
major changes in the constitution, in practical terms there won't be
many alterations in the funeral rites,'' a palace official said
before Hirohito's death.
   That would mean there could be more than 61 different ceremonies,
rites and imperial court appearances extending over at least two
years before his son Akihito's formal ascension to Japan's
2,600-year-old Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Many are directly linked to Japan's native Shinto religion, for
which the emperor serves as chief priest.
   Hirohito was considered a living Shinto god until allied
occupation authorities forced him to renounce his divinity after
World War II. The postwar constitution makes the emperor the
``symbol of state.''
   Officials say Hirohito's body will be placed in a casket two or
three days after his death.
   The funeral, on a day that will be declared a national holiday,
will include a procession of top officials and foreign dignitaries
to a royal burial ground.
   In a departure from common Japanese practice, palace officials
said the emperor will not be cremated.
   Government officials avoided talking about the funeral before
Hirohito's death, believing it inappropriate while he was still
battling his illness.
   The 45-day period after Taisho's death was likely related to the
time required for foreign dignitaries to travel to Japan, since only
boat transportation was available at the time, the palace official
said.

   In Hawaii, where one-quarter of the population is of Japanese
descent, Emperor Hirohito was remembered as a symbol of unity who
helped Japan emerge as a leading democracy in Asia.
   Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years, died today of intestinal
cancer at age 87. His eldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, 55,
immediately became the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Elsewhere Friday, Americans made books of condolence in
Washington state and Colorado as officials planned to mark his
passing in ceremonies during the coming days.
   In Washington, D.C., President Reagan offered condolences and
lauded Hirohito for playing ``a truly heroic role'' in urging his
country to surrender after the atomic bombing of Japan by the United
States at the close of World War II.
   Mourning was most evident at the Japanese consulate in Honolulu,
where Hirohito had planted a tree during a 1975 visit to the
Islands. The Japanese flag flew at half-staff and officials
monitored Japanese radio accounts of Hirohito's death.
   Consul General Tadayuki Nonoyama invited mourners to the
consulate on Monday and Tuesday to sign a book of condolences for
the royal family.
   Nonoyama said his own loss was made greater because he had known
Hirohito, once serving as an interpreter in the royal household.
   ``I have a deep affection for the emperor. He was a very sincere
man,'' Nonoyama said.
   Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, said he had great respect for
Hirohito, with whom he met on several occasions.
   ``The emperor's role as a symbol of unity contributed to the
miracle performed by the Japanese people in developing their country
as the leading democratic nation in post-war Asia, politically,
economically and culturally,'' Matsunaga said.
   Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi said Hirohito ``will long be remembered
as the god who became a man, and through his personal humility
brought respect and dignity out of the tragedy of war.''
   In Seattle, plans to mark Hirohito's passing would be formalized
next week, said Christine Rose, assistant director of the Japan
America Society of the State of Washington. Seattle's Japanese
consulate also would have a book of condolences for signing, she
said.
   In California, Japanese-Americans voiced restrained sympathy over
the monarch's passing.
   ``I suspect that in a way the Japanese-Americans who are living
in the U.S. may take the death a little more seriously, or hard,''
said Peter Duus, professor of modern Japanese history at Stanford
University.
   ``When the older generation left Japan the emperor was almost
like a Russian Czar, surrounded by religious awe. And the younger
generation here, as a result, have a wonderful time-capsule picture
of the Japan their parents knew,'' Duus added.
   Leon Kimura, president of the Japanese-American Citizens League's
San Jose chapter, said, ``This is a shock even though we knew he was
sick.''
   ``Even though we are Japanese-Americans there is still some
strong feelings for our homeland,'' Kimura said.
   In Colorado, Japanese residents planned a ceremony Monday to
memorialize the emperor, but the state's Buddhist community planned
no commemoration to avoid misunderstanding over Hirohito's wartime
role.
   Joe Ozaki, vice president of the Japanese Association of
Colorado, said the organization made arrangements for a ``kicho,''
or memorial ceremony for the state's 7,000 Japanese to bow before a
portrait of the emperor and sign a condolence book on Monday at
Sakura Square, a Japanese commercial area in downtown Denver.

<HEAD>Fingerprint On Salad Dressing Jar Convicts 320-Pound Burglar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 320-pound man whose appetite got the
best of him while he was burglarizing a home fixed himself a meal _
and one to go _ but was caught when authorities found his
fingerprint on a salad-dressing jar.
   ``This man is no overweight Goldilocks sampling their porridge
... He's a brazen thief,'' Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Stephen
Givando-Cline said Friday at the trial of Darryl J. White.
   ``We have a man apparently overcome by the vigor of his own
appetite who stops during the course of his own burglary and
prepares himself a feast,'' Givando-Cline said.
   White, 24, of Chesapeake, was convicted of burglary, fined $1,000
and sentenced to 5{ years in prison.
   Givando-Cline said White, who is 6-foot-2, entered a townhouse
through an unlocked door on the night of June 4, 1986, while the
family of four slept upstairs. The prosecutor said White took a
videocassette recorder, tapes and $69.
   But White didn't leave after getting the loot, opting instead to
plunder the pantry, Givando-Cline said. Littering the counters were
a plate that previously held four salmon cutlets, an open loaf of
bread, orange peels and pitchers of milk, water and Kool-Aid.
   The burglar also packed a snack to go of luncheon meats, cheese,
oranges, ice cream and Kool-Aid, the prosecutor said.
   Givando-Cline said White's fingerprint was found on a jar of
Miracle Whip Light salad dressing in the kitchen.
   Randall D. Smith, White's court-appointed attorney, argued that
fingerprint evidence is not steadfast.
   ``For 20 years fingerprints can stay there,'' Smith said. ``Think
about that the next time you're in a grocery store and touch a jar
of mayonnaise there.''

<TEXT>
   A pre-dawn earthquake jolted the Swiss
Alps today, but no major damage was reported, authorities said.
   Switzerland's strongest tremor in five years, which measured 3.8
on the Richter scale, was felt mainly in the region around the
Valais Alps ski resort of Crans-Montana, the Swiss Federal
Polytechnical Institute in Zurich reported.
   Tremors were felt up to 30 miles from the quake's epicenter, said
the institute's chief earthquake specialist Dieter-Mayer Rosa.
   He said one resident called authorities to report a crack in a
house wall.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by
humans, while a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in
populated areas.
   A tremor of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable
of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi made a surprise
appearance today at a hotel filled with foreign journalists and
vowed that Libya would not yield to U.S. pressure for a million
years.
   Gadhafi's unannounced arrival at Tripoli's top hotel was his
first public appearance since U.S. jetfighters on Wednesday shot
down two Libyan Soviet-built MiGs over the Mediterranean.
   According to sources in the capital, Gadhafi had not been seen in
public for several weeks, a period of sharply increased tensions
between the United States and Libya over U.S. allegations the
Libyans had constructed a chemical weapons factory in the desert 60
miles southwest of Tripoli.
   Gadhafi has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine. U.S.
President Reagan has said he could not rule out a military strike
against the site, at Rabta.
   His recent disappearance from view had prompted speculation that,
fearing a U.S. attack, he had fled the capital, possibly going to a
refuge in the desert.
   Gadhafi's fortified headquarters in Tripoli, which include a
residence of the leader, was bombed by the United States in April
1986 to retaliate for Libya's alleged support of terrorism.
   About 200 reporters mobbed Gadhafi, who was ringed by bodyguards
when he appeared in one of the hotel's lobby lounges. Speaking
softly for about five minutes, he gave a statement in Arabic, whose
translation was not immediately available.
   Then he answered some of the journalists' shouted questions. A
man from Libya's official news agency JANA translated some of his
replies, in Arabic, into English.
   ``Libya is opposing the use of chemical weapons,'' Gadhafi said
in his only comment on issue in the question-and-answer period.
   Asked how he felt, he said only, ``I'm fine.''
   His curly hair was topped by a black, wool pillbox hat. He wore a
maroon-and-blue sweater, covered by a brown wool cape, to protect
him against Tripoli's rainy weather.
   Asked about the U.S. pressures on his country, he vowed never to
bow to the Americans, ``even if this confrontation lasts 1 million
years.''
   The unexpected sight of a smiling Gadhafi in the hotel set off
chaos. Journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants,
scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a two-story-high ornamental
fountain inside the lobby.
   The Libyan government, challenging U.S. justifications for the
downing of two Libyan jets, has claimed its planes were overwhelmed
by 14 ``hostile American aircraft.''
   A government spokesman said the U.S. assertion that two American
jets had acted in self-defense after being dogged in the air by the
Libyan MiG-23s was ``a fabrication.''
   Washington has provided television stations with videotape said
to be from Wednesday's attack, as taken by one of U.S. aircraft, and
has shown blurred photographs to the U.N. Security Council of what
it said was a Libyan plane carrying four bombs that was downed in
the encounter.
   The council met in emergency session Thursday and Friday to
consider Libya's request for a condemnation of the U.S. act. The
council is to resume its session Monday morning.
   Libyan U.N. envoys have contended the planes were unarmed and on
a simple reconnaissance mission.
   In other developments:
   _At least two MiG-23 jet fighters sat at Tripoli's airport
Friday, poised to enter the takeoff runway. A day earlier, no
military planes were seen on any runway. Increased security was
noted at the headquarters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   _A Western diplomat in Tripoli said he believed the United States
and Libya had had ``contacts'' through a third country to defuse the
tension.
   _Reports circulated that Gadhafi had ousted his military chief,
but the reports could not be confirmed.
   Rajab Abou Dabbous, secretary of the information ministry, told a
news conference Friday that the U.S. Navy jets launched a
premeditated attack.
   He disputed Washington's account that the two planes, which were
attached to the U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet, were threatened by the Libyan
MiGs.
   ``The truth is that 14 _ count them _ attacked two Libyan planes
on a normal reconnaissance flight,'' said Dabbous.
   ``The (U.S.) statements of the last couple of weeks show a
pattern of premeditation,'' he added. ``It is not by chance the
(U.S.) fleet was off our coast.''
   Tensions between the United States and Libya have been high over
Washington's charges that Gadhafi is on the verge of full chemical
weapons production. The United States has threatened to bomb the
plant it says is involved.
   In a special program Friday night, official Libyan television
said: ``While (the Libyan jets were) carrying out their duties,
seven groups of hostile American aircraft suddenly appeared at 1100
hours.''
   It said the U.S. planes flew away, but one pair ``suddenly
reappeared and fired at our aircraft while they were in their
regular flight.''
   The television program and JANA said the issue was not whether
the Libyan planes were carrying missiles, but one of U.S.
``premeditated aggression.''

   Troops backed by helicopter
gunships today stormed a military garrison held by Moslem gunmen and
ended a three-day standoff in which at least 17 people were reported
killed.
   Gen. Renato de Villa, military chief of staff, said the camp _
captured Thursday by eight Moslem policemen and seven supporters who
took two high-ranking officers hostage _ was secured late this
afternoon.
   De Villa said eight soldiers and two civilians were wounded.
   He said 16 bodies, many burned beyond recognition, were found in
the headquarters building and the camp mosque. One of the rebel
supporters was killed and his wife was wounded in Thursday's
takeover.
   The military attacked the Moslems on Friday after the captives _
Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and Col. Romeo Abendan _ were reported
killed. After that attack was repulsed, the military tried again
today.
   The military confirmed that Batalla was killed during the
standoff and said one of the 16 bodies recovered was tentatively
identified as Abendan.
   The policemen had been ordered to surrender to Batalla, the
regional Philippine Constabulary commander, to face murder charges
in a 1984 incident.
   The military said up to 60 other Moslems, including many
soldiers, had joined the rebel group after ransacking the garrison
armory.
   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino said she was ``grieved'' by
the loss of lives but added: ``Let there be no doubt about our
equally strong resolve to protect our people from such brutal and
senseless acts of violence.''
   At midmorning, two military UH-1 helicopters strafed the main
stronghold with machine gun fire and a Sikorsky helicopter fired
four rockets, setting the building on fire.
   Government troops surrounding the compound cheered as the
helicopters opened fire. The compound is in Zamboanga, 560 miles
south of Manila.
   The leader of the gunmen, patrolman Rizah Alih, was charged but
acquitted in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor Cesar Climaco. Three
weeks after Climaco's death, seven people were killed in a marine
raid on Alih's home.
   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batalla
received permission to arrest Alih. Batalla ordered Alih and eight
others detained. All of them could be charged with murder or
conspiracy to commit murder.
   In an apparently unrelated incident, military sources said seven
marines were killed and two wounded today during an attack by Moslem
rebels on Basilan island, about 10 miles to the south.
   A military report said two rebels were also slain.
   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which has
population of 59 million.

   Attorneys representing the estate of Rock
Hudson portrayed a companion of the actor who died of AIDS as an
opportunist who threatened to go public with the love letters Hudson
had written him.
   But a lawyer for Marc Christian said his client was victimized by
the actor who died in October 1985 because Hudson concealed
knowledge of his incurable and contagious disease.
   Hudson's secretary, Mark Miller, hid Hudson's disease from
Christian until the whole world heard about it, attorney Harold
Rhoden told jurors Friday in Christian's $11 million lawsuit.
   ``Marc Christian got a call from Mark Miller in France,'' said
Rhoden. ``He said, `I'm sorry. The movie star told me not to tell
you, I know it's not fair. But I was only following orders.'''
   Rhoden said the trial would focus on whether Hudson had a duty to
warn his sexual partner that he had AIDS and whether Christian
should be compensated for emotional distress and the ``enhanced
fear'' that he, too, had been infected.
   The estate's attorney, Robert Mills, said Christian has not
developed AIDS, which supports his theory that the affair ended
shortly after it began.
   ``If he doesn't have AIDS what motivation is there for suing?''
he asked. ``And if it wasn't a movie star of Rock Hudson's stature
would he be suing?''
   Miller's lawyer, Andrew Banks, said Miller had vowed to keep
Hudson's illness secret from everyone, including Christian.
   ``This was a man Rock Hudson trusted closer than he would trust a
brother,'' he said. ``When Rock Hudson learned he had AIDS, he
turned to this friend he trusted with this terrible secret because
it would be safe.''
   But he said Miller did not believe that Hudson was continuing to
have sex with Christian.
   ``Rock Hudson told Mark Miller they were not having sex, that
they hadn't had sex since February 1984,'' Banks said.
   He also quoted Hudson as telling Miller: ``Give the kid what he
wants. He has letters.''
   Banks said Christian lived off Hudson as he lived off a woman 33
years his senior with whom he had an affair.
   ``What the evidence is going to show,'' said Banks, ``is he
(Christian) is interested in the will, money and publicity.
   ``When the Rock Hudson gravy train ended and Mr. Hudson died,
Marc Christian filed this suit because the will had been probated
and he wasn't in it,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Miller and the Hudson estate contend the love
affair between Hudson and Christian soured in early 1984 because
Christian told Hudson he had sold sex for money. They said Hudson
stopped having sex with Christian and allowed him to stay in his
home for the next 18 months only because Christian threatened to
expose the star's homosexuality.
   Rhoden said Hudson deluded his lover by hiding his disease and
was protected by Miller, who told Christian that Hudson had
anorexia, not AIDS.
   Rhoden described a tender 2{-year love affair that began when
Hudson and Christian met at a political fund-raiser in October 1982.
Christian was 28, and Hudson, 56.
   In early 1983, ``Hudson said he was falling in love with
Christian and that he hadn't felt this way since he was in high
school,'' Rhoden said.
   The men engaged in sex three to five times a week with neither
man using a condom, Rhoden said. Hudson developed symptoms of AIDS a
year later, including rashes and sores, profuse sweating and rapid
weight loss.
   Hudson was diagnosed with AIDS in June 1984, but decided not to
tell Christian, Rhoden said.

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Refugee Count Reaches 160,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   The number of Azerbaijanis who fled neighboring
Armenia to their homeland in the face of ethnic unrest and a
devastating earthquake has swelled to 160,000, an Azerbaijani
official said today.
   Thousands of the refugees are camping in schools, clubs and other
public buildings as they await resettlement, said Azerbaijan Foreign
Ministry spokesman Bagirov, who did not give his first name.
   Others have been placed in new jobs and housing all over the
Azerbaijan, he said, although officials are still trying to persuade
both Azerbaijani and Armenian refugees to return home.
   The refugee situation in neighboring Armenia is much worse, since
the 90,000 Armenians who fled Azerbaijan have been joined by half a
million left homeless by the devastating Dec. 7 earthquake.
   Previous figures refugees, issued in November, said about 75,000
Armenians and 75,000 Azerbaijanis had fled to their homelands.
   Ethnic violence between the Moslem Azerbaijanis and the Christian
Armenians has torn the two southern Soviet republics for the past
year, and the latest outbreak starting in November killed 43 people,
according to today's Pravda.
   Bagirov said Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, was calm. The
atmosphere in the city was described as ``explosive'' during ethnic
unrest just before the quake.
   However, chief investigator Gen. Lt. V.K. Pankin of the national
Ministry of Interior told Pravda today, ``The situation is still
complicated.''
   His department has sent staffers from Moscow and elsewhere in the
Soviet Union to assist Azerbaijani law enforcement personnel to
ensure correct investigation of crimes, he told Pravda.
   Several Armenian prosecutors were fired this week for failing to
fulfill their duties.
   Authorities have begun filing criminal charges against those who
committed acts of violence during the riots, including murder and
arson, Pankin said. For example, one teahouse manager has been
arrested for inciting teen-agers to riot and carry an Islamic flag
in demonstrations, he said.
   In Baku, authorities continue to detain 100 to 200 people a night
for curfew violations, Bagirov said. On Friday, for example, 104
people were held for violating the curfew and four were detained for
inciting ethnic dissension where a curfew has been imposed.
   About 15,000 Armenians have returned to Baku after fleeing at the
height of the violence and daily demostrations by Azerbaijani
nationalists, Bagirov said.

   Emperor Hirohito, once venerated as a living god and
made into the guiding spirit of a world war, today died of
intestinal cancer, ending a 62-year reign that saw his nation
recover from ruin to riches. He was 87.
   Crown Prince Akihito, oldest of the emperor's two sons, became
the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn,
wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperial
seals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed.
   Hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his World
War II role.
   Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required
to approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the
Japanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing and
invasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945.
   His death followed a 3{-month illness during which reports on his
blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routine
and many festivities were postponed or canceled.
   The government proclaimed a six-day formal mourning period and
named the new emperor's reign Heisei, or Achieving Peace. Hirohito's
reign, which began on Dec. 25, 1926, was called Showa, or
Enlightened Peace.
   Thousands of people signed condolence registers at the palace.
Japan's stock markets closed, but banks and many shops remained open.
   Some clerks wore black ribbons to signify mourning but, prepared
by the monarch's long illness, people generally reacted calmly.
   In western Japan, however, an 87-year-old man hanged himself
today, leaving a note that said in part, ``I want to follow the
emperor in death,'' police said.
   Kyodo News Service said Umanosuke Ue, a former Imperial Army
soldier, had been particularly proud of having been born in the same
year as the emperor.
   In western Tokyo, police arrested 10 members of the radical
leftist Chukakuha (Middle Core Faction) on charges of assembling
weapons for a demonstration against the nation's monarchy.
   About 100 faction members tried to demonstrate, and ``some of
those arrested tried to push through with bamboo rods against riot
police,'' said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said 15,000 riot police were being mobilized around Tokyo
against possible sabotage.
   About 90 people peacefully marched in another Tokyo district with
banners bearing such slogans as ``No more emperor'' and suggesting
Hirohito bore responsibility for the war.
   ``I could not stand the thought that people outside Japan are
going to think ... everyone is crying over his death,'' said
organizer Ryuichi Harada. ``It is about time we should learn that
the image of him being a pacifist and warm and kind old man was
forced on us.''
   The formal state funeral is planned for Feb. 24, Kyodo news
service reported, quoting government sources. There was no immediate
government announcement.
   Until Hirohito's death, palace officials refused to acknowledge
that the emperor was suffering from cancer. Japanese rarely inform
cancer patients of their disease.
   After fell seriously ill on Sept. 19, 67.8 pints of blood
transfusions helped keep Hirohito alive.
   In September 1987, Hirohito had undergone intestinal bypass
surgery, but doctors had said that a growth found there was not
cancerous.
   ``With heartfelt sorrow, I, together with our people, wish to
express my deep sense of loss on the passing,'' Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita said in a television address.
   Takeshita recounted Hirohito's ``eventful and turbulent'' reign,
through the Depression and ``the calamities of that deplorable war''
to unprecedented postwar economic growth.
   ``He resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in
spite of his wishes, out of a determination to prevent further
suffering of the people,'' said Takeshita.
   In Washington, President Reagan joined leaders worldwide in
offering condolences. Reagan lauded Hirohito for playing ``a truly
heroic role'' in urging his country to surrender.
   Reaction to his death, however, was muted in South Korea, ruled
harshly as a colony during 20 years of Hirohito's rule, and by some
Chinese who held Hirohito accountable for the Japanese invasion of
China in World War II.
   Hirohito died in the moat-ringed palace where he had stayed most
of the time, a remote figure who was known, however, as an eminent
marine biologist and avid fan of sumo, a traditional Japanese form
of wrestling.
   Hirohito wrote 12 books on hydrozoans, small sea animals.
   The world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. _ passed
automatically to Akihito.
   If tradition is followed, there will be more than 60 different
ceremonies over the next two years until Akihito is formally
enthroned.
   Akihito, 55, was schooled among commoners and, in an upset to
precedent, married a commoner.
   With Princess Michiko becoming the new empress, Hirohito's wife,
Nagako, 85, becomes empress dowager.
   The new crown prince, Akihito's eldest son Naruhito, 28, formerly
known as Prince Hiro, also is a tennis player, and studied at Oxford
University in England.
   Akihito has indicated he would lower some of the walls around the
monarchy, and he once reportedly told a friend, ``I want to shake up
the imperial protocol system.''

   Stores covered display windows with white cloth,
Tokyo's Disneyland turned its music down and the stock market closed
today in a show of commercial restraint as Japan mourned the death
of Emperor Hirohito.
   And in western Japan, an 87-year-old man hanged himself today,
leaving a note that said in part, ``I want to follow the emperor in
death.''
   But while shock and a flurry of cancellations followed the sudden
worsening of Hirohito's health in September, his long illness had
given Japanese time to prepare for the end of his 62-year era.
   The government declared an official six-day mourning period, and
the Ministry of Education called on schools and athletic
organizations ``to unite together to suitably mourn the emperor.''
   Thousands of people lined up at the Imperial Palace to pray and
sign their names on registries to express condolences for Hirohito,
87, who died today of intestinal cancer.
   ``Of course it's a shock. I had hoped that the emperor would live
as long as possible,'' said Masakichi Koizumi, 69, one of those in
line. ``But it was inevitable.''
   In downtown Tokyo, a group of about 90 people marched for about
an hour protesting the imperial system of rule.
   Television newscasters changed into dark clothing to express
mourning.
   Although stock exchanges canceled their regular half-day
sessions, banks, department stores and chain stores remained open.
   Tokyo Disneyland was open, but played its music at half the
normal volume.
   Most stores in Tokyo's normally garish Ginza shopping district
turned off their electric signs and erected Japanese rising-sun
flags topped with black streamers. At a McDonald's restaurant,
clerks with black ribbons pinned to their lapels scurried to serve
customers.
   Department stores covered their elaborate show windows with white
sheets.
   ``We thought it would be better, given the circumstances, to
cover up the decorative displays,'' said Haruhisa Hattori, director
of advertising at Wako department store.
   But not everyone supported the expressions of ``jishuku,'' or
self-restraint.
   ``I think it's crazy to do things like that for someone who
shared responsibility for World War II,'' said a 33-year-old office
worker, pointing to the covered Wako window. ``I had hoped the
emperor would apologize (for the war) before he died.''
   Questions over Hirohito's wartime role _ whether he was an active
participant in planning the hostilities, or merely used by
militarists _ remain controversial in Japan, although most people
express affection for the dead monarch and say they favor the
emperor system.
   The anti-imperial protest went on for about an hour in downtown
Tokyo.
   ``I could not stand the thought that people outside Japan are
going to think all Japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is
crying over his death,'' said organizer Ryuichi Harada.
   Passers-by looked uncomfortably at the marchers. ``I don't
believe it,'' one said. ``Are they really Japanese?''
   All major political parties expressed sorrow over the emperor's
death, with the exception of the Japan Communist Party, which
officially opposes the imperial system.
   Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest
opposition group, said the emperor's reign ``was full of bitter
experiences and shocks,'' and pledged her party would work to use
the lessons of history to achieve a permanent peace.
   ``The sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has
left me grief-stricken,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said.
``Our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain, and I am at a
loss for words.''
   Hirohito's fifth daughter, Takako Shimazu, said her father had
``battled gallantly'' against his cancer. ``I hope he now will be
able to rest peacefully,'' she said.
   ``He wasn't a god, but he was somehow different from ordinary
people,'' said Hiroko Gotoh, 22. ``I don't think I've changed inside
because of his death, but I have a feeling an era has changed in
Japan.''

   A jail guard passed out while 48 inmates
were in a common dayroom, and the inmates, after calling for help,
locked themselves in their cells, authorities said.
   The inmates were given ice cream at their next meal for following
the correct emergency procedure, which was shown during a jail
orientation film, said Jail Commander Bob Conroy.
   Conroy said Santa Clara County's newest jail was designed to
foster better conditions by having officers mingle with inmates.
   The incident occurred Tuesday morning when the lone correctional
officer on duty, Veronica Foley, passed out because of a suspected
virus.
   One inmate picked up a red emergency phone and explained the
situation to officers in the building's central control room. Then
the prisoners, all male, went back to their cells and closed the
doors, Conroy said.

   Sikh militants shot and killed 10 Hindus
and set fire to a railway station to avenge the hanging of two Sikhs
for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,
officials said today.
   Three or four Sikhs carrying AK-47 rifles raided four homes of
Hindu workers in Badowal village in Punjab on Friday, police chief
Govind Ram said.
   ``They separated the male members from others and shot them from
point-blank range,'' Ram said in a telephone interview. One woman
was injured in the firing when she tried to save her husband, he
said.
   The area is 20 miles south of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
   A note left by the killers said this was the first revenge
killing for the deaths of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were
hanged Friday in a New Delhi prison after their conviction for
assassinating Mrs. Gandhi.
   The note threatened more massacres in the state, Ram said.
   Also in apparent revenge for the hangings, a group of radicals
set fire to the Alab railway station in Punjab's Sangrur district on
Friday night, said officials in Chandigarh, the state capital. After
also damaging furniture at the station, the attackers fled, said the
officials, who demanded anonymity.
   Sikh militants had threatened widespread massacres of Hindus in
retaliation for the executions.
   Tens of thousands of police and paramilitary troops were deployed
across northern India to check outbreaks of secterian violence,
authorities said.
   The latest killings brought this week's death toll blamed on the
militants in the northern state of Punjab to at least 40. Last year,
2,400 people were killed in Sikh violence in the state.
   Mrs. Gandhi was slain in apparent revenge for the Indian army's
June 1984 raid on Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in
Amritsar. The raid was to clear the temple of Sikh militants who
were entrenched there.
   About 1,200 people, mainly Sikhs, died in the operation.
   Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in
India's north. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more
than 80 percent of India's 880 million people.

   Jordan, China and Qatar announced today they
will upgrade Palestine Liberation Organization missions in their
capitals to embassies, bolstering PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's peace
initiative.
   Eight countries now have given embassy status to the PLO. The
others are Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq and the United Arab
Emirates.
   They are among about 70 countries that have recognized the
independent Palestinian state proclaimed in November by the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   Boundaries of the still-symbolic Palestinian state have not been
defined. Official Radio Jordan said that at King Hussein's
direction, ``Jordan has decided to consider the PLO office in Jordan
the embassy of the state of Palestine.'' PLO sources said Arafat
would lay the embassy's cornerstone in Amman today.
   China's Xinhua News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying Beijing's move will strengthen friendly relations between the
Chinese and Palestinian people.
   China long has been a supporter of the PLO and other Arab causes.
It says it will not normalize relations with Israel until Tel Aviv
returns land seized in the 1967 Israel-Arab war.
   Qatar's Foreign Ministry said the PLO office in Doha was upgraded
because of the Persian Gulf state's desire to ``bolster the national
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right
to self-determination and establishing their independent state on
their national soil.''
   Leaders of the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza today called on European
countries to upgrade PLO offices there to embassy status.
   France on Thursday elevated the PLO's representation in Paris to
``General Delegation of Palestine.'' That fell short of diplomatic
recognition but still was considered a significant political
response to Arafat's moderate policies.
   Earlier today, Hussein met Arafat at the government guest house
in Amman to review ``the challenges facing the Arab community in
addition to bilateral relations,'' Jordan's official Petra news
agency reported. Jordan's prime minister, Zaid Rifai, was present
with several PLO executive committee members.

   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Vorontsov said today Moscow would ``find a way'' to support Kabul's
communist government after the withdrawal of the Red Army from
Afghanistan.
   Vorontsov told reporters a broad-based government ``representing
all the political forces of Afghanistan'' is the only way to
guarantee peace after the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops depart. The
Soviets are to withdraw by Feb. 15.
   The Soviet envoy dismissed claims by Moslem insurgents, as well
as Pakistani and Western analysts, that the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan will be toppled once Soviet troops
leave.
   ``It will survive in its own right and you will know it after the
withdrawal of the Soviet forces,'' said Vorontsov. ``We will be
supporting them (Kabul communists) if there is no broad-based
government. We will support the regime in Kabul as the legal
government of the Republic of Afghanistan.
   ``We will find the way,'' said Vorontsov. ``We will tell you
later.'' He refused to elaborate further.
   Afghan guerrillas, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
government for 10 years, have promised to establish a council to
choose a transitional government.
   ``If that's going to be only a one-sided council there is no
value in it,'' said Vorontsov.
   The alliance of seven Afghan guerrilla groups headquartered in
Pakistan has said no Afghan communists will be allowed to
participate in their council.
   Pakistan, which is giving refuge to more than 3 million Afghans,
also dismissed the participation of the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan in a postwar government.
   However, Vorontsov said the People's Democratic Party ``has all
the right to participate as a political force in that broad-based
government.
   ``They must be realistic,'' he said of the guerrillas. ``By
puffing and huffing they will not be able to destroy the house of
the present regime, if we take the words of the famous fairy tale
about the three little pigs.''
   Vorontsov said the February withdrawal deadline would be met
unless the guerrillas attack departing Soviet soldiers.
   ``It could be delayed if there were all out fighting on Soviet
forces, if there were attacks on Soviet forces withdrawing,'' said
Vorontsov. ``They will fight back to defend and will not withdraw.
   ``The Soviet soldiers are not running for their lives,'' he said.
   The Kremlin sent more than 100,000 Soviet soldiers into
Afghanistan in December 1979. Last April, Moscow agreed to withdraw
them by Feb. 15. Half had left by August.
   Vorontsov suggested the warring factions should look to the
United Nations to resolve the deadlock over Afghan's future
government.
   ``They have an important role to play, even more important than
ours,'' he said of the United Nations.
   Vorontsov's diplomatic mission began in early December when he
met Pakistan-based guerrillas in Saudi Arabia. The only significant
agreement to come out of that meeting was a decision to hold the
Islamabad talks. The only agreement this time was to hold more talks.

   Market-style economic reforms have brought new
prosperity to China but have cost some women their jobs, others
their education and have revived traditional views that women should
stay at home.
   In the new atmosphere of competition and making money, the
40-year-old official line that women should share equally in
building socialism has been muted.
   Instead, employers, some local officials and even the influential
People's Daily have said openly over the past year what many Chinese
believe privately: women are more suited for housework and should be
``liberated'' from outside jobs.
   Among related developments:
   _Many companies forced for the first time to make a profit are
refusing to hire women _ both uneducated and college graduates _
saying they can't afford maternity benefits. Now that factories can
fire workers, they are cutting nearly two women for every man,
officials say.
   _Single teen-age girls in rural areas can still find jobs,
however, and many peasant families are pulling them from school to
go to work, believing that only sons should be educated. More than
four-fifths of children not in school are girls, officials say.
   These trends, which have emerged mainly over the past year, are a
startling about-face in a society where nearly 70 percent of women
work outside the home. They have generated heated debate in Chinese
newspapers and protests from women's groups.
   ``We advocate that women hold outside jobs,'' said Cai Sheng, a
spokeswoman for the All-China Woman's Federation, an official
organization concerned with women's issues. ``This is the first step
in liberation. Only then can women achieve political status and
economic independence.''
   For thousands of years, Chinese women's roles were strictly
defined by a Confucian code that required obedience first to one's
father, then to one's husband. Rural women often worked in the
fields alongside men, but few were taught to read and write or
played any role in the larger society.
   Many young urban women joined the political ferment that
culminated in the Communist victory in 1949. The Communists outlawed
the practice of binding women's feet, mandated education of both
boys and girls and encouraged women to work in ``building the new
China.''
   But Ms. Cai said traditional views of women's roles remained
strong, especially in the countryside. Comments by officials of some
rural areas appear to buttress that contention.
   ``If women don't stay home, we men can't go to work ... with a
light heart,'' said Li Fengzhuang, a spokesman for the government of
Daqiuzhuang Village.
   Daqiuzhuang, a community of 3,550 people in the Tianjin Municipal
Region in east China, has received favorable publicity from the
People's Daily because nearly half the working-age women have become
full-time housewives in the decade since China began its newest
economic reforms.
   Li said those reforms have increased prosperity in the village
and made two incomes unnecessary.
   ``By staying home, women can liberate Daqiuzhuang's
productivity,'' he said. ``What's wrong with people doing what they
do best? It's appropriate for women to do (housework). They're more
thorough, it's their specialty. Men have strong bodies and can do
hard labor.''
   Li said most of the housewives were illiterate and therefore made
poor outside workers. Daqiuzhuang does offer education programs on
closed-circuit television. The subjects are cooking and cleaning.
   Wu Yurong, 35, one of Daqiuzhuang's housewives, said she once
worked in a factory cafeteria and enjoyed it. But she said she was
underpaid, and she now concentrates on caring for her two children,
10 and 14, and for her husband.
   ``Me go to work?'' she asked. ``A woman can't earn enough.'' At
the cafeteria she made $324 a year. Her husband now earns more than
$1,620 as a workshop foreman _ more than twice the average worker's
salary.
   Although the People's Daily said approvingly that Daqiuzhuang may
``set the trend for Chinese women in the future,'' Ms. Cai said it
remains an exception.
   More widespread, she said, is the problem of employers refusing
to hire women or laying off those who are pregnant or have small
children. The employers argue they can't afford maternity benefits,
usually about 70 percent of wages, and that women with children tend
to miss work more often and are more tired.
   The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently cited a survey
showing only about 5 percent of company heads favored hiring women.
A recent official report said 13,000 women in the northeastern
province of Liaoning lost their jobs in 1987 because they were
pregnant or had just given birth.
   ``Having children is necessary for society, and we think society
should be responsible,'' Ms. Cai said.
   She supports experiments in several cities that seek to ease the
burden on individual enterprises by having government and companies
set up a collective fund to pay maternity benefits.
   Most women would need maternity leave only once because China,
trying to control its population, attempts to limit each couple to
one child.
   Resistance to the traditionalist revival is strongest among
young, educated women.
   ``After I marry, I will still struggle to achieve my goals,''
said Liu Guanghong, 23, one of Daqiuzhuang's working women. She is
in charge of the administrative office of one of Daqiuzhuang's
corporations and said her goal is to become company head.
   ``I am a woman of the '80s,'' said Ms. Liu. ``My mother ... is
satisfied being a good wife and mother. But I want to pursue a
career and improve myself.''
   However, even expressing ambitions is difficult for many Chinese
women.
   ``Apart from the sex discrimination by society, sex
discrimination also exists in the thinking of women, in their sense
of inferiority,'' Ms. Cai said.
   The key to change, she said, is education, ``but it will take a
long time, maybe decades.''

<HEAD>Clamor Rising for Overhaul of Campaign Finance System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From lawmakers on Capitol Hill to their
reform-minded critics and even well heeled lobbyists, a growing
chorus of influential voices is calling for an overhaul of the
nation's campaign finance system.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has campaign finance reform
near the top of his agenda for the new Congress as does Rep. Bob
Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader.
   And change is being urged by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., whose GOP forces used a stubborn filibuster to kill a
Democratic election-money package in the last Congress.
   Senate Democrats have no formal agenda yet, but their new
majority leader, George Mitchell, D-Maine, favors change, and the
leader of the reform forces, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., is ready to
renew his fight in 1989.
   There is optimism at Common Cause, the self-described citizens'
lobby, which wants to substitute public financing for individual and
special interest money in the quarter-billion-dollar plus business
of winning seats in Congress.
   ``It's going all the way to the top,'' says Fred Wertheimer,
Common Cause president. ``There's a different dynamic now. An awful
lot of Republicans are upset with the present system and talking
about need for change. There's an unusual opportunity for 1989.''
   Joining in the push are some people Common Cause wants to send to
the election sidelines, for example Bill Baer, a senior
partner-lobbyist in Arnold &amp; Porter, one of Washington's big league
law firms.
   ``Things have gotten out of hand,'' says Baer, who heads the
150-member Lobbyists and Lawyers for Campaign Finance Reform.
   Baer says there is deep and growing dissatisfaction over the
seemingly endless congressional fundraising events _ sometimes as
many as 10 in one night _ at which lobbyists fete candidates with
$2,000 contributions from political action committees operated by
industry, labor and ideological groups.
   The final tabulations for the 1987-8 election cycle haven't been
made by the Federal Election Commission. But the FEC says that
through last Sept. 30, PAC money continued to grow both in total
dollars and in comparison to campaign contributions from individuals.
   For the period, PACs pumped $35.7 million into all Senate
campaigns, up 1.7 percent over the corresponding 21 months of the
1985-6 cycle. They provided more than one-fifth of the $159.8
million given to Senate candidates.
   PACs provided one of every three dollars given to House
candidates, or about $73.7 million of the $214.4 million
contributed. The PAC money was nearly 24 percent higher than in the
first 21 months of the 1985-6 cycle.
   As in past years, incumbents fared better than their challengers
in the scramble for PAC dollars. Senators got $5.17 for every $1
contributed to challengers. In the House it was 10 to one in favor
of incumbents.
   When the votes were counted, all but six of the 411 House members
seeking reelection received another term.
   Under consideration are spending limits that would slow or halt
the rapidly rising cost of campaigns. Provisions could be included
involving phone-bank support that labor gives far more readily to
Democrats. And lawmakers are puzzling over what to do about huge
sums in little-controlled and unreported collected by the national
parties.
   Republicans have opposed altering the system for more than a
decade, thinking that they benefit more from the status quo. But
Democrats are getting more PAC money. Their fund-raising among
individuals is catching up with that of the the GOP.
   The Democratic Party already has pulled even in the so-called
``soft money'' race to put the bite on corporations and people who
can afford a $100,000 contribution not covered by FEC limits. And
labor continues to favor Democrats.
   Although Wertheimer is optimistic about action in the 101st
Congress, he sees ``a tough battle because individuals who benefit
from the current system, incumbents, will be writing the new rules.''
   Aides say House leaders want to negotiate a bipartisan bill. But
House Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., is warning that if necessary
Democrats will use their majority to pass their own package.
   The Senate is a different matter. If they keep their ranks
together as they did in the last Congress, the 45 Republicans can
again prevent a vote on campaign legislation they think favors
Democrats.
   ``We can have a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill or we'll
have no bill,'' says Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate GOP
spokesman on the issue. ``We can stop it in the Senate or we can
stop it in the White House.''
   McConnell says that ``there's no middle ground on spending
limits.'' This puts him in direct conflict with Democrat Boren, who
last year cosponsored a package calling for voluntary spending
limits for Senate races.
   Even with this apparent basic difference, Boren says he sees some
unspecified ``bargaining room'' with McConnell and the Republicans.

<TEXT>
   The ambiguity of Emperor Hirohito's place in history
rests with a key decision made in 1945 by Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
who told Washington he would need a million reinforcements to occupy
Japan if Hirohito were prosecuted for war crimes.
   MacArthur also said Hirohito did not deserve to be prosecuted.
But many people then thought the opposite. Even as Hirohito lay on
his deathbed 43 years later, there were some who said he was a war
criminal.
   The debate seems likely to continue as long as the war is
remembered.
   At the end of World War II, the Allies prosecuted Nazi and
Japanese war criminals. Seven Japanese government officials,
including the prime minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, were hanged after
being found guilty in the main Tokyo war crimes trial.
   MacArthur, head of the forces occupying Japan, wrote in his
memoirs, ``Reminiscences,'' that he fended off pressure from Britain
and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito. ``Indeed, the initial list
of those proposed by them was headed by the emperor's name,'' he
wrote.
   But the general had decided the emperor could play a major role
in changing Japan from a militaristic nation to a peaceful member of
the world community.
   Also, MacArthur had told Washington a guerrilla war could break
out if the emperor were indicted.
   ``When Washington seemed to be veering toward the British point
of view I had advised that I would need at least one million
reinforcements should such action be taken,'' MacArthur wrote.
   He hadn't told the nervously waiting Japanese of his decision,
and when the 44-year-old emperor called on MacArthur, the general
believed Hirohito might plead for mercy.
   Instead, MacArthur said Hirohito, his hands trembling, declared:
``I come to you, Gen. MacArthur, to offer myself to the judgment of
the powers you represent as the one to bear sole responsibility for
every political and military decision made and action taken by my
people in the conduct of the war.''
   Hirohito accepted a likely death sentence by assuming ``a
responsibility clearly belied by facts of which I was fully aware,''
MacArthur wrote.
   This provided major evidence of the view held by most historians
today: that Hirohito had been a powerless figurehead but had
approved orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and put most
of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule.
   The main piece of contrary evidence is that Hirohito was the one
who decided to end the war. If he had that power, and if he thought
the war was wrong, why didn't he prevent it?
   Hirohito was asked at news conferences later to explain, but he
gave evasive answers. He said he wouldn't criticize those who had
ruled Japan and felt obliged as a constitutional monarch to approve
all government decisions.
   As to having power to end the war, he said the government had
told him to decide what to do, so again it was the government's
responsibility.
   Analysts of the war crimes trial say a key episode involving Gen.
Tojo threatened to bring Hirohito back into the picture.
   Tojo testified ``there is no Japanese subject who would go
against the will of His Majesty, more particularly, among high
officials of the Japanese government.''
   Since the American prosecutors had decided to keep Hirohito out
of the trial, they were alarmed at the implication the emperor might
bear responsibility.
   So a week later, the ex-prime minister was led again into the
same territory, but this time he had been briefed to give a
different impression, American author Richard H. Minear wrote in his
1971 book ``Victors' Justice.''
   Tojo was asked if it was Hirohito's will to institute war. He
replied, ``It might have been against his will, but it is a fact
that because of my advice and because of advice given by the High
Command the emperor consented, though reluctantly, to the war,''
according to Minear's book.
   Minear comments: ``The decision to exclude the emperor was a
political decision, not a decision based on the facts of the case.
Under the concept of conspiracy invoked by the prosecution, it would
have been easy to assure the conviction of the emperor on all counts
of the indictment.''
   The prosecutors' position was that the militarists had deluded
the Japanese into thinking the emperor was with them in going to war.
   MacArthur summed up his view of the emperor: ``I found he had a
more thorough grasp of the democratic concept than almost any
Japanese with whom I talked. He played a major role in the spiritual
regeneration of Japan, and his loyal cooperation and influence had
much to do with the success of the occupation.''

<HEAD>Three Blacks Killed in Natal Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three black men were killed in
township violence in Natal province, police said today, bringing the
official death toll from fighting among black political factions
this year to 12.
   One of the three men killed Friday died when police shot into a
gang of men who were stoning a township home, police said.
   More than 1,000 people have died over the past 18 months in Natal
township fighting, chiefly between members of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's
Inkatha, a Zulu political organization, and supporters of the banned
United Democratic Front.
   Despite national emergency laws and restrictions enforced since
June 12, 1986, political unrest has continued at a reduced level,
particularly attacks on black policemen and homes of government
employees in black townships.
   But in the first week of 1989, political violence has been
reported every day. The events include stabbings and shootings in
Natal, mine explosions near Cape Town, gasoline bombings of
townships houses throughout the country, stonings of houses and
cars, and ambushes of policemen.
   However, the deaths and injuries and the numbers of incidents are
much lower than during the height of the unrest from 1984-86.
   Currently, most incidents occur in Natal, where Inkatha and the
United Democratic Front are fighting for control of segregated black
townships.
   The front supporters accuse police of siding with Buthelezi, whom
they regard as a collaborator because of his position as head of the
KwaZulu homeland government.
   Buthelezi accuses the front of supporting the bombing and
sabotage campaign of the outlawed African National Congress. He
disagrees with front policies supporting boycotts, sanctions and
strikes to end the apartheid policy of legal race separation.
   During the violence Friday, police said a group of blacks fired
at a another group, killing one man, in Mpumalanga township, where a
house was damaged by a gasoline bomb.
   Police said they killed one black man and arrested four men when
they opened fire with shotguns and pistols at a crowd of blacks who
were stoning a house in Haza township.
   The body of a black man who had been stabbed to death was found
at Taylor's Halt, police said, and another black man was shot and
wounded by an unidentified assailant in Imbali township.

   A 15-second tremor shook the mountainous
southwestern region of France, but no injuries were reported,
officials said Saturday.
   The quake, measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, hit at 8:33 p.m.
on Friday, said the officials.
   Its epicenter was at the ski station in La Mongie, in the
Pyrenees mountains that form the border between France and Spain.
   The tremor reportedly caused some cracks in buildings and rattled
furniture and other objects.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage and one
measuring 4 can cause moderate damage.

   Radical Palestinians in the occupied territories
have formed a coalition of Moslem fundamentalists and pro-Syrian
factions opposed to PLO chief Yasser Arafat's recent peace overtures.
   The radical alliance on Friday issued a leaflet accusing Arafat
of ``selling out'' the cause when he recognized Israel and renounced
terrorism.
   Arab hospital officials said today that a Palestinian village
leader in the occupied lands was stabbed to death Friday by
unidentified assailants.
   Elsewhere, Israeli troops today shot and wounded 10 Palestinians
who attacked them with rocks, an Arab reporter said.
   Hospital officials said one of the wounded was a 16-year-old girl
who was in critical condition after being shot in the head in the
West Bank city of Nablus. Three other West Bank Arabs were shot and
wounded, while six were wounded in the southern Gaza Strip, Arab
reports and hospital officials said on condition of anonymity. The
military said it was checking the reports.
   Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah, the 57-year-old mukhtar or traditional
leader of the West Bank village of Qubeiba, died Friday of multiple
stab wounds, said a Ramallah hospital official.
   Israel Radio said Hamoudah was killed by a Palestinian mob that
attacked him at his home because he was suspected of working for
Israeli security forces.
   His two sons, Nasser Mahmoud ,22, and Walid, 29, were slightly
wounded in the attack, said the hospital official. They were treated
for head wounds and discharged. A military spokesman refused to
comment on the incident.
   Qubeiba is seven miles northwest of Jerusalem.
   Palestinians have killed more than a dozen suspected Palestinian
collaborators since the anti-Israeli revolt started 13 months ago.
They are among at least 347 Arabs and 14 Israelis who have died in
the uprising.
   Last week, death threats against Bethlehem mayor Elias Freij were
scrawled on walls in the town after he proposed a truce in the
Palestinian uprising. Also last week, a 25-year-old suspected
collaborator was killed in Jericho.
   Reports in Palestinian newspapers say pro-Syrian groups want to
install more radical leaders.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, four refugee camps were under curfew
today, said an army spokesman who demanded anonymity.
   The United National Front in Occupied Palestine, as the radical
new coalition calls itself, said in its leaflet, ``We demand the
establishment of a militant leadership to replace the diminishing
leadership of Yasser Arafat.''
   The new faction includes members of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front
For the Liberation Of Palestine-General Command and Abu Moussa's
breakaway faction of Arafat's mainstream Fatah group.
   ``There can be no reconciliation with the Israeli killers and no
negotiations with Zionist criminals,'' the document said. ``We
oppose any kind of political settlement, whatever its source, and
consider negotiation with the enemy to be grave treason and an
unforgivable crime.''
   It called for a new Palestine National Council to be led by
advocates of armed struggle. The Palestine National Council in
November implicitly recognized Israel in a declaration of an
independent Palestinian homeland.
   Israeli officials did not accept the implicit recognition, and
maintain the Palestine Liberation Organization still is dedicated to
destroying Israel.
   Pro-Syrian Palestinians said the new Palestinian alliance
resulted from increased collaboration between extremist factions
over the past few months.
   ``The PLO has been moving from one mistake to another. We totally
reject the PLO's political compromises,'' said Sufian Khatib, a
Jerusalem physician opposed to Arafat.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz today urged the
leaders of more than 140 countries to foreswear using chemical
weapons and to keep them out of the hands of terrorists.
   Addressing the first session of an international conference on
chemical weapons, Shultz proposed the imposition of unspecified
penalties by the United Nations to those violating the 1925 Geneva
Protocol banning the use of ``one of humanity's most dreaded and
dreadful forms of warfare.''
   Shultz warned that the threat of terrorists using chemical
weapons is ``a real one'' and said some governments linked to
terrorism have the ability to produce deadly chemical agents.
   ``There are no insurmountable technical obstacles that would
prevent terrorist groups from using chemical weapons,'' Shultz told
the conference delegates.
   Shultz did not specify any particular country, but it appeared
Libya was at least one of his targets when he said, ``Some
governments which have been known to sponsor terrorism now have
sizable chemical weapons capabilities.''
   Libya is among the countries on the State Department's list of
nations sponsoring terrorism. Syria is also on the list, and some
analysts fear the country also may have embarked on a chemicals
weapon program.
   ``With the inhibitions against employing such weapons now
weakened through recent years _ and with targets for conventional
terrorist attacks becoming better protected _ terrorist groups could
be tempted to shift without warning to use of chemical weapons for
dramatic political and media attention,'' he said.
   Shultz also supported increasing in the U.N. secretary-general's
authority to investigate allegations into the use of chemical arms
in war, and said nations must find ways to block the transfer of
technology.
   He made no direct reference to Libya, nor did he single out any
other nation believed to possess or have the ability to produce
chemical weapons. Only the United States and the Soviet Union
acknowledge having such stockpiles.
   U.S. officials maintain chemical weapons are being developed at a
plant 60 miles from the Libyan capital. Libya denies it.
   However, the U.S. secretary of state said chemical weapons have
proliferated in recent years. He cited reports of the use of
chemical arms in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Afghanistan.
   ``We cannot delay. Time is not on our side,'' he said.
``Technology is not stagnant. Ever more lethal and insidious
chemical weapons are being developed ... the ability to produce such
weapons is rapidly spreading and with it the technology to produce
ballistic missiles as delivery vehicles.''
   Shultz said it was, ``grimly ironic'' that the threat of chemical
weapons has grown just as progress is being made in controlling and
reducing nuclear arms.
   ``A nightmare for all, of course, would be the combination of
ballistic missiles, chemical warheads and biological weapons in the
hands of governments with histories of the conduct of terrorist
violence.''
   In opening the five-day conference today, President Francois
Mitterrand of France told delegates: ``This conference is not going
to be a court of justice. However, you should state unconditionally
and unreservedly your condemnation of chemical arms.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asked for a minute
of silence to honor Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who died today. More
than 140 nations were represented _ including 80 by their foreign
ministers _ at the meeting at the headquarters of the U.N.
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 Geneva Protocol,
banning use of chemical arms, and pressing for a broader agreement
that would prohibit their use, production and stockpiling.
   The emnity between the United States and Libya loomed over the
conference, as the United States pressed its accusations about
Libyan chemical weapons capabilities, trying to persuade
industrialized nations the claims are correct.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Friday that
the U.S. downing of two Libyan jetfighters ``poisoned'' the
atmosphere of the meeting.
   U.S. officials say two U.S. planes shot down two Libyan planes
over the Mediterranean in self-defense Wednesday. The officials also
say the issue of a Libyan chemical plant on the verge of production
had nothing to do with the air incident.
   Libya claims its chemical plant, in Rabta 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli, is for making pharmaceuticals.
   Shultz and Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher of West
Germany agreed today that U.S. and West German experts would meet
next week in Washington to weigh any evidence West German firms are
involved in the factory in Rabta.
   ``We will do everything in our power to prevent German nationals
and German companies from taking part in chemical weapons
production,'' Genscher said.
   Some published reports have linked a West German firm to the
Libyan plant, but the Bonn government has expressed skepticism.
   For nearly two decades, negotiators in Geneva have worked without
success to draft a new, wider convention to give it some power of
enforcement. The meeting in Paris is meant to give a political push
to the negotiations.
   Perez de Cuellar told the delegates, ``The time has come to take
concerted political action at a high level.''
   Mitterrand said the conference should also examine the question
of how to control and verify any future chemical weapons accord.
   The conference was formally proposed by President Reagan.
Mitterrand had said earlier he was looking for such an initiative.
   French officials stress that the final communique, to be issued
Wednesday, is political in nature, and that binding agreements must
come from Geneva, where delegates from 40 nations are at work.
   According to U.S. estimates, about 20 nations have or are capable
of producing chemical arms.

   Three officials of a zoo in central China have
been charged with aiding poachers and buying illegally trapped
monkeys, an official report said Saturday.
   Officials of the zoo in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, were
accused of buying 12 golden-haired monkeys from poachers, the
People's Daily said.
   Zoo director Li Jiawan, deputy director Wang Peilin, and head
manager Yu Hzncheng allegedly provided the poachers with food,
transportation and other help.
   The monkeys, native to China and listed as an endangered species,
are illegal to hunt. Some Chinese believe their bones, blood, meat
and internal organs have medicinal value.
   More than 200 golden-haired monkeys have been killed by poachers
since 1970, Xinhua said.
   The National People's Congress, China's legislature, recently
approved its first wildlife protection law, intended to stem
poaching of rare species of animals.

<TEXT>
   Ante Markovic, a strong supporter of
market- oriented reforms and a leader of the republic of Croatia, is
the leading candidate to become Yugoslavia's new premier, newspapers
said today.
   Premier Branko Mikulic and his government resigned Dec. 30 after
being criticized for failing to curb the country's 250 percent
annual inflation rate and other economic problems. It was the first
time the government of Yugoslavia resigned since the communists took
power after World War II.
   ``The most serious candidate to become Yugoslavia's new premier
is Ante Markovic,'' said the Vecernje Novosti daily.
   Mikulic is to stay in office as caretaker premier until the
nine-member federal presidency names a new premier, probably by the
end of January.
   The new Yugoslav Cabinet, which is expected to be installed in
February, will probably include Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar and
Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic, both of whom resigned, the
newspaper said.
   Markovic, an electrical engineer who had managed a large Yugoslav
company, is currently a member of the collective presidency of the
northern republic of Croatia. He has often advocated radical
market-oriented changes and demanded reforms in the country's
political system.
   Mikulic also has called for economic reforms, but he did not
favor major changes in Yugoslavia's communist political system.
   During a recent Communist Party meeting, Markovic said the
authorities ``should not scare Yugoslavs by saying reforms would
bring social upheavals and unemployment, since we already face such
problems today.''
   Workers last year staged a record 1,400 strikes, and many
Yugoslavs have called for a multi-party political system.

   Fire broke out on two oil barges in the Yangtze
River, and at least two firefighters were killed trying to put out
the blazes and six were missing, a news report said Saturday.
   The fire began Monday on a barge anchored near Wuhan, about 700
miles south of Beijing, and spread to a second barge, the Xinhua
News Agency said. One of the barges was still burning Saturday,
according to the report.
   One firefighter was found dead Monday, and the second body was
found Saturday, Xinhua said.
   The two barges carried almost 34,000 tons of oil, Xinhua said. It
said the barge still burning was anchored to prevent it from
drifting down the river to Wuhan, a major metropolitan area.
   The cause of the fire was not known. Initial reports said fires
broke out simultaneously on the two barges and caused an explosion
that spread burning oil across the river.

   Narcotics agents raided a hotel near
Clark Air Base and seized morphine worth $4.3 million that was
allegedly bound for the United States, police said Saturday.
   The agents found 4.4 pounds of morphine Thursday when they raided
the hotel about 50 miles north of Manila, according to Capt.
Francisco Bustamante, chief of the Philippine Constabulary's
regional anti-narcotics unit.
   The suspected trafficker is a U.S. serviceman and the morphine
probably came from China or Thailand, Bustamante said.
   He said the serviceman, who had been under surveillance for two
months, left his hotel room shortly before the raid, but his name
name was given to U.S. military authorities and he was expected to
be arrested.
   Bustamante said an international drug ring has been using U.S.
servicemen as couriers and the Philippines as a transit point for
shipments.

<HEAD>All Eyes On Bush Even Though It's Not His Name On Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush will keep the sideline
seat he has occupied for the past eight years when President Reagan
sends his final budget to Congress, but this time all eyes will be
on Bush because the next moves clearly will be his to make.
   The vice president, who repeatedly touted a vague ``flexible
freeze'' to pare the federal deficit during his campaign, has been
equally mum about details during the transition period.
   But, with the formal submission of Reagan's $1.15 trillion
spending plan out of the way Monday, attention will shift quickly to
Bush.
   ``There's no question, his first test of leadership will be on
this issue,'' Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee, said in an interview.
   If Bush carries through on his vow and produces a credible
spending plan that holds the increase in overall spending to the
rate of inflation, ``then I think that could very well be the basis
for negotiation and for compromise with the Congress,'' Panetta
continued.
   ``If, on the other hand, he walks away from that challenge in
some way, then obviously we are facing a potential for
confrontation.''
   Bush has said he will outline his budget priorities in an address
to a joint session of Congress soon after he takes office, following
Reagan's 1981 example. He has indicated he won't submit a complete
new budget, but will spell out what he'll ``add here and take off
there.''
   The amendments, which have yet to take shape, will embody Bush's
key priorities and reiterate his oft-stated pledge not to raise
taxes, transition officials said.
   Clearly, many of Reagan's pet budget projects _ selling off a
host of federal assets, wholesale abolition of programs and agencies
and the ``privatization'' of federal functions _ aren't high on
Bush's list of priorities, based on his campaign statements.
   And he will have to make room in his budget outline for the
``kinder, gentler nation'' proposals he talked about so much before
the election, including $2.2 billion in child-care tax incentives,
$600 million in additional promised funds for education and
increasing spending for environmental cleanup.
   But, basically, Reagan at least has given Bush a spending outline
that generally conforms with the vice president's ``flexible
freeze'' goal without advocating new taxes.
   Reagan's budget is expected to envision a federal fiscal 1990
deficit of $92.5 billion, lower than the $100 billion target of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and a sharp decline from the $155
billion projected in the current fiscal year.
   And Reagan's expected call for $1.15 billion in overall spending
represents a 4.5 percent increase over this year's anticipated $1.10
billion spending level. That's close to the estimated 4.4 percent
annual rate of inflation the Consumer Price Index posted for 1988.
   In other words, the Reagan budget in numbers alone adds up to the
Bush ``flexible freeze.''
   While Bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in
the preparation of the Reagan budget, his choice for budget
director, Richard G. Darman, has made frequent trips to Capitol Hill
to meet with Republican budget writers.
   In the meetings, Darman indicated the forthcoming Bush proposals
would be general, and that the incoming president would put greater
emphasis on negotiations with Congress, according to participants.
   The Bush amendments are more likely to reflect overall targets
for major programs rather than a program-by-program list of specific
increases and offsetting cuts, the congressional sources said.
   Darman all along has advocated a series of quiet negotiations
with Congress to forge a budget consensus. And Bush has said he
would send his budget negotiating team, headed by Darman, to meet
with congressional leaders at the outset of his presidency.
   However, both Democratic and Republican leaders said Bush would
have to do more than just negotiate; he would have to come up with
his own set of proposals to have negotiating credibility.
   ``Bush has promoted some new programs that the president of the
United States has not,'' said New Mexico Sen. Pete V. Domenici, the
senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. ``I don't think
Bush has been a part of this (Reagan) budget. He has to do his own,
produce his own changes.''
   Darman so far has been ``laying low,'' said Mike Johnson, an aide
to House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. ``I don't
think they're prepared at this point to begin specific discussions
on the Hill. They'll wait until after Bush is inaugurated to do
that.''
   Still, Darman has been kept closely informed on details of the
preparation of the final Reagan budget and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady _ a close Bush confidant whom the vice president has
announced he will retain _ played a role in shaping it.
   In fact, Brady will be one of the administration's principal
briefers on the document after its release Monday.
   Outgoing Budget Director Joseph Wright suggested the Reagan
budget would be a good starting point for Bush. ``This is a very
good thing, for Ronald Reagan to propose as he is going out and then
George Bush can go in there and negotiate,'' Wright said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who will occupy the same
post in the Bush presidency, has said the two men differ somewhat in
specifics but ``they are in general agreement about budget policy.''
   But, he emphasized, the spending plan ``is a Reagan
administration budget and not a Bush administration budget.''
   Bush echoed that sentiment: ``Let's see what the president does
and then when the ball is in my court and the buck is stopping at my
desk, I may have something else to say about matters of this
nature.''

<HEAD>Dropping Two Counts Against North Called Aid to Prosecutors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution's request to drop the most
sweeping and controversial Iran-Contra charges against Oliver L.
North could make it easier to put the former presidential aide on
trial, legal experts say.
   The most politically explosive charges, alleging a conspiracy to
divert to Nicaraguan rebels $14 million in proceeds from U.S.-Iran
arms sales, will be gone if the dismissal move by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh succeeds.
   But some experts say that would leave a ``lean and mean'' case
against North, free of problems that have bogged down the
proceedings for months.
   District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will decide whether to grant the
dismissal motion. If he does, prosecutors will still be able to try
the former National Security Council aide on 12 felony charges,
including allegations that he shredded documents and lied both to
Congress and a presidential inquiry in an effort to conceal his
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The sex appeal part of this case is always the conspiracy,''
said Washington attorney Stanley Brand. ``But there is still a
substantial case left.''
   ``Lying to Congress and obstruction of justice are not small
matters, if in fact that's what happened,'' said Brand, a former
counsel to the House of Representatives.
   ``Lying to the Congress may be worse'' than actually diverting
arms-sale proceeds to help the Contras at a time lawmakers had
banned such assistance to the rebels, Brand said.
   ``The public's perception of this and what it says about the
distribution of powers among the branches of government is as
important to me as whether anybody goes to jail,'' he added.
   The remaining counts carry prison terms totaling 60 years. They
include charges that North lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about
his involvement in the covert Contra resupply operation.
   North also is accused of accepting installation of a $13,800
security fence around his suburban Virginia home, pocketing at least
$4,300 in travelers checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero and
illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the
rebels.
   Other counts charge that North lied to Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and destroyed official documents during the Nov. 20-23,
1986, presidential investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Since the indictment was returned March 16, a number of federal
prosecutors have privately criticized Walsh for bringing a broad
conspiracy charge against North and his three co-defendants.
   These prosecutors questioned the wisdom of trying to criminalize
the conduct of North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   But many of these same prosecutors also supported the decision to
charge North with destroying documents and lying to Meese.
   The Justice Department last fall filed a brief criticizing a
legal theory Walsh used to support the conspiracy charge, saying it
would set a dangerous precedent for prosecuting government officials
whose conduct had not actually violated any laws.
   Brand rejected this criticism of Walsh's use of the conspiracy
statute, a popular law among federal prosecutors in other cases.
   ``It was fine with those guys to use it against politicians when
they thought it was in their interest,'' he said.
   Walsh successfully defended the legality of the charges he
brought against North. Gesell refused to dismiss all but two of the
16 original charges.
   From the start, however, there was a problem about the conspiracy
and theft charges.
   North's defense against the charges _ that he thought he was
acting with President Reagan's permission _ hinged in part on highly
secret information about covert operations.
   Gesell, meanwhile, stuck to his ruling that the prosecution must
disclose more information than the Reagan administration wanted
released in open court.
   That prompted Walsh on Thursday to seek dismissal of the key
charges, a motion in all likelihood Gesell will grant at a hearing
Monday.
   Walsh's decision prompted charges that the Reagan administration
deliberately held back releasing some secrets to help scuttle the
major charges against North.
   But Attorney General Richard Thornburgh defended the
administration, noting that when Walsh informed him of the decision
the independent counsel did not complain that the intelligence
agencies had treated him unfairly.
   Reagan himself said Walsh's decision ``satisfies our problem,
which has been concern.. about national security.''
   North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., said in a statement that
``although the heart of its case is destroyed, the independent
counsel continues to toy with Col. North.''
   Sullivan vowed to continue to press the secrecy issue on the
remaining charges, stating that Walsh ``apparently refuses to
recognize that classified information pervades the remaining charges
as well.''
   But Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor who has
done some work for Walsh's office, said the secrecy problems will be
``radically reduced'' once the conspiracy and theft charges are
dismissed.
   Walsh will have ``a lean and mean version of the prosecution,''
Tribe said. ``With must of the most dramatic conspiracy and theft
elements removed.. (Walsh) can proceed without the cloud of national
security'' hanging over the case.

   In his 10 years as leader of the nation's
capital, Marion Barry has earned the sobriquet ``mayor for life''
and a reputation for withstanding embarrassment and scandal that
would wither any other politician.
   In the past two weeks, though, there have been indications his
industrial-strength coating of political Teflon may be wearing thin.
   The latest episode to ensnarl Barry has triggered a federal grand
jury investigation and raised new allegations of drug use,
corruption, consorting with criminals, and interference with a
criminal investigation.
   ``It's worse than the other scrapes he has gotten into,'' said
Bishop Edward H. Moore, leader of 125 storefront, independent,
predominantly black churches across the city.
   ``The grassroots that's been behind the mayor, he's losing
them,'' Moore said. ``And he'll lose them as he goes along.''
   Barry's latest problems began three days before Christmas when
District of Columbia police detectives went to investigate a
suspected drug dealer at a hotel bordering a seedy area. They
encountered one of the mayor's security guards. Barry was in the
room of the suspect.
   Police left without talking to the man, Charles Lewis. He checked
out he next day. A search of the room later turned up traces of
cocaine, but Barry denied any drug use, and authorities said there
was no way to determine how recently cocaine had been in the room.
   From there the story, reported in daily detail by The Washington
Post and other local news outlets, has taken a variety of twists _
none of them good for Barry.
   Police said they were investigating a complaint by a hotel maid
that the man Barry visited had offered her drugs in exchange for sex.
   The newspaper reported the police were ``called back'' from their
investigation of Lewis after confronting Barry's security agent.
Barry acknowledged he made several calls to the assistant police
chief, Isaac Fulwood, and others, but denied trying to interfere or
pressure the investigation.
   Barry gave conflicting accounts of why he was there, and of how
many times he had visited the man.
   And Lewis, who dropped from sight for several days before
resurfacing in the Virgin Islands, had a long history of contact
with Barry. A native of the Virgin Islands, he had headed an
agreement between the islands' government and the D.C. government
for Washington officials to provide consulting help on personnel
matters. But he was fired amid concern about free spending by
visiting D.C. government officials who stayed in expensive resort
hotels in the islands. Barry himself made at least one trip there in
connection with the project.
   Auditors for the Interior Department, which oversees U.S.
territories including the Virgin Islands, were already investigating
that arrangement. Inspector General James Richards said they found
little documentation of expenses, and no trace of even a contract.
   There were more damaging details, but Barry angrily blamed the
Post and others in the media in his first public statements. He
later apologized for the Lewis episode and said, ``I'm guilty of
poor judgment, no question.''
   As only the second elected mayor since rule over Washington,
D.C., was released by Congress 15 years ago, Barry has been a
powerful symbol for many of the residents of the city that is 70
percent black. He grew to represent both the aspirations of the
city's downtrodden and the success of its black elite.
   Barry, who is black, emerged from the civil rights movement of
the 1960s, where he was a leader of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, or SNCC.
   A tough-talking figure of the streets who favored wearing
colorful African dashikis, Barry slowly earned respect from and drew
closer to the political mainstream through neighborhood work and
service on first the school board and later the city council. By the
time he ran for mayor in 1978, he had attracted support from the
white establishment.
   He won re-election twice with two-thirds or more of the vote,
leading to the conclusion the job was his for as long as he wanted.
But along the way Barry raised plenty of eyebrows with reports of
womanizing and innuendo of possible drug use.
   A dozen city officials have been convicted on corruption charges
under his administration, including two deputy mayors. One of them,
Ivanhoe Donaldson, was Barry's closest friend and political alter
ego.
   Barry himself was the object of a highly publicized investigation
by the U.S. attorney's office that ended in 1987. There were
allegations that close friends of Barry paid hush money to a
convicted cocaine dealer, Karen Johnson.
   Barry, who is married, acknowledged a personal relationship with
the woman, but denied buying or using drugs. She served a prison
term on contempt of court charges for refusing to testify about
Barry to a grand jury. Later a Washington magazine published what it
said was her diary, naming Barry and grading his sexual performance.
   Barry has survived embarrassments involving other women and his
frequent absenses from the city.
   His problems this time seem most serious in part because of the
issue of drugs and the heightened concern over that issue.
   Barry has been leading a public crusade against drug use in a
city where open-air drug markets operate, some in close view of the
Capitol dome. Violence has accompanied the explosion in drugs, and
homicides came at a rate of more than one a day in 1988.
   By the account of city hall insiders, support for Barry is
eroding even among his own appointed officials.
   One long-time ally, speaking on condition he not be identified by
name, pointed to pictures of Barry on his own office wall and said,
sadly: ``This was taken three years ago, but he's aged 10 years
since then. He really seems like he's on a self-destructive course.''
   A Washington television station, WRC, conducted a poll last week
of 400 D.C. residents and reported nearly half thought he should
resign; 40 percent thought he was involved with drugs.
   ``Some of his support may have eroded,'' said city council member
John Wilson, who is black. ``I think a lot of people are waiting to
see what the U.S. attorney and others are coming up with in this
situation. You've got to realize we've been through this three or
four times before. Each time they've not come up with anything to
indict the mayor or force him from office.''
   Barry's term expires in 1990, and he has not yet indicated
whether he will run for re-election.

<HEAD>Chemical Weapons _ Long A Concern To France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the muddy trenches of World War I to the lofty
chambers of UNESCO today, the subject of chemical warfare has long
been of concern to France.
   French troops were among the first victims of the deadly, yellow
chlorine gas released by the Germans at Ypres, Belgium, on April 22,
1915. An estimated 5,000 men died and 15,000 others were
incapacitated in what is considered the beginning of 20th-century
chemical war.
   About a month later, 6,000 more men in the trenches suffocated
from inhaling phosgene gas used by the Germans on the Russian front.
By the end of World War I, chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas had
been established as chemical weapons.
   Public revulsion at their use brought about the international
agreement in 1925 banning the use of chemical and bacteriological
agents.
   France _ which acknowledges it has the capability of making
chemical weapons but has never admitted possessing them _ is
custodian of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, holding the original document
in the Foreign Ministry and accepting additional signatories to it
over the years.
   Successive governments have made much of the moral responsiblity
implied in serving as custodian, and the feeling was the backdrop
against which President Francois Mitterrand proposed France play
host to the international conference on chemical weapons that began
Saturday.
   Not everyone, however, saw France as the best choice for the
five-day conference.
   The English-language Tehran Times said Saturday that Paris was
the ``least qualified'' to host the meeting because of its estimated
$5 billion worth of arms sales to Iraq during the eight-year Persian
Gulf war.
   ``In view of France's indirect condonement of the Iraqi regime's
actions during the war and in view of the fact that Iraq is one
country which flagrantly used chemical weapons ... any Western
capital would have been a better and happier choice,'' the newspaper
said.
   Both Iran and Iraq have accused the other of using poison gas. It
is known that Iraq used mustard gas during the war. Both are
signatories to the protocol.

   A South Korean fishing boat with 21 crewmen aboard
has disappeared in the Japan Sea, and searchers have found two empty
lifeboats bearing the missing ship's name, officials said Saturday.
   The 74-ton No. 801 Wonkyung-ho, which left Chumunjin on South
Korea's east coast three days ago to catch squid, was last heard
from by radio Thursday evening, said an official of the Maritime
Safety Agency.
   After an emergency message from South Korea's coast guard
Saturday morning, Japan sent three patrol ships and two airplanes to
search near the missing ship's last known position, near Japan's
Mishima Island 520 miles west of Tokyo, the official said.
   He said weather had been calm in the area.

<HEAD>Boat People Flee Poverty in Dominican Republic</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AGUADILLA, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boat people fleeing poverty in the
Dominican Republic are boarding flimsy motor boats and braving a
hazardous 90-mile stretch of the Caribbean to reach Puerto Rico,
gateway to the United States.
   Many of the illegal aliens drown during the three-day voyage.
Most who make it ashore later pose as Puerto Ricans to slip past
immigration officials and board flights to New York.
   U.S. Coast Guard and Border Patrol officials in Puerto Rico say
they don't have enough manpower to halt the exodus, which has
increased sharply in recent months as the Dominican economy worsens.
   The Dominican Republic has a population of 6 million, and as many
as 30,000 try to leave each year, officials estimate. They say no
more than 10 percent to 20 percent of Dominicans illegally entering
Puerto Rico are caught. Some 3,000 people were detained in 1988. The
rest either make it or drown.
   Authorities complain that the problem isn't getting the attention
it deserves because it's happening so far from the U.S. mainland.
Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, is 1,000 miles southeast of Miami.
   ``There are human beings dying, and they also pose an economic
threat to the United States; but the consciousness of this is
zero,'' said Capt. William A. Caster, head of the Coast Guard's
Greater Antilles Command.
   U.S. officials say the Dominican exodus has reached the scale of
Haiti's in 1985, when thousands of boat people were intercepted by
the Coast Guard and hundreds of others washed up on Florida's shores.
   ``The only difference is that Haitians were dying off the U.S.
coast,'' said Caster, who also led the Haitian operation.
   Another difference is that the Coast Guard has an agreement with
Haiti allowing the Coast Guard to board Haitian boats to check for
illegal aliens. The agreement resulted in the arrest of some 4,000
Haitians in 1988.
   There is no such accord with the Dominican government, although
talks are to start in the new year about signing one.
   ``We are focusing on the drug problem, not aliens,'' said Caster.
``We don't go out looking for Dominicans. We're coming across them
on our patrols and when we do, it invariably turns out to be a
rescue operation.''
   ``The boats are in such bad shape and the people are in so much
danger, they are thankful to be taken anywhere,'' he said.
   Facing 30 percent unemployment rate and 60 percent inflation,
Dominicans are lured to the United States in search of jobs and to
Puerto Rico because Spanish is spoken here and Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens. A Dominican who can pass for a Puerto Rican doesn't
need documents or a passport to fly to New York, where most illegal
Dominicans end up.
   Authorities concede it is easy for Dominicans to get past
immigration officials at San Juan's airport with a well-rehearsed
``New York'' when asked where they're from.
   ``There aren't that many differences between the languages and
cultures'' of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, said James
Walker, the district director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. He said more than 1 million Dominicans are in the United
States, most of them illegally.
   ``If the family never hears from them, they assume they made it
safely. They don't think anybody drowned,'' said Walker.
   About 100 bodies were recovered in a two-month period alone in
1988.
   ``But we never find the bodies when they drown in the high seas.
We suspect there's quite a number though,'' said Joe B. Bennett,
chief of the Border Patrol, the federal agency set up a year ago in
the northwest port of Aguadilla where most Dominicans arrive.
   Dominicans take on the 90-mile Mona Passage in fragile, wooden
fishing boats loaded with up to 80 people. They usually wear no life
jackets or other safety equipment.
   ``They don't know the first thing about navigating in the most
hazardous conditions in one of the most dangerous waters of the
world,'' said Bennett.
   Clashing winds from the Caribbean and the Atlantic can whip up
20-foot swells in the Mona Passage. It's a trip even the Coast Guard
and Border Patrol avoid on rough days.
   Dominicans sell stoves and refigerators to raise the $500
smugglers charge for the journey. The price is $3,000 if a plane
ticket to New York is included.
   Ramon Antonio Sanches, a 30-year-old fisherman recently arrested
off the cost of Aguadilla, said he sold everything he had for the
trip.
   ``If hunger is going to kill me, I prefer to be killed
escaping,'' he said. ``What I want to do is work, but there are no
jobs at home.''
   The Coast Guard patrols 1.3 million square miles with seven large
patrol boats, four smaller boats, four helicopters and three planes.
   The Border Patrol has 17 agents and two boats for a 30-mile
coastline. Bennett said it would take 200 agents to halt the exodus.

<HEAD>Missouri Oil Spill Possibly Linked To Problem At Refinery</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Oil Spill Impact, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. officials said a pipeline rupture
that sent 840,000 gallons of oil into the Gasconade River last month
may have been caused by a malfunction at an Illinois refinery that
temporarily increased pressure in the line.
   Shell spokesman Tony Canino said Friday that pressure increased
in the pipeline laid in 1948 while valves at a refinery in Wood
River, Ill., 170 miles east of the spill site in central Missouri,
were switching some crude oil from the Shell pipeline into another
line operated by Marathon Oil Co.
   Canino said company officials have not determined what caused the
malfunction.
   The oil from the spill, one of the worst inland spills in U.S.
history, made its way from the Gasconade to the Missouri River, and
from there to the Mississippi.
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Transportation said a federal inspector visited the spill site last
week to determine if Shell violated any regulations in its operation
of the 435-mile pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Okla., to
Roxanna, Ill.
   The oil lost in the Shell spill is more than three times larger
than the amount lost in all pipeline accidents in 1987, the last
year for which figures are available, said the spokeswoman, Suzette
Paes.
   The oil erupted from a 35-foot rupture in a buried pipeline near
the Gasconade River, about 140 miles west of St. Louis.
   Also Friday, Anheuser Busch Cos. announced that it had recalled
1,500 of 2,000 bottlers and brewers laid off Tuesday when production
shut down after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the water used for
brewing the beer. Water samples taken Wednesday by the state
Department of Natural Resources turned up no traces of oil or
related chemicals.
   In a statement, Andrew J. Steinhubl, senior vice president of
brewing, said the company ``would return gradually to full
production and full employment.''
   St. Louis water department officials have said that while the
water from city taps might taste and smell oily for a few days,
there was no danger. Extra steps were taken in treating water taken
from the Missouri and Mississippi as the oil spill moved past the
city.

<TEXT>
   In a short, silent ceremony soon after the death of
his father, Emperor Akihito on Saturday ascended the Chrysanthemum
Throne and received the mythic symbols of imperial legitimacy _ a
sword and jewels.
   The ancient ceremony began when the new emperor, clad in black
morning coat and gray trousers and accompanied by six male members
of the imperial family, entered the Matsu no Ma Hall of the Imperial
Palace.
   For the first time, reporters were allowed to witness the somber
ritual, which later was broadcast on national television.
   Journalists were led through dimly lit, concrete tunnels to the
palace, where they watched through tinted windows that hid them from
those at the ceremony.
   It lasted just four minutes.
   Taking his place before a purple and gold folding screen and
high-backed wooden chair bearing the imperial chrysanthemum crest,
Akihito stood facing the official witnesses _ Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, 19 Cabinet ministers, the four heads of Parliament and
two Supreme Court judges.
   The government leaders later were joined by top Imperial
Household Agency officials and chamberlains. All wore morning coats
and black ties.
   With bows, three palace officials presented the seals and two
encased objects of the regalia _ a sword and jewels _ then placed
them on short wooden tables before the emperor. The third regalia
item, a mirror, is kept at a shrine on the palace grounds.
   The regalia, which have deep religious significance to followers
of Japan's native Shinto religion, have never been displayed in
public and were encased throughout the rite.
   After exchanging bows with those present, Akihito left the room
preceded by the sword bearer and followed by the chamberlain
carrying the jewels. The imperial and state seals, carried in two
purple pouches, were removed after other members of the imperial
family had left.
   For centuries the regalia have symbolized the divine origin of
the world's oldest imperial family.
   According to legend, the mirror was used by the deities to lure
the sun goddess Amaterasu out of self-imposed seclusion on the High
Celestial Plain and the jewels were given to her after she emerged.
   The sword was a token of repentance by her brother, who drew it
from a giant eight-tailed, eight-headed snake he killed after being
banished from the divine highland for misconduct.
   Amaterasu later gave the regalia to her grandson, Ninigi no
Mikoto, before sending him to conquer the Japanese islands. He
passed them on to Jimmu, another descendant of the sun goddess who
by legend was Japan's first ruler.
   Today, the supposed original mirror is kept at the Grand Shrine
of Ise, the center of Shinto sun goddess worship 200 miles southwest
of Tokyo. The ``original'' sword is at the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya,
central Japan, and the ``original'' jewels, said to be comma-shaped
stones, are kept at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
   Replicas of the sword and mirror, themselves ancient, are used in
imperial ascension ceremonies.
   Until his death Saturday, Emperor Hirohito slept in a room where
the jewels and replica sword are stored.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moammar Gadhafi today called for direct
negotiations with the United States to resolve a dispute over a
Libyan factory U.S. officials claim was built to produce chemical
weapons.
   The Libyan leader made the statement at Tripoli's best hotel,
where he arrived unexpectedly to speak to foreign reporters. It was
his first public appearance since two U.S. Navy jets shot down two
Libyan MiGs over the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday.
   ``America must understand that her policy of surrounding us and
using force against us will absolutely fail,'' Gadhafi said,
speaking softly in Arabic.
   ``They must negotiate with Libya directly and they should sit at
the negotiating table with Libya without their weapons to achieve
peace in the Mediterranean,'' he said. He was ringed by bodyguards
during his appearance in a hotel lobby lounge.
   ``I think the Bush administration will be able to do this because
they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration.
There have been enough lessons. They will have learned that force
does not pay, especially with Libya,'' Gadhafi said.
   ``We will not respond to force, only to politeness and direct
negotiations.''
   The United States brushed aside Gadhafi's call for direct
negotiations. A senior U.S. official, attending a chemical warfare
conference in Paris, said, ``Communications is not the problem, the
problem is Libyan policy.''
   But the official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, also said, ``I am not ruling anything in or out.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Thursday the United
States had been able to stay in touch with Libya through
intermediaries.
   Gadhafi's five-minute-long statement was translated into English
by a Libyan who works for the Information Ministry.
   The Libyan leader's curly hair was topped by a black, wool
pillbox hat. He wore a maroon-and-blue sweater, covered by a brown
wool cape, to protect him from Tripoli's rainy weather.
   Asked about the U.S. pressures on his country, Gadhafi vowed
never to bow to the Americans, ``even if this confrontation lasts 1
million years.''
   The unexpected sight of a smiling Gadhafi in the hotel set off
chaos. Journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants,
scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a two-story-high ornamental
fountain inside the lobby.
   Sources in the capital said Gadhafi had not been seen in public
for several weeks, and there was speculation he had fled in fear of
a U.S. attack.
   Tensions between the United States and Libya have increased
because of U.S. allegations that Libya has built a chemical weapons
factory in Rabta, 60 miles from the capital.
   Libya has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine. President
Reagan has said he could not rule out a military strike against the
site.
   In 1986, Gadhafi's headquarters in Tripoli was bombed by the
United States in to retaliate for Libya's alleged support for
terrorism.
   Gadhafi told reporters today that the administration of
President-elect George Bush ``should sit with Libya to discuss
face-to-face cases of dispute. Libya is absolutely against terrorism
but we are beside the just struggle for just causes.''
   He added: ``The Palestinian peoples' stuggle for a free Palestine
is a just struggle and we will never hesitate to support it.''
Gadhafi's regime came to power in 1969 with a coup that ousted a
Western-backed monarchy.
   ``Bush will have another lesson from the failure of America's
childish policies, which gain nothing,'' said Gadhafi.
   Gadhafi and other Libyan officials offered the United States a
one-time inspection of the Rabta plant, but the Reagan
administration rejected that offer, saying Libya could disguise the
plant for the inspection and then restore its chemical weapons'
capabilities.
   Gadhafi told reporters today: ``Libya will participate in all
negotiations to get rid of all weapons from ordinary guns to nuclear
bombs. America must get rid of its chemical and nuclear weapons
factories and cancel the `Star Wars' program,'' refering to U.S.
research for a space-based defense system.
   ``All nations of the world must agree to get rid of weapons and
settle for peace. If this does not happen, we have only
confrontation. Libya will never surrender and America will lose,''
said Gadhafi.
   ``Libya will accept the participation of any international
committee to inspect Israeli factories and factories in America,
Europe and any spot of the world,'' Gadhafi concluded in his
statement.
   On Friday, the Libyan government charged at a news conference and
in official media that its planes were overwhelmed Wednesday by 14
``hostile American aircraft.''
   A government spokesman maintained the U.S. report that two Navy
jets had acted in self-defense was ``a fabrication.''
   Washington provided the U.S. media with videotape taken by a U.S.
aircraft of the encounter and showed photographs to the U.N.
Security Council of what it said was a heavily armed Libyan plane
involved in the encounter.

<TEXT>
   A farmer watching a television news report
about a missing woman recognized the sketch of a barn that was shown
as his own. He then went out and found her body buried nearby.
   The body found Friday was identified as that of Virginia Moore,
26, of Berrien County, said John Bankhead, a Georgia Bureau of
Investigation spokesman in Atlanta.
   William Earl Lynd, 33, of Berrien County, who had already been
charged in Ms. Moore's slaying, also faces a murder charge in the
Christmas Day shooting of a Detroit woman near Chesapeake, Ohio.
   Lynd had told authorities he buried Ms. Moore near a building off
Interstate 75, said Berrien County Sheriff Jerry Brogdon.
Authorities distributed a sketch of the building Thursday based on
those statements.
   Tift County farmer Clarence Smith said he saw the sketch on
television and recognized his barn. When he searched around it,
Smith found the body under about 9 inches of dirt, Bankhead said.
   Authorities had been searching for Ms. Moore's body along a
200-mile stretch of Interstate 75 between Atlanta and south
Georgia's Cook County. Tift County is just north of Cook County.
   State officials said Ms. Moore is believed to have been killed
Dec. 23, the day she disappeared from her home. Lynd was charged
based on a statement he made after surrendering Dec. 31.
   Lynd also is charged with killing Leslie JoAnn Starkey, 42, of
Detroit, who was shot Christmas Day in Ohio as she traveled to West
Virginia for a family gathering. She was able to describe her
attacker before she died Dec. 26.
   Lynd is being held without bond in the Berrien County jail. He
also is charged with auto theft in the disappearance of Ms. Moore's
car.

   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for spearheading a
regional peace plan, said Friday the summit planned for Jan. 15-16
should be postponed to give President-elect George Bush time to
formulate his policy in the region.
   ``The great irony is that President Arias, the great creator of
the Esquipulas Peace Plan _ for which he was given the Nobel Prize _
could be the same person that buries the plan,'' Ortega said Friday
night.
   He was speaking at an awards ceremony for Milos Jakes, visiting
secretary-general of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party.
   ``Fixing the dates of Jan. 15 and 16 was proof by the Central
American governments that we weren't going to be waiting until the
new North American government assumed power to debate our problems
and look for a solution,'' he said.
   Arias also said he and his counterparts in Honduras, Guatemala,
Nicaragua and El Salvador need more time to prepare for the meeting
in San Salvador, El Salvador.
   The presidents had planned to talk about how to revive the peace
plan they signed in 1987. Although some progress had been made, the
plan now is stalled in all the countries it applied to.
   Ortega said Arias' proposal could ``practically kill'' previous
peace accords between the Central American nations.
   Honduran and Guatemalan officials said they still plan to attend.
``I'm still preparing for the meeting,'' President Jose Napoleon
Duarte of El Salvador told reporters.
   Arias hinted to a news conference that Central American leaders
may get more support for their plan from the new U.S. administration.
   President Reagan's administration ``didn't fully understand the
plan for peace in Central America'', Arias said, while ``the
statements of Mr. Baker make it appear that there is a commitment to
give diplomatic support to resolving the conflicts in Central
America.''
   The United States supports Nicaragua's Contra rebels, who are
trying to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist government. It backs the
governments of El Salvador and Guatemala in their conflicts with
leftist rebels and considers Costa Rica and Honduras strong allies.
   Arias' peace plan called for cease-fires, political amnesties and
negotiations between guerrillas and the governments of Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala.
   A cease-fire has been in effect between the Contras and the
Nicaraguan government since March 1988, and the level of fighting
there has dropped drastically. But fighting continues in Guatemala
and has escalated in El Salvador.

   A half-dozen students in an adult
literacy project were hesitant at first, but now they're all
published authors.
   The book of six stories, ``Fireside Memories,'' was mailed last
week to 200 people who helped keep the Hattiesburg Education
Literacy Project going during the past year.
   The 24-page book is partly a ``thank you'' to those who have
given time and money to the literacy project, but it's also a way to
get the students interested in writing, said Project Director Ron
Blackwell.
   When Blackwell and Tom Boss, volunteer coordinator for the
center, first proposed to students that they write stories for
publication, the answer was ``No way,'' Boss said.
   Some of the adult students don't want to let their friends and
coworkers know they have trouble reading, Boss said.
   But eventually, six students agreed to put their ideas in print.
Some wrote their stories alone, others dictated to a tutor.
   Tom Miller, who has been working with tutor Kathy Ballard for two
years, wrote poetically about colors of Christmas: ``With all of its
beauty of red, gold and silver and the pure white snow which stands
for God's pure love for us all.''
   ``We talked about writing what Christmas meant to him,'' Ballard
said. ``He came in with it, and it was written. It was not all in
complete sentences, but I didn't want to touch it; it was free
verse. The only things I changed were some possible spellings.''

   What would a legal document be without a few
``heretofores'' and ``forthwiths?''
   It probably would be better written and easier to understand,
says Minerva H. Neiditz, director of the University of Connecticut's
Institute of Writing, who is running a contest to find the best
legal brief written in Connecticut in 1988.
   For the contest, 900 law firms and state agencies have been asked
to submit their best appellate briefs filed in either state or
federal court. The deadline is Jan. 15, and Neiditz is hoping to
receive at least 100 entries.
   ``Lawyers have been my most difficult clients because they all
assume they can write. They're extremely sensitive to anyone
criticizing them,'' Nieditz said.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of extra verbiage and pomposity,''
she said. ``So, I thought it would be an exciting first project for
the institute to create this competition for the best legal brief.''
   Briefs will be screened initially by members of the UConn Law
Review. Then a panel of six judges will make the final selection.
   Some details of the contest are still to be worked out. For
instance, Neiditz doesn't know how many runners-up will be named,
she doesn't know when the winners will be announced, and she doesn't
know if cash prizes will be given, although she's hoping they will.
   In the event of a tie, Neiditz will cast the deciding vote.

   April LaSalata, Elizabeth Croff and Lydia
Grohoski all turned to the courts to ward off their estranged
husbands. But the long arm of the law was not long enough or strong
enough to prevent their murders.
   In the past two weeks, all three Long Island women, who had
obtained court orders of protection from their estranged or former
husbands, were shot to death by those men. Each man then killed
himself.
   ``We did our damnedest to protect her,'' Mary Werner, chief of
the Suffolk County district attorney's family crime bureau, said of
the most recent victim, Mrs. LaSalata, who was killed Tuesday.
   Mrs. Werner, choking back tears, said: ``We knew for about a year
of horrendous fear that she lived with every day. We tried
everything to help her _ short of placing an armed, 24-hour guard in
front of her house _ and we failed her.''
   It is a refrain becoming unnervingly common on Long Island.
   Mrs. Croff, 30, of Central Islip was chased down and shot to
death by her ex-husband, William, as she clutched her 2-year-old
daughter Dec. 30.
   She obtained a court order of protection almost a month before.
She called police on at least five occasions seeking to have him
arrested but was told they could make an arrest only if her husband
was there when they arrived.
   On Dec. 26, George Grohoski invaded his estranged wife's Southold
home and shot her in the face with a shotgun before killing himself.
She, too, had an order of protection, and police had gone to the
couple's home four or five times in the past year on calls of
domestic violence.
   Police pointed out that the killings all occurred during the
holidays, when family violence tends to escalate. But it was
possible, police said, that one shooting inspired another, copycat
style.
   They also inspired hysteria. Organizations that aid battered
women reported a flood of calls from women whose fears were
aggravated by reports of the murders.
   Suffolk County authorities point to a year-old policy that police
make arrests rather than encourage mediation in domestic violence.
Arrests increased from 126 in 1987 to 1,200 in 1988.
   Meg O'Regan, Suffolk County deputy attorney, said of 1,930
protective orders by Suffolk Family Court last year, 275 were
violated.
   ``An order of protection cannot stop a psychotic killer,'' she
said. ``But most husbands are not psychotic killers.''
   It was not the first attack on Mrs. LaSalata. Anthony LaSalata
was charged with trying to kill his 34-year-old ex-wife in February,
months after their eight-year marriage was dissolved. He broke into
her house, cut her telephone lines and stabbed her with a hunting
knife. The couple's son ran to a neighbor, who called police.
   LaSalata was ordered held on $25,000 bail on charges of assault
and attempted murder despite pleas by the district attorney for a
higher bond.
   When LaSalata posted bail after eight months in jail, police
installed a sophisticated alarm in Mrs. LaSalata's home to
automatically alert police if anyone broke in.
   They also gave her a hand-held electronic device to signal police
in an emergency. Patrol cars carried a picture of LaSalata so they
could identify him if he appeared in her neighborhood. Mrs.
LaSalata's mother, Lillian Principio, went to her daughter's house
every night so someone was home when Mrs. LaSalata returned from
work.
   The protection order did not dispel Mrs. LaSalata's fears. In
October, she told authorities that her former husband drove past her
house and stared at her. The prosecutor sought higher bail. Judge
Rudolf Mazzei refused.
   Mazzei refused to increase bail on another occasion when Mrs.
LaSalata claimed her husband had called her and breathed heavily
into the phone.
   ``The only reason for bail is to return a defendant to court, and
he had made all his court appearances,'' said Mazzei. ``We don't
have preventive detention in the United States.''
   Weeks ago, Mrs. LaSalata made a will and chose an urn for her
cremation. ``She knew she was going to die,'' said her mother.
   Mrs. LaSalata was gunned down in front of her Brentwood house as
she returned home from work Tuesday. On Friday, her husband's body
was found with a rifle in the front seat of his car at a highway
rest stop.
   Suffolk law enforcement officials have asked the state
Legislature to upgrade violations of protection orders from
misdemeanors to felonies.
   Suffolk County announced that henceforth, a judge would be
available every night to issue arrest warrants. That did little to
appease Mrs. LaSalata's mother.
   ``The system stinks,'' said Mrs. Principio. ``If it was the
judge's daughter, he would not have let him out on bail.''
   Mazzei dismissed his critics as Monday-morning quarterbacks.
   ``This is a human tragedy,'' he said. ``It's the kind of thing
that can drive a judge crazy.''

   The number of students entering U.S. nursing
schools rose 11 percent last year, after falling nearly a third from
1983 to 1987, according to a survey of more than 220 schools across
the nation.
   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published Monday
by the trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494
freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 a year earlier.
   The magazine's publisher, Richard A. DeVito, attributed the
turnaround primarily to rising salaries and plentiful job
opportunities. ``Probably the most important thing is that there has
been so much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' he
said Friday.
   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
have reduced minimum entry level grade-point averages to attract
more applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses
failed their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988,
four times the level of 1987.
   Hospital officials hailed the survey's finding as good news for
the nation's health care system. It has been strained by a
``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a
December report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
   ``We're going through a period where there's a wrenching change
in need for intensive nursing, because New York, San Francisco,
Boston and other cities are faced with a pandemic of AIDS. We need
more nurses, not less,'' said Martin H. Bander, a spokesman for
Massachusetts General Hospital.
   Two critically burned patients were turned away in August 1988
from the only hospital in Denver with a special burn unit because of
a shortage of nurses and, in February, the largest hospital on Long
Island in New York began refusing non-emergency cases because of a
lack of nurses.
   Some 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the American
Nurses Association estimated last year.
   And the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said the biggest
demand for any single occupation between 1988 and the end of the
century would be for registered nurses.
   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
$5,000 to $6,000 over the last five years. Registered nurses now
typically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on the
region of the country, and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in
some cities, he said.
   Nursingworld Journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S.
nursing schools and received responses from 227 institutions in 44
states.
   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs
experienced the greatest increase in entering students in 1988,
reporting a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were
next, with a 14.6 percent rise.
   Bachelor's degree programs at four-year colleges and universities
saw a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate
degree programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported
8.7 percent more freshmen.
   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of nursing graduates.
   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission
standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to
make the grade,'' he said.

   State leaders are trying to make Wisconsin
less attractive to poor people considering moving there by offering
new residents only as much in welfare as they would have received in
their old state.
   Following a recent study that concluded the state was a ``welfare
magnet,'' Gov. Tommy G. Thompson is proposing to limit payments for
incoming welfare recipients for their first three or six months in
Wisconsin, his aides said Friday.
   The Republican governor's plan, to be included in his budget
message to the Legislature later this month, was revealed a day
after a key Democrat, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Strohl,
advocated a similar plan.
   ``It is time that we Democrats admit that people really are
moving here because of our higher benefits, and begin to address
it,'' Strohl said.
   But others say the two-tiered benefit plan, even if it applies
only during a resident's first few months in the state, is
unconstitutional.
   ``The Supreme Court says it's illegal to have a two-tiered system
of benefits,'' said the Rev. Ted Steege, head of the Lutheran Office
of Public Policy in Wisconsin.
   Steege said each state ``has established a standard of need for
welfare recipients, and no state can create a new class of citizens
who aren't entitled to that.''
   The Supreme Court in 1969 ruled a one-year waiting period for Aid
to Families with Dependent Children benefits in several states and
the District of Columbia was unconstitional because it created ``an
invidious distinction'' among citizens.
   But lawmakers here said a two-tiered plan _ in effect, giving out
lower benefits, rather than no benefits, for the first few months of
residence _ has never gone before the court.
   Strohl said he was ``mildly optimistic'' the courts would uphold
such a plan because it does not deny all benefits based on one's
length of residency in the state.
   A recent report from the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute that
found 29 percent of new welfare cases in Wisconsin were people from
other states.
   More than one-fourth of the new arrivals were from Illinois,
where a family of three receives $558 a month in AFDC benefits and
food stamps. A family of three received a total off $542 a month in
Indiana. Combined benefits for such a family in Wisconsin are $680 a
month.
   Steege contended welfare recipients are attracted to Wisconsin
for a variety of reasons, including its quality of life, lower crime
rate, good schools, and to join family members who have previously
moved there.
   In November, 83,216 families in Wisconsin received AFDC, compared
with 72,646 in 1980.

<HEAD>President Touts 1990 Budget As `Responsible Plan'</HEAD>

   President Reagan touted his forthcoming budget
today as a ``responsible plan'' that will cut the deficit and assure
America's prosperity without raising taxes.
   ``I leave as I came _ dead set against any new taxes,'' Reagan
said in the next-to-last radio address of his presidency.
   The five-minute talk was taped on Friday because the president
entered Walter Reed Army Medical Center for surgery today to correct
a curvature of his left ring finger.
   The president's final spending plan is due out Monday, a $1.15
trillion budget that is said to propose the elimination of 82
government programs while protecting his two-term defense buildup.
It covers the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1.
   But since President-elect George Bush is slated to take office on
Jan. 20, Reagan's document has been branded in some quarters as
irrelevant.
   ``It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching
Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benfits to the
needy,'' Reagan asserted. ``And the best news is that this budget
proves it can be done without raising your taxes.''
   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way to kill the economic
goose that lays the golden eggs,'' Reagan said.
   The president argued that his plan will contain additional funds
for air safety, fighting crime, housing the poor, the war on drugs,
and the space program, as well as fighting Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.
   The president also warned that his defense buildup must be
maintained, saying, it is ``the price of peace and security for
America.''
   ``My fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy, does not
raise taxes, and by controlling the growth in spending, reduces the
deficit next year by nearly $70 billion,'' Reagan said.
   ``This budget is a realistic program which protects the working
families of America, provides adequate support for those who depend
on government and helps assure America's prosperity for years to
come,'' Reagan said.
   The president also put in a plug for his decision this week to
back the large pay raise for Congress, judges and top executive
branch officials that has been recommended by a presidential
commission.
   ``We must be willing to pay for excellence in government or risk
a government run only by people of wealth or by those beholden to
special interests,'' Regan said.
   The 50 percent pay raise will be come law automatically unless
each house of Congress rejects it by Feb. 8. The plan includes a ban
on outside speaking fees and other certain income and will formally
be sent to the Congress with Reagan's budget on Monday.
   Giving the Democratic response to Reagan's radio speech was House
Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, who expressed hopes for ``a new era of
cooperation and good feelings'' between Congress and the White House.
   Speaking about Bush, Wright said, ``we in the House leadership
are eager to help him attain his announced goal of wider access for
all Americans to education, to child care, to affordable housing and
to a cleaner environment.''
   ``We in Congress hope that the next administration, together with
us, will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings between
the legislative and executive branches of government,'' Wright said.

<HEAD>California Raisins Refuse To Parade at Inaugural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Raisins are in the middle of
a mild rhubarb and the ad-celebrities won't be marching in
President-elect George Bush's inaugural parade.
   The wrinkled television stars were billed last week by parade
coordinators as prominent characters in the 78-float parade,
following the swearing-in on Jan. 20.
   But the people who run the California Raisin Advisory Board,
which bankrolls the famous corrugated crowd of TV ad fame, said it
was news to them.
   The inaugural procession would include attractions ``from
bell-ringers to bagpipes ... California raisins to rodeo queens,''
said the announcements on parade plans.
   ``I was surprised to read it,'' said Robert Phinney, the board's
director of advertising.
   Phinney denied that Bush's ``damned dancing raisins'' campaign
crack had anything to do with the board's refusal to have people in
California Raisin costumes march in the parade.
   For more than two years, the board has promoted its product with
the help of animated figures shaped like raisins, dancing to the
1960s song, ``I Heard it Through The Grapevine.''
   Since then, raisin sales shot up 11 percent and more than 300
raisin dolls, shirts and other items have gone on store shelves.
   The human version of the California Raisins, people in black
tights under costumes, occasionally make public appearances, and
during Christmastime First Lady Nancy Reagan invited the furrowed
fellows to help entertain children of foreign diplomats at a White
House party. But the parade presented some new wrinkles.
   Ed Cassidy, spokesman for the Bush inaugural committee, said the
raisin marchers were selected by the Council on Physical Fitness to
accompany its float, but that the raisin advisory board but the
kibosh on the plans. ``We'd be pleased to have the California
Raisins in the parade if (the board) wishes them to be there,'' he
said.
   Phinney said the big hangup was the council's plan for the
raisins to walk 2{ miles in their raisin outfits alongside the
floats. Such a walk, said Phinney, would be too tough on the raisins.
   ``Our characters are known for their dancing,'' Phinney said.
   The absence of the raisins might not be terribly disappointing to
Bush, who will watch the parade from a reviewing stand in front of
the White House. Bush has already seen the raisins.
   They performed at a Bush campaign rally in Kingsburg _ important
raisin country. On the final weekend of the campaign, Bush joked
that he canceled a planned return to the area because he didn't want
to see ``those damned raisins again.''
   Phinney insisted the wisecrack had nothing to do with the parade
refusal, adding that the remark ``certainly didn't warm the cockles
of our heart.''

   Prosecutors say the investigation of Pentagon
corruption, which took more than six months to yield its first
indictments, is just getting started.
   None of the indictments issued in U.S. District Court on Friday
involves high-ranking present or former military officials, but U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson said the continuing inquiry promises to be a
protracted affair.
   One defense contractor, a Navy employee and five other men were
indicted on charges that included conspiracy and bribery, while
another corporation pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the
government.
   ``I think over the next few months, perhaps the next year, you'll
see a great deal of additional activity,'' Hudson said Friday,
adding that the initial round of indictments represented a ``small
percentage'' of the case.
   ``It's a significant investigation and my assessment of its
dimensions hasn't changed in the last six or seven months,'' he
said. Prosecutors have subpoenaed more than 1 million documents and
spent ``many, many hours'' before the grand jury, he said.
   The big-rigging investigation hinges on allegations that private
consultants, hired by defense contracting firms, paid bribes to
government employees for inside information that gave them an
advantage in securing multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Hudson, who had once promised indictments in late fall, said he
is satisfied with the pace of the complex case.
   ``I think if you'll compare this to others of its type ... this
investigation is almost unprecedently quick,'' he said.
   Six months ago, President Reagan, declaring he was ``very upset''
about the reports of corruption in the Pentagon's
$150-billion-a-year purchasing system, told law enforcement agents
to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get the facts on the case,
said his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
   And President-elect Bush said the allegations, if correct, showed
people ``stealing from our national defense and undermining our
national security.''
   Although the investigation had been under way since September
1986, it was not made public until mid-June when the FBI issued
search warrants at 38 locations and 12 states. Investigators used
court-ordered wiretaps to gather much of their information.
   At least 20 defense contractors are under investigation, as well
as six Pentagon officials and a number of consultants, among them
Melvyn Paisley, former assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems.
   Hudson has said no congressmen were targets of the investigation,
although Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. William Chappell,
D-Fla., were once described as being under scrutiny. No search
warrants or subpoenas were issued to members of Congress or their
staffs.
   Shortly after the investigation was revealed, Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci reassigned the six Pentagon officials under scrutiny.
Then, based on information he received from court papers, he
suspended payment on $1 billion worth of potentially tainted
military contracts.
   The investigation has prompted calls in Congress to overhaul and
procurement system at the Pentagon, which lets contracts worth $620
million daily.
   The first indictment named Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park,
Calif., a division of Teledyne Industries, three of its employees,
two private consultants and a Navy procurement specialist. They will
be arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court. Teledyne could be fined
up to $6.5 million if convicted.
   At the heart of the indictment are charges that Teledyne and its
officers agreed to pay consultant William Parkin $160,000 to assist
them in obtaining a Navy contract worth $100 million.
   Parkin paid Fred Lackner, a California-based private consultant,
who gave money to Stuart E. Berlin, a Navy procurement official, for
his assistance in manipulating the procurement process, the
indictment says.
   If convicted of all charges, Berlin, Parkin and Lackner could
face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $5.5
million each, Hudson said.
   At the same time, Hazeltine Corp., of Greenlawn, N.Y., a division
of Emerson Electric Co., pleaded guilty among other things to
conspiracy to defraud the government in its efforts to obtain a
contract for radar testing devices.
   Hazeltine, which is cooperating with the government, agreed to
pay fines and court costs of just under $2 million, a fee Hudson
said he believed was ``appropriate.''
   Two former Hazeltine employees and a Teledyne Electonics employee
also pleaded guilty to lesser charges. They, too, are cooperating
with the government.
   The Pentagon said it is reviewing the guilty pleas and the
indictments to see what action should be taken.

<HEAD>Reagan `In Good Spirits' After Undergoing Hand Surgery</HEAD>

   President Reagan's doctors surgically corrected
a curvature of his left ring finger on Saturday and he was described
as being ``in good spirits'' after the 2{-hour operation.
   ``The president is comfortable and completed the operation with
flying colors,'' Reagan's doctor, Col. John Hutton, said in a
statement released by the White House.
   The operation was designed to alleviate a rather common but
deforming condition known as Dupuytren's Contracture. It caused the
president's finger to curve inward.
   Reagan's arm will be in a sling and his hand bandaged for several
days. He he will receive no special medication ``other than routine
post-operative antibiotics and analgesics,'' the statement said.
   ``It is anticipated that the president will have full use of his
finger,'' the statement added.
   Hutton said Reagan was ``alert and responsive'' throughout the
surgery, which began at 8:24 a.m. EST and was ``sucessfully
completed'' around 11 a.m. EST. ``His overall health is excellent,''
the physician said.
   ``He's in good spirits,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said following the surgery. Reagan returned to his hospital room
shortly after the procedure and was visited by his wife, Nancy, the
spokesman said.
   ``Today's procedure is not expected to interrupt the president's
normal work schedule,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said Reagan chatted with the team of physicians
throughout the procedure, talking about horses and his upcoming
return to California. Reagan returns to his home state on Jan. 20
after president-elect George Bush is inaugurated.
   Hutton reported that the president's doctors began administering
local anesthesia shortly after 7:30 a.m. to numb his arm and hand.
The procedure was conducted by a team of physicians at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center.
   Hutton said Reagan's operation consisted of a ``partial palmer
and digital fasciectomy. The disease extended from the wrist to the
tip of the ring finger.''
   Fitzwater explained that Reagan's finger was cut from his palm to
the tip of his finger and that the diseased tissue was removed in
order to allow the finger to move freely.
   The affliction causes the progressive, and usually painless,
contraction of the fingers and is due to a thickening of the tissue
called fascia in the palm of the hand.
   Dr. Robert J. Neviaser, chairman of the orthopedic surgery
department and director of the hand surgery service at George
Washington University Medical Center, said Dupuytren's Contraction
is a fairly common problem in men of Irish or Scottish ancestry.
Reagan is a descendent of Irish immigrants.
   Neviaser said doctors do not know exactly what causes the
affliction, which consists of ``a cellular activity that changes the
fascia, causing formation of bands and nodules. The skin becomes
thin over the fascia and the contraction of the fingers start.''
   To relieve the contraction, Neviaser said surgeons make an
incision over the area in the palm where a band of tissue has
formed. The fascia is carefully separated from the skin and removed.
The incision in the skin then is stitched back together.
   Neviaser, who is not involved in Reagan's operation, said only
the tissue directly involved with the finger contraction is removed.
   Although the procedure to remove the diseased tissue is
considered minor surgery and patients usually do not remain
overnight in the hospital, Reagan was to stay at Walter Reed until
Sunday as a precaution, Fitzwater said.
   The first lady was expected to stay overnight at the White House
but to go to the hospital to accompany her husband home.
   Upon entering the hospital just before noon, Mrs. Reagan nodded
``yes'' when asked if she had spoken with the president by
telephone, flashed a thumbs-up signal and said he was ``fine.''
   The contracture was minimal when Reagan took office in 1981 but
progressed enough during the past year to require surgical treatment.
   Untreated, the condition eventually may involve all four fingers
but the thumb, leaving the hand in a clenched, claw-like position.
   Fitzwater said Hutton did not expect any further surgery to be
necessary.
   After several days, the spokesman said, Reagan's splint will be
removed and he will only be required to wear a hand bandage. He will
wear a so-called ``dynamic'' splint for several months. It is a
splint that allows the finger to flex so that the muscles can be
strengthened, the spokesman said.
   Hutton said the physicians involved, besides himself, included
Dr. George Bogumill of Georgetown University and a consultant at
Walter Reed; Col. Alan Smith and Maj. Paul Perlik of the Hand
Service at Walter Reed.
   The anesthesiologist was Lt. Col Charles Gandy. Lt. Col. Lawrence
Mohr of the White House medical unit and members of the Department
of Medicine at Walter Reed took part as consultants, Hutton said.

<HEAD>New Year Brings Integration, Ending 36-Year-Old Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black and white students are in the same
public schools for the first time in St. Helena Parish, after
officials settled a 36-year-old integration lawsuit, the nation's
oldest.
   ``The biggest problem has been kids not finding their
classrooms,'' said Malcolm Mizell, one of two administrators sharing
responsibility for the new consolidated high school, after classes
began Friday.
   ``It's working smoother than anybody thought it would,'' agreed
Willie Johnson, the other co-supervisor. Mizell was principal at
all-white Greensburgh High School and Johnson was principal at Fifth
Ward Elementary, a predominantly black school.
   Although St. Helena Parish's high school students all are going
to class in what used to be Greensburg High, it will be next fall
before their classes are integrated, officials said. For this
semester, they have the same classmates and teachers they had when
the year began.
   Friday was the first day of class under an integration plan
proposed by the school board and approved Dec. 22 by U.S. District
Judge John Parker.
   Parker made his ruling settling the nation's oldest pending
desegregation lawsuit after two days of hearings, during which white
parents demonstration against consolidation and black parents
demonstrated for it.
   ``There is no question the St. Helena School Board has been
operating in violation of the Constitution of the United States,''
Parker said in his ruling. ``The board now has come with its own
proposal to consolidate all schools in the parish and this means
desegregation will be accomplished.
   ``In some areas, these schools are not fit for a doghouse,'' the
judge added.
   The suit was filed in 1952 by John Hall, whose 14 children all
attended black schools, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. That was even before the U.S. Supreme
Court's landmark ruling in the case of Brown vs. the Board of
Education of Topeka, Kan., that ruled that segregated schools are
inherently unequal.
   About 70 percent of the 2,040 children now in public school are
black, although the parish population is about 51 percent black. St.
Helena Parish is northeast of Baton Rouge, the state capital.
   The school board, saying it could no longer afford segregated
schools, combined seven schools into three _ one for kindergarten
through fourth-grade students, one for grades 5-8 and the high
school.
   ``Most of the adjustments are at the elementary school,'' said
Perry Spears, the parish's first black superintendent of schools and
one of only three black superintendents among Louisiana's 64 parish
(county) and two city school systems.
   The elementary level also was where most of the obvious problems
were. Kindergarten and the first four grades were consolidated at
what had been St. Helena Elementary _ a predominantly black school.
Three other elementary schools were closed, two for blacks and one
for whites.
   ``Why couldn't they have waited? I went into two classrooms and
neither have lights. They have wires all over,'' said Shirley
Blackwell, whose second- and fourth-grade sons had attended a closed
white school.
   Kindergarten teacher Kim Chadwick, who came from a closed school,
said her new classroom had no heat, one of her two windows wouldn't
open, there were no electrical outlets, painting was incomplete,
clothes racks weren't up, floors hadn't been cleaned and the play
area was so full of cars that recess was canceled.
   Spears said all of the parish's schools are substandard, but the
four closed schools were the worst.
   ``I think today is excellent for a start, and I expect to see
changes of attitudes in the next couple of days,'' the
superintendent said.
   Larry Self, a senior who had attended predominately black St.
Helena High, said there hadn't been any conflicts.
   ``I play basketball and that'll work out once we get to know each
other _ when we learn each other's moves,'' he said.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, on Monday I submit to Congress my final
budget. It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without
touching Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benefits to
the needy. And the best news is that this budget proves it can be
done without raising your taxes.
   Our growing economy will, in the next fiscal year, produce $84
billion in new revenues with no increase in tax rates. Since the
whole economic pie is expanding, the federal government's slice
grows along with the private sector. Raising taxes would be the
surest way to kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs. So
   I leave as I came, dead-set against any new taxes. And even if
there were a tax increase, history shows that Congress would almost
certainly spend the additional money, it couldn't be used to reduce
the deficit. It would just mean that you had to pay for an even
bigger government. And now, with an estimated $84 billion new
revenues coming in, we can both reduce the deficit and increase
federal spending.
   By combining new revenues with previously scheduled reductions
and savings in other areas, priority programs will grow by nearly
$50 billion. There are more funds for air safety, fighting crime,
housing the poor, and the war on drugs. Funds for AIDS research and
prevention is increased by 24 percent. And money to clean up toxic
waste goes up by a fifth. We also increase funds for the science and
space program, and for basic biomedical research. And student aid
funds are increased again, bringing it to a level 83 percent higher
than where it stood in 1980.
   Real defense spending is increased by 2 percent. This is a small
increase, but an important one _ the price of peace and security for
America. Through strength we achieved greater realism in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship and breakthroughs in arms reduction. Our
defense budget will enable us to continue on this path. Let's
remember that despite the internal reforms in the Soviet Union, they
are modernizing their weapons at a rapid pace, spending a far larger
share of Gross National Product on weapons than the United States
does.
   Spending on Medicare and Medicaid will increase by $10 billion in
the next fiscal year. But, if the past is any guide, the headlines
will claim we've actually cut funding. Well, ``t'ain't so.'' In
Washington, when spending goes up less than had been projected, they
call that a ``cut,'' even though more of your tax dollars are being
spent than ever before. With Medicare, we've simply limited the
increase in payments to providers of services. There is no effect on
the people who receive the benefits.
   So, my fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy, does not
raise taxes; and, by controlling the growth in spending, reduces the
deficit next year by nearly $70 billion. This not only meets the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction target, it reduces the
deficit even further and puts us on track to a balanced budget and a
modest surplus by fiscal year 1993. This budget is a realistic
program which protects the working families of America, provides
adequate support for those who depend on government, and helps
assure America's prosperity in the years to come.
   I've often spoken of the rising income Americans have enjoyed in
recent years, but one group lags behind. According to a new report
by the Bipartisan Commission on Federal Salaries, real pay for top
level government jobs has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 due to
inflation, while private sector pay has outpaced inflation. So, my
budget includes higher pay for vital positions ranging from judges
to scientists to elected officials. This increase is still less than
what was lost to inflation. Even after this raise, the real income
of a Circuit Court judge will be 19 percent less than in 1969.
   The cost of these increases will be absorbed in the budget
without slowing progress in the deficit, and we'll be getting
something important in return. When salaries are too low, it's hard
to attract and keep America's best in government. Federal judges are
leaving the bench in record numbers, partly because they're paid
less than junior members of law firms.
   The National Institutes of Health that fight cancer and other
grave diseases have vacancies for senior researchers that have been
empty for 10 years, due to poor pay. Also troubling is that some
officials, particularly in Congress, now supplement their income
with special interest honoraria payments. My support for the pay
increase rests on my firm belief that such payments undermine the
integrity of our government and should be abolished. We must be
willing to pay for excellence in government, or risk a government
run only by people of wealth, or by those beholden to special
interests.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Four Die in Battles between Rival Shiite Militiamen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four fighters were killed and 12 civilians
wounded in battles Saturday between rival Shiite Moslem militias in
west Beirut's bomb-scarred commercial district and south Lebanon, a
police spokesman said.
   An uneasy calm prevailed Saturday afternoon following the clashes
between the pro-Syrian Amal, which means Hope, and Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Three fighters were killed and eight people wounded in fierce
Beirut street battles, said the spokesman who cannot be named under
police rules.
   The two groups also dueled with howitzers and mortars 30 miles
southeast of Beirut, killing one combatant and wounding four people,
he said.
   The new casualties brought the casualty toll to 33 killed and 92
wounded the Dec. 31 outbreak of the latest round of violence between
the rival militias.
   Shell explosions accompanied by staccato bursts of machine-gun
fire echoed across Beirut through the night as Amal militiamen
launched hit-and-run attacks on Hezbollah positions near the western
edge of the civil war Green Line that divides the capital into
Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Hezbollah, according to the spokesman, responded by shelling
Amal-controlled districts of west Beirut to ``ease the pressure on
its fighters.''
   Syrian troops armed with AK-47 assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers moved into the disputed area
before dawn and enforced a cease-fire, the spokesman said.
   In south Lebanon's Iklim al-Tiffah, or Apple Province, Amal
gunners shelled Hezbollah fighters with howitzers in the villages of
Jbaa, Jarjou, Arab Saleem, Louwaizeh and Ein Bouswar on the
northwestern edge of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   The police spokesman said Hezbollah answered by shelling Amal's
supply lines.
   ``No change of positions was reported in the region. The fighting
died down early in the morning,'' he said.
   The Dec. 31 clash shattered a Syrian-brokered cease-fire. The
Nov. 27 cease-fire ended six days of Amal-Hezbollah fighting in
which 40 people were killed and 87 wounded.
   For more than nine months, the two factions have been fighting
for dominance of the 1 million Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest
sect.
   Amal flushed Hezbollah out of most of south Lebanon in a four-day
crackdown in April that killed 62 people and wounded 150.
   The militias fought a fierce 22-day battle in the slums of south
Beirut in May, killing 286 people and wounding 972 by police count.
That confrontation also ended with Syrian intervention.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's radio address Saturday, given by House Speaker
Jim Wright of Texas:
   Good afternoon. This is Jim Wright. In 13 days, President Reagan
will complete his eight years as our nation's chief executive. I
know I speak for all Americans in wishing for Mr. Reagan the
blessings of health and happiness, as much rest as he wants and as
much work as he wants, and a full and productive life in his
retirement. For President-elect Bush, all of us wish success in his
mighty endeavor _ the strength, the vision, courage and ability
required in that most important office on Earth, and the finest
blessings of God.
   Let us work as Americans to begin the new year in a cooperative
spirit. In a nation where free men and women think for themselves,
unanimity is never possible; it probably isn't even desirable. But
when we let the larger things that unite us transcend the lesser
concerns that divide us, our nation can achieve the basic unity
essential in dealing with foreign countries.
   As a spokesman for the loyal opposition and leader of the House
of Representatives, one who has often disagreed with the domestic
priorities of the Reagan administration, I want to express thanks as
an American to this administration for improving relations with the
Soviet Union, for helping to abate the crisis in the Persian Gulf,
and for encouraging the growth and sustenance of political freedom
in countries throughout the world.
   In most areas of our foreign policy, the Congress and the
administration have worked together. The only exceptions were how to
deal with South Africa and with Nicaragua. During the new
administration, I earnestly hope that we will be able to achieve
true bipartisanship in every area of our foreign policy, and I
pledge to President-elect Bush the unstinting cooperation of the
congressional leadership in seeking that end.
   On the domestic front, our nation struggles to overcome three
deficits: the budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the social
deficit, caused by the growing difficulty for average Americans in
trying to pay for such basic necessities as housing, higher
education and health care. Now we cannot expect to vanquish those
evils entirely in this coming year. But if we have the will, we can
make significant progress against all three deficits. Both of our
political parties are publicly committed to doing so.
   By working together, we can help our new president fulfill his
announced promise of a ``kinder, gentler'' America. We in the House
leadership are eager to help him attain his announced goals of wider
access for all Americans to education, to child care, to affordable
housing, and to a cleaner environment. Working together, we can
remove the scourge of drugs from our streets and from our schools.
We have made significant progress in this bipartisan goal. Let us
work together now for full funding to make our pledge a reality.
Working together, we can pass a clean air bill this year. Let's make
that one of our objectives.
   By working together, we can clean up the murky areas of campaign
financing, broaden the base of small individual contributors and
reduce the influence of special interests. This deserves our
commitment, and I now invite a joint commitment.
   By working together, we can steadily reduce and eventually
eliminate the annual budget deficits that threaten our economic
future. Both Democrats and Republicans made contributions last year
to landmark trade legislation. Let us not abandon that effort until
America attains the objective of a revived industrial base.
   This is going to be a very busy and productive year in Congress.
I am determined that as far as the speaker can influence the
schedule, we're going to perform our work on time. As we did last
year, the House will pass all of our regular appropriations bills
before the beginning of the August recess.
   Now we in Congress hope that the next administration, together
with us, will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings
between the Legislative and Executive branches of government.
America faces daunting challenges, but by working together, we can
assure that America's future will shine just as brightly as our past.
   Thank you for listening, and good afternoon.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged more than
140 nations Saturday to keep chemical weapons technology out of
terrorists' hands, and he took steps to smooth relations with West
Germany over a Libyan plant said to be developing poison gas.
   Addressing delegates at UNESCO headquarters, Shultz lamented
``the dangerous spread and resurgent use of one of humanity's most
dreaded and dreadful forms of warfare.''
   He urged the imposition of U.N. sanctions against countries
violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning use of chemical weapons.
He said the U.N. secretary-general should be armed with broad powers
to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in wartime.
   Shultz said the past quarter century has seen the erosion of
``international norms'' in the Middle East, Southeast Asia,
Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.
   This, he said, was ``a dangerous step backwards for mankind, for
reason, for civilization.''
   Shultz did not single out any country by name, but it was clear
Libya was one of his targets.
   ``Some governments, which have been known to sponsor terrorism
now have sizable chemical weapons capabilities,'' he said. Libya is
on the State Department's list of nations sponsoring terrorism.
   Despite a tacit ground rule against name calling at the
conference, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran made a
vitriolic attack on Iraq for using chemical weapons in the Persian
Gulf war. Velayati demanded to know whether Iraq would be cited in
the conference's final communique.
   The war, the most recent verified use of chemical arms, was
obliquely referred to by other speakers. Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas of France reminded delegates that ``high quality'' discussion
was needed for a successful congress.
   Outside the conference hall, Shultz made arrangements with West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher for the United States
to present evidence in Washington supporting allegations that West
German firms are involved in building a plant in Libya that will
produce chemical weapons.
   ``We will do everything in our power to prevent German nationals
and German companies from cooperating in a foreign country in
chemical weapons production,'' Genscher said.
   West Germany has insisted there is no hard evidence of German
involvement in the plant at Rabta, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli,
which Libya says will produce pharmaceuticals. A spokesman for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl complained Friday of a ``campaign in the U.S.
media'' against West Germany.
   Shultz said he was certain the West Germans were approaching the
problem with ``great seriousness'' and ``if they find there is a
need for adjustments in their legal framework, they will do that.''
   He referred to export controls on technology transfers that some
U.S. officials said failed to keep sensitive technology out of
Libya's hands.
   The five-day conference at the headquarters of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is aimed at giving
renewed political impetus to negotiations that have been going on
nearly two decades in Geneva. Negotiators are seeking a convention
banning the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use
of chemical arms.
   ``The time has come to take concerted political action at a high
level,'' U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the
conference. ``All nations large and small have an equal interest in
working for a world without chemical weapons.''
   The deliberations were delayed for a minute's silent tribute to
Emperor Hirohito of Japan, whose 62-year reign ended with his death
Saturday at age 87.
   The U.S. dispute with Libya over the Rabta plant tended to
overshadow the gathering of foreign ministers and ambassadors from
more than 140 nations.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, on his arrival
Friday, said, ``Without proof, no government has the right to
present such accusations'' as those the United States has made
against Libya.
   He also complained that the U.S. downing of two Libyan planes
over the Mediterranean on Wednesday ``poisons the atmosphere'' for
the conference.
   In his speech, Shultz said terrorists' access to chemical and
biological weapons poses a growing threat to the world.
   He urged delegates ``to join me in committing our governments not
only to prevent the use of chemical weapons in armed conflict, but
also to prevent the spread of chemical weapons to terrorist groups.''
   He renewed a U.S. pledge to observe the 1925 protocol, signed by
118 countries, and said nations possessing chemical weapons should
join in ``preventing these weapons from spreading and being used
....''
   Only the United States and the Soviet Union have acknowledged
manufacturing and storing arsenals of chemical weapons.
President-elect George Bush has vowed to seek an international ban
on production provided it can be verified.
   The Soviets two years ago announced sharp reductions in their
stockpiles.
   Officials stress that the conference's final communique, to be
issued Wednesday, is political in nature, and that binding
agreements must come from Geneva. Negotiations in Geneva are due to
resume next month at a 40-nation disarmament conference.

<HEAD>Vietnam Hails Withdrawal Of Its Troops from Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after its forces marched into
Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh, Vietnam on Saturday hailed the
planned withdrawal of its remaining 50,000 troops.
   The Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan praised the
pullout as ``a convincing proof of the steady growth of the People's
Republic of Kampuchea,'' or Cambodia.
   Cambodia's government was installed Jan. 7, 1979, when Hanoi's
troops ousted the communist Khmer Rouge from power.
   In a speech Friday marking his government's decade in power,
President Heng Samrin of Cambodia announced Vietnam would withdraw
all its remaining forces by September if a political settlement to
the Cambodian war is reached.
   Vietnam has repeatedly pledged to withdraw the troops earlier
than its original target date of 1990, but it had not previously set
a date.
   The Vietnamese newspaper said the decision, made jointly by the
two countries, is a ``new testimony to good will and determination
to achieve an equitable solution.''
   The anniversary celebrations began Friday with speeches by
Cambodian and Vietnamese leaders. In Phnom Penh, public buildings
had been painted and streets swept clean.
   Nguyen van Linh, general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party,
said Friday the total withdrawal ``must be undertaken simultaneously
with the cessation of foreign military aid to all Cambodian sides
and of the use of foreign territory as sanctuary against the
Cambodian people.''
   Heng Samrin said his government hopes other countries will keep
promises to end aid and sanctuary to the Khmer Rouge and two other
non-communist guerrilla groups. Such promises have been made by
China, which arms the guerrillas, and by Thailand, which gives them
territory for bases.
   ``These agreements must be carried out under effective
international supervision,'' the president said.
   Resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk was quoted as saying,
however, that Vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are false, that
peace talks have failed and that Cambodia's future can be settled
only by continued fighting.
   Vietnam's announced intention to withdraw its troops has raised
fears that the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of the resistance
groups, would seize power again.
   Vietnam, which initially had an estimated 200,000 troops in
Cambodia, claims to have made annual withdrawals since 1982. It says
the largest came in 1988, when all advisers and 50,000 soldiers
returned home.

   Bjorn Borg, known for the silent,
determined style he displayed in winning five Wimbledon titles from
1976-80, plans to marry a colorful, Italian rock star, according to
published reports.
   Swedish newspapers reported Saturday that the 32-year-old Swede
will marry Italian singer Loredana Berte on Feb. 26 in Milan.
   The Aftonbladet daily said Borg had asked Loredana, a 38-year-old
rock star known for her wild and explicit stage appearances, several
times to become his wife before she agreed last December.
   ``Now Bjorn comes first and my career second,'' Loredana told the
newspaper Expressen. ``I am here in Sweden because I am in love, for
the rest of my life.''
   Borg, who has retired from active competition, earlier was
married to Romanian-born tennis player Mariana Simionescu. In 1984,
he met Jannike Bjorling, then 17 years old. She gave birth to their
son, Robin, a year later. They lived together until 1987.

   President Reagan takes his last shot at
ordering national priorities when he sends Congress his final
budget, a $1.15 trillion spending plan that purports to cut the
federal deficit to the lowest level of his administration while
keeping taxes at their present level.
   Sounding many of the president's favorite conservative themes,
the budget being laid out Monday will propose eliminating 82
government programs while protecting his defense buildup and
recommending a big increase in spending for the space-based nuclear
shield known as Star Wars.
   ``I leave as I came _ dead set against any new taxes,'' Reagan
said Saturday in his weekly radio address.
   ``It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching
Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benfits to the
needy,'' Reagan said.
   ``And the best news is that this budget proves it can be done
without raising your taxes. Raising taxes would be the surest way to
kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs,'' Reagan said.
   The budget also will address two of the government's most
pressing problems: the costly bailout of the savings and loan
industry and the cleanup of contaminated nuclear weapons production
facilities.
   Reagan's budgets often have been declared dead on arrival by
skeptical members of Congress and the new document is being branded
as even more irrelevant since President-elect Bush can rewrite the
whole thing if he chooses to after he takes office Jan. 20.
   ``I think we'll pay very little attention to the Reagan budget
and really focus on what's coming from Bush,'' said Sen. James
Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   But Reagan's budget director, Joseph Wright, insists the Reagan
budget will serve as an excellent starting point for the new
administration. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill agree.
   ``It will be a tough, classic Reagan budget,'' said Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee. ``It proves that even with an increase in defense you can
reach the deficit targets without higher taxes.''
   Like Bush, Reagan does not favor any new taxes and the Reagan
budget leaves Social Security untouched, something Bush also has
pledged to do.
   Reagan's budget for fiscal 1990, which begins next Oct. 1, calls
for a deficit of $92.5 billion. If that projection holds true, it
would be the smallest deficit of the Reagan era. The deficit was
$73.7 billion in fiscal 1981, but that figure resulted from policies
put in place by Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter. In fiscal 1982,
the first budget year for which Reagan bore responsibility, the
deficit rose to $127.9 billion and has been higher than that in each
subsequent year. Technically, Carter also submitted the 1982 budget
before he left office in January of 1981, but it was the Reagan
administration that dealt with Congress in shaping the final 1982
spending plan.
   Reagan has called the string of deficits, which hit a record of
$221 billion in 1986, his biggest disappointment while in office. In
a speech last month, Reagan said the deficits, which have almost
tripled the national debt during his presidency, were the fault of
an ``iron triangle.'' This alliance among Congress, the news media
and special interest groups frustrated his attempts to bring
spending under control, Reagan said.
   Sources who spoke on condition they not be identified by name
said the final Reagan budget will seek to abolish the Interstate
Commerce Commission, reduce subsidies for the Amtrak railroad
passenger service and ``privatize'' some of the regional power
authorities, all ideas Reagan has pushed without success for years.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said none of the more
than 80 program eliminations being sought will surprise anyone.
   ``We have talked about eliminating these programs for eight years
and have not been able to do it,'' he said.
   Reagan also will seek to save about $5 billion by slowing the
growth of Medicare, the program that provides health care for 33
million elderly and disabled Social Security recipients. The
reductions would not mean higher out-of-pocket costs for patients
but would come from reducing payments to doctors and hospitals.
   In addition, the administration is seeking savings of $1.1
billion in the Medicaid program which pays the health costs of poor
people.
   Some areas will be in line for spending increases under the
Reagan budget. Reagan will propose boosting defense spending
authority to $306 billion, representing a 2 percent increase over
the rate of inflation, something that Bush and Congress are likely
to scale back. The Reagan proposal will seek about a 50 percent
increase in spending on the Star Wars nuclear shield.
   Also in line for spending increases will be AIDS research,
modernization of the nation's air control system and more funds for
orbiting a manned space station.
   Reagan will seek a $900 million increase in cleanup and upgrading
of the nation's nuclear arms plants and will propose spending around
$10 billion in 1990 on the cost of closing or merging hundreds of
failed savings and loan institutions.
   The budget also will call for a 50 percent pay increase for
members of Congress and other top federal officials.
   If current government programs underwent no changes except to
take the cost of inflation into account, the federal deficit would
be $127 billion in 1990, the administration estimates.
   The deficit for the current fiscal year is projected to be $155
billion, the same as the deficit in the 1988 fiscal year, which
ended on Sept. 30.
   The administration's projected $92.5 billion deficit would more
than meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $100 billion for 1990.
The law sets deficit targets for each year leading to a balanced
budget in 1993.
   In addition to spending cuts, the budget proposes to raise $6
billion from the sale of government assets, including two naval
petroleum reserves and a package of government loans held by the
public.
   The administration's projection of meeting the Gramm-Rudman
deficit target depends on a set of economic assumptions that many
private economists consider too optimistic.
   ``I think Reagan's final budget is going to give us Rosy
Scenario's older sister _ Pie in the Sky,'' said Gary Best, head of
OMB Watch, a non-partisan group that monitors the Office of
Management and Budget.
   By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office is predicting the
deficit in 1990 will hit $141 billion.
   The CBO expects the economy, as measured by the gross national
product, will expand 2.9 percent this year, compared to an
administration forecast of 3.2 percent economic growth.
   The difference in economic assumptions is even greater in the
years beyond 1990 with the CBO projecting sluggish growth of around
2.2 percent each year through 1994, a full percentage point below
the administration's assumptions.
   Where the administration sees the budget deficit shrinking to
only $9 billion by 1994, even without any spending cuts or tax
increases, the CBO forecast, reflecting its slower growth estimates,
puts the deficit that year at $122 billion.
   Bush is expected to adopt the administration's economic
projections when he submits his own spending proposals to Congress
in two or three weeks. Bush has said he will set forth his ideas of
attacking the budget deficit at a joint session of Congress shortly
after he takes office Jan. 20.

   Troops shot and wounded 14 Palestinians on
Saturday in the occupied lands, including a teen-age girl shot in
the head and critically wounded during a clash in the West Bank,
Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   Hospital officials also reported that assailants stabbed to death
an Arab village leader suspected of collaborating with the Israelis.
But a military spokesman linked the slaying to rivalries between
Arabs.
   Protests erupted Saturday in the area of Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, where troops shot and wounded four protesters,
including the 16-year-old girl, hospital officials said.
   In another incident in Nablus, dozens of Palestinian women held
an illegal march and raised Palestinian flags, an Arab reporter
said. He said soldiers forced the women to disperse without opening
fire.
   Two protesters were shot and wounded in a clash in Bani Naim, a
village in the West Bank, Israel Radio said.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded at least eight
protesters who hurled rocks at them in the town of Rafah and at two
refugee camps. Among the wounded was a 7-year-old boy, Arab reports
and hospital officials said.
   A military spokesman said three Arabs were wounded in the West
Bank, but he gave no other details.
   The village leader, Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah, was stabbed to
death late Friday when an angry mob attacked his home in Qubeiba,
seven miles northwest of Jerusalem, acccordign to Israel Radio.
Hamoudah's two sons, both in their 20s, were injured in the attack,
the report said.
   Hamoudah, 57, died Friday in a Ramallah hospital, hospital
officials said.
   A military spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Hamoudah's death was connected to rivalries between Arab clans.
Hamoudah was the mukhtar, or traditional leader of Qubeiba.
   More than a dozen Palestinian collaborators have been killed by
fellow Arabs during the nearly 13-month-long Palestinian uprising.
   Last week, death threats were made against the mayor of
Bethlehem, Elias Freij, for proposing a cease-fire in the uprising
that has claimed the lives of 347 Palestinians and 14 Israelis.
   Also last week, a 25-year-old man from Jerico suspected of
cooperating with Israel was slain in the West Bank.
   Pro-Syrian Palestinian factions have been calling for the
elimination of the traditional leadership in the occupied
territories to make way for more radical leaders, according to
reports in Palestinian newspapers.

<HEAD>Creator of TV's `Roseanne' Leaves Show After Tension With The Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top producer of the popular ABC television
comedy series ``Roseanne'' has left the show citing ``creative
tensions'' with the star, comedian Roseanne Barr, the show's
publicist said.
   Matt Williams, one of three executive producers of the most
successful program of this fall's television season, walked off the
show late Friday, publicist David Brokaw said in a statement.
   The statement said the tensions were ``between the executive
producers and Roseanne Barr.'' Williams was the only executive
producer to leave.
   ``Roseanne,'' which stars the sarcastic comedian as a middle
American housewife and mother who works at a factory, has
consistently been a hit with viewers. For the past two weeks, it has
beat out ``The Cosby Show'' for the No. 1 spot in the Nielsen
ratings.
   The remaining executive producers, Marcy Carcey and Tom Werner,
said in a statement that Barr was given creative control over her
own character, and that her insight into working women and
housewives is what appealed to the general public.
   Calls seeking comment from Barr placed to Brokaw's office and to
ABC Entertainment went unanswered Saturday.

   Here is the text of the statement issued
Saturday by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on President
Reagan's surgery:
   President Reagan's operation to repair a Dupuytren's Contracture
of the ring finger of his left hand was successfully completed at
approximately 11:00 this morning, Jan. 7, 1989, at the Walter Reed
Army Medical Center.
   The procedure commenced at 7:30 a.m. and was performed under
regional anesthesia. A general anesthesia was not necessary. The
president was alert and responsive throughout the operation,
discussing various aspects of the procedure with doctors. His is now
recovering in his room, and is in good spirits.
   The president's physician, Dr. John E. Hutton, Colonel, U.S.
Army, reports that, ``The president is comfortable and completed the
operation with flying colors. He was alert and responsive throughout
the process. His overall health is excellent.''
   Dr. Hutton said, ``The operation consisted of a partial palmer
and digital fasciectomy. The disease extended from the wrist to the
tip of the ring finger.''
   President Reagan will remain at Walter Reed tonight and return to
the White House at his convenience on Sunday, Jan. 8.
   Today's procedure is not expected to interrupt the president's
normal work schedule, other than the obvious presence of a dressing
on the left hand. The president will be receiving no special
medication other than routine post-operative antibiotics and
analgesic as necessary. The president's arm will be bandaged and in
a sling for a few days. After that, only a hand bandage will be
required. The finger will require a ``dynamic'' splint for several
months to ensure corrective healing.
   Dr. Hutton indicates that no further surgery should be necessary.
It is anticipated that the president will have full use of his
finger.
   The physicians involved were Dr. George Bogumill of Georgetown
University and consultant at Walter Reed; Col. Alan Smith and Maj.
Paul Perlik of the Hand Service at Walter Reed, and Col. John E.
Hutton, Jr. Physician to the president. Lt. Col Charles Gandy
performed the regional anesthesia. Dr. Marc Hahn assisted Dr. Gandy.
Medical consultation was provided by Lt. Col. Lawrence Mohr of the
White House medical unit and members of the Department of Medicine
at Walter Reed.

<TEXT>
   Troops backed by helicopter
gunships Saturday stormed a military garrison held by dissident
police officers, ending a three-day standoff in which a general and
16 others were killed.
   Military officials said they believed all the dissident officers
were killed when troops attacked the Philippine Constabulary
regional headquarters in Zamboanga, about 500 miles south of Manila.
   Soldiers secured the camp Saturday afternoon after nearly 24
hours of sporadic fighting with the gunmen holed up inside,
according to Gen. Renato de Villa, the country's military chief of
staff.
   The seaside garrison was seized Thursday by eight police officers
who had been fired from their jobs and ordered held in connection
with a murder investigation. The eight, along with about five of
their supporters, took hostage the garrison commander and his chief
of staff.
   On Friday, scores of armed men, some of whom may have been
soldiers, slipped into the headquarters building to join the
captors, officials said.
   Troops stormed the garrison Friday but withdrew under heavy fire.
   On Saturday, the soldiers fired rifles and automatic weapons at
the headquarters and nearby buildings held by the dissidents.
   Troops began their final assault after two military helicopters
strafed the compound with machine guns and another helicopter fired
four rockets, setting the two-story headquarters building on fire.
   Armored personnel carriers provided cover fire as soldiers swept
through the compound, using tear gas to flush out snipers.
   Since the fighting began Thursday, eight soldiers and two
civilians have been wounded, officials said.
   The police officers had demanded to be flown to Siasi Island, 125
miles southwest of Zamboanga. Officials offered to fly them to
another island if they could prove one of the hostages, Brig. Gen.
Eduardo Batalla, was alive.
   Officials launched an attack on the garrison after they learned
that Batalla and the second hostage, Col. Romeo Abendan, had been
slain by the captors.
   De Villa said 16 bodies, many mutilated and burned beyond
recognition, were found in the headquarters building and around the
mosque. He said the bodies of Batalla and Abendan were tentatively
identified.
   The eight police officers, led by Patrolman Rizal Alih, took the
general hostage after he dismissed them from the police force and
ordered them held for an investigation into the 1984 killing of
seven people, authorities said.
   Alih had been charged in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor Cesar
Climaco of Zamboanga but was acquitted. Three weeks after Climaco's
death, seven people were killed in a raid on Alih's home.
    Last month, Batalla received permission to arrest Alih and the
other police officers, all of whom faced possible charges of murder
or conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the 1984 raid.
   De Villa said investigators were uncertain whether Alih's body
had been found among those who died at the garrison.
   Maj. Gen. Manuel Cacanando, the southern regional commander, said
a 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew would be imposed for several days in
Zamboanga to allow tension to ease and military reinforcements would
be deployed.

   Under all the glitz at Saturday's opening of the
North American International Auto Show are 700 cars and trucks
showing that rounded shapes have taken charge and the rolling box is
becoming a thing of the past.
   ``It's obvious that everyone is hitting the aerodynamics heavy,''
Ron Dalton of Ann Arbor said looking over the displays at the show,
which runs through Jan. 15.
   ``Just look at the Cadillacs,'' said Dalton, who added he prefers
Fords. ``They're starting to soften the lines even on the big ones.
They aren't bulky boxes anymore.''
   Automakers talk a lot about performance, suspension and safety,
but most American car shoppers look for other things, said analyst
Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   ``People buy cars for three reasons: price, looks and
reliability,'' he said.
   And appearance is what an auto show is all about. There are no
test drives and some of the cars can't even be touched.
   There are new versions of old cars, like the Oldsmobile Cutlass
series, and completely new cars, like the Ford Thunderbird and
Mercury Cougar. There are traditional luxury cars, like Cadillac and
Mercedes-Benz. And there are high-powered sports cars, like Jaguar
and a new Corvette.
   There are two new imported luxury car lines at the show _
Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti _ which won't be in showrooms
until next fall.
   A common thread is exterior design.
   The lines between the roofs and windshields and doors are barely
noticeable. Rear windows flow smoothly into trunk lids, and
redesigned under-door panels add to a sleeker appearance.
   Smooth design also moved into the popular minivan segment, in
General Motors Corp.'s new line of plastic-body, all-purpose
vehicles for 1990, including the Pontiac Trans Sport, the Oldsmobile
Silhouette and the Chevrolet Lumina.
   ``I think that they are going to be dynamite vehicles,'' Glantz
said. ``There are a lot of advantages to having a plastic body _ you
don't have a rust problem and it resists minor dings.
   ``And some people just want to have something new-looking,'' he
added.
   ``Will an Oldsmobile buyer like it? That's a pretty traditional
buyer,'' Glantz said. ``But I tell you, the Pontiac buyer will love
it.''
   While watching a white Trans Sport revolve slowly on a turntable
at the show, Cheryl Boily of Windsor, Ontario, said, ``It's
definitely different.
   ``It looks like a jet,'' she added, saying she and he fiance are
looking seriously at minivans.
   The changes in design toward smoother cars is due in large part
to changes in manufacturing and engineering technology, along with
new materials.
   ``What's feasible to manufacturers continues to expand,'' said
analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York.
   ``Part of it is the (metal) stamping equipment,'' Glantz said.
``In the golden age of U.S. car design, we used thick steel with
very generous curves. It didn't fit very well.
   ``We went to simpler dies and less handwork and thinner steel and
that evolved into a boxier-looking car,'' he said. ``It's more
sophisticated engineering, you have to have much more precise dies.''
   Standing beside a maroon Audi 200 at the show were Kevin and Sue
Burt of Westland. ``The first thing that strikes me about the car is
the outside,'' Sue Burt said.
   ``It's the silhouette,'' she added, ``I don't like boxy cars.''

<HEAD>Jordan Upgrades Palestinian Mission To Embassy Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women sang and men cheered Saturday after
Jordan upgraded the PLO mission to an embassy and Yasser Arafat
hoisted the Palestinian flag over the building.
   China and Qatar also announced Saturday they would upgrade PLO
missions to embassies. The actions were seen as bolstering the PLO
chairman's Middle East peace initiative and demand for an
independent Palestinian state.
   Arafat waded through a crowd in Amman to raise the black, red,
white and green Palestinian banner in front of the Palestine
National Council headquarters that will apparently serve as the PLO
embassy in Amman. Prime Minister Zaid Rifai raised the Jordanian
banner next to the PLO flag.
   Eight states, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq and
the United Arab Emirates, now have granted the PLO embassies.
   About 70 countries have recognized the Palestinian state
proclaimed in November by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament in exile. The boundaries of the state sought for
Palestinians have not been defined, but PLO officials say it would
roughly encompass the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat told reporters Jordan's decision to upgrade the embassy
was ``true and strong support for the Palestinian cause, toward
retrieving Jerusalem so that we can raise these two flags on the
walls of Jerusalem once again.''
   He said no Palestinian ambassador to Jordan had been named.
   China's Xinhua news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying the PLO mission would be upgraded there to strengthen
friendly relations between the Chinese and Palestinian people.
   China, long a PLO supporter, is one of the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council. Arabs want the five to oversee
Arab-Israeli peace talks at an international conference.
   Qatar's Foreign Ministry said its decision to grant embassy
status to the PLO was due to the gulf state's desire to ``bolster
the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, especially
their right to self-determination and establishing their independent
state on their national soil.''
   The clandestine leadership of the 13-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday issued a
communique calling on European countries to upgrade PLO offices in
their capitals and urging the United States to recognize the
Palestinian state.
   France has raised the PLO's status in Paris to that of ``general
delegation'' _ a step short of diplomatic recognition.
   Arafat met with King Hussein and Rifai on Saturday.
   Petra, the official Jordanian news agency, said Hussein expressed
``unlimited support for Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian brethren and
their just cause ... and support for the PLO in every way until the
Palestinian people achieve their goal'' of an independent homeland.
   Arafat said discussions covered ``ways of reaching a fair and
comprehensive peace'' with Israel and ``the importance of holding an
Arab summit to extend support to the Palestinian position and
advance the efforts of Arab unity.''

   A teen-age girl robbed a disabled
86-year-old man of his Social Security benefits, then threw his
artificial legs out of his reach so he could not pursue her, police
said.
   Alex Williams of Youngstown was sleeping at 2 a.m. Friday when
awakened by a girl he recognized as having robbed him two years
earlier, said Youngstown police Lt. Edward Zaccone.
   ``The girl removed his pants from him, (and) threw his two
artificial legs across the room,'' Zaccone said. The robber then
took $800 from Williams' wallet, he said. Williams was not injured.
   The suspect, a 15-year-old girl whom police did not identify, was
at large Saturday, Zaccone said.
   ``This is terrible,'' said Williams, a retired produce worker.
``Now I'm broke and can't pay my bills.''

<TEXT>
   Students and their parents increased pressure
Saturday on the teachers union and the school board to end the
city's first teachers strike.
   Several people picketed in front of the home of school
superintendent Conrad Ott on Saturday morning, urging the board and
the union to resume negotiations which broke off Wednesday, when the
strike began.
   The strike by 2,000 teachers, chiefly over salary and student
discipline issues, has left some 34,000 students out of school. The
teachers have worked without a contract since July 1.
   Ott was not home Saturday, but his wife, Jeanne, said about 20
pickets gathered for a short time in front of their home. She said
pickets carried signs that asked for negotiations to be resumed and
the schools to be reopened.
   ``It's getting to where these people are saying `a plague on both
your houses,''' said Sam Salem, a 17-year member of the school board
and chairman of its finance committee.
   ``Some people are mad at the school board, some are mad at the
union and a lot of them are fed up with both,'' he said.
   Students also picketed Friday outside school buildings and school
board offices demanding a speedy resolution to the dispute.
   No formal talks were held Friday. Federal mediator David Thorley
said he hoped negotiations might resume Sunday. But Louis B. Trenta,
a chief negotiator for the school board, said Saturday he had not
heard of new talks.
   Union leaders met Saturday afternoon with the teachers in an
Akron church to brief them on the status of the strike and were not
immediately available for comment.

<HEAD>17-Year-Old Suspected In Baby Shooting During Sitter's Drug Buy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy is being sought in the
wounding of a 1-year-old child who was shot as his baby sitter was
cruising for a drug buy, police said.
   An arrest warrant was issued Friday for Sedrick Latroy McKinney,
the suspect in the Dec. 27 shooting of the baby, said Sgt. Wiley
Howell, a police spokesman.
   The warrant charges McKinney with attempted first-degree murder
of Sebastian Placker and attempted armed robbery of his baby sitter,
Theresa Charlene Robertson, 30.
   The child has been listed in guarded condition at St. Joseph's
Hospital most of the time since he arrived with a bullet in his
spine. Doctors believe it may have left him partially paralyzed.
   The baby was in the back seat of Ms. Robertson's car when she
went to buy crack cocaine, investigators said. A gunman believed to
be McKinney tried to grab an imitation gold necklace from Ms.
Robertson, then fired a single shot into the car, hitting the baby.
   ``We've tried to arrest him numerous times. He keeps evading
us,'' Howell said. ``We hope that by publicizing his photograph
someone who might see him would call the department.''
   Ms. Robertson was arrested the day after the shooting on a
warrant stemming from cocaine possession charges but does not face
charges in the shooting, authorities said. She was released from
jail on probation Thursday.

<HEAD>Long Waits for City's First Pollution Checks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drivers trying to get their cars checked
before an anti-smog crackdown begins say they have waited in line
for hours and even days for the five-minute inspection.
   ``I've come four times so far,'' Jose Reyes said heatedly as he
got out of his battered white 1976 Rambler at one of the 32
governmen stations. ``Now I'm plain nervous.''
   The government and environmentalists say Mexico City's 3 million
vehicles account for 80 percent of its pollution, which regularly
exceeds maximum acceptable levels for ozone.
   Starting Monday, the city says cars visibly contaminating the air
will be stopped. Fines equal to 20 days' minimum wage, or about $76,
go into effect for violators Feb. 1, even if they have a sticker
certifying their cars are smog-free.
   To obtain a sticker, a driver must pass muster at one of the
inspection stations set up across the city. Inspections are free
until Feb. 1. After that, they'll cost about $3.80 _ the equivalent
of one day's mininum wage.
   Reyes said Thursday he had waited from just after midnight until
4 p.m. and had yet to get his inspection. He said he came in at 4
a.m. another day and found too many already in line.
   At a larger station, drivers said they had been in line only 30
minutes, but longer waits seemed to be the rule.
   At a parking lot in the south part of the city, 160 cars were in
line at 10 p.m. one night for the next day's scheduled 9 a.m.
opening, already more than the station could handle in a day.
   Miguel Angel Martinez said he was given a March 4 appointment at
the La Viga station in south-central Mexico City. ``I'd be in
violation by then,'' he said.
   A few drivers said some stations were issuing stickers in
exchange for bribes when cars failed the test.
   Adela Rodriguez said her car failed its first check, but the
inspector tried to sell her a sticker for $17.50. She offered him
$11, but he turned it down. Her car passed a later inspection.
   Eduardo Rodriguez, waiting in line with his '78 Dodge, said a
similar thing happened to a friend who's a chauffer and took some
company cars to a station. ``According to them, they weren't
properly tuned and they charged 20,000 pesos ($8.75) for the
sticker,'' Rodriguez said.
   Newspaper reports said places in line were selling for up to
20,000 pesos. Responding to complaints, Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis
on Friday urged citizens to report incidents of corruption to city
officials.
   Taking action against pollution is good, ``but I'd like to see
one of those buses come in here,'' Rodriguez said, watching a yellow
and brown city bus as it trailed a stream of black smoke from the
pipe on its roof.
   The testing so far is required only of private vehicles, which
account for 80 percent of Mexico City's vehicles. In 1987, private
cars carried only 18 percnt of 25 million daily passenger trips,
according to official figures. Subway, buses, trolleys, light trains
and taxis provided the other transportation.
   At the parking lot where Reyes was waiting, drivers had taken
matters into their own hands.
   Vilma Romero, a young volunteer, wrote license numbers on a
waiting list for the first available appointment time, eight days
later. She told drivers to come two days ahead to confirm the date
and the next day to pick up a number.
   The plan included leaving cars in line overnight to assure their
position. A guard was being paid about 45 cents apiece to watch
them, but some drivers said they were staying anyway.
   Heated arguments resulted when newcomers tried to jump the line.
   Reyes complained there was one mobile unit instead of two and it
didn't open on time.
   ``There's nothing of what they have promised,'' he said. ``The
people are obeying all the orders. Why don't they do their part?''

   Band leader Xavier Cugat was responding
favorably Saturday to treatment for a lung inflammation but remained
in intensive care, a clinic spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman said the 89-year-old Spanish-born musician may be
moved to a regular room in Quiron Clinic in the next few days if he
continues to improve. His condition was stable Saturday, according
to the spokeswoman, who declined to be identified.
   Friends rushed Cugat to the clinic Friday for treatment of
``severe lung inflammation and high blood pressure,'' said his
physician, Dr. Jordi Rius.
   Cugat has suffered four heart attacks and a stroke since 1980. In
1987, he was twice treated for lung congestion.
   Born Jan. 1, 1900, in the northeastern Catalonian town of Gerona,
Cugat is credited with introducing tropical rhythms into American
dance music.
   When he was 4, he and his family left for Cuba, where he became a
violinist.
   After limited success in New York as a classical violinist, he
began playing Latin American rhythmic music with several bands
before organizing his own. Cugat became a star with his band in the
1930s playing Latin dance music in Los Angeles and later at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
   In 1970 he turned over his band to Tito Puente, and a decade
later returned to live in Barcelona.

<TEXT>
   Sikh militants shot and killed 14 Hindus
in Punjab state, apparently to avenge the execution of two Sikhs
convicted in the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,
police said Saturday.
   At least three other people also were killed by suspected
militants in the northern state Friday night.
   Three to four Sikhs carrying AK-47 rifles Friday raided four
Hindu homes in Badowal village and shot down 10 people, said police
superintendent Govind Ram. ``They separated the male members from
others and shot them from point-blank range,'' he said in a
telephone interview. One woman was injured in the firing when she
tried to save her husband, he said.
   A note left by the killers said it was the first revenge killing
for the hanging of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were hanged
Friday.
   Ram said the note, written in Punjabi, threatened more killings.
   Badowal is 19 miles north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
   In another attack, Sikh militants shot and killed four Hindus and
injured two others at Sarai Amant Khan village Saturday, said police
superintendent Suresh Arora.
   The village, 14 miles northwest of Amritsar, is close to the
Pakistan border.
   Militants also were blamed for the killing of one Sikh, a
Christian and an unidentified man in separate incidents in the state
overnight.
   In other violence, a railway station was set ablaze and rockets
were fired at a police patrol, police and news reports said. No
casualties were reported.
   The killings bring to more than 50 the number of people killed in
Punjab last week. In 1988, more than 2,400 people were killed in
attacks blamed on the militants.
   Sikh militants fighting for an independent state since 1982 had
threatened a wave of sectarian violence if Satwant Singh and Kehar
Singh were executed.
   The government has placed tens of thousands of police and
security forces on alert throughout northern India, including New
Delhi, authorities said.
   The Supreme Court on Saturday ordered the ashes of the executed
Sikhs be immersed into a river under police supervision. It is an
important religious rite for Hindus and Sikhs.
   The men were cremated at New Delhi's Tihar Jail after authorities
refused to hand their bodies over to relatives.
   Sikhs make up only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
they are a majority in Punjab. They claim Sikhs are discriminated
against by India's Hindu religious majority, which comprises 80
percent of the population.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed in November 1984 in apparent revenge for
an army raid she had ordered on the Golden Temple in Amritsar,
Sikhism's holiest shrine, in June 1984.
   The temple was being used as a base by the militants. Troops
killed more than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, in the operation.

<TEXT>
   Honky-tonk music knows no boundaries,
according to musicians opposed to creation of a music district.
   Musicians in the audience of a City Council meeting last week
applauded the establishment of a Music Commission. But members of
the Austin Federation of Musicians expressed concern that the panel,
charged with overseeing creation of a music district downtown, might
only benefit business and real estate interests.
   Music-related businesses in the district could receive incentives
such as the waiver of development fees and low-interest loans, said
Randy McCall, president of the 750-member federation.
   ``Trying to translate that into a benefit for the city's working
professional musicians just kind of strains my credulity,'' said
McCall.
   Eric ``Doc'' Butler, a guitar player and music producer, said he
does not think the commission will help local musicians.
   ``I don't think the music district makes much sense. We've got
areas all around town that are real active in music that are
excluded'' from the district's boundaries, he said.
   Bob Meyer, owner of Concept Music, agreed.
   ``I think assigning it to a specific location is going to cut out
an awful lot of people who could otherwise participate in it. I'm
concerned that it's going to wind up being in the best interest of
real estate owners and not musicians,'' he said.
   Councilman Max Nofziger, who proposed the commission, could not
be immediately reached by telephone at his home or office.

   One month after Armenia's devastating earthquake,
the foundation stone of a new apartment building was laid Saturday
in Leninakan to start reconstruction in the Armenian city.
   Authorities have pledged to rebuild within two years Leninakan
and other Armenian towns and villages leveled in the Dec. 7 quake
that killed tens of thousands of people.
   The quake destroyed about 200 apartment houses, factories and
buildings in Leninakan and left more than 500,000 people homeless.
   Leninakan, home to about 280,000 people before the disaster, will
be rebuilt with three- and four-story stone buildings that will be
more comfortable and earthquake-resistant than those that crumbled,
the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   Many of the buildings destroyed in the quake were nine-story
apartment houses, and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has said a
government commission will investigate whether building regulations
were violated by the erection of such structures in a seismically
active area.
   On Friday, the evening television news program ``Vremya'' showed
workers using explosives to demolish five-story apartment buildings
in Leninakan that had not been toppled by the tremor but were too
dangerous to inhabit.
   Workers on Saturday laid the first stone of an apartment building
in Leninakan that is to be part of a housing development, Tass said.

   World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some
declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday,
but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of
the Japanese monarch.
   President Reagan said Hirohito's 62-year reign ``spanned one of
the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in
the history of mankind.
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision
to end World War II.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent his
``sincere condolences'' and ``profound sympathy'' to the Japanese
people.
   His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities
with what still is known officially as ``militarist Japan.'' The
Kremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased trade
with Japan.
   India declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor of
Hirohito and Norway's King Olav V announced a three-week court
mourning. President Francois Mitterrand of France opened an
international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of
silence.
   But some reaction to Hirohito's death was cool in South Korea,
which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
   While President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea sent his condolences,
a government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment,
considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan
relationship.''
   China extended condolences and Taiwan said it will send a
delegation to the funeral.
   But Taiwan's daily United Evening News said:
   ``It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United
States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to
China to show his sorrow.''
   Most historians believe Hirohito was a powerless figurehead but
had approved orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and put
most of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule. Hirohito
called on his nation to surrender in 1945.
   The emperor's death drew mixed reaction in the Netherlands, which
lost more than 20,000 people under Japan's wartime occupation of the
former Dutch East Indies.
   The government said it sent its sympathy for ``the loss that has
befallen the Japanese people,'' without mentioning the name of
Hirohito, branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime
occupation of the colony that became Indonesia in 1949.
   ``To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come to
an end,'' said Gen. Ruud Boekholt, chairman of the August 15
Commemoration Foundation, a group representing 127,000 Dutch
citizens who underwent Japanese internment.
   ``Daily, they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that
was inflicted on them in the name of Emperor Hirohito,'' Boekholt
told The Associated Press.
   But Indonesian President Suharto cabled his condolences to Crown
Prince Akihito, Hirohito's eldest son who immediately ascended the
Chrysanthemum Throne, and said he will personally pay the last
homage to Hirohito, presidential spokesman Moerdiono said.
   Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to
Hirohito's family, Vatican radio reported.
   Queen Elizabeth II said she was saddened and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said she shares the Japanese people's sorrow. But
opposition lawmakers said Britain should boycott his funeral.
   ``No one should go to that funeral from this country,'' said Ron
Brown, a lawmaker of the opposition Labor Party, who denounced
Hirohito as ``a war criminal of the worst kind.''
   ``It would be a grave insult to the many men and women ...
imprisoned in slave camps,'' he said. ``Many of them died, but those
who survived still suffer today.''
   King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and other
Persian Gulf monarchs, King Birendra of Nepal and Sultan Mahmood
Iskandar of Malaysia also sent condolences to Akihito.
   Brazil called Hirohito ``a superior symbol of the Japanese
nation, its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic
transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave
new challenges in the world.''

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with plant visit, expulsion order apparently
changed; No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Saturday called for
talks with the United States on defusing tensions and warned that
military force ``does not pay _ especially with Libya.''
   A U.S. official brushed aside the Libyan leader's call but did
not rule out the possibility of talks.
   Also Saturday, the government took three busloads of journalists
to a plant that the U.S. government claims is intended to produce
chemical weapons. Libya said the plant at Rabta, 60 miles southwest
of Tripoli, produces pharmaceuticals.
   The reporters allowed only were to view the unlit building from
the buses, which drove through the complex without stopping.
   Later Saturday, the government ordered visiting foreign
journalists out of the country. However, journalists then were told
they could stay until Sunday. It was unclear why the government
issued the order and then apparently changed it.
   Gadhafi, who had not been heard from or seen since Wednesday's
U.S. downing of two Libyan jet fighters, surprised about 200 foreign
journalists at Tripoli's waterfront Al Kabir Hotel.
   Reporters and photographers scrambled over sofas, pushed over
potted plants and took shortcuts across an ornamental fountain in
the lobby to approach the Libyan leader as he entered. Some people
were knocked to the ground.
   Patrons in a nearby coffee shop pressed against the window to
catch a glimpse of Gadhafi.
   ``Libya will not give in to the pressure of a superpower even if
this confrontation lasts 1 million years,'' Gadhafi said, speaking
softly in Arabic and surrounded by bodyguards.
   ``America must understand that her policy of surrounding us and
using force against us will absolutely fail,'' he said.
   ``They must negotiate with Libya directly and they should sit at
the negotiating table with Libya without their weapons to achieve
peace in the Mediterranean.''
   Wednesday's incident occurred over the Mediterranean. The United
States said two Navy jet fighters shot down two Libyan warplanes in
self-defense. Libya said its planes were unarmed.
   ``I think the Bush administration will be able to do this because
they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration.
There have been enough lessons. They will have learned that force
does not pay, especially with Libya,'' Gadhafi said.
   ``We will not respond to force, only to politeness and direct
negotiations,'' he added. His comments were translated to English by
an Information Ministry aide.
   A senior Reagan administration official attending a chemical
weapons conference in Paris responded, ``Communications is not the
problem, the problem is Libyan policy.''
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added, ``I
am not ruling anything in or out.''
   Gadhafi, whose country is represented at the Paris meeting, told
reporters he would participate in efforts to ban chemical weapons as
long as the campaign was aimed at all countries, not just Libya. The
meeting is aimed at adding political impetus to a 1920 Geneva
Protocol outlawing use of chemical weapons.
   Pressed about the Rabta plant, Gadhafi said only: ``Libya is
opposing the use of chemical weapons.''
   Journalists got only a fleeting view of the Rabta plant.
   Two separate surface-to-air missile sites were nearby, as well as
a radar station atop a barren ridge overlooking the highway. Tanks
and an encampment of soldiers were also in the area.
   An unidentified Libyan official said the radar, soldiers and air
defense batteries were put in place after Reagan threatened the
plant last month.
   However, the radar station was a permanent facility on a concrete
base, not a mobile unit.
   Gadhafi has offered the United States a one-time inspection of
the Rabta plant, but the Reagan administration said such a visit
would be inadequate because the plant could quickly be modified to
hide evidence of chemical weapon production.
   The Times of London reported Saturday the Rabta plant is geared
more to the production of chemical weapons than to medicine because
of its location, configuration and surrounding surface-to-air
missiles.
   The plant is close to the Libyan Technology Center, which the
paper said the CIA suspects is capable of producing or modifying
heavy battlefield equipment as well as manufacturing weapons
components and munitions.
   ``Libya will participate in all negotiations to get rid of all
weapons from ordinary guns to nuclear bombs. America must get rid of
its chemical and nuclear weapons factories and cancel the `Star
Wars' program,'' Gadhafi said, referring to U.S. research for a
space-based defense system.
   Gadhafi was wrapped in a brown wool cape and wore a black wool
pillbox hat to protect him from the rain. He smiled at cameras and
with a handkerchief dabbed at the sweat that appeared on his face
under the television lights.
   After Gadhafi spoke, he took a quick stroll around the hotel, got
back into his gray Peugeot and drove off.

<HEAD>Two Lawyers Ordered to Pay $12 Million for Mishandling Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has ordered two lawyers to pay a total of
$12 million in damages for mishandling a medical malpractice case.
   A Baltimore Circuit Court jury on Friday deliberated 45 minutes
before finding former law partners Herbert L. Singleton Jr. and
Robert F. Dashiell negligent in the case brought by Arthur and
Shirley Stokes, whose 16-year-old daughter, Evon, died in October
1974 after minor surgery.
   The medical malpractice case, originally filed in 1977, was
dismissed in 1980 for what a judge concluded was a lack of activity
by the lawyers handling it.
   Dashiell's lawyer, Charles Martinez, said his client would
appeal. Dashiell has since joined another Baltimore law firm.
   Singleton, who represented himself during the trial, had his
legal license suspended indefinitely by the Maryland Court of
Appeals in February 1986 for neglecting another client's case.
   According to Stephen Snyder, an attorney for the Stokeses,
Singleton admitted deceiving Mrs. Stokes in her daughter's case and
told the jury he had planned to pay her by accumulating money
through other cases.
   Evon Stokes died after surgery at Lutheran Hospital to remove a
cyst from the base of her spine, Snyder said. The surgery should
have been minor, but the girl was given ``excessive doses'' of
anesthesia and died shortly after being taken to the recovery room
because hospital employees failed to properly monitor her heart
rate, breathing and pulse, he said.
   The $12 million verdict is the largest legal malpractice award
given by a jury in Maryland, Snyder said.
   In May 1987, the Baltimore firm of Venable, Baetjer and Howard
agreed to pay $27 million to settle a legal malpractice lawsuit
filed by the state of Maryland, but that sum was not awarded by a
jury.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Force Cancellation After Learning Of Sabotage Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flight attendants forced the cancellation of
a United Air Lines Newark-to-Los Angeles flight last week when they
heard of a sabotage threat shortly before passengers boarded,
authorities said Saturday.
   The seven members of Flight 49's cabin crew would not fly Tuesday
night because the airline did not adequately explain the threat,
said Cindy Yeast, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight
Attendants, the crew's union.
   ``I think the flight attendants felt threatened,'' Ms. Yeast said
Saturday. ``I just think it was an oversight on ... United's part.
It points to how important communication is in a situation like
this.''
   The State Department had informed United that the U.S. Embassy in
Oslo, Norway, received threats against Jan. 3 flights from New York
to Los Angeles, the airline said Saturday. No specific flight was
identified, according to the airline.
   For most of the day Tuesday, United briefed crews leaving from
LaGuardia and Kennedy international airports in New York City and
Newark International about safety precautions. But United officials
apparently overlooked an information session with Flight 49's cabin
crew, said Ms. Yeast.
   She said the flight attendants learned of the threat just minutes
before passenger boarding was to begin. The plane, a DC-10 with 198
booked passengers, was scheduled to depart at 9:45 p.m. and was the
last United flight out of Newark.
   ``I think the process tended to break down after people went home
for the day,'' Ms. Yeast said, adding that airline officials
continued to perform diligent baggage checks.
   Rob Doughty, a United spokesman, said Saturday from Chicago that
he could not comment on the crew briefing procedures for security
reasons.
   ``We have an excellent security program ... part of that is not
to discuss it publicly,'' Doughty said.
   Doughty did not know how passengers were notified of the flight
cancellation, but he said 138 of them were accommodated overnight at
hotels and departed the following day. The plane, a DC-10 with 198
booked passengers, was scheduled to depart at 9:45 p.m.
   Airline industry officials said Saturday they did not expect more
such cancellations, despite sensitivity to sabotage threats
following the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland more than two
weeks ago.
   ``We don't think that's an appropriate response on the part of
the flight crew,'' said Steve Hayes, spokesman for the
Washington-based Air Transport Association, an industry trade group.
   ``We just think that airline management and the intelligence
community are in a better position to make a threat assessment and
to decide what the response should be,'' Hayes said.
   Ms. Yeast said the union had confidence in security measures.
   ``I don't think this is something that may be repeated'' by
flight crews, she said. ``I don't think that every flight attendant
group goes through the situation ... is going to walk off. They were
a victim of several circumstances.''

   Iranian authorities hanged 19 narcotics
traffickers, some publicly, in an anti-drug drive in which more than
1,000 people were rounded up and dozens killed in shootouts, Iranian
news reports said Saturday.
   There are no official estimates available, but officials have
reported that drug abuse rose alarmingly during the 8-year war with
Iraq. Iran's crackdown began after the Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   The official Islamic Republic New Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said 10 smugglers were convicted of running drug trafficking
networks, carrying illegal weapons, clashing with security forces,
and possessing a total of 167 pounds of heroin and 1,166 pounds of
opium.
   The agency said some were executed in Tehran's Qasr prison and
others publicly hanged in Bani-Hashem Square in the northwest
suburbs. It did not say when.
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said nine other
convicted smugglers were hanged Friday and Saturday in other Iranian
cities.
   These included Mashhad in the northwest, near the Afghan border,
and Kerman and Zahedan in the southwest, a major smuggling route
from neighboring Pakistan.
   Iran television on Saturday night showed interviews with some of
the condemned men before their hangings.
   They were seated at what appeared to be school desks, and some
tried to hide their faces from the camera.
   One was asked if he had known the penalty for his crime was
death. ``I am an illiterate and didn't understand what was going on.
My father didn't have anything, so I committed this act,'' he said.
   Another man, whose name also was not given, said he was a truck
driver who was offered the equivalent of $12,000 to carry narcotics
from a provincial town to Tehran. ``I was tempted. It was purely
materialistic,'' he said.
   The radio said several of the men executed were kingpins in major
narcotics rings operating in the southwest, one of the main targets
of the crackdown.
   A statement by the office of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor
in charge of the anti-narcotics campaign branded the executed men as
``the best examples of the corrupt on earth.''
   The executions were carried out in advance of a tough new law
that takes effect Jan. 21 under which the death sentence is
mandatory for anyone caught carrying 30 grams (just more than 1
ounce) of heroin, morphine, codeine or methadone or smuggling more
than 11 pounds of any narcotic.
   Any person who is found responsible for addicting another faces a
minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment.
   The Expediency Council, set up by revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini in February to speed up legislation snarled in
Tehran's bureaucratic machine, announced the new law Dec. 5.
   In addition to the Persian Gulf War, other likely factors in the
rise in drug smuggling and opium growing include a ban on alcohol,
worsening unemployment and the breakdown of political control in the
first years of the Islamic revolution.

   A 14-year-old boy who died of starvation
despite his parents having nearly $4,000 in savings was buried
Saturday before a handful of strangers.
   Eric Cottam's family was unable to attend. They were in hospital
beds, under treatment for malnutrition.
   His parents, Larry and Leona Cottam, have been charged with
criminal homicide in the death. The boy died Tuesday night after the
family hadn't eaten for 42 days, Larry Cottam told police.
   Larry Cottam, 39, said he didn't use $3,775 in cash, bonds and
bank accounts to buy food because it was a tithe belonging to God,
according to an affidavit filed by state police. Cottam, a former
Seventh-day Adventist preacher, believed God would provide for his
reclusive family, acquaintances said.
   The private, 10-minute graveside service was attended by nine
people, said Hubert Morgan, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor who
conducted the service. He said his wife, a local funeral director
and six pallbearers also attended and none of them knew the boy. The
church paid for the boy's burial, he said.
   ``It's tragic that he was cut short in life _ that he didn't get
to enjoy a full life,'' Morgan said. He said Larry Cottam told him
he wanted the service private and requested that relatives in
California not be present; Morgan said he didn't know how to contact
them.
   The time and the location of the service were kept secret to try
to keep away the media and others who wished to attend.
   ``A lot of members (of the congregation) wanted to go. Not out of
curiosity, out of sympathy,'' Morgan said in a telephone interview.
   A spokesman at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical
Center-Wilkes-Barre said Larry Cottam was in fair condition and
Leona Cottam was in serious condition. Their daughter, Laura, 12,
was listed in serious condition at Mercy Hospital.
   Eric, whose dream was to become a meteorologist, was 5-foot-10
and weighed 69 pounds when he died, 80 pounds less than normal,
Luzerne County Coroner George E. Hudock Jr. said.
   His brief life was dominated by his family, neighbors and school
officials said.
   He and Laura scored extremely well on standardized tests, but
since 1985 they were taught at home by their mother, Crestwood
School District officials said.
   Cottam, who was fired in March from his job as a truck driver,
said his savings represented 10 percent of his total earnings,
according to the affidavit. Tithes, which are usually 10 percent,
are used to pay the local pastor and for evangelical work, said
Frank Kowalski, first elder at the Seventh-day Adventist church in
Slocum, four miles from the Cottam's home.
   Kowalski said the Cottams hadn't paid a tithe to the local church
since they returned to the area in 1985. Morgan said the Cottams
hadn't attended his church in Slocum in his 14 months as pastor.
   In 1983, Cottam became an intern pastor, ministering to Slocum
and three other nearby churches with a total congregation of about
250. He was stripped of his license to preach in 1985 because of
strained relations with the congregations.
   Seventh-day Adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the
Bible as their sole rule of faith and practice.
   ``I think they (the Cottams) took the Lord and tested him to the
extreme,'' said Kowalski, a building contractor from nearby Dorrance.
   Cottam told a reporter Wednesday night he blamed himself, not
God, for his son's death.
   He and his wife were arraigned separately Thursday night at Mercy
Hospital.
   No bail was set, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for
Friday. In addition to criminal homicide, they face two counts each
of recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare
of children.
   Death is the maximum sentence for criminal homicide.
   Joseph Loftus-Vergari, executive director of the Luzerne County
Children and Youth Services, said his agency was investigating
whether the Cottams are able to properly care for their daughter.

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday showed foreign
journalists a plant the Reagan administration claims is preparing to
produce chemical weapons, but the visit was a drive-by view on a
moonless night.
   Thousands of civilians, including women and children, were camped
nearby to ``protect'' the plant from a U.S. attack, Libyan officials
said.
   Soldiers, tanks and surface-to-air missiles guarded the site 60
miles southwest of the capital of Tripoli. Children in the village
of Rabta shook their fists and chanted anti-U.S. slogans at Western
television cameras.
   The mysterious factory has been at the center of a conflict
between Libya and Washington that has threatened to escalate into
military action. Fears of a U.S. attack were heightened Wednesday
when U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan fighters over the
Mediterrean Sea.
   The government had promised the three busloads of reporters a
tour of ``Pharma 150,'' which it claims makes medicine.
   However, officials refused to allow journalists out of the buses
and into the building and did not drive close to the buildings until
after nightfall. The buses came about 75 feet from the unlit plant
buildings and did not stop.
   A short distance away, a radar station operated high atop a
barren ridge overlooking the highway and two surface-to-air missile
sites.
   Some tanks and an encampment of soldiers could be seen nearby.
   One unidentified Libyan official said the radar, soldiers and air
defense batteries were put in place after President Reagan said last
month that the United States was considering military action to
destroy the plant.
   However, the radar installation was a permanent station on a
concrete base, not a mobile unit.
   Ali Ibrahim, the man identified as manager of the factory,
insisted it was a pharmaceutical plant and said no foreign
contractors were involved. The Reagan administration has alleged
that a West German company and other foreign firms helped build the
complex. West Germany has denied the allegations.
   One Libyan official said foreigners could not have an inside tour
because well-known companies had been involved in the factory's
construction and the firms did not want to be subject to sanctions.
   The visit to the plant appeared designed to give reporters a
chance to see the crowds that Libyan officials said were gathered
along the road to ``protect'' the factory.
   A small tent city had been set up about 2{ miles from the plant,
but it appeared too small to house the crowd of several thousand
people in the area.
   A large number of cars and vans were parked along the road along
with at least a dozen empty buses.
   ``We're standing up to Reagan's call to attack,'' said Ahmir
Mohammed, an Agriculture Ministry employee from Tripoli who said he
was staying in the camp.
   ``The children and women here are brave too,'' he said.
   The crowd included women and children, people in white laboratory
coats and men in blue jeans. Official Libyan media has said doctors
and nurses have been holding a sit-in at the plant to protect it and
protest U.S. threats.
   A Tripoli-based Western diplomat said in an interview Friday that
Gadhafi sent many people to the plant so that in case of an attack
Libya could claim a civilian target had been hit, and women and
children had been killed. The diplomat spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Meanwhile, The Times of London reported Saturday that the factory
is geared more to producing chemical weapons than medicine because
of its location, configuration, and protection by surface-to-air
missiles.
   The paper quoted unidentified U.S. security sources as saying the
United States believes the factory is designed to produce mustard
gas and the nerve gas Sarin because of chemicals stockpiled there.
   Pharma 150 has been built close to the Libyan Technology Center,
which the paper said the CIA suspects is capable of producing or
modifying heavy battlefield equipment as well as manufacturing
weapons components and munitions.

   Gov. James G. Martin was sworn in for his
second term Saturday in a festive inauguration that marked the first
time since 1901 that Republicans held the state's top two offices.
   James C. Gardner was sworn in as the state's first Republican
lieutenant governor elected this century.
   Also taking the oath of office were eight Democratic Council of
State officers.
   Martin, 53, is the state's second governor this century to win
successive terms. The first was Democrat Jim Hunt.
   In his inaugural address to about 7,000 people, Martin outlined a
policy agenda that included a career advancement plan for teachers
and more highway funding.
   ``There are new challenges for us to face, along with unfinished
business from the past,'' said Martin. ``There is indeed a brighter
future for North Carolina.''
   Martin affirmed his support for statewide implementation of the
Career Ladder Program for teachers, a merit pay system he has pushed
despite mixed reviews from educators and legislators. Sixteen school
systems now use the program.
   The governor said he would establish task forces to study two of
North Carolina's biggest problems: drug abuse and pollution.
   He also promised to support the recommendations of a legislative
commission studying ways to finance a major highway construction
program. But he endorsed no specific measures.

   The arrival of 94 Haitians picked up after their
homemade sailboat ran aground in the Florida Keys has seriously
overcrowded the federal detention center here.
   ``It just today got severely overcrowded,'' Immigration and
Naturalization Service district director Perry Rivkind said Friday.
``We were getting overcrowded yesterday. It hit it today.''
   The situation is so serious that Rivkind said he will ask other
detention facilities to handle some of the Krome Avenue Detention
Center's overflow.
   ``We're going to ask for relief,'' he said. ``We need it. The
more people at Krome, the longer they have to wait in line for food
and other things, the opportunity for protests and tension grows.''
   Rivkind said there should be 125 staff members for the 500-plus
detainees at Krome, but there are only 63 and they are working
12-hour shifts. He has asked for $30,000 in emergency money to pay
for overtime for ``a month or two.''
   INS also has detention facilities in Texas, California and
Arizona. Rivkind said he did not know where Krome detainees would be
sent.
   ``They're all getting overcrowded because of the border
activities and movement into the United States,'' he said.
   Friday's 94 arrivals told INS officials they had been packed
aboard the 30-foot boat for about a month. They said they had
stopped twice in Cuba for food.
   Though most of the refugees were men, their number included 10
pregnant women and some children traveling without their parents.
   Rivkind said INS would try to locate sponsors for the children
and the women in the late stages of pregnancy. Instead of going to
Krome, they will stay with the sponsors until hearings are held to
decide their fates.

   Government water utility workers went on
strike Saturday, threatening water shortages for at least 1 million
people in the capital and in western Sudan.
   Five unions at the official Sudan News Agency, representing
editorial and other workers, also began a seven-day strike.
   The latest strikes follow four days of violent street
demonstrations and a general strike in late December against steep
price increases. The protests ended after the financially strapped
government rolled back prices.
   Workers at the the Sudanese Rural Waters Corp. demanded better
working conditions and wage increases for employees.
   The strike affected 245 water stations in Khartoum, most of them
in the industrial northern area, and further aggravated water
shortages suffered by residents in the mainly desert regions of
Darfur and Kordofan in the west.
   Union leaders representing workers at the Sudan News Agency met
with Abdallah Mohamed Ahmed, the culture and information minister,
but failed to head off the walkout. The unions voiced opposition to
deteriorating professional standards and an alleged lack of
leadership.
   In the past few months, powerful trade and professional unions
have orchestrated strikes by teachers, communication technicians,
Information Ministry employees and civil aviation technicians and
air controllers.
   The government says the unrest at the end of last month left one
person dead and 26 injured, but Western sources say at least four
died and more than 26 were hurt.
   The protests and general strike prompted Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi's Cabinet on Dec. 29 to revoke commodity price increases of up
to 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-board sales tax. It also
made retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1, salary increases of 50
percent to 300 percent decreed a week before for all public and
private employees.
   Since then, the government has been discussing with trade and
professional unions ways to finance the salary increases.

   Another relative of ex-president Chun
Doo-hwan has been arrested in a widening corruption inquiry that has
disgraced the former ruler and embarrassed his successor.
   Prosecutors said Lee Kyu-seung, an uncle of Chun's wife, Lee
Soon-ja, was imprisoned Friday and charged with taking about
$730,000 in bribes from a businessman for selling influence.
   Prosecutors and legislators are investigating allegations of
corruption, human rights violations, and other abuses under Chun and
his authoritarian rule.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile last month after making a public apology
for abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended in February.
   President Roh Tae-woo, a former general and once a close ally of
Chun, has distanced himself from Chun while asking the nation to
forgive him. But opposition parties say they will not agree to a
pardon for Chun unless he appears before a National Assembly inquiry.
   Opposition parties have demanded that Chun account for misdeeds
by his associates and relatives. They are accused of extorting money
from businesses, diverting government funds, selling influence and
forcing political donations.
   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but some of his
relatives and associates have been arrested or convicted of
corruption.
   Last week, prosecutors arrested two former government ministers
on corruption charges. It was the first arrest of ministers of
Chun's administration.
   Prosecutors have promised to expand their case into suspected
corruption involving former government officials and Chun's aides.

   Four hundred police, troops and
civilian volunteers fanned out through remote areas of northern
England on Saturday for debris from the Pan Am jet that crashed
across the border in Lockerbie.
   A British newspaper, quoting U.S. intelligence sources, reported
that the plane was sabotaged by Iranian terrorists aided by Libya. A
West German newspaper reported Saturday that the plane was sabotaged
by an IRA terrorist aided by a Palestinian group and Libya.
   Twenty-eight bodies still were missing after the Dec. 21
explosion that blew apart the Boeing 747 over this Scottish village,
killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
   The main search area has moved east from the vast Kielder Forest
near the border with Scotland to Harwood Forest, almost 60 miles
east of Lockerbie, in Northumberland, England's northernmost county.
   A police spokesman said Saturday's search had found nothing
significant.
   Wreckage from the explosion and crash has been found over a
65-mile stretch, from the Solway Firth in the west to the North Sea
in the east. About 220 volunteers from mountain rescue teams around
the country have joined the troops and police.
   The Sunday Telegraph of London said on Sunday that U.S.
intelligence agencies believe the terrorists who planted the bomb
came from Iran and were aided by Libya.
   The respected weekly quoted unidentified intelligence sources in
Washington as saying ``hard evidence is emerging'' to show that
Iranian Revolutionary Guards sabotaged the plane in part for
reprisal for the U.S. downing of an Iran Air passenger plane last
summer.
   The newspaper said ``there is a suspicion that Libyans acted as
`a conduit' for the explosives and provided intelligence for the
Iranian team.'' It said the information came from an intelligence
official who would not disclose the source or details of the
evidence.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said:
``We know nothing about that at the State Department.''
   In Hamburg, West Germany, a newspaper said Saturday the bomb that
destroyed the plane was planted by an Irish Republican Army
terrorist with Libyan and Palestinian assistance.
   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper said British
investigators believe the terrorist boarded the plane in Frankfurt
but left the flight in London. The newspaper did not cite sources.
   New York-bound Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, but passengers
and luggage switched planes in London.
   A spokesman for the British Department of Transport, which is in
charge of the investigation, said Saturday he knew nothing of the
Bild report and that he believes it is speculation.
   British authorities have dismissed numerous and often
contradictory media accounts of how and where and by whom the bomb
was planted, saying those questions remained unanswered.
   Bild said the IRA planned the bombing with a group called the
People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine, led by terrorist
Ahmed Jibril.
   Bild, which is known for good government sources in Bonn but has
often been inaccurate in the past, said the terrorist was trained in
Libya. It said Libya also provided the explosives.

   Soviet aircraft are tentatively scheduled to pick
up prefabricated housing for Armenian earthquake survivors at an Air
Force base that is home to a squadron responsible for keeping enemy
aircraft out of West Coast airspace.
   The two Aeroflot cargo jets are to land Saturday at McChord Air
Force Base near Tacoma, which would be the first time Soviet
aircraft have landed at the base, McChord officials said. An F-15
fighter interceptor squadron is at the base.
   The Soviet heavy freight transports are to each carry six
shelters developed two weeks ago for quick reassembly in Armenia.
Volunteer workers at companies here made the shelters, 32 feet by 32
feet, of plywood, tin roofs and insulation sufficient to protect as
many as 40 people from temperatures as low as 40 below zero.
   The Soviet planes are scheduled to refuel at Elmendorf Air Force
Base at Anchorage, Alaska, en route to McChord.
   In Seattle, at least 13 firefighters have volunteered to go on
the flights to Soviet Union to assemble the shelters.
   The shelters are designed to last about three years, replacing
canvas tents while Soviets rebuild their earthquake-ravaged cities.
   Bob Walsh, who arranged the flights partly through his contacts
as president of a group planning the 1990 Goodwill Games, said all
that remained for final approval was the filing of a flight plan
with the State Department.
   Iraklij Chichiabaja, Aeroflot district manager in Washington,
D.C., also said tentative clearance has been given for the planes to
land at the base.
   The effort was started by Seattle firefighters Dan Gomez and
Steve Beaumont within days of the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an
estimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 homeless.
   The cost of the shelters is $8,000 to $11,000 each.
   Kirk Ohanessian, chairman of the local Armenian Church parish
council who has volunteered to go as translator, said the council
was trying to raise $64,000 to help finance eight more units.
   ``You can save all the lives you want, but you're going to have
more people die if they don't have a place to live,'' Ohanessian.

<HEAD>Chilean Prosecutor Approves U.S. Request to Question Former Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor approved a U.S. request to
question seven former government officials about the 1976
assassination in Washington of a retired Chilean minister, news
reports said Saturday.
   However, the ruling Thursday by prosecutor Rene Pica must be
upheld by a six-member panel of the Supreme Court, which is to meet
Monday, local newspapers said. The panel includes two justices who
have in the past opposed U.S. extradition requests in the case.
   Orlando Letelier and an American aid, Ronnie Moffit, were killed
on Sept. 21, 1976, by a bomb that blew up Letelier's car as he drove
along Embassy Row in Washington.
   Letelier was an ambassador to Washington and later foreign
minister in the leftist government of President Salvador Allende.
Letelier was an avowed foe of Augusto Pinochet, who overthrew the
government in a 1973 coup that left Allende dead.
   Investigators believe that the seven former Chilean officials may
have information about what they describe as a plot by Chilean
intelligence agents to kill Letelier and a later cover-up, according
to papers filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   
   The U.S. request, signed by U.S. District Judge Barrington
Parker, was filed Dec. 28 by the U.S. Justice Department through the
Chilean Foreign Ministry.
   Parker wants to question Gen. Odlanier Mena, former head of the
secret police; Miguel Schweitzer, former foreign minister; air force
Gen. Enrique Montero, former interior minister; Jose Miguel Barros,
Manuel Trucco and Jorge Cauas, all former Chilean ambassadors to
Washington; and Tomas Amenabar, who was at the time a charge
d'affaires in the Chilean Embassy. Cauas was later appointed finance
minister.
   Barros is now a prominent foe of Pinochet's government.
   A former Chilean army major, Armando Fernandez Larios, who left
Chile and surrendered to U.S. authorities in 1987, provided U.S.
investigators with information that led to the request, according to
U.S. court papers.
   Fernandez and two other high-ranking Chilean army officers were
indicted in the 1970s in the United States in connection with the
assassination. However, the Chilean Supreme Court turned down a
request for their extradition.

   The central figure in two
federal inquiries involving Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry Jr.
has denied using drugs with the mayor, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Virgin Islands Daily News also quoted Charles Lewis as
defending his role in a heavily-criticized joint venture between the
governments of the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.
   Lewis, a former District of Columbia and Virgin Islands
government official, was the target of a police drug effort on Dec.
22 after a maid at his Washington hotel complained he had offered
her drugs in exchange for sex. An undercover attempt to buy drugs
from Lewis that day was called off after Barry showed up at Lewis'
room.
   However, Lewis denied offering drugs to the hotel maid in
exchange for sex, the newspaper said. He was quoted as saying that a
misunderstanding arose when he was looking for writing paper to
complete a job application.
   ``There was a service tray with writing paper on it, and I asked
the housekeeper, in the presence of two maintenance men, in Spanish,
if I could have the paper.
   ``When I got the paper off the tray, a light piece of plastic _
probably a used disposable shower cap _ fell off the tray, and I
picked it up to give to the housekeeper,'' Lewis told the Daily News.
   ``She started acting funny,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Lewis said Barry was in his room later to help him find a job.
   Lewis, who had not spoken publicly about the incident until the
press account Saturday, remains at an undisclosed location. His
version of the story differs little from that of Barry, who said he
was simply visiting an old friend at the hotel.
   Barry has denied using drugs with Lewis and said he was unaware
Lewis was under police investigation.
   Federal investigators are trying to determine whether Barry
thwarted a separate police investigation into the matter, why he was
visiting Lewis at the hotel, and whether Lewis was using or selling
drugs.
   Barry has denied interfering with the city's drug investigation.
   The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jay B. Stephens,
has expanded his inquiry to include the city's involvement in a
$260,000 joint venture between the city and Virgin Islands
government to upgrade the islands' personnel system.
   Lewis headed the project but was fired in April after Virgin
Islands officials became concerned about cost overruns. Stephens is
trying to find out whether city officials working on the project
charged personal items and expenses to their account with the Virgin
Islands government.
   In his Daily News interview, Lewis said the reason hotel costs
for the personnel project were so high was because Virgin Islands
Gov. Alexander Farrelly was slow with paperwork, which put the
project into the busy season when rates are higher.
   The Daily News quoted Farrelly as saying Friday that he fired
Lewis because he was ``dissatisfied with the pace of the
activities'' and felt some of the consultants' expenditures
``warranted criminal investigation.''

   Three Israelis beat and kidnapped a Palestinian
man on Saturday because they were upset about his romance with a
Jewish woman, a news report said.
   The assailants, relatives of the woman, broke into an apartment
in suburban Tel Aviv where the couple was staying, beat the
Palestinian man and hauled him away in the trunk of their car, the
Itim news agency said.
   The young woman fled and alerted a policeman, who pursued the
assailants' car and freed the 29-year-old Palestinian from the
trunk, Itim reported.
   Police took the beating victim to Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel
Aviv, where he was treated for minor injuries and then released,
Itim said.
   The attackers, two men aged 44 and 22 and a 35-year-old woman,
were arrested and charged with kidnapping. All were residents of the
Tel Aviv suburb of Rosh Ha'ayin, Itim said.
   The assailants had apparently implored their relative, a divorced
woman in her late 20s, to leave her Arab boyfriend, a native of
Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Itim said. The couple have
been romantically involved for two years, Itim said.
   Itim quoted the Palestinian boyfriend as saying, ``I don't see
what the fuss is all about. There is no difference between me and a
Jew.''
   A Tel Aviv police spokesman refused to confirm details of the
story.

<HEAD>Government Denies Clash Between Greenpeace and French Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday denied charges that
French construction workers in Antarctica roughed up 15 Greenpeace
environmentalists protesting an airstrip being built near a penguin
sanctuary.
   A statement from the environmental group, issued in New York,
said its members were knocked down and dragged through mud and rocks
by workers at an airstrip at France's Dumont d'Urville station,
located on one of five small Antarctic islands claimed by France.
   It was Greenpeace's fourth expedition to Antarctica, where the
organization established the only non-government run environmental
base in 1987.
   The expedition was to spend seven weeks visiting U.S., West
German, Soviet, Italian and New Zealand bases in Antarctica to
document waste disposal and pollution.
   The group went to the French base to protest the construction of
a runway which they say will cut through a natural breeding ground
and migration area for penguins.
   The clash occurred after protesters erected a portable hut in the
path of French bulldozers and held a banner reading ``Halt the
Airstrip _ Greenpeace.''
   The Greenpeace communique said the station's officer-in-charge
saw a video of the brawl and ``admitted the construction workers
were out of control,'' Greenpeace expedition coordinator Peter
Wilkinson said in the statement.
   A spokesman for Louis Le Pensec, France's minister for overseas
territories, denied a conflict occurred and said the group received
authorization from the government to visit the French station.
   The group had been welcomed on arrival Thursday by 30 French
scientists, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with ministry rules. He said the ministry had spoken with
authorities at the base who confirmed the Greenpeace members erected
a hut on the airstrip.
   Greenpeace has clashed with Frane several times. In 1985 the
Greepeace vessel Rainbow Warrior was bombed in Auckland harbor by
people who were later identified as working for the French
intelligence service.

<HEAD>Group Forms Apparently To Counter Activists; Party Chief Warns Ethnic
Split</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group formed Saturday appears to challenge local
activists seeking autonomy in the Baltic republic of Latvia, where
the Communist Party chief says independent organizations are causing
ethnic divisions.
   The new Latvian organization, the Inter-National Front, held its
organizing congress in Riga, the Latvian capital. Tass, the official
Soviet news agency, said preliminary data indicate the group is
supported by 300,000 of the republic's 2.6 million inhabitants.
   ``The new mass organization proclaimed its main goal to promote
and further extend the perestroika reform program,'' Tass said,
referring to the campaign for economic and social change mounted by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   However, Latvian nationalists and activists say the group is
dominated by ethnic Russians and is intended to be a counterweight
to the Latvian People's Front, which is seeking greater autonomy for
the Baltic republic from Moscow.
   ``They are anti-perestroika,'' said Boris Sokolov, a Riga-based
member of the Democratic Union, an independent group seeking to
challenge the political monopoly of the Communist Party.
   At a Thursday meeting of the Latvian party's Central Committee,
the republic's party chief, Janis Vagris, seemed to distance himself
both from the People's Front and the Inter-National Front.
   According to state-run Radio Moscow, Vagris said ``various public
organizations had emerged lately in the republic, such as the
People's Front, where ethnic Latvians constitute a majority, and the
Inter-Nationalist Front, made up mostly of people of other
nationalities living in the republic.''
   The existence of such groups ``has been causing ethnic
stratification in Latvia,'' he said.
   ``Both movements have some extremist-minded elements,'' Vagris
was quoted as saying. ``Both also involve members of the Communist
Party, which means that there is also stratification within the
party.''
   He said that was ``impermissible'' and called on the
organizations to ``lose no time in renouncing confrontation and join
forces instead in promoting the process of perestroika,'' Radio
Moscow said.
   Despite Vagris' criticisms, one of the founders of the
Inter-National Front said its members were seeking ethnic harmony
but indicated the group will seek to remain outside party control.
   ``When creating the Inter-National Front, we proceeded from the
fact that the interests of the working people of various
nationalities largely coincided, while differences between them were
not antagonistic,'' Tass quoted Anatoly Belaichuk as telling the
Saturday congress.
   ``It means we can jointly work for the victory of perestroika
initiated by our Communist Party,'' said Belaichuk, a rector at the
Riga Institute of Civil Aviation Engineering.
   Ethnic Latvians make up 54 percent of Latvia's population,
according to the most recent official data, obtained in the 1979
Soviet census. Ethnic Russians total 33 percent of Latvia's
population, while 5 percent are Ukrainians, 3 percent Byelorussians
and 3 percent ethnic Poles.

   On the most beautiful and wild of the state's
rugged beaches lie hundreds of sea birds wrapped like mummies in
heavy oil. Some are moving. Others are not. They are victims of the
second-largest oil spill in Washington waters.
   The oil that poured from a barge Dec. 22 was thought to have
dissipated at sea after some of it moved onto the southern
Washington coast.
   But a storm just before New Year's brought the oil rushing back
to shore, fouling 300 miles of coastline, including the pristine
northern beaches of the Olympic Peninsula and on Vancouver Island,
British Columbia.
   ``I think it's kind of outrageous that this can happen,'' said
Melissa Seymour of Forks as she helped clean a beach where she and
her family go regularly.
   Ron Holcomb, spokesman for the state Ecology Department, said
Saturday more than 6,400 birds have been recovered from Washington
beaches, about 4,000 of them dead. An estimated 85 birds have been
cleaned and released and 675 more have been washed; scientists say
more than half of those washed are likely to die.
   Some of the estimates had been revised downward Saturday based on
more complete information, officials said.
   Hundreds more contaminated waterfowl have been recovered from
beaches in Oregon and British Columbia, while uncounted others
probably died at sea.
   Damage to other parts of the ecosystem is less obvious and
probably less severe, but it may take months to evaluate, said David
Kennedy, a biologist and oil spill expert for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   Currents along the Washington coast shift to the south in the
spring and could deposit even more oil on beaches.
   ``In a few years, maybe these beaches will be back to normal, but
the effects will be seen for months, if not years to come,'' said
Chuck Janda, chief park ranger for the Olympic National Park. ``In
some areas the oil will always be there, on rocks or on logs, to
serve as a reminder.''
   Many of the dead birds are taken away in bags by volunteers so
that bald eagles and other birds of prey won't eat them and be
poisoned. The live birds that can be captured are placed in other
bags, waiting for a bath that may save their lives.
   Two persistent birds, cleaned and tagged, were released at an
area without oil, only to be picked up again, re-oiled, at a beach
farther north.
   The spill that occurred off Grays Harbor when a tug collided with
an oil barge it had been towing at first appeared limited to 70,000
gallons. Environmentalists were relieved when most of the oil swept
back out to sea, with only a bit clinging to the Grays Harbor
estuary, where many species feed.
   But last weekend, it turned out that as much as 231,000 gallons
had spilled, and the storm drove it shoreward, blackening more
beaches, mostly to the north.
   Bird-cleaning centers were opened at Ocean Shores, at Neah Bay to
the north and at Astoria, Ore.
   Already the accident has claimed more birds than the largest
marine spill in state history. About 4,000 birds died in December
1985 when 239,000 gallons of Alaska crude leaked into Port Angeles
harbor from a tanker that ran aground.
   Damage to other life appears minimal so far, experts said. No sea
mammal deaths have been conclusively linked to the spill. Most of
the toxic, lighter elements already had been refined out of the
heavy oil, Kennedy said.
   Mary Lou Mills, a biologist with the state Department of
Fisheries, said most of the oil will break up, allowing most of the
toxic hydrocarbons to evaporate.
   Ms. Mills was generally optimistic because the fouled areas are
north of clam and oyster beds and a smelt spawning habitat, but she
said mussels, barnacles and starfish might be affected.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, who toured the coast Wednesday, said the
spill strengthens his resolve to oppose federal plans for oil and
gas drilling off the coast.

<HEAD>Jamaica Deports Alleged Drug Dealers in $8 Million Arms-Smuggling
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities are deporting eight
foreigners accused of posing as Colombian military officials to ship
$8 million worth of weapons through Jamaica to leftist rebels in
Colombia, an official said Saturday.
   National Security Minister Errol Anderson of Jamaica, who made
the announcement, did not identify the men. However, he said three
were Colombian, four Panamanian, and one British.
   He said the men were involved in ``narco-terrorism and the
Medellin cartel,'' referring to a leading Colombian drug-trafficking
group.
   ``In questioning the conspirators, it was learned that the arms
were destined for a leftist Colombian insurgent group called the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,'' he said. ``This group is
in league with and financed by Colombian cocaine traffickers.''
   The rebel group, one of several opposed to the Colombian
government, has made known through an intermediary that it would
like to open peace talks with the government.
   Anderson said the weapons arrived on this Caribbean island
shortly before Christmas via a Panamanian-registered freighter.
   He said Colombian officials were invited to Jamaica on Thursday
to witness the opening of the crates, which contained machine guns,
assault rifles, mortars and hand guns. The Colombian officials
returned with the weapons and the three detained Colombians on
Friday, he said.
   Anderson said the Panamanians and Briton were to be deported
Saturday. He said two of the Panamanians were pilots who were to fly
the weapons from Jamaica to Colombia.
   The official said the weapons were paid for by cocaine sent to
Europe. He said the arms came from West Germany, where they were
made by the firm Heckler and Koch.

   Southern California radio listeners may be
startled Sunday morning to hear traffic reports delivered by
Commander Wes Steel, who surveys road conditions in a B-52 bomber
and shoots at stalled cars.
   The maniacal traffic reporter is the creation of comedian John
Candy and a radio troupe whose new syndicated comedy show, ``Radio
Kandy,'' is a parody of popular radio.
   The weekly two-hour show, featuring Candy as a disc jockey, is
scheduled to be heard at 8 a.m. Sundays on KNX-FM and eventually
over 225 radio stations nationwide. It is distributed by the
Transtar Radio Network.
   Candy first gained fame on ``Second City TV,'' (``SCTV'') a
now-defunct show about a fictional television station. From there
Candy moved to the big screen, starring in such movies as
``Splash,'' ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles,'' and ``Little Shop of
Horrors.''
   Joining Candy on the show will be ``SCTV'' alumni Joe Flaherty,
Valri Bromfield and Ira Miller. Candy said many ``SCTV'' characters
will be reprised for radio, but it will not be a ``Second City
Radio.''
   ``I don't know what it is going to be yet; we'll see what works.
That is how `SCTV' evolved,'' he said.
   Candy said he is not in danger of becoming a so-called ``shock
radio'' DJ.
   ``It's like how gross can you get? How low can you go? Who can
you wake up and disturb? Whose life can you wreck today? And when
you finally meet these people, they are really quite the opposite,''
he said.
   ``We will give a nice mixture of music and humor,'' Candy said.
``It won't beat you over the head.''

   Police arrested nearly 100 anti-abortion
protesters Saturday who sang Christmas carols while blocking
doorways and jamming elevators at an abortion clinic, officials said.
   Police dragged and carried away the protesters, who filled
hallways of a busy office building and prevented 15 women from
entering the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts clinic,
officials said.
   Four of the protesters fastened heavy-duty bicycle locks around
their necks, interweaving the locks and throwing away the keys.
   ``It just makes it take longer (to clear the entrance),''
explained protester Darroline Firlit. ``It takes them a long time to
try a hacksaw and figure out that it won't work and then get the
Fire Department and send for a locksmith.''
   ``It only takes three minutes to kill a baby. So every three
minutes we save is another life.''
   Another group of 50 to 75 anti-abortion protesters, also members
of the national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, picketed
peacefully outside the downtown building, said Deputy Police Chief
John Coakley.
   Police said 92 protesters who blocked entrances to the clinic and
refused to move were arrested, charged with trespassing and released
on their own recognizance pending arraignment Tuesday.
   The protest was one in a series of anti-abortion demonstrations
in Massachusetts in recent months, including one Dec. 31 in which
about 75 members of Operation Rescue's Boston chapter were arrested.
   The clinic opened three hours late, at 11 a.m., after all the
protesters were removed, and all but one of 15 patients who had
abortion appointments in the morning waited for the protesters to be
hauled away rather than reschedule the procedure, clinic officials
said.
   About 50 members of the Boston chapter of the National
Organization for Women staged a counter-protest outside the building.
   ``It would be unheard-of to block a voting booth,'' said Ellen
Convisser, president of the Boston NOW chapter. ``And it should be
equally underheard-of to block my constitutional right to enter an
abortion clinic.''

   Security has been stepped up near the two
U.S. military bases on this Greek island after they were threatened
in a note attached to an airport bomb, police said Saturday.
   The bomb was found Thursday at Heraklion International Airport
and dismantled by police, a police spokesman said.
   It carried a handwritten note signed by the ``Unknown
Organization.'' The group said it would attack the U.S. Air Force
electronic listening post at Gournes if American forces attack
Libya, the spokesman said.
   ``Although we've never heard of this group before, we can't rule
out the possibility of an attack,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with Greek practice.
   Relations between the United States and Libya have hit a new low
since U.S. jets downed two Libyan military planes and U.S. officials
began complaining about a factory in Libya they believe is designed
to make chemical weapons. President Reagan has said military action
against the plant is an option.
   More than 1,200 U.S. servicemen and 400 local employees work at
the military installation at Gournes, which monitors radio
communications and Soviet activity in the Mediterranean.
   The Gournes base and a U.S. Sixth Fleet supply installation at
Suda Bay are located about 150 miles from Libya.

   A Soviet cultural group picked five candidates
Saturday to sit on a new national political body, but the
organization's best-known member, Raisa Gorbachev, was conspicuously
absent from the list.
   It is not known if the wife of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who attended the meeting according to state-run
television, presented herself as a candidate to represent the Soviet
Culture Fund. She helped create the organization in 1986.
   If so, her failure to achieve election could be a clear rebuff to
her husband. However, the wives of Kremlin leaders do not usually
engage in political or Communist Party business.
   Excerpts of Saturday's meeting in Moscow were shown on the
Saturday evening television news show ``Vremya.''
   The program said the Soviet Culture Fund was entitled to send
five representatives to the Council of People's Deputies. The
council is a new 2,250-member body that will chose members of the
national Supreme Soviet legislature and elect the Soviet president,
the post now held by Gorbachev.
   The five chosen included Dmitri Likhachev, a top member of the
literature and language department of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences; and Daniel Granin, a prominent Leningrad author, Vremya
said.
   The 750 candidates to the Council of People's Deputies from
public organizations like the Culture Fund will be submitted to the
organizations' congresses and conferences in March for a vote. In
addition, 1,500 deputies will be elected to represent territorial
divisions and the 15 constituent Soviet republics.
   The Culture Fund is an umbrella group for the arts that tries to
involve more Soviets in cultural pursuits, provide financial support
and help young artists gain public recognition.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, a former philosophy teacher, arouses strong
passions among Soviets. Some admire what they view as her sense of
style, while others condemn her for extravagant taste in clothes and
public assertiveness.

   The cleanup of a radioactive house
contaminated by a professor processing radium in the basement will
cost $9.5 million and involve digging up neighbors' lawns and
possibly garages, federal officials say.
   It is the second major price increase for the project, which is
being financed by the federal Superfund cleanup program.
   In 1984, the cleanup cost was estimated at $2 million. Last
August, as the cleanup began, officials estimated the cost at $7.5
million.
   ``A lot of the areas we are excavating turned out to be
contaminated,'' Nanci L. Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, said Friday. ``In some areas we
went down seven to nine feet'' before finding clean soil.
   Officials found that portions of the lawns of four surrounding
homes were radioactive.
   Since August, contractors have been pulling apart the house and
its lawn. The house was contaminated in the 1930s and 1940s by a
University of Pennsylvania professor.
   By November, contractors had torn down the entire house and
shipped it to a special dump site in Utah. Only the lawn remained,
but that has proven to be much more radioactive than previously
thought, Sinclair said.
   Instead of the 1,000 tons of soil contractors expected to remove,
they will cart off 2,200 tons to the Utah dump, Sinclair said.
   Victor J. Janosik, EPA project manager, said he expects the
cleanup to be completed by May or June.
   ``I've never seen the price of these things go down,'' he said.

   Sentencing is set for Feb. 21 for a Spokane,
Wash., man arrested with a loaded gun and ammunition near the White
House last month.
   Dennis Arthur Hanson pleaded guilty on Friday in District of
Columbia Superior Court to a misdemeanor charge or carrying a pistol
without a license.
   Hanson faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   In exchange for the guilty plea, the U.S. Attorney's office
agreed to dismiss charges of possession of an unregistered firearm
and possession of unregistered ammunition.
   The court also granted a request by Hanson's attorney, Daniel
McGuan, that Hanson be transferred immediately to St. Elizabeth's
Hospital in Washington for a 30-day psychiatric evaluation.
   A status hearing will be held Feb. 6 to review the findings,
McGuan said.
   Hanson, a Vietnam veteran, was arrested Dec. 8 near the Ellipse,
between the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the White House.
   His wife, Diane Hanson, has said her husband was troubled by his
wartime experiences and that he told her he went ``to the wall,'' a
reference to the memorial, intending to kill himself.

   The family of a Syracuse University
student killed in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 learned shortly
before her scheduled funeral they received the wrong body, the
victim's father said Saturday.
   ``I know my daughter is still out there somewhere, either in
Scotland, unidentified, or shipped somewhere else,'' said Robert
Hunt. ``And we have a body here that some family is grieving over.''
   Hunt said the body of his daughter, Karen, was examined by the
Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office Friday. Examiners determined
Saturday through dental records and X-rays that it wasn't Karen's
body, he said.
   ``They told me this morning they were 100 percent positive it
wasn't Karen's body,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
home in the Rochester suburb of Webster.
   Dr. Frederick J. Halik, a specialist in dental identification of
the dead, said he determined the body was not Karen's after
examining it in the medical examiner's office Saturday.
   ``Nothing matched ... just about nothing,'' Halik said.
   Dr. Nicholas Forbes, chief medical examiner, said other physical
discrepancies also existed.
   British officials in Lockerbie said they were investigating.
   ``A question has been raised regarding the body of Karen Hunt,''
officials said in a terse statement. ``The matter is the subject of
further discussion and examination by appropriate medical
specialists.''
   Hunt received word Tuesday from authorities in Scotland that the
body of his daughter, who would have turned 21 Saturday, had been
identified.
   Miss Hunt's aunt then called officials in Scotland to get a
description of the clothes on the body, he said.
   ``What the person over there described didn't sound like
Karen's,'' Hunt said.
   The funeral, which had been scheduled for Friday, was postponed.
   Hunt said he's concerned another family might receive Karen's
body and cremate it without knowing its true identity.
   ``You can exhume a body, but you can't identify it once it's been
cremated,'' he said.
   Miss Hunt was returning to New York after completing a
one-semester program in Syracuse University's Division of
International Programs Abroad in London.

<HEAD>France Negotiating Jet Deal With Libya, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France is negotiating to sell jet fighters to
Libya, a U.S. official was quoted as saying in a report published
Sunday.
   The Sunday Telegraph said the senior official, who the report did
not name, said information about the deal to sell Mirage jet
fighters was compiled with the help of European intelligence
agencies.
   The report did not say how many jets were under negotiation.
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Kudla, a Defense Department spokesman in
Washington, said he had not seen the report and could not comment on
it.
   The newspaper said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``wants to
replenish his stock of aging (Soviet) MiG planes with the latest
French fighter,'' the Mirage.
   It said the French government first sold Libya a version of the
Mirage in 1978 which was delivered in the early 1980s, although
Libya now receives most of its military equipment from Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``The United States fears that, if the Libyans had been equipped
with the new Mirage, the fight over the Mediterranean last week
could have ended differently,'' said the report, referring the U.S.
downing of two Libyan planes on Wednesday.
   He said the United States had not confronted the French with its
knowledge.

   Best-selling author Clive Cussler led 200
volunteers Saturday in a search for a locomotive believed buried in
a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood, but the hunt's first day ended
with no clues unturned.
   Cussler said he was not optimistic after workers found only a
part from a railroad car, some tubing and what appeared to be part
of an old farm wagon.
   ``If I had five guys with magnetometers and lined them up we'd
find it,'' he said. ``But (with 200 volunteers) it's too unwieldy.
None of them have ever worked together before.''
   The search was to be completed on Sunday.
   A Kansas Pacific locomotive reportedly fell 30 feet from a
railroad bridge, along with 19 of its 25 cars and a caboose, on the
night of May 21, 1878, when an enormous flood struck the area 30
miles east of Denver. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were
said to have been buried in the sand.
   The front brakeman, fireman and engineer all were killed.
   Cussler, who lives in Golden, has become somewhat of a guru to
people who dream of discovering lost relics. Through his National
Underwater and Marine Agency, the author of ``Raise the Titanic''
has located 54 sunken vessels, including a dirigible.
   But this is his first buried train.
   He said he learned about the train from articles several years
ago.
   ``I put it away and filed it and I used it for a germ for my
book, `Night Probe,''' he said. ``I brought a psychic out once. He
didn't spot the train but he found a target I had marked.''
   Volunteers used shovels and hand-held metal detectors while
several archeologists and flood experts used a land radar unit to
search.
   Some volunteers, like Curtis Hotzinger of Denver and his wife,
Mary Fedoruk, said they joined the search because they are fans of
the writer.
   Two backhoes dug three large holes in the creekbed in areas
targeted by metal detectors. But water filled the holes about 10
feet under the surface.
   Eric Walker of Darwin, Australia, found the flat car part, which
he described as a horseshoe-shaped piece of metal that held a gear.
   If the locomotive is found, it will belong to the landowner,
Cussler said.
   Since most of the equipment has been donated, the cost of the
search is less than $1,000, said agency spokesman Craig Dirgo.
   The town of Kiowa, near where the tragedy occurred, was renamed
Bennett to honor two of the victims' widows, sisters whose maiden
names were Bennett.
   Local newspapers reported that about two weeks after the
accident, a man named Wolfe Londoner searched for the locomotive,
using a magnetized crowbar. The Rocky Mountain News reported that
the crowbar suddenly plunged violently into the sand, dragging
Londoner with it ``to the astonishment of the spectators.''
   Two hours later, Londoner reportedly emerged from the bog to
announce that he had found the missing engine 8 feet under the
ground and some distance downriver from the bridge. However, the
newspaper story doesn't say the locomotive was recovered.
   Bob Richardson, director of the Colorado Railroad Museum in
Golden, has said he thinks it unlikely that the Kansas Pacific
Railroad would have left such a large, expensive locomotive in the
sand. He said the railroad was in financial straits, and human labor
was cheap at the time. The locomotive was said to be worth $18,000,
by one account.
   However, 79-year-old Emma Mitchell, whose father was a
15-year-old railroad worker at the time of the flood, thinks the
train is still there.
   ``My father said emphatically that nobody salvaged the
locomotive,'' she said.
   Dirgo said the most recent organized search for the train was in
May 1953 by a Colorado School of Mines professor. ``They only
searched an area of 150 by 400 feet and didn't have the kind of
equipment we have now,'' Dirgo said.

   Chanting monks pounded drums as tens of thousands of
people thronged the moated Imperial Palace on Sunday to pray for
Hirohito, the emperor who presided over Japan's jorney from war to
ruin to economic rebirth.
   Hirohito died at dawn Saturday, and 3{ hours later his
55-year-old son Akihito silently accepted the regalia of the
Chrysanthemum Throne in a 4-minute ceremony.
   The new emperor bowed as the symbols of his new position were
placed before him in a large room in the palace.
   Included were the state and imperial seals and two of the three
imperial treasures _ a sword and jewels. The third, an ancient
mirror, is enshrined on the palace grounds.
   Later, Akihito used a calligraphy brush to sign formal approval
for Heisei _Achieving Peace _ as the name of his reign. The name
will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Hirohito's death at age 87 ended a 62-year reign, the longest of
any Japanese monarch. During that time, he announced Japan's
surrender in World War II, gave up his divinity and saw his nation
emerge as a world economic power.
   The Cabinet met Sunday morning to deliberate on funeral
arrangements and, following precedent of earlier imperial funerals
held at least six weeks after death, set Feb. 24 as the date for
Hirohito's burial.
   Tradition calls for dozens of ceremonies, some elaborate, others
poignantly simple, to lay Hirohito to rest. Thirty-six ceremonies
have been announced for the first year, the official mourning period
for the imperial family.
   The Cabinet announced it was considering an amnesty of prisoners
to mark Hirohito's passing, that it was watching ultra-leftists
against the possibility of anti-emperor guerrilla activity, and that
it expected many foreign dignitaries to attend the state funeral.
   Meanwhile, people streamed to the palace in central Tokyo to sign
condolence registers. Sunday morning alone, 44,332 people signed
their names up to 10:30 a.m., the palace said, and the throng was
growing.
   The rain-soaked streets around the palace, normally quiet on
Sunday, were crowded as if it was a weekday rush hour. The crowds
were quiet, the stillness broken only by the chanting of a
half-dozen Buddhist monks who thumped drums and chanted prayers for
the dead emperor.
   Nationwide, 430,000 people signed registers on Saturday, news
reports said.
   The government declared an official six-day mourning period. Many
celebrations, store sales and other events have been canceled, while
others, including a rugby tournament and sumo tournament, were
rescheduled.
   ``The sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has
left me grief-stricken,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said.
``Our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain, and I am at a
loss for words.''
   Workers at train stations, restaurants, stores and airlines
donned black ribbons, and flags were lowered to half-staff or draped
with black bunting.
   Television networks dropped advertising and regular programs to
broadcast documentaries on the imperial family, interviews with
scholars and politicians and reports from overseas on how the
emperor's death was received. Thousands of viewers called to
complain about the changes, while others simply rented videos.
   Many older Japanese, who grew up thinking of Hirohito as a
demigod, expressed sorrow. In Western Japan, an 87-year-old former
Imperial Army soldier hanged himself, saying in a note, ``I want to
follow the emperor in death.''
   ``I heard the news on TV and I could not stay home any longer,''
said a weeping elderly woman at the palace. ``I feel so sorry that
his life was filled with so many difficulties. I pray that he can
rest peacefully now.''
   ``It was a shock when I first heard the news though I knew it was
inevitable and I thought I was ready for it,'' said Tetsuji Kikkawa,
65. ``I have really mixed feeling because I went to the war (World
War II) and many of my friends died for the emperor.''
   Many businesses, from banks to pachinko pinball parlors, stayed
open, but on Saturday night, the bright lights of the Ginza shopping
district and Tokyo's entertainment districts were dark.
   The emperor's death was not expected to cause major disruptions
in business. Stock exchanges canceled their Saturday half-day
sessions but officials said trading would resume this week.
   Officials said 15,000 riot police were mobilized in the Tokyo
area to guard against possible actions by radicals, as both the left
and the right see the emperor as a focus of Japanese nationalism and
militarism. Leftists want the imperial system abolished; rightists
want it strengthened.
   Demonstrators gathered at several locations to protest the
imperial system and the attention given Hirohito's death.
   Police arrested 10 members among some 100 from Japan's largest
radical leftist group, the Chukaku-ha, on charges of possessing
dangerous weapons after they tried to push past police lines with
bamboo poles.
   At another location in Tokyo, 100 people marched for about an
hour but there were no arrests.
   ``We don't want an emperor anymore!'' chanted the marchers, who
carried a banner reading, ``We shall not forget World War II.''
   ``I could not stand the thought that people outside Japan are
going to think all Japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is
crying over his death,'' said protest organizer Ryuichi Harada.
   One passer-by said of the protesters: ``Are they really
Japanese?''

   A Nicaraguan rebel leader was killed
by machine-gun fire as he drove along a highway west of the Honduran
capital, police said Saturday.
   The body of Manuel Adan Rugama Acevedo, 39, also known as
``Commander Aureliano'', was riddled with 26 Uzi machine gun bullet
wounds, police officials said.
   Rugama apparently was alone when he shot as he drove along a
highway west of Tegucigalpa. Officers later found his body on the
street, outside the vehicle he was driving to a friend's home to
attend a birthday party.
   They said they had no more details about the killing.
   Leaders of the anti-Sandinista rebels, known as the Contras,
immediately blamed the Nicaragua Sandinista government for the
killing of one of their regional commanders. They said Rugama had
been scheduled to meet with other Contra leaders in Tegucigalpa that
afternoon.
   The United States supports Nicaragua's Contra rebels, who are
trying to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist government.
   ``The Nicaraguan Resistence profoundly laments this act
perpetrated by the communists of the Sandinista Front, who are our
only enemies,'' said Enrique Bermudez, a member of the Nicaraguan
Resistance Directorate.
   He spoke Saturday in a telephone interview.
   A doctor by profession, Rugama had been a Contra for nine years.
He was the organization's Segovia regional commander.
   Bermudez said Rugama had returned to Tegucigalpa two days ago
after visiting with his mother, Elsa Acevedo, who lives in San
Francisco, Calif.
   Roberto Ferrey, another Contra directorate member, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview Saturday that ``our
organization doesn't have the slightest doubt that the Sandinista
regime sent a commando to Honduras to kill not only Commander
Auerliano, but also other high-ranking members of the Nicaraguan
Resistence.''

   Biting wind, snow and bitter cold continued their assault on the
northern Plains Saturday, while parts of Tennessee and Ohio enjoyed
record highs.
   In Allendale, Ill., a tornado destroyed a quarter of the town's
buildings and caused numerous injuries, officials said. Tornadoes
moved into southwestern Indiana, but officials said the most damage
apparently was in Allendale, which is 130 miles east of St. Louis.
About 600 people live in the town.
   A record 23.1 inches of snow piled up in Fargo, N.D., between
Friday morning and Saturday afternoon, breaking a 1927 mark of 20.5
inches. Grand Forks received 22 inches, while Jamestown and Minot
both recorded 19 inches.
   Wind chill factors hit 50 to 60 below zero in eastern Montana,
western North Dakota and northwestern South Dakota, with 35 to 50
below zero wind chills throughout the remainder of the Dakotas.
   Blowing and drifting snow created near-blizzard conditions and
made travel nearly impossible across much of North Dakota, northwest
Minnesota and portions of South Dakota. In South Dakota, 10 inches
of snow fell in Ludlow and 8 to 10 inches was recorded southwest of
Bristol.
   In Minnesota, a storm dumped as much as 20 inches of snow,
causing many traffic accidents and forcing police to close part of
Interstate 94.
   ``Everyone out there stranded is definitely in a life-threatening
situation,'' said forecaster Rainer Dombrowsky of the National
Weather Service in Minneapolis.
   Dombrowsky said the storm will continue to be ``very dangerous''
as arctic-like temperatures settle in behind the system.
   As of 7 p.m., snowfall amounts included 20 inches in Crookston,
17 in Detroit Lakes, 15 in Park Rapids, 14 in Breckenridge, 13
inches in Thief River Falls and Roseau, and 10 in Big Falls and Sauk
Centre, Dombrowsky said.
   Wet roads turned icy in southeast Nebraska and western Iowa,
affecting traffic in Omaha, Neb., and Des Moines, Iowa.
   Thunderstorms hit portions of Arkansas, with showers reaching
from western Tennessee to southeast Texas.
   High temperature records were set Saturday afternoon in portions
of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and Gulf Coast: Bristol, Tenn.,
had 64 degrees; Mansfield, Ohio, had 54; and Zanesville, Ohio, had
56. Temperatures reached 64 degrees at Columbia, Mo., and 75 degrees
at Little Rock, Ark., by 2 p.m. EST.
   The low of 71 degrees in Houston Saturday morning was the warmest
ever recorded there for the month of January.
   Dense fog extended Saturday morning from northern Missouri and
Iowa across the southern Great Lakes to the central Appalachians.
Visibilities were still near zero Saturday afternoon over eastern
Iowa, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin and in the foothills of
the central Appalachians.
   Snow flurries or snow showers hit much of the West, including
southeast Colorado, portions of Washington, northeast Oregon and
Idaho.
   Temperatures hit a low for the season in Los Angeles at 35
degrees. A few snow showers were reported in California hills near
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. Two inches of snow fell at Pozo,
Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 89 degrees at McAllen,
Texas. The low in the nation Saturday morning was 30 degrees below
zero at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The forecast for Sunday called for rain showersover the
Appalachians, the East Coast from New England to Virginia, interior
portions of the Carolinas, with showers and thunderstorms scattered
from Georgia to southeast Louisiana. Scattered light snow along with
strong winds and cold temperatures were expected to extend from
Michigan across the upper Mississippi Valley to eastern portions of
the Dakotas. Scattered rain and snow showers were forecast for the
Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were expected in the 70s from coastal sections
of the Carolinas across southern Georgia to the central Gulf Coast
region, with 70s and 80s over Florida. Temperatures were forecast
for the 50s over the desert Southwest and portions of California and
in the 50s and 60s from the mid-Atlantic Coast across the southern
Appalachians and the Gulf Coast to the southern half of Texas.
Readings were expected to remain below zero over northwest
Minnesota, most of the Dakotas and eastern Montana, with single
digits and teens from the upper Mississippi Valley across the
central Plains to the northern Rockies. Highs elsewhere were
forecast for the 20s, 30s and 40s.

<HEAD>Detroit Parishes Get Word of Closings, Some Spared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of at least a dozen Roman Catholic
inner-city churches were told Saturday that their parishes will
close by summer, while others rejoiced upon learning they won't have
to sit in someone else's pew.
   The plan first announced in September by the Archdiocese of
Detroit called for closing or merging 48 parishes, the most
widespread move of its kind in U.S. Catholic history. Officials
cited declining membership, a shortage of priests and the increasing
cost of supporting the parishes.
   But according to announcements at services Saturday, three
parishes targeted for closing would be kept open; two would be
merged with other churches; and two would remain open until their
pastors retired.
   At least 18 other parishes mentioned in the original list were
designated as ``questionably viable.'' Each was given six months to
a year to coduct a self-study about its future with the assistance
of archdiocesan leaders, parishioners were told Saturday.
   Nearly two dozen other parishes that did not have Saturday Masses
were to learn their fates Sunday.
   Cardinal Edmund Szoka disclosed his final decisions to pastors in
private meetings last week, giving them permission to release the
information during weekend services. A formal announcement by Szoka
was scheduled for Sunday afternoon.
   Szoka has defended the closings as necessary to wipe out a
``plantation mentality'' in which white pastors and lay people run
churches attended mostly by blacks because of white flight to the
suburbs. But his home has been picketed by both black and white
parishioners in the nation's sixth-largest city.
   At St. Theresa of Avila Parish, which will merge with another
parish, the Rev. Robert Morand said he was asked to keep the news a
secret until his Saturday afternoon Mass.
   ``The idea is that he (Szoka) sticks a dagger in you and says,
`Don't tell anybody it's there until Saturday,''' Morand said. ``I
really believe he sincerely thinks he's right. But he says he's
doing God's will. He has said that often, and I resent it very much.
   ``It isn't God's will. It's a travesty.''
   Attitudes were upbeat, however, at parishes spared closing.
   ``That's wonderful news. What a wonderful way to begin the new
year,'' said the Rev. John Quinn of St. Luke's parish on the city's
west side, whose 70 parishioners learned Saturday their church
earned a one-year reprieve.
   ``We are open and here to do the Lord's work.''

   Emperor Hirohito, once venerated as a living god and
made into the guiding spirit of a world war, today died of
intestinal cancer, ending a 62-year reign that saw his nation
recover from ruin to riches. He was 87.
   Crown Prince Akihito, oldest of the emperor's two sons, became
the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn,
wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperial
seals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed.
   Hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his World
War II role.
   Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required
to approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the
Japanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing and
invasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945.
   His death followed a 3{-month illness during which reports on his
blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routine
and many festivities were postponed or canceled.

   Japan's new imperial era was formally named
``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for Emperor
Akihito's reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,
the government announced today.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi announced the new name,
which will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends Japan's 2,600-year-old
Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Emperor Hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-month
illness. He was 87.
   His oldest son, Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded him.
   ``Heisei'' was chosen for Akihito's reign because the word,
consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning of
achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a statement.

   The Libyan government, challenging U.S.
justifications for the downing of two Libyan jets, claims its planes
were overwhelmed by 14 ``hostile American aircraft.''
   A government spokesman said the U.S. assertion that two American
jets had acted in self-defense after being dogged in the air by the
Libyan MiG-23s was ``a fabrication.''
   The Libyan account _ echoed on national television and by the
official news agency JANA _ appeared intended to counter the U.S.
government's vigorous presentation of its own case.
   Washington has provided television stations with videotape said
to be from Wednesday's attack, as taken by one of U.S. aircraft, and
has shown blurred photographs to the U.N. Security Council of what
it said was a Libyan plane carrying four bombs that was downed in
the encounter.

   President-elect Bush says he will go before a
joint session of Congress soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration to
spell out his idea of a ``flexible freeze'' on spending to bring
down the federal budget deficit.
   Bush, who still has two Cabinet-level vacancies to fill,
announced a series of nominations for top ambassadorships and State
Department jobs Friday, including the selection of his longtime
national security adviser, Donald P. Gregg, as ambassador to South
Korea. He also named Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a protege and
associate of Henry Kissinger, as his choice for deputy secretary of
state.
   The Gregg nomination could spark controversy because of the
involvement of the former career Central Intelligence Agency officer
in the Iran-Contra affair while serving on the vice president's
staff.
   Bush was spending this weekend out of the public eye, with no
indication of when he will name an energy secretary and appoint a
drug-czar.

   Prosecutors in the Pentagon procurement
investigation say an initial 27-count indictment is just the start
of an expected wave of court activity in the prosecution phase of
Operation Ill Wind.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia
said the pace of the investigation that began more than two years
ago is moving with unprecedented speed, given the complexity of the
case.
   ``In the next few months you will see a great deal of additional
activity,'' he said.
   On Friday, a federal grand jury filed the first charges in the
procurement case, accusing a defense contractor, a Navy employee and
five other men with crimes including conspiracy, bribery and theft
of government property.
   Hudson, who is leading the nationwide investigation into the
Defense Department's $150 billion-a-year purchasing system, said the
indictment ``strikes at the very heart'' of alleged corruption in
the procurement process.

   A Polish trawler captain who was afraid his sailors
might try to jump ship in Boston Harbor refused to enter the port,
but 16 crewmen determined to flee their homeland simply hopped
aboard a refueling barge.
   The sailors' decision to jump ship Thursday was the latest in a
wave of defections that immigration officials say is unusual and
puzzling. Forty-eight sailors, all members of Poland's banned
Solidarity union, have fled from three Polish fishing vessels in
Boston in the last month, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials said.
   ``Ship jumping is a very common occurrence in all U.S. ports. But
even so, I don't remember hearing of these kind of numbers,'' said
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the INS in Washington.
   Jervis said he could not understand the defections, because ``if
anything, things in Poland have improved in recent years.''

   Multiple abdominal organ transplants are still
in the early stages of development where failure is common, but hope
remains high despite the death of another toddler following the
risky surgery, experts say.
   ``We're in areas that are essentially unchartered,'' said Dr.
Marc Rowe, chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh. ``What we're doing is making tentative steps and then
very carefully analyzing where we've been and what we've learned
before we make any decision about the next one, when we'll do one or
whether we'll do one.''
   The fifth of six children in the country to undergo a multiple
abdominal organ transplant died Friday. Three-year-old Rolandrea
Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., survived six weeks with a transplanted
liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and portion of a large
intestine, and was awaiting another set of organs.
   Four other recipients died shortly after the transplants, and the
sole survivor, Calvin Oliveira, 14 months, of Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
was doing well Friday, despite a seizure earlier in the week and a
bout of pneumonia, said Dr. Tony D'Alessandro, a transplant fellow
at the University of Wisconsin.
   The boy received a small intestine and liver Dec. 31 at the
University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison.

<HEAD>West Germans Debate Whether to Work on Sunday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public debate about whether they
should work on Sunday is making it hard for citizens of Europe's
richest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the Bible extols and
their constitution protects.
   Most West Germans hew to the tradition of a day on which the
family has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even
discouraged from going next door to play with friends.
   Popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from
prominent people singing the virtues of Sunday in church and at home.
   The constitution provides special protection for Sundays as days
``of rest from work and of spiritual uplift,'' but union leaders say
2.2 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at least
one Sunday a month.
   Hermann Rappe, head of the 630,000-member chemical workers union,
issued the latest call for more Sunday work. Other union leaders
united against him in what one called an ``avalanche'' of opposition.
   Rappe was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper
Osnabruecker Zeitung: ``The unions must be ready to negotiate over
Sunday work for reasons of economics.
   ``I'd prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs in
the Federal Republic (West Germany) rather than in Spain or Greece.
If that's only possible with more work on weekends, the unions can't
simply say no.''
   Business representatives praised him. Klaus Murmann, head of the
national management council, called Rappe's comments a ``beneficial
shot of realism.''
   Leaders of the printers, public workers, office workers, the
mighty, 2.5-million-member steel workers union and some others
didn't find his viewpoint beneficial in the least.
   ``Hermann Rappe's position was not and is not that of the
printers union, spokeswoman Ulla Krause-Schaeuffler told The
Associated Press. ``He has set off an avalanche. We are currently in
negotiations to block Sunday work.''
   Rainer Hillgaertner, spokesman for the public workers, said his
union wants to keep Sunday work to a minimum because ``the cultural
value of having Sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing
profits.''
   Ernst Breit, head of the DGB labor federation, which has 7.7
million members, also has expressed public opposition to work on
Sunday.
   Church leaders, worried about a drop in attendance, have been
steadfast in disapproval.
   ``We stand by our previous positions,'' Lutheran church spokesman
Peter Kollmar told The Associated Press, citing the importance ``of
the observance of the Lord's Day and the cultural role of Sunday.''
   The issue even united Roman Catholic and Lutheran prelates in
1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing further
expansion of Sunday work.
   ``The Bible teaches us: `God blessed the seventh day and made it
holy, because on that day he ceased from all the work he had set
himself to do,'' the statement said in a citation from Genesis.
   ``Remember to keep the sabbath day holy,'' the Christian leaders
added, quoting from Exodus.

<TEXT>
   More than three decades after renouncing his U.S
citizenship and returning to East Germany, novelist Stefan Heym's
American experience continues to infuse his writing and offend his
nation's censors.
   ``From my experience in America I learned to fight back and speak
up,'' the 75-year-old writer said in a recent interview at his East
Berlin home. ``I learned that you don't have to take things lying
down.''
   Heym's critical views have resulted in a ban of almost all of his
later works in his homeland, and he has struggled for more than two
decades with East German censors. His latest book, a voluminous
memoir titled ``Nachruf'' (``Obituary''), has only been published in
West Germany.
   Because of his prominence, East German officials allow him to
publish his books in the West and to accept hard currency royalty
payments.
   He is also permitted to travel freely to the West, a privilege
enjoyed only by a select few of the nation's authors, artists and
trusted party officials.
   ``I'm just too well known now for them to hurt me,'' Heym said,
adding that he has won the grudging respect of party foes in his
clashes with them over the years.
   His first novel, ``Hostages,'' was written in English and
published in the United States in 1942. A movie based on the novel
was released a year later. While his early work received
considerable critical acclaim, most of his novels are no longer in
print in the United States.
   Heym returned to East Germany in the early 1950s after becoming
disillusioned with the advent of the McCarthy era and the American
involvement in the Korean War.
   ``I loved the United States,'' he said.
   ``It was the time of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Then came
McCarthy and it all changed,'' Heym said, referring to
anti-communist hysteria sparked by Sen. Joseph McCarthy that left
hundreds of creative artists blacklisted.
   Heym, the son of a Jewish merchant, was forced to flee Germany in
1933 after the Nazis took power. He traveled first to Prague, where
he worked as a journalist for a variety of left-wing publications.
It was there that the young writer abandoned his given name of
Helmut Flieg and created the pseudonym Stefan Heym in order to
secretly inform his family in Chemnitz (now Karl-Marx-Stadt) that he
had arrived safely in Czechoslovakia.
   In 1935, he received a scholarship from a New York-based Jewish
organization and enrolled at the University of Chicago.
   He stayed on in the United States, writing and editing
anti-fascist newspapers in New York as Adolf Hitler's war engulfed
more and more of Europe. He later served in the U.S. Army in a
special psychological warfare unit in Europe charged with the task
of demoralizing the will of German troops to fight.
   Heym published four novels in the United States before returning
to East Germany, which he said he believed at the time was the
Germany ``where there was the most hope that something new and
better could be forged.''
   The respected Hamburg-based weekly newspaper Die Zeit, however,
in a review of ``Nachruf,'' suggested that other, opportunistic
considerations were also a factor in his decision to return to East
Germany.
   ``The reasons for Heym's return appear well-known _ McCarthyism
and the Korean War,'' Die Zeit said. ``But another factor played a
role _ a lack of artistic success in America. Then came the
fortuituous invitation to return. In this he saw a chance for a new
professional beginning.''
   Heym said that after a brief, uncritical love affair with the
fledgling communist state, he turned more and more to an analysis of
social and political problems that brought a series of stern rebukes
from the party's leadership, who rejected his calls for ``discussion
without taboos.''
   Official dissatisfication over the course of his writing prompted
former East German leader Walter Ulbricht to mockingly refer to Heym
as ``an American writer with an East German passport.''
   He still frequently writes passages in English first because
``its precision and economy demands clearer thinking than cloudy
German.''
   Heym devotes a considerable part of his best-selling ``Nachruf''
to detailing his battle with East German censors and his fight to
break free of ideological limits imposed on his works.
   But it is also a compelling chronicle of Hitler's rise to power
and the fate of a generation uprooted and decimated by war.
   ``This was the most difficult book I have ever written,'' he
said. ``It was an effort at self-accounting on a scale I had never
attempted before.''
   Heym said he used the third person in the memoir as a literary
device in an effort to create a critical distance to his own life.
He evokes a refined sense of history and self-irony in retelling his
own often contradictory political development and the many macabre
and brutal events that shaped the century.
   The narrative distance also helped him come to terms with the
loss of relatives murdered by the Nazis. Three of Heym's five aunts
were murdered in Nazi death camps, along with a daughter he never
knew. Many of his friends died in concentration camps or were
executed for resistance efforts.
   Heym said he hoped that ``Nachruf'' would someday be approved for
publication in East Germany, although he predicted that it would not
happen anytime soon. The government has begun to gradually soften
its stand on several of his earlier books, approving the publication
of two novels over the next two years.

<HEAD>Short Films Go A Long Way for Polish Director</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Krzysztof Kieslowski, the director of ``A
Short Film About Killing'' and ``A Short Film About Love,'' believes
the human condition can be expressed by the ways people observe and
ignore the Ten Commandments.
   The winner of the first European Film Prize, who sees human
frailty in its purest form, has set out to do short films about all
10.
   But anyone expecting nicely packaged sermonettes in Kieslowski's
decalogue will find the effect quite startling.
   ``A Short Film About Killing'' contains what he believes is the
longest murder in film history, nearly eight minutes of brutality
that he himself describes as too horrible even for a horror film.
   ``A Short Film About Love' speaks equally of loneliness and need,
leaving the viewer scoffing at the superficiality of most
relationships and rethinking the common assumption that true love
brings happiness.
   Long one of Poland's leading filmmakers, Kieslowski has remained
relatively little known in the West. But these ``sophisticated and
strange tales'' _ to use the words of one Polish critic _ may cause
that to change. Already they have brought him far more acclaim than
he ever expected.
   ``Killing'' recently won the first European Film Award, a
statuette called ``The Felix,' in West Berlin. The prize, to be
awarded annually in a different European city, is intended to be
Europe's answer to the Academy Awards. Last May, the film won the
1988 Jury Award at the Cannes Film Festival.``Love'' has been
submitted as Poland's entry in the Oscar's best foreign film
category.
   Kieslowski, 47, an intense, ironic filmmaker whose past work has
focused on people faced with ambiguous moral and political choices,
has finished shooting the other eight films of his decalogue and is
editing them for state-controlled Polish TV.
   ``It's not a religious inclination to make the Decalogue,'' he
said in an interview, ``it's just a look at how difficult it is to
live, how complicated life is.
   ``Moses came up with the Decalogue 6,000 years ago. Nobody has
ever questioned it _ no ideology, no politics. (And yet) we violate
it every day. That's interesting.''
   Interesting enough for Kieslowski to work harder than he ever has
in his life, he said. Instead of his usual pace of one film every
four years, he is making 10 in a space of three years.
   ``Americans are always saying that if there is something good,
you should shoot it immediately. And they are right. That's how it
happened with the Decalogue. ... I'm surprised no one ever thought
of it earlier.
   The first commandment that he completed was the fifth, Thou Shalt
Not Kill. It resulted in the starkly titled ``A Short Film About
Killing.'' The screenplay, which Kieslowski co-authored with a
lawyer who is active in political causes, portrays the murder of a
taxi driver by a young criminal and the youth's subsequent execution
for the crime. The initial murder lasts seven minutes, 44 seconds.
   ``Film killing has its own form,'' Kieslowski said. ``We know how
one kills or gets killed in movies. Unfortunately, in real life, one
has to work very hard to kill a man. It's hard work.''
   The ruthless hollow-cheeked killer, played by Miroslaw Baka,
struggles for what seems an eternity to strangle and beat to death
the much larger taxi driver and then drag him down a river bank.
Strangely, by the end of the film _ which portrays Warsaw's mean
streets at their meanest _ the audience is able to see the killer as
a victim too.
   In Poland, the film has given impetus to a drive to outlaw
capital punishment, a goal which Kieslowski readily endorses.
   The movie ``is against the death penalty because it is against
killing, any form of killing. Because I think that relations between
people have become too brutal.''
   Abruptly shifting gears from killing to love, Kieslowski made a
haunting film about the crystalline love of an innocent 19-year-old
for a worldly woman in her mid-30s whom he observes with the aid of
a telescope from his room in an apartment block opposite hers.
   The film, which refers to the Sixth Commandment, ends with their
positions reversed and the woman longingly watching for the boy
through the window. Love fails to bring happiness, but afterwards
they are ``wiser, better people,'' said Kieslowski.
   The critical acclaim for the films is a complete surprise, he
said.
   ``Beginning the screenplays and beginning the production, we
really did not have any idea they would go beyond Poland,''
Kieslowski said.
   ``They are such small films ... very short, cheap films. It
seemed to me they were unusually local, although obviously we were
trying to give them a universal character.''
   ``Killing,'' is being shown in France and it to be distributed
throughout Europe. He said it may eventually be sold to an American
distributor for the U.S. market.
   For Polish audiences watching the films, there is unflinching
faithfulness to the realities of life here, from a cafe that is out
of tea at midday to the windswept, barren apartment blocks where
families are packed like so many sardines.
   However, Kieslowski is not striving to portray life in Poland but
values that apply equally everywhere in the world.
   ``It's the same experience for an American, for a German, for a
Frenchman, even for a Japanese. ... Everyone is afraid of death, no
matter what party he belongs to.''
   He said portraying such elemental, universal values was his main
aim. ``Maybe I did not always succeed, but I was trying to make them
in their purest forms.''
   Although critical of Poland's political system, Kieslowski has
continued to work within the state-controlled film industry rather
than go abroad or underground. But he now avoids political themes in
his work.
   ``I stopped being interested in politics a long time ago,'' he
said. ``I hope it's for good, because it set me free.''

   After a rip-roaring 1988, the film industry
anticipates _ with wary optimism _ a new season that will bring such
surefire moneymakers as Indiana Jones and the ``Star Trek'' gang, as
well as the return of ``The Fly'' and those hilarious folks of
``Police Academy.''
   If box-office hopes are somewhat guarded, that's because the
movie menu is leaner than usual. Last year's 22-week writers' strike
has finally been evidenced in fewer releases for the pre-summer
season, traditionally a slow period. The fall stepup in production
assures that the rest of the year will bring a plentiful supply.
   A cautious note is supplied by Daily Variety's Art Murphy. After
noting that the 1988 domestic (U.S. and Canada) gross would amount
to a record $4.4 billion, he added a historical note: Previous
industry booms have lasted 30 to 42 months, followed by an average
18 months of recession. The current prosperity began in June 1986.
Hence a downturn is due, according to business cycles.
   The most awaited film event of 1989 is Paramount's ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade,'' coming on May 24. The two previous
adventures starring Harrison Ford rank among the top 10 moneymakers
of all time. The new collaboration of Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas has the added allure of Sean Connery as Indiana's father, Dr.
Henry Jones.
   Paramount plans a one-two punch that might help restore its
position as the top-grossing releasing company, the crown now held
by Disney's Buena Vista. June will bring ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier,'' directed by Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner.
   Buena Vista hopes to hold its position with a varied program. The
dramatic ``Beaches,'' with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey as
longtime friends, goes into national release this month. On the
lighter side are two crime-oriented comedies, ``Three Fugitives''
with Nick Nolte and Martin Short; ``Bank Job'' with Corbin Bernsen,
Reuben Blades and Lou Diamond Phillips; plus a re-release of ``The
Rescuers.''
   Episodic films are rarely proved successful, but Disney is trying
again with ``New York Stories,'' a trilogy with films by Woody
Allen, Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese.
   Comedies have dominated the year-end product, and they will be in
big supply this year. They include:
   _ ``Major League,'' a story of baseball misfits with Tom
Berenger, Charlie Sheen and Corbin Bernsen.
   _ ``Let It Ride,'' Richard Dreyfuss as a gambler trying to get
rich against all odds.
   _ ``Cousins,'' Ted Danson and Isabella Rossellini in an
Americanized ``Cousin Cousine.''
   _ ``The Experts,'' John Travolta and Ayre Gross involved in a
Soviet plot in deepest Nebraska.
   _ ``The 'Burbs,'' Tom Hanks, Carrie Fisher and Bruce Dern in a
suburban comedy.
   _ ``Se You in the Morning,'' Farrah Fawcett and Jeff Bridges in a
story of divorce and remarriage.
   _ ``Bert Rigby, You're a Fool,'' Carl Reiner directs a comedy
with music. Robert Lindsay, the Broadway sensation in ``Me and My
Girl,'' stars.
   _ ``Penn and Teller Get Killed,'' the two comedians in a film
directed by Arthur Penn.
   _ ``Who's Harry Crumb?'' John Candy as a bumbling detective.
   _ ``Chances Are,'' a supernatural comedy with Cybill Shepherd,
Robert Downey Jr., Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.
   _ ``Skin Deep,'' John Ritter as a hard-drinking author with
writer's block.
   Adventure and horror also figure in the pre-summer schedule.
Among the offerings: ``Farewell to the King,'' Nick Nolte in a World
War II story laid in Borneo; ``Pink Cadillac,'' Clint Eastwood as a
fugitive hunter (not Dirty Harry); ``Dead Bang,'' Don Johnson as an
L.A. cop tracking a killer across the country; ``Millenium,'' Kris
Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd in a time warp caused by a jetliner
collision; ``The Witches,'' Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling
trying to turn the children of England into mice; ``Speed Zone,''
Brooke Shields, John Candy, Tim Matheson and a large cast in a
cross-country auto race.
   Tri-Star Pictures is offering a few musicals in the coming
months: ``Tap,'' Gregory Hines as a tap dancer returning home from
prison; ``Sing,'' a young cast in a song-and-dance competition in
Brooklyn high schools.
   Aside from the newcomers, such holiday holdovers as ``Rain Man,''
``Twins,'' ``The Naked Gun'' and ``Working Girl'' can be expected to
remain profitable well into the new year.

   For the 17 months since a disturbed man
walked onto the KNBC news set and pointed a toy gun at consumer
reporter David Horowitz, he has waged a personal campaign against
lookalike play weapons.
   Horowitz, a 22-year veteran reporter who covered the Vietnam war
for NBC, has had some of his longest days and nights wrangling with
manufacturers and retailers over toy guns that look like the real
thing.
   It was just such a phony weapon, a Daisy BB pistol that looked
like a Colt .45 automatic pistol, that Gary Stollman pointed at
Horowitz on Aug. 19, 1987, as he demanded that Horowitz read a
handwritten statement while on the air.
   Horowitz complied, but the broadcast went nowhere after a few
seconds because KNBC news director Tom Capra ordered the station to
``go to black'' _ shut down the broadcast signal.
   ``I was lucky I had my reading glasses on,'' said Horowitz,
referring to the bizarre, barely legible statement handed him by
Stollman.
   During the short time the incident was on the air, Horowitz
calmly asked the name and hometown of Stollman, the son of a KNBC
reporter whose contract was not renewed that summer.
   ``It was the only thing I could think of,'' Horowitz said. ``I
also thought that if I could get out a few hints to police of who
this was and where he was from, they could follow leads.''
   The broadcast journalist was questioned by Stollman about the
sudden appearance of the ``stand by'' messages on studio monitors.
Technicians were on strike at NBC at the time, and Horowitz told
Stollman that while there occasional difficulties, the station was
still probably on the air.
   The last lines of Stollman's note stated the gun he was holding
was a harmless toy. When Horowitz read that, the 33-year-old man put
the pistol down and was rushed by waiting police as news anchor John
Beard grabbed the gun.
   Stollman later was placed on three years of intensively
supervised probation.
   Horowitz, meanwhile, intensified a campaign he had already
started against the marketing of realistic toy guns.
   The effort, almost a second career, comes in addition to his
consumer reporter job at KNBC and his syndicated ``Fight Back''
television show.
   Burbank, the city where KNBC's studios are located, was the first
locality to ban the sale of the toy guns, in August 1987. Los
Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco followed suit. And in October of
1988, California Gov. George Deukmejian signed a statewide ban on
the sale, manufacture and distribution of replica firearms.
   But a few weeks after the state legislation was signed, Horowitz
got a telephone call from Washington which told him all his personal
campaigning was about to be crushed.
   A congressional source told him that Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.,
had attached a rider to a late-session energy bill. The rider called
for some part of toy guns to be made of bright orange plastic, and
the federal law would supersede the tougher state and local laws
already passed.
   ``I took this very personally,'' said Horowitz, who has
campaigned in 15 states and as many as 30 cities across the country.
He also estimates he has received 75,000 pieces of mail over the
months on the subject of toy guns.
   Horowitz spent the next few days on the telephone. He said a toy
manufacturer lobbyist didn't return his call. Neither did Dole,
although members of his staff told Horowitz they were unaware of the
impact the rider could have on state and local laws.
   Horowitz said Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson and Rep. Mel
Levine, all of California, helped frame compromise wording that
leaves tougher state and local laws in effect.
   The language about using bright orange plastic remained, and
Horowitz has criticized it because fluorescent orange tape can make
a real gun look like a toy or black paint can make a toy gun look
real.
   ``But what I didn't want to see most of all was a bill that would
have killed state and local legislation on guns,'' said Horowitz,
``And we did get the pre-emption clause out of the bill.''
   Horowitz estimates the toy industry makes $300 million annually
from the sales of all types of toy guns.
   ``They tell me that kids want to play with toy guns and parents
want to buy them. But the bottom line is bucks,'' he said. ``I'm not
saying kids shouldn't play with toy guns, but they should play with
toy guns that look like toys.''

<HEAD>Positive, But Not Definitive, Signs From Retail, Auto Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers went on a spending spree in the last
days of 1988, but while retailers and automakers are basking in the
glow of impressive sales gains, few observers expect their good
fortune to continue.
   The nation's biggest retailers had expected only a modestly good
Christmas season following nearly two years of sluggish sales, but
were pleasantly surprised when a last-minute burst of gift buying
gave them stronger-than-anticipated results.
   Analysts estimated the retail industry's December sales rose in a
range of 6 percent to 7.5 percent from a year earlier, better than
the 6 percent gain forecast before the start of the holiday season.
   Meanwhile, sales of domestically-produced cars and light trucks
soared 20.7 percent in the last 10 selling days of the year.
   The spurt boosted total sales of cars and light trucks to 15.44
million vehicles in 1988, up from 14.9 million in 1987. Most auto
industry analysts had estimated U.S. and foreign car makers would
sell about 14.5 million cars and light trucks in 1988.
   But despite that stellar performance, Ted Sullivan, an economist
with Wefa Group, an economic forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said the yearend surge in auto sales was ``a one-time deal.''
   Very attractive incentives by dealers ``kicked up the selling
rate a bit the last 10 days of December,'' but the trend won't last
because interest rates _ and the cost of financing a new car _ are
moving higher, he said.
   ``We're looking for car sales to continue to weaken _ and they
have weakened,'' Sullivan said, noting that while cars sold at an
annual rate of 10.8 million cars in early 1988, sales later slipped
to a rate of 10.2 million.
   Auto and retail sales are watched closely as barometers of
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of the economy's growth. A
sharp drop in consumer spending could send the economy into a
recession.
   Sales at general merchandise and apparel retailers began to slump
nearly two years ago, although overall consumer spending generally
increased. Americans were paying more money for services and
necessities _ including cars _ and so had less money for what
economists call ``discretionary spending,'' on items such as
clothing and furniture.
   Christmas 1987 was a disappointment for many retailers, and they
went into the 1988 holiday season _ when they generally make half
their annual sales _ with lowered expectations. But consumers came
through, especially in the last days before Christmas.
   Retail industry analysts are split now over whether Americans are
likely to resume their cautious stance.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.,
said, ``Consumers are in a mood to spend,'' but at the same time, he
said, the retailers' recent sales gains cannot be sustained.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., predicted
that with the holidays over, consumers would again be hesitant.
   One thing is certain: No one will be sure about a sales trend
until several more monthly sales reports come out.
   In other business news this past week:
   _The government said the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in
December from November's 5.4 percent, indicating the economy remains
robust. In other reports, the government said construction spending
increased for the third consecutive month in November while factory
orders rose modestly.
   _Braniff Inc. said it would buy as many as 100 jets from Airbus
Industrie in a $3 billion as part of a plan to expand the regional
carrier, which has undergone three changes in owners and
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in recent years.
   _Published reports said Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which is
in the process of acquiring RJR Nabisco Inc., was considering a bid
to buy MCorp., a Texas banking firm. Kohlberg Kravis refused to
confirm or deny the reports, which said the investment firm could
get about $1 billion in federal aid if it acquires MCorp.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was suspended from participating in
a $500 million New York City bond issue in the wake of its agreement
to plead guilty in a federal securities fraud probe.

<HEAD>Caution Prevails In First Week Of Bond Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond traders rang in the new year the same way
they rang out the old _ with worries about inflation, the dollar and
the stubborn trade and federal budget deficits lingering like a bad
hangover.
   ``I think it's going to be a difficult year for the financial
markets,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International.
   He and a number of other economists are predicting that interest
rates will head higher in the first half of 1989 due to the overall
strength of the economy, although some experts are slightly more
optimistic about the near-term.
   ``The Fed may do a little snugging here and there, but no major
moves are needed,'' Brusca said. ``I think they tend to feel that
interest rates are already high enough.''
   Short-term rates, in particular, rose sharply in 1988, reflecting
the Federal Reserve's desire beginning last March to tighten credit
to prevent inflation from heating up. Longer-term rates remained
fairly stable, though.
   That same trend continued into the first week of trading in 1989,
causing a more pronounced inversion of the so-called yield curve,
which illustrates the difference between short- and long rates and
normally slopes upward.
   ``We're seeing a flatter yield curve overall,'' said Mitchell
Held, chief economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   For instance, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill has
risen 0.21 percentage points to 8.52 percent since the end of last
year, while the yield on the 30-year bond moved up only 0.08
percentage points to 9.06 percent.
   Part of the reason for the rise in short-term rates so far this
year is that fact that the federal funds rate, the interest banks
charge each other on overnight loans, has remained relatively high.
   Some analysts say the rise in the fed funds rate represents
merely a carryover of yearend corporate demand for money, but others
say the Fed could do more to keep a healthy dose of reserves in the
banking system.
   ``There are a lot of things the Fed could have said and done ...
and didn't,'' said Held.
   Still, interest rates and bond prices remained relatively stable
in the first week of 1989 trading, mainly because of the dollar's
surprising strength in foreign exchange. Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.'s Treasury Bond Index, which measures the price of all
outstanding Treasuries, rose marginally since the end of last year.
   ``This strength in the dollar is giving us some breathing room in
the year,'' said Brusca.
   The U.S. downing of two Libyan jets in the Mediterranean this
past week had helped push up the currency, since the dollar is often
considered a safe haven amid international tension.
   The dollar still remains a major concern among bond traders this
year, analysts say, since the market sentiment toward it remains
fairly bearish. A weak currency makes dollar-denominated bonds less
attractive to foreigners and often sparks higher inflation, which
erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
   Besides the lingering trade and budget deficits, which helped
spark the 1987 stock market crash, bond traders this year remainly
acutely worried about inflation as evidence points to a generally
strong economy.
   ``You're not going to see inflation falling,'' said Brusca, who
noted that the businesses are still using their plants and equipment
to near capacity.
   One bit of positive news this past week, however, came from the
December unemployment data. Although the jobless rate last month
fell to 5.3 percent, dropping back to a 14-year low, many economists
noted that average annual earnings remained unchanged for a third
consecutive month and that the average factory work week declined.
   ``That isn't symptomatic of a booming economy,'' said William V.
Sullivan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<HEAD>Market Bids To Dispell Crash Memories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is no easy undertaking, but the stock market
has been doing its best lately to dim investors' memories of the
1987 crash.
   In the early days of 1989, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials has rallied to its highest levels since the collapse.
   In fact, the Dow has moved to within hailing distance of its
2,246.74 close on Friday, Oct. 16 _ the session before it took a
508-point drop on Black Monday.
   If the Dow were to complete the mission of recouping its Black
Monday loss, it would naturally serve as a morale booster on Wall
Street. But the prospect hasn't stirred up much excitement just yet.
   For one thing, legions of the smaller stocks not represented in
the Dow remain well below their pre-Black Monday levels.
   The industrial average itself still stands more than 500 points
below its peak of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Furthermore, the market's latest advance has failed to dazzle
some of the Street's chart-watching analysts.
   ``We would caution against characterizing this as a chart
breakout that would suggest significantly higher levels,'' said
Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   As it moved to a new post-crash high, Zinder pointed out, the Dow
remained within the confines of a gradually rising trend that has
been in force for a year.
   The skeptics also wonder how far stock prices can go while
interest rates are high and rising.
   Widespread expectations persist in the financial world that the
Federal Reserve will soon raise its discount rate, the charge it
sets on loans to private banks, from the 6{ percent level that has
prevailed since last summer.
   Such a move would mark the third consecutive increase in a
sequence dating back to September of 1987.
   That, in turn, would invoke a warning indicator known as the
``three steps and a stumble'' rule developed years ago by the widely
respected analyst Edson Gould.
   Under this rule, three discount rate increases in a row signal a
commitment by the Fed to tighter credit that is stringent enough to
put the stock market in jeopardy.
   ``One thing which has never changed and which never will change,
in my opinion, is that sharply rising interest rates will eventually
cause a sharply declining stock market,'' asserted Charles LaLoggia,
a Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser.
   Despite such concerns, the Dow Jones industrials rose 25.72
points to 2,194.29 in the four sessions that made up the first
trading week of the year.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.70 to
157.96; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 3.36 to 384.74, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 5.39 at 311.40.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 153.39 million shares a day, up
from 114.15 million the week before.
   ``One of the first lessons a new investor learns is that the
stock market dislikes rising interest rates,'' said James Stack,
whose InvesTech advisory letter is published in Whitefish, Mont.
   ``Not only does it give competing investments such as bonds and
money market funds an edge, but higher rates eventually slow the
economy. That leads to lower corporate profits.
   ``Bull markets rarely occur without favorable monetary
conditions. It's very unusual for investors to mount a sustainable
long-term advance while the Federal Reserve is putting on the
brakes.''

<HEAD>Wages Flat As Unemployment Matches 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wages remained flat in December as the nation's jobless rate
retreated to its 14-year low of 5.3 percent, according to a
government report that indicates continued growth without worsening
inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 3.75 points to
2,194.29, its highest point since the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   Bond prices posted healthy gains. The dollar also rose.
   Ordinarily a drop in the jobless rate scares the bond market
because it raises concerns that the economy is overheating, causing
inflation that undermines the value of fixed-income investments.
   Inflationary pressures could prompt the Federal Reserve to
tighten credit by boosting interest rates, something that hurts both
stocks and bonds.
   But analysts said the employment gains were expected, and they
noted that average wages remained flat at $9.45 an hour for a third
month. That eased inflation concerns.
   The jobless rate averaged 5.5 percent for all of 1988, down from
6.2 percent in 1987, the Labor Department said.
   ``That gives some support to the notion that we have a strong
economy but it hasn't set off a new inflationary spiral yet,'' said
Carol Stone, an economist with Nomura Securities International Inc.
   December's civilian unemployment rate was down 0.1 percentage
point from November, hitting 5.3 percent for the third time in 1988,
the lowest level since the 5.1 percent of May 1974.
   Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 new
jobs last month, bringing to nearly 3.8 million the number of jobs
created during the year, the most since 1984's total of 3.95
million, the department said.
   Economists said inflation remains a threat.
   ``It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear,''
said economist Roger Brimmer of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting service. ``With the economy continuing to operate
at these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is,
inflation is going to keep creeping up.''
   ``The economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are not
accelerating very much right now,'' said Washington-based economist
Michael K. Evans. ``But I still think there is higher inflation
ahead, perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it. We
could get a big jolt in inflation in January.''
   When Reagan took office in January 1981, unemployment was 7.5
percent. It rose to 10.8 percent late in the 1981-82 recession, the
highest level in four decades, before beginning to decline.
   The number of workers employed part-time because they cannot find
full-time work also was unchanged over the past year, remaining at
5.3 million.
   An alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the
1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the United
States was also 5.3 percent last month, unchanged from November.
   The dollar rose sharply for a third straight day as traders
interpreted comments by a West German official as being bullish for
the U.S. currency.
   Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of the Bundesbank, said the
West German central bank had not intervened recently to influence
exchange rates. Dealers took that to mean the bank would not try to
limit the dollar's rise. But the German central bank and the Federal
Reserve did sell dollars on Friday.
   The dollar's rise helped support bond prices.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 21-32 point,
or about $6.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 9.03 percent
from 9.08 percent on Thursday.

<HEAD>Oil Investors Remain Confident</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concerns about OPEC's intentions over the next
six months remain evident in the oil futures market, but overall
investors remain confident.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose
13 cents to close at $17.55 a barrel Friday. The contract recovered
on Thursday to post a gain of 34 cents after losing 28 cents on
Wednesday.
   Analysts noted that although investors have appeared optimistic
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick
to its new six-month production agreement prices for contracts
between March and June showed only small gains of between 5 cents
and 6 cents a barrel.
   ``Although there has been a steady growth in confidence, prices
still favor the near-buy months,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., ``so confidence erodes as the
months go out.''
   The 13-member cartel agreed late last year to cut back production
to 18.5 million barrels a day starting Jan. 1 from over 22 million
barrels a day. A worldwide oversupply of oil has kept crude prices
weak.
   Since the accord was announced, prices have risen from around the
$13 level.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, domestic
heating oil futures closed narrowly mixed. Analysts said cold
weather has not affected heating oil prices significantly because of
adequate supplies and forecasts of warmer weather.
   The February contract for home heating oil closed 0.13 cent
higher at 53.60 cents a gallon after rising 0.82 cent in Thursday's
session. Other contract months ended the day mixed.
   Gasoline futures followed crude oil, with the February contract
settling 0.32 cent higher at 47.72 cents a gallon. Other contract
months also ended mixed.
