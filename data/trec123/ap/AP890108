   Bourhane was repairing his radio Christmas Day
when the Chinese crowds came.
   ``Down with black devils!'' they shouted. ``Black devils, go
home!'' The chants echoed off the walls of his dormitory at the
Nanking Polytechnical Institute.
   ``I thought they wanted to kill me, kill all of us from Africa,''
said the 23-year-old student from the African country of Comoros,
who uses one name. ``I started pacing the room. My sweat was cold.''
   For the next four days, thousands of Chinese youths marched
through Nanking's streets, shouting racist slogans and calling for
the punishment of African students who brawled with Chinese at a
dance when the Chinese objected to the Africans bringing Chinese
women.
   The racial incidents, which began in Nanking at the Christmas Eve
dance and spread to three other cities, were fueled by a mixture of
racism and political restiveness. Chinese youths wanted to express
anger and frustration. Africans were an easy target.
   In Hangzhou, Africans boycotted classes because they said
university operators were telling Chinese that all Africans have
AIDS. In the central city of Wuhan, Chinese youths threw rocks at
foreign students' dormitories. And in Beijing, Africans at one
college stopped going to class after Chinese protested an alleged
assault by a black man on a Chinese woman.
   African students have been coming to China since 1959 as part of
Beijing's policy of asserting a role of leadership in the Third
World. Today, about 1,500 African students a year receive Chinese
scholarships.
   But African-Chinese relations are strained. Many Chinese are open
about their disdain toward black people.
   ``When I look at their black faces, I feel uncomfortable,'' a
25-year-old said during a demonstration in Nanking. ``When I see
them with our women, my heart boils.''
   Most Chinese have little or no contact with different races or
cultures, so a foreign face naturally draws attention. But Africans
say the Chinese treat whites and other Asians better.
   ``Not a day goes by when I'm not insulted,'' said Billy Sissoko,
a student from Mali. ``Today someone looked at my skin and asked me,
`After six years in China, why haven't you become whiter?'''
   Chinese often say they find dark skin ugly because it implies
that a person engages in manual labor _ still not a glorious calling
in this dictatorship of the working class.
   Black gods in Chinese mythology are invariably wicked. ``Black
children'' is the name given to unplanned children.
   Chinese also look down on those poorer than themselves, and many
African nations fall into that category.
   This feeling of superiority turns to resentment when Chinese
discover that African students in China receive about 10 times the
monthly stipend of about $6 given Chinese students.
   Add the issue of women to this mixture of economic and cultural
prejudice, and the situation becomes explosive.
   Most African students in China are men, sent here for as long as
six years. They say it is only natural they should mix with the
local women. Many Chinese object.
   One night, Sun Min, a 20-year-old woman in Nanking, invited an
African man and a white American woman to dinner. Later, she said,
her neighbors gossiped: ``You had a foreigner to dinner, that's not
bad. But how could you also invite a black man?''
   The Chinese government insists racism does not exist in China and
that it played no part in the recent confrontations.
   The official Xinhua News Agency blamed the clashes in Nanking on
a group of Africans and said Chinese demonstrators who shouted
``erroneous slogans'' were immediately stopped.
   Xinhua also accused The Associated Press, the Voice of America
and Agence France-Presse of distorting the incidents by reporting
the racist elements in the clashes.
   By the third day of demonstrations in Nanking, protesters had
turned their wrath from the Africans to the Chinese government. A
main concern was that Africans should not receive special treatment
under Chinese law.
   In effect, students used the demonstrations to attack ``special
privileges'' given to foreigners. The Christmas Eve clash gave them
an excuse to address a sensitive political issue without confronting
it directly.
   ``It doesn't matter if you're a foreigner or Deng Xiaoping's son,
if you break the law, you must be punished,'' said one Chinese
student in Nanking. ``That's why I am marching.''
   Chinese students who marched in Beijing last Tuesday echoed the
call.
   ``We are Chinese and we feel the law isn't protecting us,'' one
woman said. ``What good is the law then?''
   African students say the only way to change Chinese attitudes
toward blacks is through education.
   ``But these people don't want to learn about Africa,'' said Tchek
Baisa, a student from Zaire. ``They don't need us anymore.''
   Indeed, Chinese foreign policy has changed since the 1960s and
'70s, when Third World solidarity was a central priority. Now
China's main focus is on Western trade and investment.
   In Nanking, Bourhane said he didn't think much would change.
   ``Really, I just want to go home, before things become too much
worse,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked To Bar Execution Of Mentally Retarded People</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The legality of executing mentally
retarded people is being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court
this week by a Texas murderer with the mind of a 7-year-old.
   The high court Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments on
whether executing Johnny Paul Penry for a 1979 rape-slaying would be
``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution.
   A federal appeals court previously rejected Penry's arguments.
   The 32-year-old Penry has an IQ estimated at between 50 and 60.
His schooling consists of a few days in the first grade, and he was
in and out of mental hospitals while growing up near Houston.
   ``I was abused _ treated like a dog. My mother broke my arm about
eight times. My left arm is three inches shorter than my right,''
Penry said in an interview last summer.
   Convicted of rape in 1977, he served two years of a five-year
prison term. Three months after his release, he was charged with the
murder of Pamela Mosely Carpenter, a Livingston housewife who was
raped, beaten and fatally stabbed with scissors she was using to
make Halloween decorations.
   Penry's case is the second within a year to result in Supreme
Court review of the Texas capital punishment law, which since 1974
has sent nearly 300 men and women to death row. Since 1976, when the
high court allowed capital punishment to resume, 29 men have been
put to death in Texas _ more than any other state.
   Among them was Donald Gene Franklin, whose attorneys last year
argued that Texas jurors were not allowed to consider mitigating
circumstances such as his good behavior in prison in deciding
whether he should be put to death.
   Penry's case is viewed in part as a follow-up to Franklin's,
whose challenge was rejected in June by a 6-3 vote. Franklin was
executed Nov. 3.
   The court will be asked to consider whether jurors should have
considered Penry's retardation before deciding to impose a death
sentence and whether anyone with Penry's mental capacity ever should
get the death penalty, said Penry's attorney, Curtis Mason.
   A court ruling that people with Penry's mental capacity should
not be executed could have major, nationwide impact, according to
Bob Walt, an assistant Texas attorney general who handles capital
cases.
   ``You can always find psychiatrists who come in and say this
person is mentally retarded,'' Walt said.
   Mason is optimistic about a ruling in his favor and sees Penry
getting a new trial or having the death sentence commuted to life.
He dismissed the idea that many killers would contend they are
retarded to avoid the death chamber.
   ``With somebody who is retarded, there generally is a long
history,'' Mason said. ``With Penry, his history goes way back. When
he first was diagnosed as retarded, he was 9.''
   Walt, however, said the Penry case already has resulted in
execution delays for inmates who are not retarded but claim to be.
   ``I have six or seven where they brought in a psychiatrist and
say he's mentally retarded,'' Walt said. He added that Penry is the
only Texas death row inmate considered retarded by state officials.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox said that although Penry has
low intelligence, he was aware of what he was doing when he raped
and killed Mrs. Carpenter.
   ``His IQ may be below 70,'' Mattox said. ``But the question is
whether or not he can adapt his behavior to what he knows is right
and wrong, and there's no doubt in this particular case that he
knows the difference between right and wrong. He had enough
intelligence to know if he raped a victim that he needed to kill the
victim.''
   A Supreme Court decision is not expected for three or four months.
   Penry, who says he can't remember the year he was born and barely
can write his name, haltingly told interviewers of his ``miserable
childhood'' and said: ``I do need help _ all that I can get. I don't
think by executing me they can get the job done.''

   Cuban troops who fought South African
forces in Angola say they have done their duty and are ready to
leave under an accord intended to secure independence for Namibia
and peace in this war-torn nation.
   The 450 troops, officers and non-commissioned officers form the
first group of a contingent of 3,000 Cubans who must leave Angola by
April 1 under terms of the accord signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa.
   All Cuban troops, estimated at 50,000 to 52,000, must be out of
Angola by July 1, 1991.
   ``We've done our duty, we've helped the Angolan people. Now it's
time to go home and resume our studies,'' said Daniel Felipe Manero,
a 21-year-old anti-aircraft gunner from Matanza, Cuba who spent two
years at a base in Menongue in southern Angola.
   Manero and other soldiers met reporters Sunday at the Futungo
transit camp outside the Angolan capital.
   Cuban government spokeswoman Eurina Cabral said the 450 will
leave Tuesday for Havana following a ceremony to be attended by
top-ranking Cuban military officials, including Deputy Armed Forces
Minister Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra.
   Cuba's military involvement in Angola began in 1975 with
Operation Carlota, an airlift of troops to back the fledgling
government of the Angolan Popular Liberation Movement just after
Angola gained independence from Portugal.
   Immediately after independence, the Cuban-aided forces began
fighting South African- and U.S.-supported rebels of UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for control of
the country.
   There is some question of how a U.N. observer force of 70
military officials and 20 civilians will actually monitor the
departures of tens of thousands of Cubans from several ports and
airports around the country.
   ``What is important is that it has een agreed the Cubans should
leave,'' the U.N. observer force chief, Brazilian Gen. Pericles
Ferreira Gomes, said in an interview. ``In what kind of transporter
or how many at a time are just details.''
   ``We are relying on the good word of both countries (Angola and
Cuba) and the important thing is they are agreeing to the
withdrawal,'' he said.
   Angola and Cuba have asked the United Nations to pick up the $800
million tab for the Cuban pullout, which Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos has said will proceed at a rate of 2,500-3,000
soldiers per month.
   Ms. Cabral said she had no details on who was paying what, but
``something is certainly being worked out.''
   She also asked for the remains of all Cubans killed in Angola to
be returned to Cuba. She could not supply casualty figures, but some
Western intelligence sources put the figure at about 5,000.
   Throughout the war, the policy has been to bury the Cuban dead in
Angola.
   Under an Aug. 22 cease-fire, South African forces withdrew from
southern Angola across the border to Namibia, a territory
administered by Pretoria since World War I.
   But Angola's rebel UNITA forces were not party to U.S.-brokered
talks that led to the cease-fire, and they continue to skirmish with
Angolan troops.
   The United States says it will continue to help UNITA until both
sides in the civil war sit down and talk, something President dos
Santos says is out of the question.
   Gen. Venancio Avila Guerrero, commander of Cuban troops at the
decisive battle of Cuito Cuanavale this spring, when the Cubans
routed South African forces in southern Angola, said he had no
doubts Angola's government forces would be able to handle the battle
with UNITA alone.
   ``They've been ready for years. They can take care of this and
morale is high,'' he said as Cuban troops, some of them women with
their hair in rollers, played a game of volleyball in the scorching
midday sun.
   UNITA representatives claim many Cuban soldiers will remain in
the country as Angolan citizens married to local women.
   ``That's total lie. There's not one Cuban married to an Angolan
woman or staying here,'' said Lt. Jesus Abad from Pinar del Rio in
eastern Cuba. ``We're professionals who came to do a job, and now
we're leaving.''
   Army reservist Olga Lidia Rodriguez Proenza was 20 when she
arrived in Angola from her hometown of Hologuin two years ago as a
volunteer in a public health team.
   Like many others at the camp, some of whom have also served in
Nicaragua and Ethiopia, she said she planned to resume studies in
pharmacy once back in Cuba.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Rush Of Diplomacy Marks End Of Reagan Era</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Has any one told Ronald Reagan he only has less
than two weeks left in the White House? He's not conducting his
foreign policy that way.
   Consider the following actions by the Reagan administration in
the past month:
   _ Reagan met in New York with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who announced a decision to reduce the Red Army by
500,000, helping redress the military imbalance that Reagan made a
campaign issue in 1979 _ a decade ago.
   _ Reagan on Dec. 15 authorized a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization following statements by PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat renouncing the use of terrorism and accepting two U.N.
resolutions that recognize the right of Israel to exist;
   _ Reagan agreed, after holding out for years, to a Soviet
proposal for a multinational human rights conference in Moscow. The
Moscow session would come in 1991, following similar meetings in
Paris and Copenhagen over the preceding two years.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz launched a diplomatic
initiative to curb the proliferation of chemical weapons, following
the reported use of such poisons by Iraq in its war with Iran and
Iraq and reports that Libya had built a chemical weapons plant.
   _ American forces bloodied the nose of Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the man Reagan loves to hate, as two U.S. F-14 Tomcat
fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23's that the Pentagon says
approached with hostile intent.
   That's an active foreign policy agenda, compared to that of
previous recent presidents as they awaited their successors to take
office.
   Two years ago, as Reagan was embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair,
few predicted that he would close with such a flurry. But in
December 1987, the man who had severely criticized previous arms
controls treaties signed one of his own, eliminating medium-range
Soviet and American nuclear weapons.
   And in May 1988, the president who five years earlier called the
Soviet Union the ``Evil Empire'' traveled to Moscow to bless
Gorbachev's reforms.
   In some of these instances, Reagan may have been reacting rather
than acting. And many people believe that President-elect Bush,
despite his denials, already has become the de facto president, with
Reagan spending much of his time in California.
   One student of the presidency says the recent activism probably
would have been impossible if Mike Dukakis had defeated Bush.
   ``If Dukakis had won, there would be less chance that he could
pull it off,'' said Samuel Kernell, a professor of political science
at the University of California at San Diego.
   ``What Reagan has done is likely to have been cleared by the Bush
people and is not likely to be undone by Bush'' after Jan. 20, said
Kernell.
   And it is no coincidence that Reagan's activities have been in
the foreign rather than the domestic realm, said Kernell.
   ``Foreign affairs is one area in which presidents can act more or
less on their own,'' said Kernell. ``The only problem that they face
is that foreign leaders are less interested in them.
   ``But for once it was in the Soviets' interest to continue
working with Reagan. That was probably helped by fact that Bush was
Reagan's protege.''
   One liberal critic of Reagan, John Steinbruner of the Brookings
Institution in Washington, said that ``although there has been a set
of events that gives great promise, I don't think the administration
initiated them.''
   ``This business about chemical weapons is driven by international
events,'' Steinbruner said. ``The Libyan plant was just finished and
the international conference was scheduled for a long time.
   ``And clearly Gorbachev set the schedule for the troop reductions
in Europe.''
   Despite the skepticism, Reagan's finale compares favorably with
his predecessors'.
   President Carter, defeated by Reagan in November 1980, spent his
last 444 days preoccupied with the American hostages, who were
released by Iran on the day Reagan took office.
   President Gerald Ford, beaten by Carter in 1976, left little
imprint on U.S. foreign policy during his 29 months in office.
   President Nixon spent his last months in office battling the
Watergate scandal, which forced him to resign on Aug. 9, 1974.
   President Johnson surprised the nation, and many of his closest
advisers, with the televised announcement in March 1968 that he
would not seek re-election, and spent last nine months in office
futilely seeking a solution to the Vietnam War.

   The government said Saturday it
will ask the United States to help battle an electricity shortage
that has reduced working hours, curtailed transportation and even
trimmed television broadcasts.
   Public Works Minister Rodolfo Terragno, who is traveling in the
United States, is to meet with U.S. energy officials on Tuesday in
Washington, the state-owned news agency Telam said in a communique.
   Terragno also will seek World Bank financing to accelerate the
completion of a large thermoelectric station in Bahia Blanca, 418
miles southwest of Buenos Aires.
   There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Embassy.
   A month ago, the government took steps to curtail electricity
consumption, including rotating power cuts of up to six hours a day,
reduced street lighting, and cutbacks in the hours of operation of
subways and television stations. Even clocks were set ahead by one
hour.
   Hundreds of thousands of state workers were given Friday and
Monday off with pay as government offices closed in response to
temperatures in the mid 90s and lack of air conditioners.
   The government attributes the situation to drought, which lowered
water levels in the rivers that feed Argentina's hydroelectric
projects; and to equipment breakdowns at several fossil fuel power
stations.
   Also, the smaller of the country's two commercial nuclear
reactors is out of service.
   Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party's candidate for
president, attributes the situation to the government's ``lack of
foresight, the lack of responsibility and lack of ability to manage
the energy sector that is so important.''
   The Department of Energy calculated two weeks ago that of a total
installed capacity of 12,118 megawatts, the national power grid was
producing only 2,500 kilowatts.
   The situation has wreaked havoc with daily life. The stock
exchange suspended operations briefly last Thursday, newspapers have
missed press runs, people have been stranded in elevators, sections
of the capital are without water due to the shutdown of electric
pumps.
   ``We are really close to a blackout,'' the president of the
state-run electric utility Segba, Pablo Caravelli, said.

   The United States and the Soviet Union will share
information on suspected narcotics smuggling and will cooperate in
scientific research under agreements to be signed in the French
capital, U.S. officials said Saturday.
   The research accord, to be signed Sunday by Secretary of State
George P. Shulz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, covers
geosciences, engineering, chemistry, mathematics and problems of the
Arctic.
   Later this year the two governments will hold negotiations to
implement the framework agreement, according to a statement by the
U.S. delegation attending a chemical weapons conference.
   Also under the agreement to combat drug trafficking, the two
governments will consider an exchange of experts and methods of
intercepting drugs.
   The narcotics agreement recognizes an acknowledgement by the
Soviets that they, like the United States and most countries of the
world, are experiencing a problem.

   An 87-year-old man hanged himself Saturday in
western Japan after leaving a note saying he wanted to follow
Emperor Hirohito in death, police said.
   A duty officer at National Police Headquarters said Umanosuke Ue
used twine to hang himself in a shed near his home in Wakayama,
about 280 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ue's eldest
son found the body and note about seven hours after the emperor died
of intestinal cancer Saturday.
   The police officer said the note read in part, ``I want to follow
the emperor in death.''
   Kyodo News Service said Ue once served in the Japanese Imperial
Army. It said he had shown no signs of poor health but was proud of
being born the same year as Hirohito.
   In ancient Japan, samurai warriors sometimes killed themselves to
follow their lords in death. In modern history, Gen. Maresuke Nogi
and his wife killed themselves on the day of Emperor Meiji's funeral
in 1912.

   Official trade unions have pledged to
strike and mount other protests if wage and social reforms fail to
offset price increases planned by the government, a union newspaper
said Saturday.
   Also Saturday, an apartment renters' group asked the government
in an open letter to refrain from planned increases in water and
sewage costs in order not to aggravate social tensions.
   The two separate reactions to the government's program were a
clear indication that it will face difficulties in imposing price
boosts of up to 15 percent on a variety of goods and services.
   A quarter of consumer prices are to go up in the near future,
government spokesman Gyerogy Marosan announced on Jan. 2. The
increases will affect food, transportation, water, and home-heating
fuels.
   The trade union daily Nepszava reported that a Friday session of
leaders of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions said, ``The
successive price increases have touched off social tensions that
absolutely require state authorities to take concrete steps in
coming months to work out and introduce, as soon as possible, a wage
and social policy reform.''
   In the open letter to Premier Miklos Nemeth, the leaders of the
Association of Apartment Renters strongly rejected planned water and
sewage rate boosts.
   The letter, quoted by the daily Magyar Nemzet, referred to ``a
situation where the rents actually paid for apartments, shops,
offices, workshops, storeroom ... more than cover the costs of
maintenance, and a profit of about 400 million forints (about $8
million) has been amassed by the offices handling this (state)
property.''
   Referring to ``responsible politicians'' predicting social
tensions, the association said, ``We question the correctness of
deepening this further by increasing the sums payable by renters in
this unjustified, unfounded and unjust and unlawful manner.''

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday pushed forward its
efforts to cool triple-digit inflation with measures that included a
28.5 percent devaluation of the currency.
   The package, which took effect Saturday, is the third in a series
of devaluations and austerity measures since September. They are
aimed at controlling rampaging inflation, which hit an all-time high
of 1,722 percent last year.
   In the latest measures, the center-left, populist government of
President Alan Garcia devalued the Peruvian inti from 500 to 700 to
the dollar, lifted the price of basic foods an average of 60
percent, and boosted salaries for most workers by 30 percent,
according to the government paper La Cronica.
   ``This third package of measures forms part of a policy to
progressively reduce inflation, while promoting exports and slowly
diminishing food subsidies,'' Economy Minister Carlos Rivas said in
announcing the program late Friday night.
   He has predicted the 1988 inflation figure will be cut by half
this year.
   But independent economists say the program has not gone far
enough in reducing the government's heavy spending policies. They
forecast inflation this year of at least 6,000 percent.
   The official rate valued the inti at 33 to the dollar before the
September devaluation.
   Analysts say rocketing inflation coupled with a dramatic
shrinkage of the economy last year, estimated at 8.4 percent, have
hit Peru's working class and its poor the hardest.
   They say the deteriorating economy and an eight-year insurgency
by leftist guerrillas have undermined government stability. Rumors
of a pending military coup have periodically sprung up in recent
months.
   The economic woes began to mount late in 1987 when dollar
reserves dried up and the government continued its spending program
despite a widening fiscal and trade deficits, a cutback in
investment and lack of fresh loans to bolster the dollar reserves.
   In Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast of Lima, police said Saturday
that Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrillas used explosives and
machine guns to ambush and kill three policeman in a jeep.
   Officials say rebel violence claimed nearly 2,000 lives last year
and more than 12,000 since 1980.

<HEAD>Judge Orders City To Provide More Beds, Shelter For Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeless residents and their advocates won a
victory Saturday when a judge ruled the city must be prepared to
open new shelters within three days in neighborhoods where existing
shelters fill to capacity for two consecutive nights.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Harriett R. Taylor also
said the city must make available within 72 hours 50 additional beds
for single women.
   Taylor ordered the actions during a special weekend court session
in response to a suit filed by the Community for Creative
Non-Violence and several homeless men and women.
   In a highly critical four-page order, Taylor said the city must
immediately provide the space for single women, who have fewer
shelters available to them than men.
   ``This extraordinary session also must be contrasted with the
actions of the District of Columbia government, which are a classic
example of `too little and too late,''' said Taylor.
   Talyor said the city's actions in response to the need for
shelter by the homeless was ``so inadequate and so inept'' that the
court was forced to ``step in with an extraordinary remedy.''
   About 200 homeless people and advocates gave the judge a standing
ovation upon hearing the ruling.
   The judge set no limit on the number or cost of the additional
space the city must provide.
   ``We're spending between $18 million and $20 million on the
homeless, and that's more per capita than any other city in the
country,'' said John White, a spokesman for Mayor Marion Barry in
disputing the judge's characterization of city efforts on behalf of
the homeless.
   The district's corporation counsel said the city would appeal the
ruling.

<TEXT>
   Tornadoes tore through several Illinois,
Indiana and Kentucky towns Saturday, injuring more than 40 people
and destroying a third of the homes and commercial buildings in this
town, officials said.
   The tornado cut through a 10-square-block area and ``most homes
are flattened and businesses are destroyed'' in that area, said
Wabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds from an emergency command post
in the local bank.
   About 35 percent of the town's 275 buildings were demolished and
half were damaged to some extent, said Grounds.
   Mayor Jack Loeffler estimated that six to eight people had been
temporarily trapped ``in rubble, but I think they've all been
rescued.''
   He said all but four or five people had been accounted for by
mid-evening in the town of 600, and emergency workers searched
door-to-door to make sure no one remained trapped. Allendale is
three miles from the Indiana border, about 130 miles east of St.
Louis.
   ``There were numerous injuries, but as far as we know, no
fatalities,'' said Trooper Harry Sutton of the Illinois State Police.
   The only fire house in the rural community was destroyed and the
only school was heavily damaged, according to Grounds.
   June Lofton, spokeswoman for Wabash General Hospital in nearby
Mount Carmel, said 39 people, including at least six children, were
treated for injuries ranging from cuts and scratches to spinal
injuries.
   ``We're talking about people who were buried under buildings ...
major injuries,'' she said.
   Lofton said at least 10 people were admitted and six were
transferred to other area hospitals.
   ``People's houses were blown away with them in them,'' Lofton
said. ``It's really been quite a disaster.''
   Gerald Waldroup, administrator of Lawrence County Memorial
Hospital, about 25 miles north of Allendale, said five people were
brought to the emergency room. Four were treated for scratches and
cuts. The fifth, an 18-month-old boy with a head injury, was
transferred to an Indiana hospital.
   Minutes before the tornado stuck Allendale, twisters hit nearby
Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said. A tornado later struck an
area south of Vincennes, Ind., but Allendale appeared to have been
hit the worst, they said.
   Thunderstorms moved into Missouri, Indiana and Illinois,
producing golf ball-size hail near Carbondale, Ill., and near
Washington, Ind., the National Weather Service said.
   The storm system, which originated in Illinois, appeared to have
lost strength as it moved in a northeasterly direction through
southwestern Indiana, authorities said.
   Near Vincennes, which is on the Illinois border 40 miles north of
Evansville, two people were treated for minor cuts at Good Samaritan
Hospital in Vincennes after their mobile home south of the city was
blown over, said hospital nursing supervisor Janet Sheirmann.
   Knox County Sheriff Don Kirkum said the tornado struck an area
southeast of the city known as Saint Thomas about 6:45 p.m.
   ``Damaged or destroyed were approximately 30 homes and 25 to 30
farm buildings,'' Kirkum said in a statement released to the media
about 11:30 p.m. ``Most power and telephones are not operable at
this time, and it is not known how long it will be before service is
restored.''
   In the Indiana town, children wept inside a car outside their
home, which appeared to have been destroyed with its roof and sides
ripped away. It was one of at least half a dozen homes damaged along
a single road in Vincennes.
   ``I don't know what it was,'' said the man inside the car.
   The storm struck Vincennes Lincoln High School on the city's
southside and knocked out power during a junior varsity basketball
game. The remainder of the game and the varsity contest that was to
have followed were postponed.
   Dispatcher Bob Street of the Martin County Sheriff's Department
said extra officers were on duty ``in case something happens.''
   A spokesman for the Starke County sheriff's department said it
had received reports of homes damaged near Knox.
   In Kentucky, officials said a tornado touched down in the
south-central town of Franklin late Saturday night, causing some
damage to businesses and homes.
   A dispatcher for the Franklin City Police said a Ford
autodealership was ``practically destroyed'' and several apartment
buildings were damaged in the east and south ends of the community
of 7,700.
   There were no initial reports of injuries or fatalities.
   The National Weather Service in Louisville said the tornado was
reported about 10:38 p.m.
   Meanwhile in Wisconsin, thick fog covered much of the state,
interfering with airport travel in the area. At 6 p.m., visibility
was reduced to a quarter mile at Mitchell International Airport in
Milwaukee.
   Airport spokesmen said some flights were diverted or delayed,
affecting about 80 percent of the day's normal traffic.
   The Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball team could not get
home by plane from Baltimore because of fog at Mitchell and
Chicago's O'Hare airport, team spokesman Bill King said.
   The players landed instead at Grand Rapids, Mich., ``the nearest
they could get,'' and resumed their trip by bus, King said. It meant
postponement by at least an hour of Saturday night's game in
Milwaukee against the Utah Jazz.

<HEAD>Soviets To Begin Destroying Chemical Weapon Stockpiles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS background, minor reorganization
throughout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will start destroying its massive
stockpiles of chemical weapons this year, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced Sunday.
   Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons,
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union is finishing construction of a
plant to eliminate chemical arms that will go into operation this
year.
   Representatives of other countries will be invited to visit the
facility, he said. He did not elaborate.
   He said that some might ask whether the Soviet Union waited too
long to stop production and the answer would be: ``Yes, we did, in
fact wait too long ... We are quickly making up for time lost over
the past two years.''
   The Soviet position has ``changed quite radically'' in recent
years, Shevardnadze said. The Soviet Union has gone from
``manufacturing to abandoning altogether'' chemical weapons.
   ``In the course of the year 1989, we will begin elimination of
chemical weapons stockpiles at a facility built for that purpose,''
he said.
   In April 1987, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his
country had stopped manufacturing chemical weapons. In October, the
Soviet Union destroyed some chemical weapons in front of a group of
Western observers, but this was done to illustrate openess on the
subject and not as part of a program to begin destroying the toxic
agents.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been the only
countries to acknowledge producing and stockpiling chemical weapons.
The United States says it produces the arms to counter those
produced by the Soviets.
   In 1987, the Soviet Union declared it had 50,000 tons of chemical
weapons. Western military experts put Soviet stockpiles at between
100,000 and 500,000 tons.
   The United States has about 30,000 tons, officials say. After an
18-year lapse, the United States resumed production of chemical
weapons in December 1987, saying that much of its aging stockpile
was obsolete.
   Shevardnadze called on other countries to end production of
chemical weapons. Without referring to the United States by name, he
said, ``there is another country that possesses equally significant
chemical weapons stockpiles and who could share with us the task of
finding compromise solutions in the interest of comprehensive and
global verfication.''
   The United States also has invited the Soviet Union to inspect a
facility used for eliminating obsolete chemical weapons, but the
Soviets have not accepted the invitation.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union wants to see a convention
banning use, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons signed
this year.
   Negotiators have been at work in Geneva for 17 years on such a
convention, but an accord has been blocked over a variety of
problems, especially verification.
   A 1925 Geneva Protocol, the only existing accord, only bans the
use of chemical weapons, not their production or storage, and has no
enforcement power.
   The Paris conference, attended by 145 nations, aims to reaffirm
the Geneva Protocol and press negotiators in Geneva to conclude
successful negotiations on a global ban.
   Iran has condemned Iraq for using chemical arms in the Persian
Gulf war, the most recent verified use of the weapons.
   The United States has accused Libya of constructing a chemical
weapons plant, but Libya says the plant at Rabta is for
manufacturing pharmaceuticals.

   Tamil guerrillas ambushed Sri Lankan
and Indian army patrols in two separate incidents that left at least
six soldiers and a civilian dead, military officials said Sunday.
   Three Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and three were seriously
wounded in an attack Saturday night near Padaviya, 145 miles
northeast of Colombo, said officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Guerrillas hiding in dense jungle on both sides of the road
opened fire with machine guns and pistols when the army truck
approached, they said. Afterward, the guerrillas fled into the
jungle with four Chinese-made T-56 semiautomatic rifles seized from
the truck, said the officials.
   The civilian driver also was killed.
   The officials said the attack was mounted by guerrillas of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil, the biggest of the Tamil separatist
groups fighting the Sri Lankan government.
   In the other attack, Tamil guerrillas killed three Indian
soldiers at Trincomalee, 147 miles northeast of Colombo on Saturday,
the officials said.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Militant Tamils seek an independent state in the northeastern part
of the island nation to combat what they say is discrimination by
Sinhalese, who dominate the government and comprise 75 percent of
the population.
   Indian peacekeeping troops were dispatched to Sri Lanka in July
1987 to try to disarm the Tigers, whose insurrection has claimed
more than 8,500 lives in six years.
   Last week, India began withdrawing some of its 50,000 troops from
the island. One battalion of 2,500 to 3,000 men has left.
   More will be withdrawn in phases ``depending on the situation on
the ground,'' according to an Indian diplomat who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

<HEAD>North Korean Art Works Imported, First Direct Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 600 North Korean art works
have arrived in South Korea, marking the first direct trade between
the two rival Korean states, government officials said Sunday.
   The paintings and pottery worth $104,000 were imported by Daewoo
Corp. of Seoul in a direct deal with a North Korean trading firm,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was the first direct deal between the two Koreas since the
Seoul government lifted a ban on trade with North Korea in October
as part of its new policy of seeking improved relations with the
communist state.
   The art works will be sold to the public after display at major
department stores in Seoul and other cities, the officials said.
They did not say how the goods arrived in South Korea, but they are
believed to have been transported by ship via a third country.
   The government has said no duties would be levied on imports from
North Korea because they would be regarded as internal trade.
   Several other trading houses in Seoul are reportedly moving to
import fish, coal and other industrial raw materials from North
Korea under the new government policy, the officials said.
   They said direct trade between the two Koreas is expected to
increase as North Korea appears to be willing to open its society to
the outside world. The two Koreas were divided in 1945.
   Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman of South Korea's giant Hyundai
group, has been invited to visit North Korea to discuss investment
and other development projects there.
   Chung, originally from North Korea, said before his departure for
the Soviet Union last week that he would discuss investment in hotel
projects at Mount Diamond, a scenic tourist spot on North Korea's
east coast. His birthplace is near the mountain.
   In a related development, industry sources said Hyundai has
received a $270 million Soviet order to construct nine oil tankers
and multipurpose merchant ships in South Korea.
   The terms of the Soviet order, including financing, were not
disclosed, but the sources said they were related to Hyundai's plan
to participate in the development of Siberia.
   Chung is currently in the Soviet Union to discuss the deal, they
said. Before his departure for Moscow, Chung said he would visit
North Korea later this month.

<HEAD>The Reagan Common Dominator: Change, Change, Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years have passed since Ronald Reagan
arrived in Washington promising many things, but with one common
dominator: change.
   ``We may not run this like a quarter mile, but we're going to run
it,'' Reagan said on his first full day in the job of president.
   ``We're going to make some changes, if for no other reason than
that they have to be made. The people are waiting for us to do it.''
   He exits this month, that promise kept. With his era over and his
presidency a matter for the historians, what can be said of the rest
of Reagan's promises? On what did he deliver, and on what did he
fail?
   There are plenty of partisan opinions. The Democrats even
published a book cataloging their view of Reagan's broken promises
four years ago, when he faced re-election.
   Reagan swept Democrat Jimmy Carter from office in 1980 with a
pledge to improve the economy at home and to improve America's
standing abroad. Central to this goal was a trio of promises: he
would cut taxes, build up the military, and balance the budget.
   So how is two out of three?
   Reagan won from the Democratic Congress a 25 percent reduction in
federal income tax rates. He later engineered a broad rewrite of the
tax laws that eliminated many deductions in exchange for reduced tax
rates _ all in the name of simplification.
   Yet he supported tax increases too, and followed the 1981 tax
cuts a year later with a $98 billion tax increase.
   The nation's military defenses grew with infusions of new money
for sophisticated weapons systems, and his administration will be
remembered for what is often called the Reagan military buildup.
   It was a buildup, in fact, that leaves Reagan's successor with
crushing demands for more money to continue _ so much so that the
ability to prune Pentagon wish lists was a central factor in
President-elect Bush's search for a defense secretary.
   But it was the federal budget deficit where Reagan clearly
failed: Not only did it not go lower, it mushroomed. The nation, it
turned out, could not generate growth as a result of the tax cuts
sufficient to balance the budget. And there were no budget cuts
sufficient to do the job either.
   Reagan's targets for a balanced federal budget kept getting put
off. He never submitted a balanced budget to Congress, and the
annual deficit grew to nearly $200 billion a year before starting to
head down in his last years.
   Democrats love to point out that the nation's total debt under
Reagan was more than that sustained under all the presidents before
him. Federal debt was under a trillion dollars when he took office
in 1981; today it is more than $2.6 trillion.
   But Reagan delivered on much of his economic promise. Inflation
abated. After an early recession that helped wring spiraling prices
from the economy, growth was steady. Indeed, peace and prosperity
was a powerful argument for his vice president's campaign to succeed
him last fall.
   Reagan also came into office promising to prune the thickening
vines of the federal bureaucracy. His first official act was to
impose a freeze on the hiring of most civilian federal employees.
   He pledged to eliminate the two Cabinet-level creations of the
Carter administration _ the Education and Energy departments. Both
survived.
   What's more, the size of Cabinet government grew. In his final
year Reagan endorsed, then signed into law the creation of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, out of what was the independent
agency known as the Veterans Administration.
   Yet the Reagan years were characterized by annual attempts to
trim government by cutting the federal budget. He succeeded in his
stated goal of reducing the rate by which federal spending grows
each year.
   Cries against the ``Reagan budget cuts'' were an annual
occurrence. Domestic programs fell victim.
   Gone now are many programs that were aimed at helping urban
America: revenue sharing, the embattled CETA job-training program,
Urban Development Action Grants. Federal housing assistance was cut
dramatically, drawing protests from the nation's mayors.
   Ironically, some of these had Republican, not Democratic,
origins. Revenue sharing, string-free payments to local governments,
was a pet project of Richard Nixon.
   Cutting government regulations was another promise Reagan brought
to Washington, and one he pursued while here.
   The airline industry, for one, has been remade as a result of
reduced government regulation. Although the foundation was laid for
that by the Carter administration, Reagan pulled deregulation levers
where he could.
   The results remain a matter of debate. Many rules are gone, but
many remain in place, too.
   Reagan had plenty of other aims. Call them promises or not, many
fell short. His plan for ``new federalism,'' returning food stamps
to state and local governments, and swapping some other welfare
programs along with the means for paying for them, never got off the
ground.
   He kept promises to back vouchers or tax credits that would help
students attend private schools, but he didn't win them from
Congress.
   No one expected a perfect record, however. And in his inaugural
address eight years ago, Reagan stated what may have been his
priority promises.
   ``It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government
back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden,''
Reagan said. ``These will be our first priorities, and on these
principles there will be no compromise.''

<HEAD>Money Is Foremost Among the Issues Facing State Lawmakers in '89</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Money _ how to raise it, how to spend it _ will preoccupy state
lawmakers as they get down to work in 1989, with every legislature
trying to squeeze the most out of state tax dollars.
   For some, it will be a Chinese puzzle that nonetheless will have
to be solved _ there just isn't enough money coming in to cover
required outlays. Most states will be able to make it by sticking to
fairly tight budgets. A lucky few will be able to salt money away or
give breaks to taxpayers.
   Bound up in the legislative purse strings are calls to improve
education, including raises for teachers; relieve prison
overcrowding; repair highways; lower property taxes, and spend more
on human services ranging from fighting drug abuse to cleaning up
the environment.
   There are also non-money items: AIDS legislation in Virginia,
Utah, Illinois; the death penalty in Rhode Island and Kansas;
insurance reform in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South
Carolina, and government restructuring in Mississippi and North
Dakota.
   Finances loom foremost. The National Conference of State
Legislatures, in a survey released Friday of staff analysts in the
50 legislatures, found that more than half said the main fiscal
issue was obtaining enough revenue to balance state budgets. Other
findings showed a broad concern for the soundness of state finances.
   ``We are literally being tugged at from all sides, and frankly I
don't think our resources are able to be stretched much further,''
said Senate President Philip Rock of Illinois, where Gov. James R.
Thompson has campaigned unsuccessfully for an income tax increase
the past two years.
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about tax
increases. However, the idea is being considered in states with the
biggest money woes: West Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Arizona
and Louisiana.
   West Virginia, with a budget of only $1.46 billion, may be the
worst off. It will need an additional $290 million in revenue to
meet bills in the new fiscal year, said House Finance Chairman
George Farley, and that's without a newly uncovered loss in
investments and other setbacks totaling $390 million. Farley said a
tax increase of $75 million to $80 million is necessary, and a sales
tax on food, abolished in the early 1980s, may reappear.
   New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses from previous years
quickly turn into deficits.
   Massachusetts has a projected shortfall of at least $636 million
in the current $11.6 billion budget, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
recently proposed laying off 300 managerial employees and other
spending cuts. Many believe he will seek an increase in the gasoline
tax and a cut in capital gains tax deductions.
   New York is short by more than $1 billion this year, according to
Gov. Mario Cuomo. For the fiscal year beginning April 1, Cuomo has
estimated that even with his less-then-inflation budget he will need
an additional $700 million in revenue, and he has already proposed
increasing ``sin taxes'' on cigarettes and alcohol to raise about
$200 million. The third year of a three-year tax cut could be
delayed, too, although Cuomo is reluctant to do so.
   The riches-to-rags example is not lost on well-off states like
Hawaii, Kansas, Idaho, Utah, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon,
Virginia and Wisconsin. ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right
now, and we all look good for re-election,'' said Hawaii House
Finance Committee Chairman Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest
thing?''
   For the majority of states, which fall somewhere in the middle,
there will be hard choices. Many have balanced-budget requirements
in their constitutions.
   Minnesota is in far better shape than it was two years ago, and
Gov. Rudy Perpich's biennial budget is expected to be $13.9 billion,
a 14.5 percent spending increase that would be achieved without
raising taxes. But even so, ``it's a very, very, very, very tight
budget,'' he said. ``I mean, tight budget. Some of the favorites
that I've been very supportive of _ be it the arts, tourism _ it's
just not there this time.''
   Educational spending ranks high on most states' lists.
``Education and economic development go together,'' said Max Coll,
chairman of New Mexico's House Appropriations and Finance Committee.
``Who is going to relocate or expand in a state that doesn't offer a
really good education system at both the public school and higher
education levels?''
   Even after budgets are settled, lawmakers won't lack items to
debate. Rising auto insurance rates are expected to come under
scrutiny in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. California
is awaiting the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a
citizens' initiative passed in November that requires a 20 percent
rate rollback for most kinds of insurance.
   There may be an effort to repeal Illinois' year-old requirement
for premarital testing for exposure to the AIDS virus. In Utah,
there are bills calling for mandatory reporting of people who test
positive for the virus, mandatory testing of inmates and a
strengthening of laws to protect the privacy of AIDS patients.
Virginia's General Assembly also will consider bills requiring AIDS
tests for sex-crime suspects and making it a felony to knowingly
donate or sell AIDS-tainted blood.

<HEAD>Restaurant Reopens After Fatal Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOVELAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hugs and tears marked the reopening of the
Riverhouse Restaurant, where a customer, a waitress and a gunman who
held 20 people hostage were shot to death four days earlier.
   All but three of the 35 employees showed up to greet customers
Saturday night at the restaurant after waitress Sally Mills and
customer Fenton Crookshank were killed in the bloody finale to
Tuesday night's siege.
   ``The next day I was ready to board this puppy up,'' said Bruce
Copp, who has owned the restaurant for two years. But the people of
Loveland, 35 miles northwest of Denver, held true to the city's name
and showered the restaurant staff with support.
   ``They have been non-stop in their calls of support,'' Copp said.
``That's probably one reason that we're going on.''
   The other reason is the strong bond among employees.
   Copp said his employees met to discuss their emotions after the
ordeal and decided to get back to work.
   Investigators say the gunman, Wayne Strozzi, apparently went
berserk after his estranged wife refused to go back to him. Police
say Strozzi then ambushed two law enforcment officers, wounding one,
before running into the restaurant and taking some 20 people hostage
Tuesday night.
   The siege ended when police shot Strozzi, who then apparently
killed Ms. Mills as he lay dying. Crookshank was accidentally killed
by police as he tried to escape through a window.
   When the restaurant's doors reopened Saturday, there were a few
hugs and a few tears as the regulars came in first. The phone rang
and rang.
   Copp, who said he was nervous about what to expect from the
customers, relaxed as the seafood and steaks started arriving at
tables.
   As he rang up his first sale Saturday at the cash register where
Strozzi took his first hostage Tuesday, Copp said it was like
starting over again.
   ``I feel like we're opening up for the first time,'' Copp said
with a smile.

<HEAD>State-By-State Wrapup Of Top Issues Before Legislatures</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-State Issues Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of the top issues facing the 50 state
governments in 1989:
   Alabama: Tax reform has been placed at the top of Republican Gov.
Guy Hunt's agenda, but political paralysis may doom any efforts.
   Alaska: Because of the decline in oil revenues, the state is
facing an estimated $1 billion budget deficit that's expected to
mount over the next 18 months unless spending is cut.
   Arizona: The state must have a balanced budget, and it is agreed
that it will cost $300 million to $350 million over this year's $3
billion budget to fund current programs. Revenues, meanwhile, are
expected to grow by only $120 million or so, leaving a gap of $180
million to $230 million.
   Arkansas: Gov. Bill Clinton has proposed $211 million increase in
general taxes, mainly to increase spending on education, chiefly for
the salaries of public school teachers and the needs of colleges.
   California: Gov. George Deukmejian is to unveil the state's $40
billion-plus budget this week. Last year's budget finished in the
red, and this year's could too. Looming is a long-term debate over
insurance reform proposals following voter approval of Proposition
103, an insurance reform initiative requiring a 20 percent rate
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of
insurers. A challenge is pending before the state Supreme Court.
   Colorado: Colorado's constitution prohibits deficit spending, but
for the past decade lawmakers have had to struggle, cutting programs
and raising taxes to keep the state in the black, and the outlook is
no different this year. Other issues are overhauling the state's
deteriorating highways and constructing new ones, education, the
environment and government efficiency.
   Connecticut: The state has a $134 million budget deficit this
year, and Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill has said tax increases
will be necessary. Some programs and services also will have to be
cut back, he said. Other issues include school desegregation,
specifically in cities where there are high percentages of minority
students; criminal justice; and prison overcrowding.
   Delaware: The No. 1 issue is establishing a statewide paramedic
service. Highway safety may also become a pressing issue this year,
and there is talk that legislation calling for mandatory seat belt
use could be introduced again.
   Florida: Gov. Bob Martinez and legislative leaders agree that
Florida's overcrowded prisons and making do with existing revenues
are top challenges in the state this year.
   Georgia: Gov. Joe Frank Harris is proposing the first tax
increase since 1971, a 6 cents per gallon increase in the state's
motor fuel tax, now at 7.5 cents per gallon. The money would be used
to finance an accelerated road construction program and free funds
now being used for roads for other purposes.

   Hawaii: Improvements in the statewide school system probably will
top the agenda after a consultant's study gave the public schools
bad marks in many areas. Also likely are calls for tax cuts or
rebates in the face of a $400 million-plus surplus over the state's
$6 billion biennial budget.
   Idaho: What to do with a state budget surplus and how much money
to pump into the education system are the big issues. Idaho ended
the fiscal year June 30 with $14 million in the bank, and the
surplus at the end of the current fiscal year could easily be $20
million.
   Illinois: The General Assembly is confronted by whether to raise
taxes to expand state spending after two years of lean budgets.
Republican Gov. James R. Thompson campaigned unsuccessfully for a
state income tax increase for the past two years and has indicated
he will do so again this year. But there's been no sign of tax
increase opponents backing down. Also likely on the agenda is an
effort to repeal Illinois' premarital AIDS testing law.
   Indiana: The state must come up with a two-year budget for the
period beginning July 1, but it is in good shape financially.
Lawmakers will consider educational funding, ways to cushion the
impact of reassessing residential property, and what sort of state
gambling to allow, including a lottery or pari-mutuel betting on
horses.
   Iowa: The formula through which the state spends just over $1
billion on elementary and secondary education expires this year, and
legislators must devise a new one. This seems certain to lead to
battles between urban and rural areas. A similar formula allocating
money for highways also must be replaced. All sides agree that the
state faces a deficit _ estimated from $65 million to $120 million _
in the fiscal year beginning July 1, but there are no plans for a
tax increase.
   Kansas: Lawmakers must decide how much of a state surplus to
return to taxpayers, and by what method _ cutting income tax rates
or reducing property taxes. Another attempt to reimpose capital
punishment is expected.
   Kentucky: The Legislature is not scheduled to hold a regular
session this year, but Gov. Wallace Wilkinson has promised a special
session to address education. The state is on schedule to meet its
budget for this fiscal year and next, but lawmakers complain that it
is not enough to meet needs in education, prison overcrowding, human
services and other areas.
   Louisiana: The oil and gas industry-dependent state is still in
financial trouble, although not as deeply as when Gov. Buddy Roemer
took office in March, when it faced bankruptcy. The state approaches
the new fiscal year with $700 million less than needed to continue
services at the current level.
   Maine: Solid waste disposal, tax relief and health-care costs are
at the top of the agenda. To ease the burden of local property
taxes, Republican Gov. John R. McKernan is said to be considering
expanding the ``circuitbreaker'' program to relieve the hardest-hit
taxpayers and give direct grants to the fastest-growing communities.
   Maryland: What to do with the state surplus and how to manage the
Patuxent Institution are the top issues. Patuxent operates outside
the regular prison system and focuses on intensive treatment for
violent offenders. Critics say it is too lax, and the governor and a
legislative task force are drafting major reform legislation.

   Massachusetts: The state must resolve a projected shortfall of at
least $636 million in the current $11.6 billion state budget. It is
widely believed that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis will seek tax increases
and higher fees.
   Michigan: The budget, school financing and prisons are the top
issues. State revenues are expected to keep pace with the 4 percent
to 5 percent inflation growth in the 1989-90 fiscal year, but the
rising corrections budget, lower federal revenues and increased
costs for some federally mandated programs will swallow the growth.
   Minnesota: The state must prepare a spending plan for the
two-year period that begins July 1 and ends June 30, 1991, but this
time, it is solidly in the black. An increase in gang-related drug
activity and the slayings of two women in Minneapolis parking
garages have prompted calls for tougher criminal penalties.
Lawmakers also will consider setting up a state lottery.
   Mississippi: A proposal by Gov. Ray Mabus to reorganize the
government and the budget are the big issues. The governor has
proposed restructuring the state's more than 100 agencies, boards
and commissions into about 15 departments, but the plan has met with
a cool response.
   Missouri: Finding a way to improve the state's higher education
system and stepping up the war on drugs will be the two dominant
issues. The state has a balanced budget requirement, but revenues
are expected to grow only moderately and be more than eaten up by
the costs of court-ordered desegregation and Medicaid spending.
   Montana: The state must fashion a new system of funding public
elementary and secondary schools to replace a method that was
declared unconstitutional last year. The budget now before lawmakers
calls for spending that would outstrip revenues by $33 million in
the next two years.
   Nebraska: Property tax relief and aid to all levels of education
are the main topics to be debated. The state is looking at a $177
million surplus at the end of the fiscal year.
   Nevada: Adoption of a budget for the coming two fiscal years
along with a review of a $465,000 study of the state's tax structure
will occupy legislators. Althought Nevada has a projected surplus,
it is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation. Demands for
expanded services already have produced state agency spending
requests that would erase the surplus.
   New Hampshire: The big question is whether to create a public
energy authority with the power to take over Public Service Company
of New Hampshire and thereby keep electric rates under state
regulation. Public Service filed Chapter 11 last year and in its
reorganization plan seeks to re-form under federal regulation. That
would allow it to bypass a state law barring it from passing along
costs of its stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant to utility
customers.
   New Jersey: Rising auto insurance rates and ocean pollution are
expected to dominate debate. After New Jersey suffered a second
consecutive summer of beach closings because of high bacteria levels
and medical waste washing ashore, the Legislature passed a series of
measures to help clean up the state's ocean waters. However,
proposals to track the disposal of medical waste, impose tougher
penalties on polluters and create a powerful commission to protect
its coastline remain mired in legislative disputes.

   New Mexico: Education, particularly teachers' salaries, is of
greatest concern. Drug control and economic development are high on
Gov. Garrey Carruthers' list. The state is in good shape, with a
surplus projected at nearly $83 million for this fiscal year.
   New York: The overriding issue is the budget, with Gov. Mario
Cuomo also putting a high priority on fighting drug abuse. For the
fiscal year that ends March 31, Cuomo has said the state is still
short more than $1 billion on a state General Fund of more than $28
billion. For the next state fiscal year, there could be a budget gap
of at least $2.3 billion without special action.
   North Carolina: A budget crunch is the overriding issue. Although
a deficit is not envisioned, the expected surplus for fiscal year
1989-90, which begins July 1, is only $232 million and requests for
spending increases from state agencies exceed $3 billion. A
non-money issue is gubernatorial veto power; North Carolina is the
only state whose governor can't veto bills. Gov. Jim Martin wants
that changed.
   North Dakota: Proposed tax increases and a major overhaul of the
state government being pushed by Gov. George Sinner will keep
lawmakers busy. To increase spending for education and economic
development and to make up for sluggish state revenue, Sinner has
asked lawmakers to increase the personal income tax by a third,
boost the sales tax from 5.5 percent to 6 percent and raise the
gasoline tax from 17 cents to 20 cents a gallon. Sinner has also
proposed changes to streamline the government and public education.
   Ohio: School funding is at the top of the state's problems,
primarily because of an erosion of property taxes that has
heightened demand for additional state aid.
   Oklahoma: The state is continuing a slow recovery from the oil
bust. The budget this year will be $2.58 billion, up $137 million
from a year ago, thanks to an improving economy. Property tax reform
is the No. 1 issue.
   Oregon: Reforming school financing and fighting crime are the top
issues. The state's economy has been rebounding, and the governor's
proposed spending increase for 1989-91 comes to almost 20 percent.
   Pennsylvania: Automobile insurance reform and tax reform are
major questions. Legislation designed to ease the burden on property
owners by allowing municipalities to impose an income tax already
passed one session of the Legislature but must pass a second time
and be approved by voters in a referendum. The biggest controversy
could be where to locate a disposal site for low-level radioactive
waste.
   Rhode Island: Two years of budget surpluses may give way in 1989
to rockier economic conditions. Gov. Edward DiPrete plans to press
for a bill reviving the death penalty but may have trouble getting
it out of committee. Prison overcrowding, beach cleanup, and a
mandatory seat-belt law also are likely legislative topics.
   South Carolina: Auto insurance reform and waste disposal are the
hot issues; motorists' desire to lower the cost of insurance played
a key role in last fall's campaigns. A hazardous waste landfill used
by more than 30 other states as come under attack.

   South Dakota: Funding for education, the budget and tax systems,
and expanding the state's lottery are the key issues. Republican
Gov. George Mickelson has asked the Legislature to increase state
aid to school districts in the budget year beginning July 1, with
more than half going to improve teachers' salaries.
   Tennessee: Prison overcrowding and the recommendations of a state
commission to reduce sentences for non-violent crime will be before
the Legislature. A 2- to 3-cent increase in the gasoline tax, now 17
cents a gallon, is proposed to keep the state's highway construction
program on schedule.
   Texas: The Legislature, convening for the first time since the
summer of 1987, faces a potential $1 billion budget shortfall. Also
high priority is reforming the state workers' compensation insurance
program. The state's public school finance system is under court
challenge because of the disparity between rich and poor districts.
   Utah: Lawmakers have the welcome task of how to allocate revenues
generated by a rejuvenating economy. Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter
is recommending a $19 million tax cut and a 3 percent pay raise for
public employees. Several bills dealing with AIDS also are expected,
including one to strengthen laws protecting AIDS patients' privacy.
   Vermont: The state faces a shortfall in its transportation fund
and has imposed a moratorium on paving projects. The governor is
expected to propose an increase in road revenues such as the
gasoline tax.
   Virginia: The state is building two new prisons to increase its
inmate capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state
still will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years. The economic
picture is good, but prison needs could swallow much of the extra
revenue. Gov. Gerald L. Baliles will ask the General Assembly to
return to taxpayers about a third of a $122 million budget surplus.
   Washington: The state must adopt a two-year budget for June 1989
through May 1991. The most controversial proposal would reduce the
sales tax and impose a flat-rate income tax. It has been defeated 10
times in the past.
   West Virginia: The state has tremendous financial problems and
needs to raise $290 million more to meet bills in the new fiscal
year, according to House Finance Chairman George Farley. A recent
state Supreme Court decision and a newly uncovered $212 million loss
in investments from 1987 have added problems of $390 million on top
of the $290 million. A tax increase is likely, with the most likely
candidate being a sales tax on food.
   Wisconsin: Adoption of a balanced budget is a must, and many hope
it will include property tax relief through additional state
revenue-sharing with local governments. Lawmakers also will address
constitutional amendments calling for a 10-year phaseout of the
property tax to support schools and to curb the governor's veto
powers. The state's mandatory seat belt law expires June 30.
   Wyoming: Raises for state workers, municipal financing and the
drinking age are top issues. State workers have gone without a raise
since 1985, except for a one-time $550 bonus, and officials are
becoming concerned that some of the best employees could leave for
the private sector. The state, however, faces a tight financial
situation.

   Police on Sunday fired tear gas to
disperse about 300 people protesting alleged government suppression
of labor movements.
   The protesters were among about 1,000 people who attended a rally
in downtown Seoul, denouncing what they called ``merciless
suppression'' of labor movements by the government of President Roh
Tae-woo.
   ``Get rid of Roh,'' protesters shouted as they marched after the
two-hour rally. Police detained at least three people.
   Protesters charged the Roh government had begun a crackdown on
labor as part of its effort to hold onto power.
   The marchers, blocked by hundreds of police at an intersection,
staged a sit-down protest. Most later dispersed voluntarily, but
some clashed with police a few blocks away.
   Police fired tear gas at about 300 who were hurling rocks as they
tried to march past the intersection. A few dozen people later
gathered near the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul to continue the
protests.
   Dozens of plainclothes police chased and arrested three of them.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Pan Am Bomb Aimed at Thwarting Mideast Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Sunday the
bombing of a Pan Am jet last month was aimed at sabotaging Middle
East peace efforts, but he said he did not know who was to blame.
   ``We consider that the crime of bombing the Pan American (jet) is
one of these efforts to abort the peace efforts,'' Arafat told a
news conference in the Jordanian capital.
   ``I don't have information that allows me to accuse anybody,
because the thing is still under investigation,'' he said.
   The New York-bound jetliner blew up Dec. 21 over the town of
Lockerbie in Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others
on the ground.
   Arafat noted that during a news conference in Geneva in December
he had warned ``there would be a lot of efforts by Mossad (Israel's
intelligence agency) and other antagonistic organizations to carry
out operations in order to abort all the peace efforts in the Middle
East.''
   During that news conference, Arafat said he recognized Israel's
right to exist and renounced terrorism _ triggering a U.S. decision
to end a 13-year ban on talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Hard-line Palestinian factions attacked Arafat's acceptance of
Israel and Israeli leaders denounced Washington's decision to talk
with the PLO.
   Arafat also claimed Sunday he had ``accurate information of
proposals of terrorist operations'' by Israel inside and outside the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat said he knew ``that (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)
Shamir has accepted these proposals.''
   He did not offer details but claimed Israel has drawn up ``a war
scenario ... aimed at carrying out aggression against the
Palestinian presence in Lebanon.''
   Arafat denounced suggestions by Shamir and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens for elections and limited autonomy for
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, occupied by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   ``I am not responsible for the sick dreams of Shamir and Arens,''
he said. ``They are talking in prehistoric terms.''
   He noted that the proposals are based on the 1978 Camp David
agreement between Israel and Egypt and that Egypt has said the
portion of the pact dealing with the Palestinians is dead. Egypt
accused Israel of reneging on the U.S.-brokered pact.
   Despite the U.S. decision to talk with the PLO, Israeli leaders
have insisted they will never do so. Shamir also rejects Arab
proposals for a U.N.-sponsored international conference leading to a
Palestinian state.
   Asked about a possible truce in the 13-month Palestinian uprising
suggested by Mayor Elias Freij of the West Bank town of Bethlehem,
Arafat noted that ``brother Elias Freij has retreated'' on the
suggestion because ``he realized the Israelis are not intending to
take a step forward in order to attain peace in the Middle East.''
   Arafat earlier had been quoted as saying anyone trying to stop
the uprising ``exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''
Arafat aides denied the statement had been meant as a threat to
Freij.
   Arafat wore his trademark checked Arab headdress and khaki
military uniform during the session at Jordan's official guest house
on his third day in Amman.
   He said his talks with King Hussein had covered efforts to reach
peace with Israel, the new PLO dialogue with the United States and
efforts to convene an Arab summit ``as soon as possible.''
   He thanked Hussein for permitting the PLO to upgrade its mission

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Supporters in Congress Seeking Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional supporters of the ban on smoking
on most airline flights are moving to try to make the restrictions
permanent, heralding a replay of the 1987 battle that pitted tobacco
interests against health groups.
   Supporters of the prohibition, who fought a long-odds campaign
two years ago, will be loaded with ammunition this time around.
   Government statistics show that there have been few problems
connected with the restrictions. Officials from the airline industry
_ which had opposed the legislation _ and the flight attendants'
unions say the ban has mostly worked out just fine. And supporters
in Congress say they believe the public is pleased with the rules.
   ``Whenever I'm introduced at speaking engagements and it's
pointed out that I'm the Senate author of the smoking ban, it's an
applause line,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a sponsor of
the bill in 1987. ``It goes over better than my jokes.''
   Reps. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bill Young, R-Fla. _ authors of
the legislation that became law _ introduced a bill last Tuesday,
the first day of the 101st Congress, that would make permanent the
current prohibition on flights of two hours or less.
   The measure has already attracted 50 co-sponsors, and other bills
that would prohibit smoking on all routes are likely to follow.
   Without an extension, the ban _ which took effect last April _
would expire in April 1990.
   The lawmakers want to move on the extension this year because
their best chance for success may be to attach their legislation to
spending bills, which are passed late in the year. Waiting until
1990 may be too late.
   Tobacco industry officials say that as they did in 1987, they
will oppose the smoking ban.
   ``The system of separating smokers from non-smokers worked, and
there was no need to do what they did,'' said Gary Miller, a
spokesman for the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, the industry's
trade group.
   Miller said there is no evidence that the $33 billion-a-year
cigarette industry has lost sales because of the airline smoking
restrictions, which affect four-fifths of domestic flights.
Cigarette sales have declined by about 2 percent annually for about
six years, a drop attributed to general attitudes about smoking, he
said.
   At least one original opponent of the ban now concedes that the
system has worked. The airline industry, which initially feared that
enforcing the restrictions would cause problems for flight crews,
says the crews simply refer disruptive situations to local
authorities.
   ``None of the horror stories people anticipated have
materialized,'' said spokeswoman Leslie Rowland of the Air Transport
Association, the Washington office that represents the nation's
airlines. ``It's worked pretty well.''
   In November, the Federal Aviation Administration told Congress
that in the first 10 weeks of the law's existence, investigations
were launched of 18 incidents in which passengers allegedly violated
the ban.
   Eight of the 18 actions involved Southwest Airlines, a
Dallas-based carrier serving the western United States. Southwest
spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard said the airline has an unusually high
proportion of short-haul flights, so that the smoking ban applies to
more than 90 percent of its routes.
   ``It's worked well for us,'' she said of the restrictions.
   Both Rowland and Goddard said industry officials have noticed
that smoking has increased at gates immediately before takeoffs,
forcing many carriers to set up more non-smoking areas and to
provide more ashtrays.
   The largest union representing airline flight attendants also
says the ban has been a success. Spokeswoman Cindy Yeast of the
Association of Flight Attendants, an original supporter of the 1987
law, says the public has accepted the restrictions.
   ``Flight attendants are finding it's relatively easy to
enforce,'' she said. ``Once they remind people that it's not a
smoking flight, that's usually the end of it.''
   People caught violating the ban can be fined up to $1,000. In
addition, they could face $2,000 fines if they have tampered with a
smoke detector in a plane's bathroom, considered the most dangerous
place for an aircraft fire because of waste paper.

<HEAD>Corruption Probe Of Three DEA Agents Widens, New Charges Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIC LEYVA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former drug agents accused of dealing
cocaine and money laundering possibly were seduced by the glamorous
Hollywood lifestyle and the large sums of money to be made from
Southern California's growing drug trade, officials said.
   The alleged conspiracy among the three men, part of a 150-agent
Drug Enforcement Administration contingent assigned to the Los
Angeles area, worries officials because cases of multiple-agent
corruption are rare.
   But it apparently was isolated despite increasing temptations in
the region, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce Karlin said.
   ``Three bad apples out of the whole force is no embarrassment,''
Ms. Karlin said. ``You could offer any of the DEA agents I've worked
with $1 million or $10 million to sell out and they would just laugh
in your face.''
   The probe of alleged corruption by the trio of agents charged
with tax evasion is widening into allegations of heroin and cash
thefts from a DEA vault and cocaine trafficking, Ms. Karlin said.
   Former agents John Jackson, Darnell Garcia and Wayne Countryman,
already indicted for tax fraud in an alleged conspiracy to launder
$608,000 through Swiss banks will face new charges, including
cocaine trafficking, by the end of January, Ms. Karlin said.
   Officials have given few details on what the men are accused of
doing. Internal Revenue Service agent John Anderson said there was
evidence the three ``were involved in money laundering and narcotics
trafficking during and following their employment.'' All three had
left the drug agency before the indictments were handed up.
   Defense lawyers have said the DEA and U.S. attorney's office are
smearing their clients with condemnations leaked to the news media
and have alleged racism in the investigation against the agents, who
are all black.
   Attorneys for all three declined requests to be interviewed by
The Associated Press.
   The West Coast scandal uncovered by internal agency reviews came
during beefed-up DEA efforts in south Florida that led many drug
smugglers to use Southern California as an alternative point of
entry.
   The high cost of living, frustrations over increasing work
pressures, gambling, and the alluring Hollywood lifestyle were
blamed as possible causes for the alleged corruption.
   ``People get disgruntled with the system, they get disgruntled
with the work, or maybe they just get burned out,'' said Ms. Karlin,
who is prosecuting the case.
   The alleged tax evasion conspiracy began in 1984 and other
alleged wrongdoing occurred during the same period when the West
Coast experienced an influx of drug smuggling, she said.
   ``Maybe there's something about the glitzy L.A. lifestyle, like
Miami, that attracts the corruptible _ things like the abundance of
Mercedes, Jaguars, BMWs, pricey shops, fancy restaurants and luxury
homes,'' she said.
   The average DEA agent earns between $30,000 to $40,000 a year,
Ms. Karlin said.
   The case is significant because it involves allegations the three
agents worked together, she said.
   Jackson, 39, was being held without bail because he was deemed a
risk to flee or pressure witnesses in the case, Ms. Karlin said.
   Countryman, 45, was freed on $120,000 bail. Garcia, 42, eluded
agents following him just hours before his planned arrest and
remains a fugitive.
   Jackson and Countryman both pleaded not guilty when they were
arraigned in U.S. District Court on Dec. 19.
   The three indicted agents also are being investigated in
connection with the disappearances of heroin and cash from a DEA
vault in late 1984 and early 1985, office spokesman Agent Ralph
Lochridge said.
   John Zeinter, DEA agent in charge of the Los Angeles office,
refused to reveal how much heroin and cash were missing until the
additional charges were filed by federal prosecutors.
   But published reports said up to five pounds of heroin worth an
estimated $7.5 million and nearly $100,000 in cash vanished in at
least three separate thefts.
   Agencywide figures on past corruption convictions of DEA agents
were unavailable, DEA spokesman Bill Deac said. The last Los Angeles
agent convicted in a drug case was George Hoelker, who was found
guilty five years ago of conspiring to sell about five pounds of
cocaine.
   Gerald Caiden, a professor at the University of Southern
California who specializes in law enforcement corruption, said the
problem is growing nationwide.
   ``This case is only symptomatic of wider corruption and a general
decline in public morality in last 30 years _ anything goes as long
as you don't get caught,'' Caiden said.
   Each of the three agents told colleagues of outside business
endeavors, which are now banned by the DEA, Lochridge said.
   For example, Jackson reportedly explained his Mercedes-Benz
sports car and sometimes heavy gambling losses during all-night
poker games by saying he used money made from operating an Amway
franchise.

<HEAD>Black Rhino Population Said To Be Growing In Kenya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenya's population of black rhinoceroses,
prized by poachers for their unusual horns, is on the increase, the
minister of tourism and wildlife said in an interview published
Sunday.
   George Muhoho was quoted by the Sunday Nation as saying a new
survey has shown the number of black rhinos in four special reserves
at slightly more than 600, about 100 more than the government
estimated a year ago.
   The minister attributed the higher figure to improved survey
techniques, stiffer anti-poaching measures and better breeding
conditions in the rhino sanctuaries: the Lake Nakuru, Nairobi,
Amboseli and Aberdares national parks.
   A single rhino horn, actually a spiked tuft of hair, can fetch up
to $24,000 in the Far East, where it is used for medicinal purposes,
and in the Middle East, where the horns are prized as ornamental
handles for daggers.
   Private wildlife conservation experts have generally placed the
number of rhinos in this East Africa nation at well below government
estimates, but Muhoho said the new survey indicates ``the situation
is not as desperate as some people have tended to make it sound.''
   In the early 1970s, there were thought to be 60,000 black rhinos
in Africa. Most private estimates put the figure at around 3,000
today.
   Concerned about mounting assaults on wildlife, the government
issued shoot to kill orders to law enforcement officers late last
year. Since then, at least 12 poachers have been killed and dozens
arrested in the crackdown.

<HEAD>Gejdenson Attacks `Double Subsidies' For Western Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is spending more than
$800 million a year on irrigation subsidies for Western farmers who
grow crops already in surplus, according to a congressional study.
   Administration officials acknowledge such subsidies exist, but
say they are a fourth a large as reported by a House subcommittee
staff study and stem from agreements that are 20 or 30 years old.
   The farmers in question are receiving water subsidies from the
Bureau of Reclamation to help irrigate part of their land to grow
surplus crops while receiving U.S. Department of Agriculture money
not to grow the same crops on other sections of their land, said
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   ``Farmers must choose their subsidy,'' said Gejdenson, who issued
the report. ``If they choose to continue to receive irrigation water
at the subsidized rate, they (should) not receive USDA commodity
benefits. If they choose to receive USDA commodity benefits, they
(should) have to pay the full, unsubsidized cost of providing
irrigation water to their farms.''
   Gejdenson, chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, is urging
President-elect Bush to eliminate the ``double subsidies'' as a way
to help reduce the budget deficit.
   ``Double subsidies increase the cost of the USDA commodity
programs, place farmers who do not receive (federal) irrigation
water at a disadvantage in the marketplace and make it more
difficult for Congress to approve administration requests for new
and expanded water projects,'' Gejdenson wrote in a letter to Bush.
   But Interior Department officials, who dismiss the subcommittee's
estimates as heavily inflated, said the government's no-interest
contracts with farmers for the irrigation programs would be
difficult and costly to change.
   ``Most of our projects were built 20 to 30 years ago,'' said
Mitch Snow, deputy assistant secretary for water and science. ``We
cannot go back in there and fiddle with the contracts unilaterally.''
   ``It would probably cost more to implement'' than it would result
in savings, he said. ``We don't see that as beneficial.''
   The subcommittee report estimates that the Interior Department's
Bureau of Reclamation provides $2.2 billion annually in irrigation
subsidies, and that $830 million of that goes to farmers who receive
USDA surplus subsidies.
   Interior officials estimate the annual irrigation subsidy at $534
million, including an estimated $203 million to farms growing
surplus crops. Both estimates are less than one-quarter of the
subcommittee figures.
   Administration officials say the discrepancies stem from
differences in calculating interest rates and whether the cost of
building dams and canals should be included in the subsidy
estimates. The Interior Department estimates do not include those
costs.
   ``We're dealing in numbers,'' Snow said. ``You can get 52
economists in a room and come up with 110 answers, all of which are
defensible.''
   But the subcommittee, in its harshly worded report, charged that
the department purposely underestimated the estimates and later
interfered with the subcommittee's investigation by withholding key
irrigation subsidy documents.
   ``The department's `official' estimates of the irrigation subsidy
have no basis in reality and are politically motivated,'' the report
said.
   Peter Yeo, a subcommittee aide, said: ``If every member (of
Congress) knew what these irrigation subsidies were costing the
federal government, the political will for constructing or expanding
irrigation projects would be significantly less.''
   Snow denied the charges, saying that the Interior Department
cooperated fully with Gejdenson and that the differences in
estimates were legitimate discrepancies among economists.

   Cartoonist Berke Breathed stepped away from comic
pages, where his Opus the penguin has been searching animal testing
laboratories for his long-lost mother, and into a fur-protest march.
   ``This is the first time I've made the dangerous foray into
personal participation. I believe it's a less transient issue than
most, which is why I'm involved,'' Breathed said Saturday.
   ``A good place to start is trying to get people to stop wearing
furs,'' he said.
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, leading a crowd of nearly
400 through a pedestrian mall, carried a sign picturing a hunter
standing on a wolf's neck. The crowd chanted ``Shame on you'' at
shoppers sporting furs.
   Opus' odyssey through the laboratories of a cosmetic company
laboratories in Breathed's nationally syndicated comic strip,
``Bloom County,'' prompted a number of newspapers to pull the strip
during the series, which ran last month.
   ``It was as divisive as if I had been writing about abortion,''
Breathed said.

   Country comedian Minnie Pearl, who has
undergone two operations for breast cancer, was honored by the
Nashville Academy of Medicine for her work to promote cancer
awareness.
   ``I do admire you,'' the Grand Ole Opry star, whose real name is
Sarah Cannon, told about 300 doctors Saturday night as she accepted
the academy's Community Service Award.
   ``Being a doctor is one of the greatest things that can happen to
a man or a woman. I could never achieve that status because I'm not
smart enough. All I could do was be a clown,'' Mrs. Cannon said.
   ``Some wonderful doctors took good care of me when I had breast
cancer. I'm glad I got this award because it gives me the
opportunity to say all these things.''
   Mrs. Cannon had two separate mastectomies and reconstructive
surgery in 1985. Since then, she has encouraged other women to pay
closer attention to signs of breast cancer.

   The stars of the U.S. fashion industry,
unabashed by disclosure that Nancy Reagan borrowed much of her
high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House, are honoring
her for ``outstanding contributions'' to fashion.
   Critics of the first lady's borrowing habits argue the practice
amounted to providing free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   At a lavish dinner Monday at New York City's Metropolitan Museum
of Art, Mrs. Reagan is receiving the industry's equivalent of the
Oscar _ the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion
Designers of America.
   Mrs. Reagan's award is one of 10 bestowed by the group and will
be presented by ABC Correspondent Barbara Walters.
   The council, which is composed of many of the key fashion
designers in the country such as Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and
Donna Karan, voted Sept. 29 to give Mrs. Reagan the award.
   Oscar de la Renta, president of the council, said it recognizes
``the outstanding contributions she had made to American fashion.
During the past eight years as first lady, she has supported our
industry with grace and dignity and has represented our country both
here and abroad with great style.''
   Carolyn Gottfried, a public relations executive working on the
council dinner, said the controversy over the first lady's borrowed
wardrobe ``was not a problem'' for the designers.
   ``They are very supportive of her,'' she said, pointing to de la
Renta's statement as typical of the feeling many in the industry
have for the first lady.
   ``No, it's not a problem, otherwise they wouldn't be giving her
this award,'' she said.
   The group was founded in 1962 as a non-profit institution to help
promote American fashion. Proceeds from the awards dinner will be
donated to the costume institute at the Metropolitan, Ms. Gottfried
said.
   Mrs. Reagan has refused to speak at length about her practice,
first reported in Time magazine in October, of borrowing expensive
designer gowns and jewelry without making any reports on her
husband's annual financial disclosure forms.
   The magazine quoted one Los Angeles Designer, David Hayes, as
saying he'd made some 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits available to
the first lady over the years. She returned more than half and had
kept the others, the report said.
   At the time of the report, the first lady's spokeswoman, Elaine
Crispen, acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan had ``broke her little
promise'' to stop accepting items lent her by leading couturiers.
   When the practice first came into question in 1982, it was
decided that Mrs. Reagan's transactions would be reported on
President Reagan's financial disclosure form. The first lady also
vowed at the time to discontinue accepting the designer clothing.
   But the Office of Government Ethics has since reaffirmed a 1982
decision that such disclosures were not required under the Ethics in
Government Act. The ethics law requires reporting by an officials,
or by the official's spouse, of any loans in excess of $10,000 in
any year.
   Some of the gowns and clothing lent the first lady would carry
thousand-dollar price tags if purchased at full price from a fashion
house.
   After the disclosure, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Reagan considered the report ``a cheap political shot against the
first lady.''

   The two Dukes _ Michael Dukakis and George
Deukmejian _ are retiring at the end of their current terms and
their abrupt decisions are focusing attention on the gubernatorial
races that will be a critical political battleground the next two
years.
   Both men surprised observers by their timing if not their
decisions. Neither was expected to opt for lame duck status this far
ahead of the 1990 campaign.
   ``This will be my last term as governor of Massachusetts,''
Dukakis told a news conference on Tuesday. The 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee pointedly refused to rule out another run for
the White House in 1992.
   ``I did not come to public office to set some record of
longevity,'' said Deukmejian two days later in ruling out a run for
a third term as governor of California.
   Of the 10 largest states, New Jersey elects its governor this
year and the other nine do so in 1990. In five of those states _
California, Texas, Ohio, Massachusetts and New Jersey _ the
incumbent governor will not be seeking re-election.
   Gubernatorial elections are of special political interest the
next two years because those contests will have a major impact in
determining which party controls the redrawing of congressional
district lines after the 1990 Census.
   Twenty-eight of the nation's 50 governors are Democrats. Of the
36 races in 1990, Democrats will be defending 20 governorships,
Republicans 16.
   In California, for example, Democrats control the legislature. If
they capture the governor's office as well, they will be in a
position to repeat their post-1980 Census triumph when they picked
up five seats in the state's congressional delegation.
   The only Republican other than Deukmejian to hold statewide
office in California is Sen. Pete Wilson and there is speculation he
might run for governor in 1990, an office he sought unsuccessfully
in the past.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp is regarded as the front-runner
for the Democratic nomination for governor, but former San Francisco
Mayor Diane Feinstein also is exploring a possible candidacy.
   On the Republican side, Peter Ueberroth _ leaving his post as
major league baseball commissioner on April 1 _ is the best known
potential candidate other than Wilson.
   Dukakis' decision, coupled with the announcement two days later
by Boston Mayor Ray Flynn that he wouldn't run for governor, offered
Republicans hope in a state where they rarely have any reason for
optimism.
   Andrew Card, tabbed for a top White House post in the Bush
administration, might reconsider and return to Massachusetts.
Another GOP name mentioned is former assistant U.S. Attorney General
William Weld.
   But the strongest names in the early speculation still are on the
Democratic side, including Rep. Joseph Kennedy, Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy and former attorney general Francis Bellotti.
   The two 1989 governors races are in New Jersey and Virginia where
the incumbents, a Democrat in Virginia and a Republican in New
Jersey, are ineligible for re-election.
   Lt. Gov. Doug Wilder is the odds-on favorite for the Democratic
nomination in Virginia, while former Sen. Paul Trible, Rep. Stanford
Parris and Marshall Coleman are the best known GOP candidates.
   Big fields are forming in New Jersey for the race to succeed
Thomas Kean.
   The other 1990 races without incumbents are in Texas where GOP
Gov. William Clements has said he won't seek another term and in
Ohio where Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste cannot seek a third term.
   A big name looking at the governors race in Texas is George Bush
Jr., son of the president-elect.
   In the other big states, Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York,
re-elected with 65 percent of the vote in 1986, has said he expects
to seek a third term. Another Democrat, James Blanchard of Michigan,
drew 68 percent of the vote in 1986 and also is considered a likely
candidate for a third term.
   Republicans don't rule out upsetting first-term Democrat Robert
Casey in Pennsylvania, but concede they'd need a particularly strong
candidate to oust him if he doesn't stumble politically.
   The nation's senior governor is Republican Jim Thompson of
Illinois, now in his fourth term. Will he seek a fifth? Nobody
knows. A lot of Republicans were hoping he'd get a big job in the
Bush administration and move to Washington. Democrats always start
out optimistic against Thompson, but he's still in office.
   In Florida, GOP Gov. Bob Martinez is expected to seek a second
term and appears to have made a partial recovery from a rocky start
when he ran into a firestorm of criticism for backing a services tax
increase soon after taking office and then calling for its repeal
after businesses protested.
   Democrat Buddy MacKay, a former congressman who lost a close
Senate race in 1988 while George Bush was carrying Florida by a
landslide, is reported considering challenging Martinez.

   Libya said Sunday that photographs
purportedly showing the downing of two Libyan jets are fakes that
``any small studio in Hollywood'' could produce.
   In a statement, the Libyan Embassy in Ethiopia's capital also
called on international public opinion to pressure the United States
``to stop its threats and aggressions.''
   Referring to the U.S. Defense Department as the ``Ministry of
War,'' the statement said the department had released altered
videotapes allegedly showing armed Libyan jets that were shot down
by Navy jets.
   The embassy said the Libyan planes were unarmed and on a routine
reconnaissance mission.
   Washington has provided television stations with videotape said
to be from Wednesday's attack, as taken by one of the U.S. aircraft.
The blurred film shows Libyan jets armed with what appear to be
missiles.
   On Friday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon
Walters, showed the U.N. Security Council two enlarged photos taken
from the videotape. He said the enlargements clearly showed the two
LIbyan Mig-23s were armed with missiles.

   A peregrine falcon who decided to hang
out on a skyscraper picked an appropriate one _ the home of the
state Fish and Game Department.
   Office workers in the 17-story government office building
building have dubbed the bird that perches on a rooftop railing
``Claudette'' because of its deadly claws, which it uses to snatch
prey.
   Peregrine falcons, which are considered the world's
fastest-moving predatory species, are an endangered species.
   Since Claudette has a band around its ankle, it was born in
captivity and then released, probably by wildlife experts who have
been trying to increase the number of peregrines mating in their
natural habitat.
   David Dick of the Fish and Game Department said it is unusual but
not unheard of for peregrine falcons to live in urban settings.
   The number of peregrine falcons fell drastically in the 1960s and
early '70s because of the use of the insecticide DDT, which weakened
the eggshells of the birds.

   William E. Powers, who recovered from an
accident that left him blind to become a Rhode Island Supreme Court
justice and attorney general, has died at the age of 81.
   Powers died Saturday morning at the Wayland Health Center in
Providence.
   Born Dec. 18, 1907, in Cumberland, Powers became totally blind in
1928, after an accident at home the previous year.
   He was the Cumberland probate judge from 1936 to 1949; a state
representative from 1939 to 1949; attorney general from 1949 to
1958; and Supreme Court justice from 1958 to 1973.
   In 1954, Powers was cited by President Eisenhower's committee on
employment of physically handicapped people for efforts to promote
equal opportunity in employment for the disabled. He was featured on
the television show ``This is Your Life'' in 1959.
   ``Why make basket-weavers, mattress-makers or chair-caners out of
everybody that's blind?'' he asked in an address in 1939.
   Powers prided himself on being able to remember many people by
voice and to make mental images of others.
   ``I see every man and woman I meet,'' he said once, ``and the
women are always good-looking.''
   His his wife, Olive Higgins Powers, said death was due to natural
causes.
   He also is survived by two daughters, a son, a brother, seven
grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services were set for Tuesday in Providence.

<HEAD>Pro-Iranian Shiites Take Control of Five Villages In Vicious Battles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslems captured five
key south Lebanon villages from pro-Syrian rivals in bloody
hand-to-hand fighting Sunday and seized control of a key area
bordering Israel's security zone, police said.
   A top commander from the pro-Syrian Amal militia, Mohammed
Hammoud, and his brother, Ahmed, were killed in a dawn raid on their
home by Hezbollah fighters loyal to Iran, said a police spokesman
who cannot be identified under standing rules.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization offered to deploy fighters
to separate the warring Shiites, but there was no immediate response
from either side.
   At least 35 people were killed and 66 wounded in house-to-house
combat in Kfar Hatta, Kfar Melki, Kfar Beit, Kfar Filla and Jbaa
villages in the former apple-growing district of Iklim el-Tuffah,
the spokesman said.
   That increased the overall casualty toll to 60 killed and 149
wounded since fighting erupted on New Year's Eve in Beirut and south
Lebanon between Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Amal, Arabic for
hope.
   Several hundred masked Hezbollah fighters, hurling grenades,
seized the villages strung along the main road from Sidon in a
four-hour battle.
   In a counterattack shortly before sundown, about 500 Amal
fighters rushed in from other districts of south Lebanon succeeded
in recapturing Kfar Hatta, police said. They gave no other details.
   The police spokesman said the Hammoud brothers died in their beds
during a grenade attack on the family residence in the Kfar Melki
village.
   Five other Amal militiamen manning a checkpoint in the same
village were captured and summarily ``executed'' by a Hezbollah
firing squad, he said.
   A hospital spokesman in Sidon, 25 miles from Beirut and the
provincial capital of south Lebanon, said the police casualty
estimate probably was too low.
   ``Some of the corpses brought in earlier were headless which
indicates the ferocity of the battle,'' he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Rescuers are now leaving the dead on the battlefield. They're
just bringing in the wounded, some of whom died on the way to
hospital.''
   Six rescuers _ three from Lebanon's Red Cross and three from the
Civil Defense department _ along with a policeman were wounded by
cross-fire in Kfar Melki and Kfar Hatta.
   The rival militias are fighting for mastery of Lebanon's 1
million-strong Shiite community, the country's largest sect.
   Hezbollah seeks to set up an Islamic state in south Lebanon. The
more secular Amal, loyal to Syria, rejects Iran's religious
influence over the Shiites.
   In Moslem-controlled west Beirut, Syrian troops from a
pecekeeping force sent patrols to halt inter-Shiite clashes in the
Noweiri and Bourj Abu Haidar residential districts. Police said no
casualties were reported.
   The village seizures left Hezbollah poised to attack the market
town of Nabatiyeh, the biggest Shiite urban center held by Amal,
lying just north of the ``security zone'' that Israel carved out for
itself in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its troops from Lebanon.
   ``If Nabatiyeh falls to Hezbollah, the fundamentalists will be in
control of most of south Lebanon's inland territory,'' the police
spokesman said.
   Capturing the town also would enable the pro-Iranian militia to
link the south with their main stronghold in the eastern Bekaa
valley and trap the Amal fighters along the Mediterranean coast, the
spokesman said.
   The killing of the Hammoud brothers was the second serious loss
in the Amal leadership in recent months. On Sept. 22, Daoud Daoud,
the militia's commander in the south and two other senior Amal
commanders were assassinated in south Beirut.
   Amal's chief, Nabih Berri, accused Hezbollah of staging the
killings.
   In Sidon, Yasser Arafat's representative said PLO fighters were
ready to help stop the fighting.
   ``I appeal to brethren in Amal and Hezbollah to respond to this
initiative, especially since the Israeli army is preparing a
large-scale aggression on south Lebanon,'' the representative, Zeid
Wahbeh, said.
   The PLO, which has ties with Hezbollah, last month reached a
peace pact with Amal to end years of fighting over control of
Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Soviets Promise To Look Into U.S. Allegations Against
Libya</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chemical Conference, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Sunday the
Soviet Union promised to look into U.S. allegations that Libya has
built a factory to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Shultz said he outlined the U.S. case and offered a description
of the plant to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at a
meeting in Paris, where an international conference on chemical
weapons opened Saturday.
   Based on this ``general flow of evidence,'' Shultz said,
Shevardnadze pledged the Soviets would make their own inquiry.
   ``Since he cares about the subject and the Soviet Union cares
about the subject, there is no doubt the questions (to Libya) will
be pointed,'' Shultz told reporters just before leaving Paris.
   ``I think that is a constructive response,'' he added.
   Libya has denied the U.S. claim and said the facility 60 miles
southwest of Tripoli is intended to produce pharmaceuticals.
   Earlier, in a speech to the conference, Shevardnadze announced
his government will begin destroying its stockpile of chemical
weapons this year. Shevardnadze did not comment to reporters after
his meeting with Shultz.
   Shultz said the Soviets were given a statement of U.S. concern
over the plant during the visit to New York last month of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev. But in the meeting Sunday with
Shevardnadze, ``they heard a little more about it,'' Shultz said.
   He said the U.S. goal is to prevent the plant, which the State
Department has said was on the verge of producing chemical weapons,
from achieving production of poison gas. ``If we can succeed in
that, we'll feel gratified,'' he said.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi often has turned to the Soviets for
support when his country was the target of U.S. condemnation. But in
this case, Shultz said, the Soviets share the U.S. aversion to
chemical weapons.
   He said he believed the Soviets ultimately would back the United
States on the issue.
   Shultz sidestepped Shevardnadze's statements that the Soviet
Union had never transferred poison gas to other countries.
   ``I put that in terms of a pledge and I take it that way,''
Shultz said.
   In the past, the United States has alleged Soviet-backed forces
in Afghanistan used chemical weapons against U.S.-armed rebels.
   Shultz reminded reporters that President-elect George Bush had
proposed outlawing possession of chemical weapons five years ago at
a 40-nation disarmament conference in Geneva.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze also signed two accords, on drug
trafficking and on scientific cooperation, and toasted each other
with champagne afterward.
   The two countries are to share information on suspected drug
traffickers and methods of intercepting drugs. They also agreed to
cooperate in scientific research, including an exchange of experts.

<HEAD>Amelia Earhart's Sister Keeps Aviator's Spirit Flying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Amelia Earhart was 7 years old, she
recruited her younger sister, Muriel, to help build a wooden
roller-coaster in their backyard in Atchison, Kan.
   A couple of years later, when Amelia developed a keen interest in
hunting rats in their grandparents' barn, Muriel was the future
aviator's eager sidekick, armed with BB gun and .22-caliber rifle.
   Muriel first went up in a plane soon after her sister bought one
at the age of 24.
   More than half a century has passed since Amelia Earhart vanished
over the Pacific attempting to become the first woman to fly around
the world. Muriel Morrissey, now 89 and a retired schoolteacher,
still reveres and promotes the memory of her big sister.
   The pain of her sister's loss has faded little from the day she
learned of the disaster, July 2, 1937.
   ``Of course it's hard to lose a sister,'' she said. ``And it's
renewed every time when they have some of these crazy stories that
are bandied about once in a while.''
   She was referring to occasional speculation that Earhart wasn't
lost at sea, but was captured by the Japanese or executed as a spy.
   ``I guess it's because people just won't accept the natural
solution: that she was low on fuel and crashed into the ocean and
that's it. It was a tragedy of the sea,'' she said.
   The sisters, born 2{ years apart, were nurtured by parents who
anticipated feminism. Their mother, who climbed Pike's Peak in
Colorado as a girl, designed trousers for them so they could play
unhindered by the long skirts then worn by most young ladies. Their
father, a railroad lawyer whose alcoholism complicated the family's
uneven fortunes, encouraged their tomboy zeal.
   Muriel came to this old Boston suburb in 1925 to teach. She
married manufacturing executive, H. Albert Morrissey, who died in
1978, and had two children.
   ``Most of the time I was not as ambitious and as adventurous,''
said Mrs. Morrissey, tall and slender like her sister. ``Amelia had
her planes and I had my children. That was the difference.''
   The world's lasting fascination with her flying sister, Mrs.
Morrissey believes, is largely due to Earhart's straightforward
personality. ``There was no commercialism. Amelia was herself,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Morrissey's home is a kind of shrine to Amelia. Beside the
bed is a tiny pink airplane on a key ring. A golden toy plane hangs
in a doorway. Trophies, plaques and parchment testimonials to her
sister fill shelves.
   Hanging on the walls are paintings and drawings of Amelia
flashing her wide smile, an airplane somewhere in the background.
   The Earhart sisters settled in the Boston area when Muriel was at
Harvard University earning a master's degree in education. Amelia
took up social work at a settlement house, teaching English to
immigrants, but quit social work to write and lecture about her
aviation feats, becoming an early emblem for women wanting the same
freedom as men.
   In 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly the Atlantic,
taking the 20 hour, 40-minute flight to Britain as a passenger with
two male fliers. Afterward she set more than a dozen speed and
distance records including flying the Atlantic solo in 1932,
becoming the first woman to do so.
   In 1931 she married publisher and explorer George Putnam. ``She
was very careful to choose a man who would see that she could fly,''
Mrs. Morrissey said.
   Earhart intended that 27,000-mile flight around the equator to be
her last long-distance jaunt. When she and her navigator ran low on
fuel about 100 miles before reaching a speck of land called Howland
Island, they had clocked 22,000 miles.
   Last January, at Mrs. Morrissey's request, the Federal Aviation
Administration retired the registration number of the twin-engine
plane Earhart flew on her last flight, 16020.
   ``I realize that if knowing about Amelia will help one young
woman accomplish her goal, I am glad I did it,'' Mrs. Morrissey said.

<HEAD>Navy Clears Whistleblower, Starts Action Against 10 Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Navy officials reversed the
court-martial of a helicopter crewman who complained of safety
lapses, and began disciplinary action against 10 people at the navy
station where he worked.
   The Corpus Christi Naval Air Station's commander and his
predecessor are among those targeted.
   ``This says that what I was saying all along was true,'' the
exonerated whistleblower, Bryan Sims, said Saturday. ``Basically,
the only justice I want to see (next) is the maintenance practices
stopped.''
   Sims was convicted in October of lying to superiors, disobeying
orders and losing gear. The charges, he claimed, were trumped up to
punish him for raising questions about helicopter safety.
   Sims, a 27-year-old helicopter crewman and rescue swimmer, served
a 30-day detention on the base and his petty officer rank was
reduced.
   But on Friday, Vice Adm. John Disher, chief of naval education
and training, dismissed the charges against Sims and restored his
rank with the accompanying pay.
   ``They've hurt me, but I've withstood it,'' Sims said Saturday.
``I guess I'm stronger than they thought I was.'' He had accused his
superiors of harassing him since 1986, when he refused to transfer
crucial, untested parts to search-and-rescue helicopters from a Huey
helicopter that crashed in 1985, killing three crewmen.
   Navy regulations forbid recycling of parts without testing.
   Vice Adm. Vernon Smith, Disher's top assistant, apologized to
Sims.
   ``Your allegations have substance,'' Smith said. ``I regret this
whole damn thing, Mr. Sims.''
   Disher ordered disciplinary hearings for 10 current and former
base personnel accused of being involved in ``improper parts
procurement and maintenance practices'' at the base operations and
maintenance department.
   Navy officials would not identify the individuals, but said the
current commander, a former commander and the base maintenance
officer were among those being charged. Capt. Craig L. Reynolds is
the current commander.
   The base said Sunday that Reynolds' home telephone number would
be released. There was no answer Sunday at his office telephone.
   Sims said Saturday that although he didn't want to see anyone
``ruined,'' he believed action should be taken against those
involved in the alleged maintenance practices. He also said he was
surprised by the number of people the Navy is taking action against.
   ``I expected two or three, but I didn't expect 10, even though
it's true and needs to be done,'' Sims said.
   The Navy said nine of the individuals, including the two base
commanders, have the option of non-judicial hearings, in which they
would report to a superior for discipline. If they don't exercise
that option, they could face a court-martial, a hearing in which a
military jury hears evidence and renders a verdict.
   The maintenance officer, the Navy said, will be subject to a
special court-martial on a charge of dereliction of duty.

<HEAD>Libya Expels Most Journalists After Look At Exterior Of Disputed
Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan officials on Sunday expelled most of
the foreign journalists who poured into the country after two U.S.
fighter jets shot down two Libyan warplanes over the Mediterranean
Sea.
   At least 100 journalists, most of them American and European,
were put on an afternoon flight to Rome. However, at least 30 others
stayed on.
   The remaining journalists, including an Associated Press
reporter, managed to avoid government officials assigned to keep
tabs on them. Libyan officials said they could stay one more night.
   The expulsion orders came a few hours after the journalists were
taken Saturday evening to the site at the edge of the desert of a
plant that the United States claims was built to produce chemical
weapons.
   The journalists were not allowed inside the facility at Rabta, 60
miles southwest of Tripoli, and because it was already dark they
could see very little from the outside. The Libyan government
insists the plant is being constructed to manufacture medicine.
   Journalists saw a ring of surface-to-air missiles around the
plant and a radar station a few miles away. Libyan officials said
the defenses were put into place after President Reagan last month
said he could not rule out a military strike on the plant.
   Earlier Saturday, Col. Moammar Gadhafi showed up at the hotel for
an impromptu news conference in which he called for direct talks
with the United States to ease tensions. U.S. officials later
rebuffed the offer.
   When the journalists were returned Saturday evening from their
tour of the plant grounds, Libyan officials at the hotel told them
they had a few minutes to pack their bags for a flight to Malta. One
official said the reporters' rooms were needed for a delegation that
was arriving.
   Information Ministry aides assigned to monitor the foreign
journalists' movements told some of them on Saturday night they must
leave immediately on two special planes for Malta. Others heard only
from their colleagues that they were to be expelled. But no one was
forced out and by midnight it appeared the news corps would be sent
packing in the morning.
   Ministry aides refused on Sunday to explain the expulsion order.
One aide in the hotel lobby, when pressed for a reason, walked away
without a word.
   At least 100 journalists were put on two buses for the airport
for the flight to Rome on Sunday afternoon. Some avoided being put
on the flight by staying in their rooms or leaving the hotel.
   Those who remained behind were told to check out of their hotel
rooms and plan to take a charter flight Sunday evening to Malta.
   But the flight never materialized as reporters, camera crews and
photographers milled about the hotel lobby. Some drank tea, coffee
or other soft-drinks in the bar of this country where alcoholic
beverages are banned.
   Security guards stood by but took no action. Finally, the
journalists were allowed to check back into their rooms but were
told it was for one night only.
   On Thursday, the day after the Libyan planes were shot down, 30
foreign journalists who arrived in Tripoli on a flight from Rome
were refused entry and after 90 minutes were put back on the next
flight to Italy.
   Many of those journalists, some of them still without a visa,
returned the next day on a flight to Rome and were allowed into
Libya without any problem.

   An assailant, apparently an observant Jew,
hurled a hand grenade at a sex shop in downtown Jerusalem on Sunday,
witnesses and Israel radio said.
   There were no injuries, but the Red Point shop, on the third
floor of a central shopping center, was damaged in the blast, Israel
radio said.
   ``A bearded man looked into my store, saw that it was full of
customers and went to the second shop. Some thirty seconds later, we
heard an explosion,'' Yossi Turgeman, the owner of another sex shop
nearby, told the radio.
   Turgeman said the assailant, who managed to escape, was wearing a
yarmulke, or a traditional skullcap of observant Jews.
   Police later arrested one suspect, the radio said. It reported
that the attacker used an army-issued fragmentation grenade.
   On Dec. 30, police found five incendiary bombs in the mostly
Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak and linked the explosives to
ultra-Orthodox Jews opposing the sale of secular newspapers, which
they consider pornographic.
   The next day, several incendiary bombs of the same type were
found along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. In addition, two kiosks
selling secular newspapers were recently set ablaze in an Orthodox
Jerusalem neighborhood, the radio said.

<HEAD>Israeli, Egyptian Foreign Ministers Meet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
Israel's new foreign minister, Moshe Arens, met Sunday for talks on
a border dispute involving a strip of land along the Red Sea.
   The two ministers met during a five-day international conference
here on chemical weapons. It was the first time the two had met
since Arens became foreign minister last month.
   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Abdel-Meguid said both
countries were ``interested in realizing a just and permanent peace
which is important for everybody, for all countries and people of
the region. We are moving in this direction.''
   Arens told reporters the two had discussed Taba, a disputed strip
of land at the northern tip of the Red Sea that Israel refused to
return to Egypt when it withdrew from the Sinai in 1982.
   A team of international arbitrators ruled late last year that the
disputed beach belonged to Egypt under a 1979 peace treaty, but the
specific borders still have to be determined by the two sides.
   Arens said further moves were expected ``in the coming days'' but
did not elaborate.
   Arens, speaking to reporters after the meeting, said the two
nations ``may be different in their viewpoints, it is also true and
important that we have direct contact.''
   Egypt is the only Arab country to have signed a peace treaty with
Israel.
   Abdel-Meguid visited Israel in July 1987 and met then-Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Hazem Foda, a spokesman for the Egyptian Embassy, said the
ministers would ``meet again soon, either in Paris or elsewhere, and
their aides will meet together.''
   U.S. officials at the chemical weapons conference appeared
concerned at the hardening line of Arab and Third World countries
toward Israel.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz accused Israel of introducing
nuclear weapons to the Middle East. Israel has never responded
directly to allegations of its nuclear capacity, saying only that it
will not be the first nation to introduce nuclear weapons into the
region.
   Arens charged Iraq Sunday with ``hypocrisy and cynicism.'' He
added that Iraq was attempting to deflect attention from suggestions
that Baghdad has used toxic gas in its eight-year war with Iran.
   On his arrival in Paris for the conference Friday, Abdel-Meguid
said it was impossible to divorce chemical weapons from other arms
including nuclear weapons.

   Fire swept through a finishing plant owned by
famous auto designer Sergio Pininfarina on Sunday, destroying or
damaging about 200 luxury sports cars worth millions of dollars.
   Three high-performance Ferraris were among the autos destroyed,
authorities said.
   Firefighters spent four hours battling the blaze, which caused
several million dollars in damage. They were summoned to the scene
around 7 a.m. after a watchman discovered the flames following a
power outage and explosion.
   Although an electrical short circuit was suspected as the cause
of the blaze, investigators said they had not ruled out arson.
   The plant, which employs about 200 workers, was closed to observe
a long holiday weekend, and no injuries were reported.
   Three Ferrari 412 sports cars were reported destroyed, and a
fourth heavily damaged. Italian television said in all about 200
autos, including Peugeots and Alfa Romeos, were damaged.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's death engulfed Britain's royal
family in a front-page debate Sunday about whether this country
should send representatives to the Japanese monarch's funeral.
   Many opposition lawmakers and World War II veterans still regard
Hirohito as an unpunished war criminal. They say it will insult
thousands of British servicemen if official representatives go to
the burial of the emperor, who died Saturday at age 87.
   About 27,000 British war prisoners died at the hands of the
Japanese in World War II, many during forced construction of the
notorious Burma railway.
   Both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II sent
condolence messages Saturday that made no mention of the wartime
enmity, and both were expected to send representatives to the Feb.
24 funeral.
   The queen has asked her son and heir, Prince Charles, to
represent her in Tokyo, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported
Sunday.
   Buckingham Palace said no decision had been made, and the Foreign
Office said no government representative had been picked yet.
   The royal family already is being criticized for failing to send
a member to last week's memorial service in Lockerbie, Scotland, for
victims of the Dec. 21 Pan Am crash.
   ``If it wasn't good enough for them to come to the Lockerbie
service, I don't see why they should go all that distance out there
for a service for somebody that treated our servicemen ... in such a
way that people suffered for years,'' said Jim Campbell, chairman of
the Mid-Annandale Comrades Club.
   Former Foreign Secretary David Owen, who now leads the centrist
Social Democratic Party, said the queen should send Charles or her
daughter, Princess Anne, as a goodwill gesture.
   ``The problem is, the royal family has got themselves in a slight
mess,'' he told Britain's commercial TV-am. ``Not attending the
Lockerbie funeral was wrong and has caused understandable anguish
and criticism.''
   The debate was front-page news in most London newspapers.
   ``Royal Dilemma Over Hirohito'' was the headline in both The
Sunday Times and Sunday Express, which added ``After Lockerbie
memorial row, who will honor Japan's dead emperor?''
   Freddie Tompkins, spokesman for the 17,000-member Burma Star
Association, said he was ``absolutely flabbergasted'' by suggestions
Prince Charles might attend the funeral.
   ``This man was a monster and should have been tried as a war
criminal,'' he said of Hirohito.
   Ted Leadbitter, an opposition Labor Party legislator who served
as an artillery officer during the war, said: ``It would be quite
hypocritical, after what happened with all the atrocities, the
torture, the bloodshed and misery that our people went through, for
us to attend that funeral.''
   Alan Amos, a governing Conservative Party legislator, spoke of
the bitterness of prisoners' relatives.
   ``It is deeply insensitive and outrageous that messages of
condolence should be sent in relation to this war criminal,'' he
said.

   Three members of a U.S.-based dissident Chinese
group left Shanghai on Sunday after police accused them of breaking
the law, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Xinhua said the three _ a Chinese-American, a Chinese-Canadian
and a Chinese student studying in the United States _ were heading
for other countries but did not specify if they had left China yet.
   American Huang Wencheng and Canadian Huang Han were ordered to
leave, Xinhua said. It was not clear if Tang Guangzhong, the Chinese
student and the only one of the three a Chinese citizen, also was
ordered out and whether he would be allowed to return.
   Officials at the U.S. and Canadian embassies said Chinese
authorities had not told them about the expulsions. The Huangs do
not appear to be related.
   Xinhua said the three acknowledged belonging to the New
York-based Chinese Alliance for Democracy, a group set up by a
former Chinese citizen in 1983 that advocates a democratic
revolution in China. Chinese officials have declared it an illegal,
reactionary organization and have banned its magazine, ``China
Spring.''
   The news agency said the men arrived in Shanghai early this month
carrying copies of ``China Spring'' and letters from an Alliance
leader to a jailed dissident, Yang Wei.
   Xinhua said they were guilty of ``illegal activities,''
presumably carrying the magazines and letter.
   Yang wrote for ``China Spring'' when he studied in the United
States. He was arrested when he returned to China and sentenced in
December 1987 to two years' jail for ``demagogical propaganda for
counterrevolutionary ends.''

<HEAD>Report: Britain Tipped United States To Libyan Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chemical Conference, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain has been convinced since 1987 that Libya is
building a plant to produce chemical weapons and first alerted the
United States to its concerns 18 months ago, The Sunday Times of
London reported.
   The newspaper, quoting what it called well-placed sources, said a
long and intensive British intelligence operation included detailed
monitoring of the shipment of materials from European and Japanese
factories to Libya.
   ``In a separate investigation (following the British tip), the
Americans had reached the same conclusion,'' the newspaper said.
   Britain was the first country to support U.S. allegations that
Libya is building a factory to produce chemical weapons near Rabta,
60 miles south of Tripoli. Libya maintains the factory will produce
pharmaceuticals.
   The Foreign Office said Wednesday it had independent information
about the plant's purpose but would not say what it was.
   The Sunday Times quoted unnamed American sources as saying both
the United States and Britain had been trying for more than three
years to persuade allied governments, principally West Germany,
Italy and Japan, to stop private firms from supplying Libya with raw
materials and technology required to build the plant.
   ``Apart from a degree of Japanese cooperation in identifying the
foreign companies working for (Libyan leader Col. Moammar) Gadhafi,
the effort failed,'' the newspaper said.
   The Observer, another weekly London newspaper, reported that the
man responsible for building and equipping the Libyan plant is Dr.
Ihsen Barbouti, an Iraqi citizen living in London and operating
through a string of small firms in several countries.
   It said Barbouti's companies in Switzerland, West Germany and
Libya have been responsible for the civil engineering at the complex.
   However, it said ``The Observer has no reason to believe that Dr.
Barbouti was aware of what the U.S. claims to be the purpose of the
plant, but he has declined to be interviewed.''

reports said.
   Television and radio stations went off, and traffic at railway
stations and airports came to a halt due to the power outage, United
News of India reported.
   The blackout was caused by a fault at a major transmission system
at Panki in the Uttar Pradesh state that transmits power to New
Delhi and the neighboring areas, UNI said.
   In New Delhi, a city of 8 million people, several residential and
business districts were without power for more than 1{ hours.
   In India, electricity is generated by hydro and thermal power

<HEAD>Khomeini Wants Gorbachev To Study Islam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has urged
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ask Iran for a new ideology
that would replace communism, the Islamic Republic News Agency said
Sunday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, was reporting the full text of
a message sent by the ageing revolutionary patriarch to Gorbachev
last week.
   ``I expressly declare that the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the
greatest and most powerful base in the world of Islam, can easily
fill the ideological vacuum of your regime,'' the agency quoted the
message as saying.
   Khomeini's special envoy, Ayatollah Javadi Amoli, traveled to
Moscow on Friday at the head of a mission to deliver the message to
Gorbachev.
   The Iranian patriarch praised Gorbachev for his decision to allow
more religious freedom in the Soviet Union, saying this proved he
had turned his back on communism, ``a bankrupt ideology,'' the
agency said.
   But he warned the Soviet leader to avoid ``the green garden'' of
western capitalism.
   ``While there is no such thing as communism in the world anymore,
you must not get caught in the Western (capitalist) snare of the
Great Satan,'' the agency said. Iranians often refer to the United
States as the ``Great Satan.''
   ``If you look to western capitalism to solve your problems, you
will not only fail to solve the ills of your society, but leaders
who come after you will have to work to mend your mistakes,'' the
message said.
   Khomeini invited Gorbachev to send some of his ``sharp-minded
experts'' to Qom, the traditional bastion of Shiite Islam, to study
the works of Moslem ideologues and bring the message of Islam back
to the Soviet leader, the agency said.
   ``The root of the Soviet problem is not the lack of freedoms, or
the communist economy, but its long, insolent campaign against
belief in God,'' the agency quoted his message as saying.

<TEXT>
   Iran has begun to rebuild homes and
factories in western regions hit hardest by its eight-year war with
Iraq, an official news agency said Sunday.
   An aide to Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said more than half the
money earmarked for reconstruction this year would be spent on
rebuilding war-destroyed cities and businesses, the Islamic Republic
News Agency said. The deputy's name was not given.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said much of the rebuilding
will take place in the Khuzestan, Ilam and Bakhtaran provinces. They
are all frontline western provinces that sustained heavy damage in
the war with Iraq.
   Iran accepted an Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-fire following a
series of military defeats, but efforts to reach a permanent
settlement have been deadlocked since November. Tehran has not
formally accepted that the war has ended, even though the government
is gearing up for post-war reconstruction.
   The government announced last month that it has allotted more
than $750 million for reconstruction during the current Iranian
year, which ends March 21.
   However, foreign analysts say it will cost $300 billion to 500
billion to rebuild the Iranian economy.
   In rebuilding industry, the government is giving top priority to
income-generating projects such as gas, oil and steel. It is also
concentrating on essential utilities, like power plants destroyed by
Iraqi air attacks.

   A fund-raising calendar with photos of
Louisiana College students in bathing suits was ``as scintillating
as a Sears catalog,'' but the small Baptist school halted its sale
following protests from ministers.
   ``I thought it was in very poor taste for a Christian college,''
said the Rev. Charles Hutzler, pastor of the Alpine Baptist Church.
``I was outraged. It makes us look like we're liberal or something.''
   The uproar over the Men Of Louisiana College calendar, which was
produced to help the school's chorus raise money for a tour, began
after the Alexandria Daily Town Talk ran a picture from the calendar
showing a male student and two female students in a hot tub.
   After a week of questions and complaints by ministers and other
school supporters, the rural, central Louisiana school decided to
stop the calendar's sale, school spokesman Lyn Rollins said Friday.
   Only 23 copies had been sold at the school bookstore, Rollins
said.
   The college, which has a full-time enrollment of about 800, is
operated by the Lousiana Baptist Convention, the state arm of the
Southern Baptist Convention.
   School President Dr. Robert L. Lynn, was quoted in The Baptist
Message, the Louisiana Baptist Convention publication, as saying the
people he talked to feared it would give the college a playboy image.
   But, he said, ``Overall, the pictures of the male students were
about as scintillating as a Sears catalog.''
   Rollins said the members of the chorus who created the calendar
had asked the school administration to endorse it to help sales. The
administrators declined but registered no objections until the furor
broke out, he said.
   Kandy Key, one of the students in the hot tub picture, said her
mother bought a copy of the calendar and approved of it, as did
members of the church she attends. The women wore one-piece bathing
suits.
   ``They tease me some, but basically they didn't see anything
wrong with it,'' said Key, 23.
   ``I love it,'' said John C. Smith, 23, another student in the hot
tub shot. ``I'm becoming a cult star. Andy Warhol would have been so
proud of me.''
   He said he thought the calendar was pretty innocent.
   ``Some people need to accept that there's more to the world than
what they see in Pineville,'' he said. ``Women aren't wearing
bathing suits up to their necks or down to their ankles anymore.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
was heavily criticized Sunday for suggesting that postponing a
Central American summit would endanger a regional peace plan.
   Ortega on Friday said Costa Rican President Oscar Arias' proposal
to delay the Jan. 15-16 summit of Central American presidents until
after President-elect George Bush's inauguration could ``practically
kill'' the peace plan.
   Arias suggested the delay Friday, saying it would give Bush time
to formulate a Central American policy. Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   ``The statement of President Ortega is out of line and clumsy,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Rivera was quoted as saying Sunday in
the San Jose newspaper La Nacion.
   ``We reject what Ortega said, because everybody knows that our
president and our people are the ones most interested in seeking
peace in our region,'' Rivera said.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the peace plan,
signed by the Central American presidents in August 1987.
   The summit, to be held in San Salvador, is intended to advance
the stalled peace plan, which calls for negotiated solutions to
civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, political
amnesties and democratization.
   On Saturday, Ortega said Arias' proposal ``is under consultation
and the meeting definitely has not been suspended.'' Ortega said he
opposed any delay of the summit.
   Meanwhile, leftist Salvadoran rebels on Sunday detonated a car
bomb and several other explosive devices in the eastern city of San
Miguel, an armed forces spokesman said. Three rebels and one
National Police officer were killed, the spokesman said, requesting
anonymity.
   The officer was killed when he tried to deactivate a bomb hidden
inside an agricultural market in San Miguel, about 86 miles east of
San Salvador, the spokesman said. The three guerrillas died when the
car bomb exploded, he said.
   The spokesman provided no other details.

<HEAD>Hostage's Brother Begins Letter Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of the longest-held American
hostage in Lebanon is spearheading a drive he hopes will direct
200,000 letters to the White House by George Bush's inauguration
Jan. 20.
   ``The State Department has told us they have no mandate on this
issue. They think the people don't care,'' said John Anderson, an
Ocala resident whose brother Terry was kidnapped in Beirut almost
four years ago. ``We're out to show them the people do still care.''
   Anderson said he thinks Bush will be more responsive to his
pleadings than President Reagan, but he doesn't plan to take that
attitude for granted.
   ``Our effort is to be sure he keeps (the hostages) in mind, to
make it one of his first concerns.''
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Eight other
Americans taken hostage since then are still being held captive.
   His brother said he disagrees with those who speculate that
attention only makes the hostages more valuable to their kidnappers.
   ``Virtually every hostage who has been released has made
statements that it was because of efforts to keep their names in the
news,'' he said. ``If the terrorists thought nobody cared, they'd
just kill them. This is most definitely an effort to keep them alive
as well as to get them freed.''
   John Anderson said he and his family are not asking the
government to deal with the terrorists, just open a dialogue and
release Iranian assets frozen in this country.
   ``Would it hurt to simply open the lines of communications?'' he
said. ``We're not asking them to trade Terry for rifles and
missiles. Let's just give them what is theirs and talk to them.''

   An early morning fire that gutted a
mobile home killed four young brothers and sisters Sunday,
authorities said.
   The fire at a trailer park in St. Mary's County in southern
Maryland killed 2-year-old twins, Michael Dwayne Bucks and Michelle
Denise Bucks, as well as a 7-month-old sister, Latashia S. Bucks,
and a 4-year-old brother, Daniel William Bucks, said Bob Thomas, a
deputy state fire marshal.
   Three adults, including the children's mother, escaped, he said.
The cause of the fire was not immediately determined.
   Thomas said the twins and Daniel were in a bedroom in the center
of the mobile home, while the infant was in her mother's bedroom at
the back of the mobile home.
   The mother, Mary Young, 20; her boyfriend, Mitchell Dove, 25; and
Ms. Young's sister Alice Young, whose age wasn't immediately
available, told authorities they tried to rescue the children but
were driven back by the fire.
   Damage to the uninsured mobile home was estimated at $25,000,
Thomas said. It was not equipped with a smoke detector.

   Christmas trees still sparkle in local homes,
but folks already are stocking up on Carnival beads and city work
crews are building parade stands for one of the earliest Mardi Gras
celebrations in years.
   ``We're going to be in more of a frenzy than normal, if that's
possible,'' said Blaine Kern, whose company makes most of the
Carnival parade floats. ``We'll barely have time to breathe this
year between parades, and that's not counting all the balls and
parties that will go on during the month.''
   Carnival begins on Twelfth Night, Jan. 6, with various balls and
parties, and ends Fat Tuesday, or Mardi Gras, the day before Ash
Wednesday. This year, with an early Easter, things got a head start
because Mardi Gras falls on Feb. 7.
   The early date leaves barely a month for reveling before Lent
when repentance descends on the city.
   The earliest Mardi Gras dates found in the Louisiana Almanac, on
a list from 1969 till 2000, is Feb. 7 _ this year and in 1978. Most
dates are middle to late February and five times Fat Tuesday occurs
during the first few days of March _ as late as March 7. So you can
say Mardi Gras falls this early only twice in the three decade
period.
   About two weeks before Mardi Gras, a series of parades in the
metropolitan area begin marking countdown before Shrove Tuesday. The
first of 50 metropolitan parades rolls on Jan. 21 this year.
   ``We made our deliveries right after Christmas. I think just
about everyone had it on the shelves by New Year's,'' said Dom
Carlone of Accent Annex Enterprises Inc., which specializes in Mardi
Gras items such as the colorful beads that are thrown by float
riders.
   Work crews began erecting bleachers along city streets Dec. 19,
and Officer Asa French, special events coordinator for the New
Orleans Police Department, said barricades used to control crowds
and traffic are being put in place this week.
   At Haydel's Bakery, Carnvial ``king cakes'' went on sale before
Christmas. David Haydel, president of the company, said bakers turn
out 2,000 to 3,000 cakes a day during the height of the party
season. This year they also hope to ship 100,000 nationally.
   King cakes _ big, donut shaped pastries covered with purple,
green, and gold sugar _ contain a small plastic baby. Tradition has
it that the person whose slice has the baby must be the host of the
next party.
   ``We started out shipping about 75 a day out in 1985. Last year
we shipped 8,000,'' Haydel said. ``This year we're advertising
nationally and we expect to sell better than $2 million of our Mardi
Gras packages.''
   Even though this year's festivities are compressed into a
shorter-than-normal time span, local authorities believe carnival
will see record numbers of people spend millions of dollars.
   ``This is turning out to be one of the best Mardi Gras in
history,'' said Beverly Gianna of the Greater New Orleans Tourist
Commission. ``And what we're seeing is that reservations for
accommodations began coming in much earlier than usual.'' She
attributed the interest to the exposure the city received last
summer as host of the Republican National Convention.
   Mardi Gras is expected to pour more than $2 million into the
hard-pressed local economy.
   ``People just love it,'' Gianna said. ``If they have less time
for it, they just go harder during that time.''

   Investigators would not comment Sunday on a
report that cyanide was found at the home of a teen-ager who has
been in a coma since eating yogurt laced with poison.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell and FBI officials in
Newark would not comment on a story in Saturday's Courier-Post of
Cherry Hill that quoted unidentified sources as saying cyanide was
found in the Haddonfield home of Thomas Lee, 17, and the laboratory
used by his father, Professor Hsin-yi Lee.
   The newspaper reported that the FBI and other investigators with
search warrants found the cyanide Thursday. Professor Lee is
chairman of the biology department at the Camden campus of Rutgers,
the state university.
   It was not clear whether the cyanide found in the home and
laboratory were of the same origin, nor whether either sample was
the same form of the chemical ingested by the boy, the newspaper
reported.
   Asbell's spokesman, George Kerns, repeated on Sunday that
attempted suicide was one of three possibilities investigators were
exploring. The others are tampering and attempted homicide.
   Asbell said Saturday that one reason authorities included suicide
as a possibility was that the cyanide was placed on the top of the
yogurt rather than mixed into the product.
   On Sunday, Kerns would not elaborate on any aspect of the case.
   ``The emphasis in the beginning was on tampering ... it's a wide
open field'' now, he said.
   An FBI official who refused to give his name on Sunday referred
all questions to the agency's media coordinator, Drucilla Wells, who
will be available Monday, he said.
   Lee remained in a coma and on life support equipment Sunday at
West Jersey Hospital-Voorhees, a nursing supervisor said.
   He became ill after eating about one-third of an 8-ounce
container of Breyers black cherry yogurt while in a friend's car on
the way to school Tuesday, authorities say.
   Tests of other cups of yogurt from the same batch showed no
cyanide, and investigators have ruled out tampering during the
manufacturing process.
   No visible evidence of tampering could be found in the cup, lid
or safety seal, officials said.
   No one answered the telephone at the Lee residence Sunday.
   Attempts to reach Dr. Robert Nagele, a Lee family friend and
unofficial spokesman for the family, were unsuccessful. Nagele's
phone line registered a busy signal throughout the day.
   Meanwhile, Kraft Inc. Dairy Group, which makes Breyers brand
yogurt, had restored most of the goods that had been removed from
store shelves in New York, New Jersey, Wilmington, Del., and five
eastern Pennsylvania counties, said Kathy Knuth, a company
spokeswoman.
   ``You're talking about so many stores it's difficult to say, but
we're in the process'' of restocking shelves, Ms. Knuth said.

<UNK>Principal Suspect in Killing of Amazon Ecologist Surrenders to Police</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cattle rancher suspected by
authorities of ordering the killing of a prominent Amazon ecologist
surrendered to police because ``he was tired of living on the run,''
authorities said Sunday.
   Darly Alves da Silva, who police believe masterminded the
shooting death of ecologist Francisco Mendes, on Saturday walked
into the police station in the jungle town of Xapuri near the
Bolivian border, according to Mere Maia of the Acre state security
department.
   Mendes, 44, led a local rubber tappers union in Xapuri, where he
was shot outside his home on Dec. 22.
   The union, whose members collect rubber-making substances from
the trees, often block ranchers' efforts to clear rainforest by
standing in front of bulldozers with family and other community
members.
   Da Silva is the father of 21-year-old Darcy Pereira da Silva, who
has confessed to the killing. Two other brothers remain in custody
in connection with the case, and another one is sought by police.
   The father also was wanted by police in the southeastern state of
Parana in connection with several other murders.
   ``He turned himself in because he said he was tired of living on
the run,'' Antonio Gomes Campos, director of the Acre state
penitentiary system, told The Associated Press by phone from the
region.
   ``But he said he had no participation in the crime. He said he
heard about the killing and his son's part in the murder through the
newspapers.''
   Darcy Pereira de Silva told journalists he shot Mendes because he
``forced my father to live on the run from rubber tappers.'' He said
Mendes found out about the earlier warrant for his father's arrest
and forced him into hiding.
   Federal Police chief Romeu Tuma called the shooting of Mendes ``a
family decision'' by the da Silva clan.
   Later Saturday, the elder da Silva was taken to the Francisco de
Oliveira Conde penitentiary in the Acre state capital of Rio Branco,
Campos said.
   Mendes received the 1987 U.N. Global 500 award for top
ecologists. He was best known for devising ways to develop the
Amazon without harming the fragile ecosystem.
   The issue of how to develop the jungle, an expanse of rainforest
that covers about two-thirds of Brazilian territory, has often led
to bloody clashes between large landowners and politicians on one
side and peasant farmers on the other.
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 people have died in such land-related
conflicts, according to conservative estimates. The human rights
group Amnesty International says people were brought to trial in
only three cases.

   A jetliner bound for Northern Ireland with 129
people on board crashed Sunday while trying to make an emergency
landing on a highway in central England, authorities said. At least
10 people were reported killed.
   The Civil Aviation Authority said the British Midland Airways
Boeing 737-400 was en route from London's Heathrow Airport to
Belfast, Northern Ireland, when it reported engine trouble.
   Airline spokesman Michael Bishop said the pilot reported ``severe
vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked clearance for an
emergency landing at East Midlands Airport.
   ``He undershot the runway,'' Bishop said. He said the plane was
new and had been delivered 12 weeks ago. It was carrying 117
passengers and eight crew members, Bishop said.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said surivors
were being removed from the aircraft.
   The aviation authority said the plane disappeared from radar at
8:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. EST) and crashed near Kegworth, about 100 miles
north of London, in Leicestershire county.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported 10 dead. It said the
plane crashed on a highway while on approach to East Midlands
Airport and that the Leicester Ambulance Service said there were
more than 120 casualties.
   An ambulance spokesman said the casualites included fatalities,
but it was not known how many. The Leceister fire brigade also
reported some fatalities but did not have a figure.
   The BBC said the plane appeared to be lying in three pieces.
Thirty ambulances were on the scene, along with 15 fire engines.
   It was the second major plane crash in Britain in three weeks. On
Dec. 21, a Pan Am jet bound for New York blew up over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. That
jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed for the crash.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted the
Leicester fire brigade as saying the plane hit an embankment on the
highway and that firefighters were rescuing some people.
   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.

   An Israeli-appointed city official in the West
Bank was stabbed in the head Sunday in the third attack in a week on
Palestinians suspected of ties with Israel.
   Town councilor Yussef Mohammed Milhem survived the attack, which
came after calls in underground leaflets to punish collaborators and
force Israeli-appointed Palestinian officials to resign.
   Also Sunday, Palestinians closed stores and schools throughout
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in a general strike
marking 13 months of the uprising. Since the uprising began Dec. 8,
1987, 348 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   At least 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded in Sunday clashes
with soldiers in the occupied territories, said Arab reports and
hospital officials.
   An army spokesman confirmed that two youths were wounded in army
gunfire and said he was checking other reports of injuries.
   A preliminary police report Sunday indicated an Israeli taxi
driver slain Thursday in the West Bank was killed by Palestinian
nationalists, Israel radio said.
   Shmuel Edri, 42, of Tel Aviv, was shot twice in the chest near
the Jewish settlement of Yakir, 25 miles north of Jerusalem. Police
found footprints of two people leading from the car to the Arab
village of Bani Hassan, the radio said.
   The military government in the territories also announced Sunday
that international telephone service was restored to the West Bank
and Gaza after 10 months.
   Service was cut to block contacts from the territories to
Palestine Liberation Organization officials overseas. There was no
immediate explanation for the restored service.
   Hospital officials said the wounded in Sunday's clashes included
a 16-year-old shot in the face and a 15-year-old hit in the stomach.
   A 10-year-old girl also was reported shot in the face by a rubber
bullet.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, five people were slightly injured
when two firebombs thrown at an Israeli bank exploded, Israel army
radio reported.
   In Israel, police said a 21-year-old Palestinian was arrested
near the Arab village of Umm Al Fahm after a firebomb was thrown at
an Israeli bus. It caused no injuries or damage.
   The army imposed curfews on five Gaza refugee camps because of
Sunday's strike, confining at least 150,000 Palestinians to their
homes indefinitely.
   Curfews and the strike kept tens of thousands of Palestinians
from jobs in Israel. The strike, called by the pro-PLO Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising, stopped public transportation
and closed all businesses and schools.
   Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist organization opposed to PLO
chief Yasser Arafat's peacemaking efforts, has called a strike for
Monday. It is viewed as a challenge to the PLO's local leadership.
   The latest attack against a Palestinian accused of links to
Israel came in the early hours of Sunday in the West Bank city of
Qalqilya.
   Milhem, 45, was stabbed in the head when he went to Qalqilya
Hospital for treatment of a minor illness, officials said.
   He was transferred to an Israeli hospital, where he was reported
in fair condition after surgery.
   ``This is not acceptable at all. Everyone condemns it,'' said
Abdel Rahman Abu Sneineh, Israeli-appointed mayor of the city of
20,000.
   Friday night, West Bank village leader Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah,
67, was killed. Israel radio said he as suspected of collaborating
with Israel.
   On Wednesday, Bassam Barameh, 25, of Jericho, was shot to death.
Palestinian residents said he was a suspected collaborator.
   More than a dozen suspected collaborators have been killed in the
uprising.

   The Soviet Union will destroy its massive stockpiles
of chemical weapons starting this year, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced Sunday.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Shevardnadze promised
him the Soviets will also look into U.S. allegations Libya has a
plant to produce chemical weapons.
   Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons,
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union is finishing construction of a
chemical arms elimination facility that will begin operation this
year.
   He said his country would not wait for an accord to be reached at
Geneva talks on chemical weapons before beginning to destroy its
stockpiles.
   American delegates said the Soviets were simply playing
``catch-up.'' A senior U.S. official said the United States had been
routinely destroying aging chemical weapons since the early 1980s.
   Shevardnadze said representatives of other countries will be
invited to visit the Soviet facility, but he did not say when.
   He said the Soviet position had ``changed quite radically'' in
the recent past, going from manufacturing chemical weapons to
abandoning them altogether.
   ``When you get into the facts of the matter, it is that we have
been doing the same kinds of things,'' said Lynn Hansen, director of
the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
   The Soviet position ``now corresponds to our own position,''
Hansen said. ``We simply don't get the press, because for us it's
more routine ... When they do it, all of a sudden it's news.''
   The five-day conference was marked by conflicts involving Middle
Eastern countries.
   Delegates from 16 Arab nations said any ban on chemical weapons
must be accompanied by nuclear disarmament.
   Iraqi Vice Premier Tarik Aziz, in a fiery speech Sunday to about
80 foreign ministers among the delegates from 150 nations, accused
Israel of posing ``a serious threat to the security of Arab
nations.''
   He said Israel kept ``nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons
and missiles that can reach many Arab cities.''
   Israel called the Iraqi statement ``blatant hypocrisy.'' Iraq is
known to have used chemical weapons in its 8-year war with Iran.
   The conference is aimed at giving new political impetus to a 1925
Geneva Protocol that prohibits the use of such toxic chemical and
biological agents.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union had stopped production of
chemical weapons _ an announcement first made in April 1987 by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We shall immediately proceed with the elimination of our
stockpiles of chemical weapons and, indeed, we shall begin doing
that even before a convention is concluded,'' Shevardnadze told
delegates.
   He did not give dates or make clear if a schedule had been worked
out.
   U.S. officials said they did not yet know whether the Soviet
facility was a pilot plant or one capable of destroying massive
quantities of weapons.
   Shevardnadze said representatives of other countries will be
invited to visit the Soviet facility.
   Addressing the thorny issue of verification, a major stumbling
block for negotiators, Shevardnadze said a new convention should
provide for a ``short notice challenge inspection'' of any facility
suspected of manufacturing chemical weapons, and that there should
be no right of refusal of any such inspection.
   He said the Soviet Union supports proposals for enlarged powers
for the U.N. secretary-general to investigate alleged chemical
weapons use, and he proposed setting up an international
verification agency working under U.N. auspices.
   Shultz, speaking to reporters at a news conference before leaving
Paris, said he was pleased Shevardnadze's speech had recognized the
importance of inspection.
   But Shultz added: ``Transferring this principle to workable
procedures is difficult.''
   Shultz also said he had won a promise from Shevardnadze during a
private meeting to look into U.S. allegations that Libya has a plant
south of its capital, Tripoli, that is intended for the production
of chemical weapons. Libya has denied the charge.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two countries
to admit they have chemical weapons. According to U.S. estimates,
about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacture
chemical weapons.
   The Soviet Union was thought to have started toxic agents after
World War II, continuing to do so until Gorbachev's 1987
announcement.
   The Soviet Union says it has 50,000 tons of chemical arms
stockpiled, while the United States has about 30,000 tons. However,
both those figures are thought to be largely underestimated.
   The Soviet foreign minister said his country, while possessing
chemical weapons, has never used them, has no chemical weapons
stockpiles outside Soviet territory and has never transferred
chemical weapons to other nations.
   He called on all countries to end production of chemical weapons.
   The United States halted production of chemical weapons in 1969
but resumed 18 years later to counter the Soviet stockpiling.

   Brutal wind chills hit 65 degrees below zero as bitter winds and
blowing snow followed up storms in Minnesota and North Dakota, while
warm and humid air continued Sunday over the Southeast.
   Winds of 20 to 30 mph and temperatures of 10 below zero produced
wind chill factors Sunday morning of 60 to 65 below zero at Grand
Forks and Fargo, N.D.
   Fargo ended up with a record 24.4 inches of snow from the
Saturday storm and by noon Sunday had a record of 29 inches on the
ground while Grand Forks had 37 inches. Travel throughout the Red
River Valley along the North Dakota-Minnesota border was nearly
impossible.
   In Minnesota, 22 inches of snow fell during the Saturday storm at
Crookston.
   Snow up to a foot fell over portions of Upper Michigan. At
Calumet, blizzard conditions were reported Sunday morning with
visibilities reduced to 150 feet in blowing snow.
   Temperatures of near zero and winds of 30 mph reduced the wind
chill to 47 below zero at Mason City, Iowa.
   Winds gusted to 68 mph near Cheyenne, Wyo., and to 58 mph at
Livingston, Mont. Wind gusts reached 63 mph at Niagara Falls, N.Y.,
61 mph at Buffalo, N.Y., 59 mph at Bradford, Pa., and 58 mph at
Chicago.
   The coldest temperature in the nation Sunday morning was at
Havre, Mont., where it was 32 degrees below zero. It was 28 below at
Worland, Wyo.
   Temperatures were in the 80s Sunday afternoon over much of
Florida with 70s extending along the Carolina coast and to the
central Gulf Coast region.
   Most of Texas was on the cool side, but it hit 80 degrees at
Brownsville, in the state's southern tip.
   Scattered rain developed over northern portions of the Gulf Coast
states, southern Oklahoma and Texas. Some of the rain mixed with
sleet in north central Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
but it melted as it fell in mid-30s temperatures.
   Rain also fell over eastern portions of the mid-Atlantic Coast
states, with freezing rain over portions of northern New England
making roads icy from Vermont to northern Maine.
   Dense fog was widespread from eastern Pennsylvania across New
York City into portions of Connecticut and western Massachusetts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees below zero at Havre, Mont., to 83 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.
   Widespread rain was forecast for Monday from southeast Virginia
across the Carolinas, Georgia, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf
Coastal states to southern portions of Texas and throughout the
Pacific Northwest into northern California. Sleet and snow was
expected from central Arkansas across Kentucky and West Virginia to
portions of the mid-Atlantic Coast. Snow showers were predicted for
the eastern Great Lakes, western Pennsylvania and northern Maine.
High temperatures were expected to stay below zero over northern
Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. Temperatures were expected to
reach only the single digits and teens from the Great Lakes region
across Iowa and most of the Dakotas to eastern Montana. Readings
were forecast for the 50s and 60s over much of California and
southern Arizona and from the Carolinas coast across southern
Georgia to the central Gulf Coast region. Highs were expected in the
70s and 80s in Florida and elsewhere in the 20s, 30s and 40s.

<TEXT>
   South African rebels fighting the
white-dominated leadership of their homeland pledged Sunday to close
their bases in Angola under an agreement with the Angolan government.
   Rebels of the African National Congress entered into the accord
to remove a possible setback for a U.S.-mediated independence plan
for Angola's southern neighbor Namibia, said ANC president Oliver
Tambo.
   Tambo said South Africa could point to guerrilla bases in Angola
as a reason for delaying the independence of Namibia, a territory
also known as South-West Africa which South Africa has administered
since World War I.
   The ANC leader spoke at a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia,
attended by visiting U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and
Andrew Young, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Jackson and Young are in Lusaka for a meeting of the African
American Institute scheduled to open Monday.
   Tambo gave no timetable for the shutdown of the bases and did not
say how many guerrillas were involved.
   The ANC, the main rebel group fighting South Africa's government,
has manned a number of training bases in Angola for several years.
It has mounted anti-government operations, however, through a number
of states on South Africa's northern border.
   Under the U.S.-mediated peace accords signed Dec. 22, Cuba agreed
to a phased withdrawal of about 50,000 of its troops from Angola. In
exchange, South Africa pledged to put into place an independence
plan for Namibia which calls for U.N.-supervised elections there by
Nov. 1.

<TEXT>
   Four of France's most notorious terrorists go on
trial Monday for the 1986 slaying of the president of the
state-owned automaker Renault who was gunned down in front of his
Paris home.
   Nathalie Menigon, 31, and Joelle Aubron, 28, are charged with
murder. Ms. Menigon's companion, Jean-Marc Rouillan, 33, and Georges
Cipriani, 38, are charged with complicity in the shooting of Georges
Besse on Nov. 17, 1986.
   If convicted by the special all-judge panel hearing the case, the
four face possible life sentences.
   All are considered leaders of the extreme leftist group Direct
Action, implicated in about 80 attacks between 1979 and 1988.
   In letters sent to several news organizations in Paris, Direct
Action on Feb. 11, 1987, claimed responsibility for killing Besse. A
later Direct Action statement said the shootings were not planned.
   The four were convicted in February 1988 of criminal association
and each sentenced to 10 years in prison. Ms. Menigon also received
a 12-year sentence for the attempted murder of two policemen on May
31, 1983.
   During the February trial, defendants shouted at judges, joked
among themselves and refused to answer questions.
   For about two months last year, the four held a hunger strike,
demanding an end to their solitary confinement. They were force-fed
intravenously and taken to trial in wheelchairs as their condition
deteriorated.
   Then-Justice Minister Albin Chalendon refused to yield to what he
called blackmail and the hunger strike ended after 74 days.
   About 50 witnesses are expected to testify during the five-day
trial, including Minister for European Affairs Edith Cresson, who
was overseeing the restructuring of Renault when Besse took over as
president. Prosecutors also are expected to call several people who
witnessed the murder.
   The four were arrested Feb. 21, 1987, at a farmhouse near Orleans
in a raid that also netted a stockpile of arms, explosives, money
and incriminating documents, including the original letter claiming
the Besse murder.
   The raid was part of a series of police sweeps which officials
believe snared all the organization's prominent members.
   When Direct Action first surfaced in 1979, its actions mostly
consisted of bombings or shooting at buildings housing French
government offices and those of other groups like the international
police organization Interpol, an Israeli bank, and the European
Space Agency.
   Assassinations began Jan. 25, 1985, with the shooting of Gen.
Rene Audran, the Defense Ministry official in charge of arms sales.
Ten days earlier, Direct Action announced it signed a pact with West
Germany's Red Army Faction for the development of a communist
guerrilla group in Western Europe.
   The groups claimed joint responsibility for a car bomb attack at
a U.S. air base outside Frankfurt in August 1985 that killed two
people and injured 20 others.

   A panel of judges in Jalisco state dropped
kidnapping and secret burial charges against five Mexicans in
connection with the slaying of two Americans, but they are still
accused of murder, a newspaper said Sunday.
   The Americans _ Alberto G. Radelat of Fort Worth, Texas, and John
Walker of Minneapolis _ disappeared on Jan. 30, 1985, in
Guadalajara, capital of Jalisco state.
   Mexican authorities said at the time they believed the men
wandered into a restaurant, where drug dealers mistook them for U.S.
narcotics investigators and beat them to death.
   The Mexico City newspaper Excelsior, which published Sunday's
report, did not say when the three-judge panel made its decision. It
also gave no reason for their ruling.
   Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Jalisco judicial
officials by telephone on Sunday were unsuccessful.
   The newspaper identified two suspects as reputed Mexican drug
lords Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca. It said the other
three men were suspected as their accomplices.
   Caro Quintero is also charged with masterminding the Feb. 7,
1985, torture and slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent Enrique
Camarena. His body was found with that of his pilot at a ranch
outside Guadalajara on March 5, 1985.
   According to the newspaper, the state Supreme Justice Tribunal
``will shortly render a verdict'' on the murder charges.
   The suspects remain in prison awaiting the verdict, the Excelsior
report said.
   The bodies of the two victims were recovered near Guadalajara in
June 1985.

<HEAD>Hefty Hikes Hit Consumers, Unions Warn Of Trouble Without Wage Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a series of
sweeping price increases Sunday that the official trade union
leadership has warned may spawn strikes unless swift wage and social
reforms are enacted.
   The increases in the next five months, the first beginning
Monday, reflect cuts in subsidies and will cost every consumer an
average $25 per month, or about 10 percent of the average national
per capita earnings per month.
   The government announcement gave no reason for the price rises on
food, drugs, autos, public transit and other items. But it was clear
from previous official statements that the changes were in part
aimed at qualifying for more help from the International Monetary
Fund in financing the country's $17 billion foreign debt.
   As of Monday food prices will rise an average 17 percent, State
Secretary Bela Szikszay, president of the national price office, was
reported as saying. Dairy products will go up 40 percent.
   Pharmaceuticals will increase 82 percent, although drugs for
treating serious diseases will be decreased or become free, he told
the Vasarnapi Hirek Sunday newspaper. Car prices are to increase as
much as 38 percent.
   Szikszay said food production subsidies will be cut by an
equivalent $200 million this year, which accounts for 40 percent of
the food price hikes, and that the other 60 percent is due to
increased farming costs.
   Szikszay vaguely referred to plans for making the wage system
``more flexible'' so as to reward better performance by higher wages.
   The presidium of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions
warned Friday that the price rises in the first half of this year
could touch off strikes unless wage hikes and other social measures
are introduced.
   According to the trade union daily Nepszava, the union leadership
demanded that funds set free by cutting state subsidies should not
only be used to reduce the budget deficit but to support those
hardest hit.
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank require that
debtor governments slash price subsidies as a condition for
obtaining credits or rescheduling debt payments.
   Last year the Warsaw Pact country spent over $3 billion on
servicing its foreign debt, including $1 billion on interest
repayment.
   Altogether, Szikszay said, this year's consumer price index rise
is to be kept to about 15 percent, slightly lower than in 1988.
   The government is making compensations for the lowest income
bracket, including a $7 extra payment to pensioners as of Jan. 1
this year.
   On an average, real wages in 1988 were 15 percent lower than ten
years ago and in fact dropped to the level of 1973 last year, the
Central Statistical Office said in a survey.
   The average monthly net wage equals about $130, while the
government has set the minimum pension at $70.

   Elvis Presley devotees took part Sunday in
a cake cutting ceremony, a breakfast and a party to celebrate the
54th anniversary of the birth of the king of rock 'n' roll.
   An estimated 2,500 people visited Presley's Graceland mansion,
compared with about 1,200 last year on his birthday, Graceland
spokeswoman Meredith Phillips said.
   Fans flock to the mansion each year during his birthday and the
anniversary of his death on Aug. 16, 1977. Presley was born in
Tupelo, Miss., on Jan. 8, 1935.
   Those who turned out early Sunday heard officials on the steps of
Graceland proclaim Elvis Presley Day in Memphis. Then fans rode
shuttle buses to the Heartbreak Hotel Restaurant for a country-style
buffet complete with Elvis' favorite extra-crispy bacon.
   Around noon a party sponsored by the Then, Now, &amp; Forever Elvis
Presley Fan Club of Memphis began at a pizza restaurant. It included
Elvis movies and concert videos and a birthday cake featuring a
likeness of Presley.
   The festivities were to be capped by two showings of ``Elvis: A
Musical Celebration'' at the historic Orpheum Theater. Fans who
bought a Graceland birthday package of admission tickets were
invited to a semi-formal cocktail party before the production's
evening showing and a chance to mingle with the cast at a
post-performance party.

<HEAD>30 People Attend Services For Whooping Crane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A memorial service for a female whooping crane
that was shot last week drew about 30 environmentalists, who called
for a campaign to educate the public about endangered species.
   The bird was killed last Tuesday by a Houston hunter who said it
was accidental. It was the first reported shooting of a whooping
crane in 21 years.
   On Saturday, members of the Houston Audubon Society gathered at
the Edith L. Moore Sanctuary for the service to remember the bird
and to remind others of the fragile coexistence between man and
animals, said Jane Scheidler, the society's vice president for
environmental affairs.
   ``She was a wonderful, precocious bird,'' said Sandi Hoover,
Audubon executive director.
   Ms. Hoover said the bird was unusual because it was only 4 years
old but had already had a chick, while most female whoopers first
have chicks at age 5.
   About 200 whooping cranes exist today, and about 130 of them
roost each winter along the Texas Gulf Coast. Before conservation
efforts began, there were only 21 whooping cranes wintering in Texas
in 1941.
   ``I think this whooping crane incident is an indication of the
whole general problem out there,'' said Rex Wahl, a zoologist with
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Natural Heritage Program
in Austin.
   ``For most people there's an unawareness, and a lack of
information. It just galls me that somebody doesn't care enough ...
to identify what they're shooting at.''
   The Houston businessman who shot the bird while at the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge north of Corpus Christi said he mistook it
for a snow goose. The whooping crane was flying through heavy fog
with her mate.
   Government wildlife officials said they have not decided what
will happen to the hunter, though they say they may seek restitution
of $4,000 to $10,000.
   But Ms. Scheidler said the man should be forgiven because he
turned himself in to authorities, who then withheld his name.

<HEAD>Banned Journalists Union To Seek Legal Status Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three hundred journalists who shunned a
union created for them after the 1981 martial-law crackdown voted to
seek reinstatement of their old organization, a representative said
Sunday.
   ``It's the right moment,'' said Stefan Bratkowski, president of
the former Association of Polish Journalists, on the second day of a
two-day meeting of the journalists in the basement of the
Association of Polish Authors' building.
   The journalists on Saturday drafted a letter to the Warsaw city
administration asking that the Polish Journalists Association be
registered because the official union ``is not fulfilling our
goals.''
   Several long-banned groups, such as the PEN writers club, have
recently received permission to function legally as the government
implements political reforms. The freer atmosphere has raised hopes
that the journalists' union might again be accepted.
   Broadcast and print journalists from around the country attended
the weekend meeting. Some of the participants were well known before
martial law but now work for obscure publications or in completely
different professions, such as construction.
   The Association of Polish Journalists, dominated by supporters of
the Solidarity trade union, was banned along with Solidarity in 1982
and replaced by the pro-martial-law Association of Journalists of
the Polish Peoples' Republic.
   At the same time, the government mounted a drive to win back
control of the media by purging from 500 to 1,000 journalists
nationwide for their political sympathies.
   Some writers who refused to join the new union were barred from
working at state-controlled publications. Others resigned rather
than submit to new editorial policies.
   In recent years, officials say the new union has consolidated its
position and now has nearly 8,000 members, as many as the old union
before its dissolution.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will upgrade the status of the
Israeli consular mission in Moscow and view it as an ``address for
political activities,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Sunday.
   The move appeared to be part of a Soviet effort to improve
relations with Israel in order to help broker a Middle East peace
plan, said Arens.
   Arens said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told
him during a meeting in Paris Saturday that Moscow will ``allow our
delegation to expand the volume and raise the level of its activity,
and to view it as an address for political activities.
   ``I think there's an important progress in it,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Paris with Israel army radio. Arens and
Shevardnadze are in the French capital for an international
conference on chemical arms.
   Shevardnadze said on Israel television the ministers decided to
``create normal working conditions for our consular groups in Tel
Aviv and Moscow ... and to hold personal meetings.''
   The Israeli delegation operates from the Dutch Embassy building
in Moscow, and the Soviet one from the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with the Israel following
the 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel captured territories from
Moscow's Arab allies, but relations have improved in the past two
years.
   A well-informed Foreign Ministry official told The Associated
Press the mandate of the Israeli delegation previously banned it
from holding any political discussions or working from the former
building of the Israeli embassy in Moscow, which it is now likely to
do.
   The group also had to renew visas every three months, a practice
now expected to be abandoned, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Ministry sources indicated in private conversations the
Israelis may also be permitted to independently process visas for
Soviet Jewish emigrants and Jews wishing to visit Israel.
   The Soviets have allowed more Jews to emigrate to Israel and sent
a low-level consular delegation to Tel Aviv in July 1987. Israel was
allowed to send its own consular group to Moscow in July 1988.
   Arens said Israel and the Soviet Union remain far apart on how to
resolve Middle East conflicts.
   ``Mr. Shevardnadze presented the Soviet position about the peace
process and the PLO. Their stand is totally different from ours,''
Arens said.
   But he added: ``They feel they can contribute to the peace
process and want to convince us they can. Together with that, or
maybe because of that, they want to build channels of communication
more systematically.''
   The Soviet Union wants a U.N.-sponsored peace forum and says the
Palestine Liberation Organization must participate.
   Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of Arens' hard-line
Likud bloc, fears the conference might force Israel into territorial
concessions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel also refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it views as
a terrorist group.
   Arens said Shevardnadze reiterated the Soviet appreciation of the
Israeli rescue and medical aid provided to the victims of the
earthquake in Armenia in December, and Israel's handling of the last
month's plane hijacking affair.
   The case involved five Soviets who traded hostage children for a
plane and about $2 million in cash and then flew the jet to Israel.
The Jewish state returned the hijackers, the plane and the money to
the Soviets on Dec. 3.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a speech
published Sunday the Kremlin is besieged by financial problems that
may require a cut in defense spending and are sapping public faith
in his reform efforts.
   Gorbachev's speech to writers, editors and artists painted a
picture of a leadership struggling to solve budget deficits, improve
labor productivity and implement price reforms while consumers blame
reforms for shortages.
   In the speech, published in the Communist Party daily Pravda, the
Soviet president complained that intellectuals spend too much time
bickering among themselves.
   ``People are talking about a lack of goods, food, about queues,
about the housing problem, about deficits of services ... and other
spheres that touch the everyday lives of people,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``And the thing is that the criticism is not just of these
deficits. People directly connect it with perestroika, they say that
so far it has provided nothing socially or economically, that in
many cases the situation even has gotten worse,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said the Kremlin's budgetary problems were so acute
that ``we will have to look at our expenditures on defense.
   ``Preliminary study shows that we can cut (defense), not
lessening the level of safety and defense preparedness of the
government,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader has said many times in the past that he wants
to lessen international tension in order to devote more resources to
his domestic reforms.
   On Dec. 7, Gorbachev announced a unilateral cut in Soviet
military forces. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze said
Sunday in Paris the Soviet Union will destroy its stockpiles of
chemical weapons starting this year.
   In contrast to many other pronouncements about perestroika, his
reform program, Gorbachev directly defended his policies against
specific complaints.
   Gorbachev's speech Friday and a subsequent question-and-answer
session with writers, scientists, artists and editors filled the
front page of Sunday's edition of Pravda and took up slightly more
than half of the paper's six pages.
   Gorbachev called budget deficits the ``gravest heritage'' of his
predecessors, whom he accused of ``carefully hiding (the deficits)
from society'' until they were revealed this fall.
   The Soviet leader gave no names, but he has been particularly
critical of the 18-year rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who died in 1982.
   The Soviet Union passed a 1989 budget last fall that runs $58
billion in the red, and government officials said the budget had
been out of balance for a decade. Gorbachev said the situation had
only worsened during his nearly four years in power.
   The government lost $60 billion in income in 1985-1988 because
world oil prices fell and lost another $78 billion because of his
cuts in production and sale of alcoholic beverages, Gorbachev said.
   The Chernobyl nuclear power disaster, the Armenian earthquake and
the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan also are draining
large amounts of money, he said.
   In addition, officials have not been able to halt a 20-year
spiral in which wages have risen faster than labor productivity, nor
decide how to reform prices, Gorbachev said.
   He credited his reforms with boosting labor productivity 5.1
percent in 1988. Many other areas of the economy are improving, but
not fast enough, he said.
   Previous Soviet leaders spread too much money over too many
development projects that have not produced anything, Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev renewed his pledge that price reforms would not lower
workers' standard of living, but he added that the problem was so
difficult that several officials had changed their minds more than
once in the last few months about how to solve it.
   ``I want to stress that we are far from thinking that everything
is already clear to us,'' Gorbachev said.
   But he said it was also wrong to think the Kremlin leadership
``does not have a program worked out.''
   The Soviet president defended his policies from critics who he
said ``feel nostalgic for the `good old days,' '' and a ``firm
hand,'' an apparent reference to the years of dictator Josef Stalin.
   Gorbachev also said a special commission of the ruling Communist
Party Politburo will finish debate on ethnic unrest in the republics
of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Jan. 11. The work of the commission,
which began in early December, was delayed by the Dec. 7 earthquake
in Armenia.

   National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as
cleanup began Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that
injured more than 50 people and damaged or destroyed scores of homes
and businesses.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he
planned to declare the town a state disaster area on Monday. He also
sent about 100 National Guardmen to prevent looting and help clean
up the town, where more than a third of the homes and commercial
buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' said Jack Loeffler,
mayor of the community in southeastern Illinois.
   In Indiana, three people were injured in one county, and another
county estimated damage at half a million dollars. In south-central
Kentucky, a twister caused at least $10 million in damage to
businesses and homes in and around Franklin.
   Tornadoes in wintertime are unusual but not unheard of, according
to officials at the National Weather Service. A tornado Dec. 24
killed one person, injured 15 and destroyed 20 buildings in two
Nashville, Tenn., suburbs.
   In Allendale, about 130 miles east of St. Louis near the Indiana
border, a tornado Saturday evening cut through a 10-block area that
makes up about half the town of 600, leveling buildings and
uprooting dozens of trees.
   Loeffler said 53 homes and nine businesses were destroyed. An
additional 28 homes were severely damaged and 30 sustained some
damage. The post office, fire station, city hall and a school were
all destroyed, he said.
   ``The east half of the town's gone,'' said Marvin Jones, an
ambulance driver. ``Most of the streets are blocked by wires and
trees and debris. ... Belongings are scattered everywhere.''
   ``It's a mess is all you you can say,'' said a resident, Linda
Griesemer.
   Six to eight people were trapped in the rubble but were rescued
Saturday evening and brought to hospitals, Loeffler said.
   ``We feel very fortunate. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no fatalities,'' the mayor said.
   About 45 people from in and around Allendale, including at least
six children, were treated at Wabash General Hospital in Mount
Carmel, said spokeswoman Elaine Shaw. Four were treated at Lawrence
County Memorial Hospital in Lawrenceville.
   Twenty-seven patients remained hospitalized Sunday at Wabash and
seven at other hospitals, Ms. Shaw said. She said some were in
critical condition, but did not know how many.
   In Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured
three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30
farm buildings in the St. Thomas area southeast of Vincennes in
southwestern Indiana.
   The injured were treated at a hospital and released.
   The twister came within a mile of a highs school, where 2,500
people were watching a basketball game when the storm knocked the
power out.
   Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged
several houses and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area,
causing an estimated $500,000 damage, said Sheriff's Deputy Jim
Baylis. No injuries were reported.
   In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in
outlying areas of Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12
million in damage to businesses and homes, Simpson County
Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday.
   ``Miraculously, no one was injured,'' Harper said after touring
the stricken areas in the community of 7,700.
   The roof was blown off an ambulance garage at the
Franklin-Simpson Memorial Hospital. Damage also was reported to 25
homes and to 15 businesses in and near Franklin.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard
troops to help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David
Adkinson, operations manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency
Services.
   About 20 military police officers from the guard's Louisville
unit were being sent to Franklin, he said.
   Minutes before the twister tore through Allendale, tornadoes hit
nearby Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said.
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
couple of homes and several farm buildings were damaged, said state
police Sgt. John Muensterman. In Albion, five buildings were
damaged, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   People whose homes were destroyed planned to stay with friends or
relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to a shelter in
nearby St. Francisville, said Wabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds.

   The Cincinnati Bengals will meet the San Francisco 49ers in a
Super Bowl rematch for the National Football League title in Miami,
after winning decisive conference championships on Sunday.
   The Bengals, who lost the Super Bowl in 1982 to the 49ers,
defeated Buffalo 21-10 to win the American Football Conference. The
49ers beat the Chicago Bears 28-3 for the National Football
Conference title.
   In Chicago, playing in 30-mph winds and wind-chill factors of
almost 20 degrees below zero, quarterback Joe Montana and receiver
Jerry Rice combined for two touchdown passes and Montana threw a
third to John Frank for the victory.
   It was the first road playoff victory for the 49ers since 1970,
and it dispelled the notion that the Californians would be numbed in
the kind of weather that has been so good to the Bears in playoffs
past.
   In Cincinnati, with the Bengals' star rookie running back Ickey
Woods prancing into the end zone twice and running for 102 yards on
29 carries, the Bengals won their second AFC championship with the
victory over the Bills.
   The Super Bowl will be held on Jan. 22 in Miami.

   The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a 35-foot sailboat
with 193 Haitians aboard Sunday 550 miles southeast of Miami, an
agency spokesman said.
   It was the third time in as many days that federal authorities
had taken into custody Haitian refugees.
   Coast Guard crewmen found three of the passengers unconscious and
revived them, Petty Officer Luis Diaz said. He said the agency
planned to return the refugees to Port au Prince on Monday.
   On Friday, a sailboat carrying 94 Haitians ran aground in the
middle Keys, and most were detained in Miami for immigration
hearings.
   On Saturday, the Coast Guard took into custody 11 people aboard a
sailboat drifting off the coast of Cape Canaveral. Two passengers
were charged with attempting to smuggle illegal aliens into the
United States, and the other nine passengers _ including three
Haitians _ will be deported, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The British Midland Airways jet that crashed
Sunday in England was one of the first 737-400s produced by Boeing
Commercial Airplanes, a Boeing spokesman said.
   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
in September and ``probably a half dozen or so'' airlines are flying
a total of 17 of the new $28 million to $32 million jets, Boeing
spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday.
   The Belfast-bound jetliner, which carried 126 people, crashed
near a highway in central England, killing at least 32 people.
   Authorities said the plane developed engine trouble. Witnesses
reported seeing an engine in flames as the jet plummeted toward the
ground.
   Gamble said the plane that crashed was purchased last fall by GPA
Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to British Midland. He
said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a 737-300,
which is 10 feet shorter than the -400 series.
   He said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56, which
is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electric and
SMECMA, a French concern.
   ``There have been no problems at all with the -300 or the -400,''
he said.
   He said the engines are brought to the United States and
reassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.
The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton,
where the 737 is manufactured.
   A Boeing team likely will be asked to help investigate the crash
Monday, said David Jiminez, another Boeing spokesman. Company policy
prohibits any speculation about the cause of the crash, he said.
   Gamble said Boeing has built 1,651 copies of the 737. More than
1,500 of them are still flying.
   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988 and the first flight
was in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130
to 150 passengers. First deliveries of the jet were in September to
Piedmont Airlines.
   The 737 is the smallest jetliner made by Boeing. The first
version of the 737 had its inaugural flight April 9, 1967, with
delivery to airlines later that year.

   Clergymen provided comfort and
counsel at Belfast's airport on Sunday as nervous relatives waited
anxiously for details of a flight that never arrived.
   News that the Belfast-bound Boeing 737-400 jet crashed with 126
people aboard beside a highway in central England brought people
rushing to Aldergrove Airport outside the Northern Ireland capital.
   Many were unaware which of the frequent shuttles their relatives
had taken.
   Some were relieved to find their loved ones had missed ill-fated
Flight BD92, which took off from London's Heathrow Airport at 7:52
p.m. (2:52 p.m. EST).
   Others waited for news of the survivors. A woman sobbed quietly
in a corner of the shiny new terminal, recently opened for
international traffic after a major refurbishment.
   ``There is a spirit of anxiety and of course a lot of patience is
being exercised,'' said the Rev. Ian Paisley, the Presbyterian
minister and a leading politician in the province.
   He spoke to relatives at Aldergrove, a 40-minute drive from
Belfast. The religious and political violence between Roman Catholic
and Protestant extremists dictates the strictest airport security in
Britain.
   ``People realize they must just wait and hope and pray their
loved ones are going to be all right,'' he said. ``In a situation
like this you always prepare yourself for the worst but the
relatives are bearing up very well. The airline is doing everything
possible.''
   Jack McConnell, chief executive of Northern Ireland Airports,
said relatives were ``very, very distressed.'' He helped set up a
hotline to Loughborough, 6 miles from the scene of the crash, to
make sure relatives were kept informed.
   A clergyman, one of a number at the airport along with doctors
standing by, told of a survivor able to get a message to his mother.
   Rev. James Barrett, a priest from Belfast, said: ``That poor
woman was mighty relieved to hear such wonderful news. Her son got
the message through fairly quickly. He appears to be OK.''
   Most people at the airport were too distraught to speak, but one
who got good news stopped to chat to a reporter.
   Richard Laird received word that his daughter Karen, 19, had made
the later flight after a New Year holiday in London.
   ``She was on time to get that flight but she decided against
changing and waited for the 9:20. We feel terribly relieved,'' he
said. ``We feel very sorry for what the relatives are going through
right now. It must be harrowing because for 15 minutes _ before it
was confirmed Karen was safe _ we were in an awful state.''
   A senior Northern Ireland government official, Industry Minister
Peter Viggers, was at first feared to be aboard the crashed plane,
but it soon transpired that he had taken the next flight.
   A few relatives gathered at Heathrow airport, and chaplains stood
by to help.
   A Belfast man who dropped off a cousin to catch the flight said,
``I've come down to try to find out what happened to him but they
can't give me any information. I'm going back to London to wait by
the phone and pray he's all right.''

<HEAD>Teen-ager Convicted Of 2nd-Degree Murder In Death Of Assistant Principal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted a teen-ager of
second-degree murder Sunday for a shooting spree in a high school
cafeteria last year that left an assistant principal dead and two
other adults wounded.
   Jurors deliberated approximately 8{ hours over Saturday and
Sunday before finding Jason Harless, 16, guilty of killing Richard
Allen.
   Harless also was convicted on charges for wounding two other
members of the school's faculty and for shooting at Pinellas Park
police officers as he fled the school.
   Patrick Doherty, the teen-ager's defense attorney, said he and
his client were pleased that the jury returned a lesser conviction
in Allen's death.
   ``There's a profound difference between murder two and murder
one,'' he said Sunday. ``There's an array of choices that the judge
can choose for sentencing.''
   Harless faces a maximum punishment of life in prison, rather than
the death penalty that first-degree murder can carry in Florida.
Circuit Judge Claire Luten set sentencing for March 10.
   Harless and a friend, Jason McCoy, ran away from home Feb. 10,
taking along two .38-caliber handguns from a neighbor's house. They
went to say goodbye to their friends the next day at Pinellas Park
High.
   Harless admits punching two school administrators, pointing a gun
at one of them and shooting student-teacher Joseph Bloznalis. But he
says he doesn't remember shooting Allen and assistant principal
Nancy Blackwelder when they tried to take away a gun from McCoy in
the school cafeteria.
   Harless said he regained his memory as he ran from the school,
firing three shots at two Pinellas Park police officers.
   Harless had been charged with first-degree murder, two counts of
attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery. A charge of
burglary was dismissed before the case went to the jury Saturday.
   Doherty argued Saturday that Harless was in a ``dissociative
state'' during the shooting and was not responsible for his actions.
   During the three-hour closing arguments, Harless sat quietly, his
head bowed. His mother sat nearby, across from Allen's family,
including his three children.
   ``What happened in that four to 10 seconds has changed the lives
of a lot of people, and it's a tragedy,'' the defense attorney said.
   Prosecutor Mary McKeown argued that Harless was a vicious,
calculating young man who deliberately shot and killed Allen.
   ``Maybe it was because he had an alcoholic father who beat his
mother,'' she told the jury Saturday. ``Does that excuse his crime?
He's a kid who has made choices, and the choices have all been
wrong. ... He gets angry and violent and that's the bottom line.''

   David Harris stood horrified in his
garden as a twin-engine jetliner flew 60 feet over his head and
crashed nearby, turning the night sky red. ``Thoughts of Lockerbie
came into my mind,'' he said.
   Less than three weeks after a bomb ripped apart Pan Am Flight 103
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, the residents of the small
central England town of Kegworth watched British Midland Airways
Flight 92, its left engine aflame, crash as it tried to make an
emergency landing at East Midlands Airport.
   ``I was in the front bedroom of my bungalow when I heard a low
sound which was obviously an aircraft in trouble,'' Harris said. ``I
rushed out into the garden. Literally 60 feet above ground was the
aircraft, obviously coming down.
   ``My wife ran to the back of the house and shouted she could see
the left engine on fire. Seconds later, there was an explosion as it
hit the ground on top of the motorway, just a short distance from
our house. The sky lit up red,'' he said.
   ``The pilot did well to avoid our built-up area in Kegworth
village. It was only seconds away from hitting the center of the
community,'' Harris said.
   George Mellors, 46, another resident of this town of about 2,000,
said the plane sounded more like a train _ ``it was going bang, bang
like a train going over points.''
   ``We have been very lucky,'' he said. ``It could easily have been
another Lockerbie.''
   In the Pan Am crash, all 259 people aboard were killed along with
11 Lockerbie residents whose homes were hit by some of the jumbo
jet's wreckage.
   The British Midlands Boeing 737-400, bound from London for
Belfast, had 126 people on board and police reported at least 32
died. It managed to just miss the M1, England's main north-south
highway, hitting a grassy embankment by Junction 24 before splitting
apart.
   It undershot the runway by about half a mile, shearing off
treetops and ripping apart with its tail embedded in the ground
while the cockpit ended up in a thicket.
   Bewildered motorists swerved in fright and there were some minor
collisions.
   Teen-ager Robert Angwin, from Kegworth, was one of the first on
the scene.
   At first, he said, ``there was a silence ... then people began
screaming and moaning.''
   Joe Weston-Webb, 50, who lives in the nearby village of Sutton
Bonningale, said he saw many bodies while helping the rescuers.
   ``The seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had
gone forward. And the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpit
end and the people had all been shunted together. There were people
in a sort of concertina, you had to take the seats from the back of
the people in front to get them out,'' he said.
   Many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and facial injuries,
he said.
   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I
can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
horrendous.''
   Angwin said: ``I ran across the fields to help and dragged three
bodies from the wreckage and five people who were still alive.
   ``It was total devastation,'' he said. ``I saw a baby taken out
alive. Luckily there were more survivors than dead.''
   The Rev. Michael Brandon, 32, described how he say prayers for
the victims of the tragedy.
   ``I held one man's hand as he died and I whispered the Lord's
prayer _ what more can you do?''

evacuation of residents from 32 units. No injuries were reported.
   The blaze burned in four buildings in a residential neighborhood,
causing more than $800,000 damage, Fire Chief Fred Postel said. The
cause was not determined, but officials believed it started on the
ground floor of a four-story apartment building. The woman rescued
by firefighters was on the fourth floor.
   Nine people were displaced by the fire, according to the Red
Cross, which offered them temporary shelter.

<TEXT>
   The late Emperor Hirohito of Japan
should have been tried and executed as a war criminal after World
War II, Defense Minister Bob Tizard said Monday.
   Tizard, expressing concern about ``unctuous statements'' from
around the world following the emperor's death from cancer on
Saturday, argued that Hirohito ``should have been shot or publicly
chopped up at the end of the war.
   ``For New Zealand to express any sympathy grates against my back
teeth,'' said Tizard, who served in New Zealand's air force during
the war.
   Prime Minister David Lange issued a statement later, saying
Tizard was expressing personal views not endorsed by the Labor
government.
   Tizard, a former deputy prime minister and the Labor's
government's longest serving member of Parliament, told reporters he
blamed Hirohito for the deaths of ``a few hundred of my friends and
thousands of others who were butchered by the Japanese after being
taken prisoner.''
   He said he was ``grateful'' for the dropping of atomic bombs on
Japan by the United States, adding he did not think his comments
would affect New Zealand's trading relationship with Japan.
   ``They trade with us only when and if they can't get a better
deal from anyone else,'' he said.
   Japan is New Zealand's largest overseas market and exports to
that country last year totaled $1.7 billion.
   Tizard claimed not to hold any grudges against the Japanese
people.
   ``I don't think the sins of the father should be visited on the
son,'' he added.

<HEAD>Child Actress Recalls Years of Drug, Alcohol Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drew Barrymore, the lovable moppet of the movie
``E.T.,'' says her descent into drug and alcohol abuse began with
her rise in fame.
   ``From the time I became famous in `E.T.,' my life got really
weird,'' Miss Barrymore said in a first-person account in the Jan.
16 issue of People magazine.
   Miss Barrymore, now 13, was released from her second stay at a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation hospital shortly before Christmas.
According to her account, she drank at the age of 9, smoked
marijuana at 10 and snorted cocaine at 12.
   ``It was frightening. I was this 7-year-old who was expected to
be going on a mature 29,'' she said. ``By the time I was 8{, I felt
like I was some abnormal, crazy girl. I could walk up to the door of
any nightclub and they'd say, `Hi, you're that little girl. Come
in.'''
   Last June, after a beer binge, Miss Barrymore had a showdown with
her mother and ``started throwing things _ glasses, vases. They were
breaking all over the floor. I went from party girl to jerk of the
planet.''
   Her mother, Ildiko Jaid Barrymore, and a friend took her to the
private hospital in Van Nuys, called ASAP.
   ``Like most parents, I had no idea what was going on,'' said her
mother. ``...When she turned 9 or 10, I felt I had to give her time
and space. I began to lose perspective on what was going on with
Drew.''
   In September, she took a break from her hospital stay to audition
for a play in New York, and broke her 88-day string of sobriety when
she snorted cocaine in a nightclub restroom, she said.
   She then stole her mother's credit card, flew to Los Angeles,
snorting more cocaine, and went on a shopping spree. Her mother
hired private agents who handcuffed her and sent her back to the
hospital, according to the account she gave the magazine.

<HEAD>Sandinista Radio Blames Rebel Leader's Killing on Contra Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's official radio station
on Sunday blamed the slaying of an anti-Sandinista guerrilla leader
in Honduras on rebel infighting.
   The killing Saturday of Manuel Adan Rugama Acevedo ``is another
product of the deep divisions that exist (among rebel forces), as
much in Honduras as in Miami,'' said the broadcast of Radio Sandino,
voice of Nicaragua's ruling National Sandinista Liberation Front.
   Leaders of the anti-Sandinista rebels known as the Contras,
however, blame Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government for the
killing.
   A doctor by training, Rugama, 39, was a Contra regional
commander, an ex-secretary of the Contras' Commanders Council and a
military spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, the rebels'
political wing.
   Rugama was killed Saturday morning by two unidentified men in a
drive-by shooting in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa. Police
said his body was riddled with 26 bullet wounds by an Israeli-made
Uzi machine gun.
   Rugama reportedly attended a Contra leadership meeting in
Tegucigalpa in the morning and was on his way to a friend's birthday
party when he was slain on a highway just west of the capital.
   He was driving alone in an open Jeep when two men in a passing
vehicle opened fire. Police later found Rugama's body on the highway
next to the vehicle.
   Sandinista officials on Sunday continued to refuse comment on the
killing. One government spokesman told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview: ``We don't know anything about it.''
   But the Radio Sandino broadcast indicated that Rugama, also known
as ``Commander Aureliano,'' may have been killed by another
Nicaraguan guerrilla. Radio Sandino said Rugama previously had been
accused by a fellow rebel commander of selling arms to Salvadoran
guerrillas.
   The broadcast also said that in early 1988 several Contra
commanders rebelled against the group's leadership and ``in some
camps there were confrontations with gunshots.''
   Enrique Bermudez, a member of the Resistance directorate, told
reporters in Tegucigalpa on Saturday that he believed the slaying
was ``perpetrated by by the communists of the Sandinista Front, who
are our only enemies.''
   In Tegucigalpa, police on Sunday continued their search for
Rugama's killers.

   A former Miami police officer sought on racketeering
and narcotics charges was put on the FBI's list of the 10
most-wanted fugitives Sunday.
   Armando Garcia is wanted on charges of attempted murder of
government witnesses and drug theft, the FBI said.
   Garcia is accused of being part of a gang of officers who stole
and sold drugs and participated in 1985 in a drug raid in which
three men fleeing threats drowned in the Miami River. Ten former
Miami police officers involved in the so-called River Cops case have
pleaded guilty in federal court, and two others were tried and
convicted, the FBI said.
   The agency said the only remaining fugitives in the case are
Garcia, 26; his father, Toribio Dagobeerto Garcia, 50; and former
Miami police officer Victor Zapata, 30.
   Garcia is 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds with brown hair and a burn scar
on his left cheek.

   Former U.S. Rep. John Jenrette says his
arrest on charges of stealing a pair of shoes from a suburban
Washington store was ``a silly, silly mistake.''
   Jenrette, convicted in 1980 in the FBI's Abscam probe, was
charged last month with petty larceny and altering price tags at a
department store in Baileys Crossroads, Va., according to Fairfax
County District Court records.
   He is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 1, said his lawyer, Warren
McLain of Fairfax, Va.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette told The State
newspaper from Georgetown Saturday. He said if he hadn't lost his
temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the arrest ``probably wouldn't have
happened,'' the newspaper reported Sunday.
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes when
he heard that cars parked outside were being towed and that he
walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had parked
his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
A heated argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette, who lives in Myrtle Beach with his sister, denied
charges that he altered prices on a pair of pants and a shirt from a
clearance table.
   Under Virginia law, each misdemeanor charge carries a maximum
penalty of up to 12 months in jail.
   Jenrette was sentenced to two years in prison and five years'
probation on bribery and conspiracy charges in the Abscam sting
operation in which FBI agents posed as Arab sheiks and businessmen
offering bribes to lawmakers. He served 13 months.
   Jenrette, who describes himself as a recoverning alcoholic and
has helped establish a center from children of alcoholics in Myrtle
Beach, acknowledged this latest incident in his life ``is going to
be devastating.''
   He has applied for reinstatement to practice law, a matter that
is to be considered by the South Carolina Bar Association in May, he
said.
   ``I'm afraid this will affect their deliberations,'' he said.

   A tip from a company that sells
explosives led investigators to a house containing bombs, a keg of
gunpowder, tear gas grenades and other explosive devices,
authorities said.
   A 25-year-old man who posed as a policeman while purchasing riot
gear was taken into custody Saturday, Waukesha County deputy sheriff
Thomas Lentz said.
   ``I'm not well-versed in explosives but there is no question
there was enough stuff in there to blow up the house and who knows
what else,'' Lentz said.
   The man's identity was not released in the absence of formal
charges. He was sleeping when deputies arrived with a search
warrant. Neighbors said the man told them he worked as a security
consultant.
   Deputies found a loaded .38-caliber pistol under the man's
pillow, a .45-caliber automatic pistol, 20 homemade bombs of various
size, 10 tear gas grenades, detonators and other devices, Lentz said.

   Thompson, who worked recently as a handyman at Sacred Heart

   O'Brien was found by a parishioner shortly after 8 a.m. The
pastor had been beaten on the head, shoulders, and back with a blunt

   Emperor Akihito told his people Monday that he would
obey the constitution and work for world peace, then offered a
public farewell to his late father, Hirohito.
   Akihito's remarks, his first public statement since ascending the
Chrysanthemum Throne, came one day after his father was wrapped in a
white robe and placed in a coffin, where he will lie in state for
six weeks of funeral rites.
   More than 438,000 mournings came out in drizzling rain to honor
the dead emperor at the Imperial Palace. Akihito became emperor
shortly after Hirohito died of cancer Saturday at age 87.
   The 55-year-old Akihito spoke in clear and somber tones for four
minutes. The new Empress Michiko, 54, was on his left wearing a long
black veil. The new Crown Prince Naruhito, 28, was on his right.
   ``I pledge I will be always with the people at any time and abide
by the Japanese Constitution,'' Akihito said. The postwar
constitution bans the emperor from any role in government and limits
him to ceremonial functions, signing bills into law and serving as
``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   ``Based on this I will exert my responsibility. I hope for
further development of the country's fortunes and world peace and
improved welfare of the human race,'' he said.
   In Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, a time for a new emperor to set a tone for his reign and
to mourn his predecessor.
   ``I sincerely mourn the late emperor's demise,'' Akihito said.
``Based on stipulations of the Japanese Constitution and the
Imperial rules, I hereby succeeded to the throne. ... Considering
its heavy duties, I recognize solemn feeling from the bottom of my
heart.''
   The ceremony, held in the main hall of the Imperial Palace,
lasted just seven minutes but was an important milestone in the
transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei, or ``achieving
peace.''
   The simple rite was attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and about 300 people from the imperial family, government,
Parliament and the judiciary.
   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 after lying in state for more
than six weeks, the Cabinet announced Sunday.
   Thousands of police were deployed to prevent attacks by radical
leftist and rightist groups who equate the emperor with Japanese
militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito, died after a 62-year reign that stretched from Japan's
descent into militarism and defeat in World War II to its
astonishing recovery into an economic superpower.
   Chief palace physician Akira Takagi said doctors knew in
September 1987 that Hirohito had cancer in his upper intestinal
area, but ``for various reasons'' did not announce it or tell the
monarch.
   Japanese doctors and family members often do not tell people they
have cancer as it is considered demoralizing and because of their
belief the disease is almost always fatal and the patient will
become discouraged.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said it knew the emperor had cancer
long ago. ``This was not reported because the emperor himself had
not been informed of the true nature of his ailment,'' it said.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said the Cabinet decided
funeral costs will be shared by the government and Imperial
Household.
   Some opposition groups have warned government sponsorship of
funeral ceremonies, closely linked to Japan's native Shinto
religion, could violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Hirohito is the first emperor to die under Japan's postwar
constitution. Obuchi said funeral ceremonies will be held at Tokyo's
148-acre Shinjuku Gyoen Imperial Gardens. From there, his body will
be taken in procession to an imperial mausoleum in Hachioji, 28
miles away.
   A Foreign Ministry official said dignitaries from 130 nations are
expected for the ceremony where the Akihito will preside.
   More than 60 funeral and transition rites, some simple and some
complex, are expected in coming months. Akihito's coronation will be
delayed by a year's mourning, although he automatically became
emperor when Hirohito died.
   Obuchi said security is a major concern and, ``The minister of
home affairs ... said he wants to make sure there will not be any
guerrilla incidents.''
   Hirohito officially was commander in chief of the armed forces
during World War II, which was fought by the Japanese in his name.
Most historians agree he had no direct personal role in the war, but
critics say he should have prevented Japanese aggression.

   Two moderate earthquakes jolted an area
southeast of Adak in the Aleutian Islands on Sunday, but there were
no reports of damage or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center
reported.
   The first quake occurred at 10:57 a.m. and was centered 90 miles
southeast of Adak, center spokesman Wayne Jorgensen said. It
measured 5.6 on the Richter scale, he said.
   The second temblor occurred at 11:26 a.m. and was located in the
same general vicinity, he said. It measured 4.8 on the scale.
   Neither was felt at Adak, the nearest populated area, he said.
There also were no reports of tsunamis, the huge sea waves that can
devastate islands and coastal communities after earthquakes.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude; a reading of 7.5 means ground motion is 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 is
capable of moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage,
7 widespread damage and 8 tremendous damage.

   The teachings of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
should inspire people to tackle contemporary issues, two speakers
said in an ecumenical service Sunday kicking off a celebration of
the 60th anniversary of King's birth.
   ``His kind of love challenges us to take some risks we are not
taking. Dr. King's preaching will not leave us in peace,'' said the
Rev. Joseph L. Roberts, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. King
once was co-pastor at the church.
   The Rev. JoAnna Adams told of the day her church was burglarized,
with evidence left of drug use by the intruders who apparently sat
on the floor and read children's Bible stories before leaving the
building.
   ``It was a reminder to me that all is not well in this world,''
she said. The thief ``gave me a message I have to bring you:
`Without the message that Martin Luther King brought to this world,
the world will choke on violence and destruction,''' she told 700
people at the three-hour service.
   The service at The Temple launched a week of activities in
Atlanta leading up to Jan. 16 national holiday honoring the late
civil rights leader.
   Meanwhile, in an East German celebration of the 60th anniversary
of King's birth, the Rev. Joseph Lowery told a congregation that the
world's churches must help keep alive King's dream of world peace
and racial equality.
   Speaking to about 300 worshipers at the Church of St. Mary in
East Berlin, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference quoted poet Langston Hughes, who ``called upon us to hold
fast to dreams, for when dreams die, life is like a broken bird and
cannot fly.''
   ``We in the church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ must hold
fast to the dream. We have made much progress in my country toward
racial equality, but we still have a long way to go. In the struggle
for racial justice, we will hold fast,'' said Lowery, an Atlanta
minister.
   Lowery spoke in the same gothic-style sanctuary with 100-foot
ceilings and ornate columns where King preached in 1964.

<HEAD>Lexis? Lexus? Trademark Battles Perplex Us</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rules of the corporate name game could change
drastically if Toyota Motor Corp. loses its struggle to hang onto
Lexus as the name for its forthcoming line of luxury cars.
   If a federal appeals court bars Toyota from using Lexus because
of trademark infringement, the precedent might vastly complicate the
already brain-busting job of choosing new names.
   ``It's a humdinger, isn't it?'' said Jerome Gilson, a Chicago
lawyer who helped prepare the report that formed the basis for last
year's federal trademark law revisions.
   When Japan's biggest manufacturer ran afoul of Mead Corp.'s Lexis
trademark, it was only the latest corporate giant to be snagged by a
smaller company with a prior mark.
   Among previous victims: USX Corp., General Motor Corp.'s Saturn
division, and NBC, whose short-lived `N' logo happened to be the
same as that of the Nebraska educational television network.
   Even the Italian gun maker Beretta has gotten into the act, suing
GM's Chevrolet division over using the Beretta name for a sporty
compact coupe. The suit is pending.
   The Lexus-Lexis decision could be bigger than any of them,
though. That's because U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein went
unusually far in siding with the holder of an existing trademark.
   An affirmation by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
will hear the case Jan. 30, would have national repercussions
because of the prestige of the panel, which is one notch below the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Toyota is allowed to use Lexus at auto shows, but not in national
advertising, until the appeal is heard. The line is scheduled to go
on sale in September.
   A loss for Toyota would be disastrous: Edelstein said Toyota had
to either drop the Lexus name or, among other things, put a
disclaimer in all its advertising saying Lexus was not related to
Lexis.
   Even beyond Toyota's difficulties, the worldwide stakes in
trademark battles are enormous. The dollar value of famous names
explains the wars for control of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc.,
which owns names like Oreo, Ritz, Winston and Hawaiian Puch.
   Toyota was given a judo flip by Mead, a Dayton, Ohio-based
company that owns a computer data-retrieval service called Lexis
that is used mainly by lawyers, journalists and researchers.
   Mead failed to prove confusion was an issue. Clearly, no one who
wants the Lexis computer service would mistakenly stumble into a
Lexus showroom and buy a luxury car.
   Rather, Mead succeeded under a New York state law that protects
trademarks from ``dilution.'' It said Toyota's Lexus would become so
well-known that potential Lexis customers would think of the car
first when they heard the word Lexis _ ergo, dilution.
   The idea that a trademark can be diluted is a departure from the
main tradition of trademark law, which protected trademarks only
when there was clear potential for confusion between two products.
   More than 20 other states have anti-dilution statutes, including
California, Illinois and Massachusetts. Like New York's, those have
usually been given weak interpretations by the courts. But as long
as they are on the books, they can be enforced.
   New York's 35-year-old anti-dilution law was ``a ticking time
bomb'' that went off with Edelstein's ruling, said Gilson, the
trademark expert.
   The U.S. Trademark Association tried to defuse the states' legal
bombs last year by proposing a federal anti-dilution provision that
would supercede state laws and protect only truly famous trademarks,
on the order of Tiffany and Yves St. Laurent. Lexis most likely
would not have made the cut.
   The provision was rejected because ``Congress didn't want to
tinker with the state system,'' said William Borchard, counsel to
the U.S. Trademark Association.
   Striking a blow for the little guy, Edelstein said lesser-known
but distinctive trademarks deserve as much protection as the famous
names owned by ``the largest and most powerful corporations in the
country.''
   The problem with protecting all trademarks equally, no matter how
obscure, is that soon _ in fact, now _ no good names will be
available for companies that need them.
   In a typical recent debacle, HNG-Internorth Inc. switched its
name to Enteron upon the advice of Lippincott &amp; Margulies only to
discover it was a name for the human alimentary canal. It settled
for Enron.
   Mead's own Nexis service, a sibling of Lexis, shares its name
with at least a dozen other products, including a hair-care line
called Nexxus.
   Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott &amp; Margulies, which worked
with Toyota but did not pick Lexus, said Mead should stop
complaining.
   ``If I were Mead I would send a thank-you note to Mr. (Eiji)
Toyoda (the chairman) for raising the awareness level of my
product,'' Chajet said.

   The head of Venezuela's central bank
plans to meet with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in
New York on Monday to discuss upcoming debt negotiations, according
to a published report.
   The Caracas daily El Nacional quoted unidentified sources Sunday
as saying Mauricio Garcia Araujo will seek the Fed's participation
as mediator in the talks with creditor banks.
   Venzuela is looking for more favorable terms on rescheduling
repayment of Venezuela's $33 billion debt, the fourth largest in
Latin America, said El Nacional.
   Venezuela decided last week to suspend payment of principal on
its debt due to a drop in the country's international reserves
brought about by falling oil prices in 1988 and continued government
subsidies of imports.
   A Venezuelan negotiating team is scheduled to meet with creditor
bank representatives Thursday in New York's Chase Manhattan Corp.
bank headquarters.

   OPEC Secretary General Subroto arrived in
Egypt on Sunday to discuss cooperation between the cartel and
non-members on controlling oil production, the Middle East New
Agency said.
   The agency said Subroto, a former Indonesian oil minister, will
hold talks with Egyptian Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil and Prime

   Oil prices have been on the rise since the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in November to cut daily oil
production to 18.5 million barrels.
   Although Egypt is not an OPEC member, it often follows the
policies of the 13-nation cartel.

   President Reagan sends Congress his final
budget proposal Monday, a $1.15 trillion spending plan that would
award the military a hefty increase while calling for the
elimination of scores of domestic programs.
   But Congress is already looking beyond Reagan's budget to see how
President-elect Bush will keep his campaign promises to boost
spending for education, child care and housing without raising taxes
while at the same time erasing the budget deficit through a
``flexible freeze'' on other government programs.
   The Reagan administration insists that its final budget, for the
1990 fiscal year which begins next Oct. 1, is not irrelevant even
though Reagan will be out of office 11 days after it is unveiled.
   Joseph R. Wright Jr., Reagan's budget director, said the spending
plan would give Bush an excellent starting point for his own
negotiations because it does not seek any new taxes and leaves
Social Security untouched, two commitments Bush also has made.
   Reagan will leave office with a budget that proposes collecting
$1.06 trillion in revenues and spending $1.15 trillion, leaving a
budget deficit of $92.5 billion.
   The deficit figure, if realized, would be the lowest since a
$73.7 billion deficit in 1981, the year Reagan took office with a
pledge to balance the budget by 1984. Reagan's campaign promise was
swamped under a tide of red ink that has almost tripled the national
debt.
   The budget deficit in the current fiscal year is projected by
many economists to total $155 billion, identical to the deficit in
the fiscal year which ended last Sept. 30.
   The president's final budget is an ideologically conservative
document that revives many of Reagan's favorite themes against big
government, proposing to eliminate 82 government programs while
protecting his defense buildup and recommending a big increase for
the space-based nuclear shield known as Star Wars.
   To trim the deficit, Reagan will propose closing down the
Interstate Commerce Commission, reducing subsidies for the Amtrak
railroad passenger service and moving some regional power
authorities into private hands _ all ideas Reagan has advanced
before without success.
   ``This is a responsible, conservative budget. It has been put
through a reasonableness test,'' Wright said Sunday. ``If he wants
to use it that way, it provides President-elect Bush with a good
base to begin negotiations with Congress during a very tough year.''
   Reagan also will propose the sale of about $6 billion in
government assets and call for further cuts in farm subsidies. The
budget also will seek to trim about $4 billion from doctor and
hospital fees in the huge Medicare program, which provides health
care for the elderly and disabled.
   In the way of increases, Reagan's budget will propose spending $5
billion a year over the next five years to close or merge hundreds
of failed savings and loan associations. It also makes a down
payment of $900 million to start cleaning up and rebuilding the
government's aging nuclear weapons plants.
   However, some estimates of the cost of the S&amp;L bailout now top
$100 billion and the Energy Department has said the weapons plants
could require as much as $138 billion over the next 20 years.
   Democratic critics say the gap between what Reagan is
recommending for the S&amp;L crisis and the nuclear cleanup and the
expected costs highlight the problems Bush will face in keeping his
no-new-taxes pledge.
   In addition, Bush is expected to have a list of his own programs
where he will be seeking higher spending to fulfill promises made
during the presidential campaign.
   New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, senior Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, said in a recent interview that he expects Bush
will ask for additional money over the Reagan-recommended levels for
day care, education, acid-rain prevention, housing for the homeless,
a project to fight the effects of global warming and anti-drug
programs.
   Bush said last Friday that he would outline his own spending
recommendations during a joint session of Congress within the first
few weeks after taking office.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine said Sunday
that Congress will closely examine the Bush spending plan to see how
he will stick to his flexible freeze approach to lowering the budget
deficit without raising taxes while at the same time increasing
spending in many areas.
   Under the flexible freeze, the growth in total government
spending would be held to the yearly increase in inflation with
certain programs, such as Social Security, exempt from any cuts.
   ``My own view is that it is very difficult,'' Mitchell said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press. ``But (Bush) has said it can be done and
that he will do it. .... My feeling is let's give him a chance to
see if he meant what he said and if he can do what he promised.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, appearing on the same program,
said it would be a mistake to count on Bush retreating from his
campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
   ``I think George Bush meant it and if people don't read lips in
this town, I think they are going to be left out somewhere,'' Dole
said.
