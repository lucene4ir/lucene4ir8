   Liberace's ex-lover testified Tuesday that a
convicted drug dealer spoke of a ``bloody mess'' after a 1981
quadruple murder and said, ``The whole thing got out of hand.''
   Scott Thorson said defendant Eddie Nash also told him he was
going to teach a lesson to a group of people who had robbed him,
saying, ``I'll have these people on their knees.''
   Nash, 59, whose real name is Adel Nasrallah, and his bodyguard
Gregory Diles, 40, are charged with the Laurel Canyon slayings in
which sex-film star John Holmes once was tried and acquitted.
   Witnesses at the current preliminary hearing said Nash was robbed
of cash, drugs and jewelry by two subsequent murder victims. Witness
David Lind, who participated in the robbery, said Nash fell to his
knees and asked for time to pray, assuming he would be killed.
   Scott Thorson, 29, who was Liberace's companion from 1977 to
1982, said he became close friends with Nash after he bought cocaine
from him in early 1981. He said he wound up living at Nash's house
when Liberace evicted him in 1982.
   At the end of June 1981, Thorson recalled, he went to Nash's
house to buy cocaine. Soon, he said, Diles appeared with Holmes in
tow. Diles took Holmes into a bedroom, Thorson said, adding he was
told to leave but listened outside the door.
   ``Eddie (Nash) was screaming at the top of his lungs,'' Thorson
said. ``... He threatened that he would kill John Holmes' family and
he would kill him if he didn't take him to the home of the people
who robbed him.''
   Diles and Holmes left and Nash said that he had sent Diles ``to
get his property.'' Thorson said.
   Later, Thorson said, Nash sank into a depression and went on a
drug binge. During one of those sessions, Thorson said Nash confided
in him.
   ``He discussed ... Wonderland (the street on which the murders
occurred) and he had gone a little too far,'' said Thorson.
   ``He used the term, `a bloody mess,''' said Thorson. ``He said
the whole thing got out of hand.''
   ``Did he say he had the murders done?'' asked Deputy District
Attorney Dale Davidson.
   ``He didn't come right out and say it,'' said Thorson. ``... He
said they were pinning the murders on him.''
   The victims, Ronald Launius, 37, Roy DeVerell, 42, Barbara
Richardson, 22, and Joy Audrey Miller, 46, were bludgeoned to death
on July 1, 1981, about two days after Lind said Nash was robbed.
   Launius' wife, Susan, survived the attack but was never able to
identify her attacker. Holmes died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome last March.
   Thorson made headlines when he sued Liberace for $12 million
claiming the entertainer reneged on a promise to support him for
life. Liberace died of AIDS in 1987.

   The landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel, a home
away from home for six presidents and armies of celebrities since
1875, has closed for the first time since the great earthquake of
1906 for a $60 million, 18-month renovation.
   ``It's very strange. It's very lonely,'' Donald Timbie, the
hotel's general manager and vice president, said Monday as the hotel
shut down.
   The quake, which destroyed much of the city, triggered a fire
which gutted the original, seven-story hotel. But 12-foot-thick
brick walls saved the shell and it was rebuilt to its current nine
stories and reopened Dec. 16, 1909, with other alterations in 1915,
1919 and 1925.
   Tenor Enrico Caruso was a guest as the temblor struck. He was
tossed from his bed and vowed, ``I will never set foot in San
Francisco again.''
   ``Actually, the earthquake only destroyed 8 percent of the
structure,'' said Jim Kilroy, the hotel's director of marketing.
``The fire did the rest.''
   The hotel has been host to Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William
Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry
Truman. Warren G. Harding died there, in room 8064 on Aug. 2, 1923.
   Other notables who stayed at the Palace include Mark Twain, Oscar
Wilde, Charles Lindberg, Amelia Earhart, Charlie Chaplin, Nikita
Khrushchev and Winston Churchill.
   President Woodrow Wilson gave his famous League of Nations speech
there, and the Garden Court held the official banquet honoring the
opening session of the United Nations.
   King David Kalakaua of Hawaii, the last of the island's monarchs,
died at the Palace on Jan. 20, 1891.
   The hotel's exterior will not be altered. Neither will the Garden
Court, a 9,350-square-foot restaurant originally built as a carriage
entrance. It was declared a city landmark in 1969 and the only work
there will involve a clean-up and a change in color scheme.
   The last luncheon was held in the court Monday. The San Francisco
Opera Guild event drew about 12 people who sat at one table, dwarfed
by the huge room that features an arching dome of iridescent glass.
   The Market Street hotel, which has 525 guest rooms and 60 suites,
will add a swimming pool and health spa, along with about 5,000
square feet of meeting space.
   Market Street, which begins near San Francisco Bay and runs
through the heart of the city's business district, has undergone a
recent revival. The repaving and renovation of six downtown blocks
was completed late last year, and the opening last October of a
lavish new Nordstrom department store a few blocks from the hotel
has attracted visitors to the area.

<TEXT>
   A Moslem Israeli army officer who spent more
than seven years in prison on false charges of spying is suing
Israel and secret service agents who interrogated him for $800,000,
a newspaper reported.
   Lt. Izzat Nafsu, 33, filed a suit in Nazareth district court on
Sunday seeking the damages from the state, eight agents of the Shin
Bet secret service and a psychiatrist, the Hadashot daily reported
Monday.
   A court spokesman in Nazareth could not immediately be reached
for comment.
   Nafsu was arrested while serving in southern Lebanon in late
1979, and a military court convicted him of treason and espionage in
1981 for allegedly passing weapons and information to the enemy.
   But Nafsu was released from prison in May 1987 after a Supreme
Court ruling that the security service had used illegal methods and
committed perjury.
   Nafsu is a member of Israel's Circassian minority of about 3,000
people, who are non-Arab Moslems. They are descendants of soldiers
who once protected the Turkish sultans, and are among the few
Moslems to serve in Israel's army.
   In his suit, Nafsu says Shin Bet agents questioned him after he
was put under hypnosis by the psychiatrist, Hadashot said.
   Nafsu has said that during questioning by Shin Bet officers he
was deprived of sleep, subjected to hot and cold showers and forced
to stand outdoors in freezing weather wearing only underwear.

   The murder of ecologist and union leader
Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes on Dec. 22, to which a rancher's son
confessed, focused attention on the struggle between
conservationists and ranchers in the vast Amazon rain forest. An AP
reporter visited the region and filed this report.

<TEXT>
   Dusk fell on a sultry evening just before
Christmas and Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes invited his two police
bodyguards to share a family dinner of fried fish, urging them to
start while he showered in the stall outside.
   It was a typically friendly gesture by Mendes. It also was a
fatal one.
   The bodyguards had become almost fixtures in the household since
Mendes began getting death threats because of his campaign to save
the Amazon rain forest from destruction by ranchers and land
speculators.
   ``I was nervous and worried,'' his widow, Ilzamar, said later.
``The death threats were getting more frequent. They said he
wouldn't make it past Christmas, but Chico tried to hide it from
me.''
   Mendes made it only to three days before Christmas.
   He was home at noon in the sleepy Amazon town of 5,000 people
2,700 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, near the border with
Bolivia.
   At 4 p.m. he was engrossed in his favorite pastime: playing
dominoes with friends from the Workers Party and the local rubber
tappers union, of which he was president. As usual, he won.
   His friends left and, at 7 p.m., Mendes stood up and asked
Ilzamar to bring the new blue-and-white towel that was a present for
his 44th birthday a week earlier.
   Stepping to the back door of the four-room wooden cabin perched
on rotting wooden pilings, he peered past the coconut, guava and
cupuacu trees toward the silt-brown Acre River 50 yards away.
   ``It's so dark outside. Those guys could be out there waiting to
ambush me,'' he said, seeming almost to joke. The guards continued
eating.
   At least to men, perhaps three, crouched unseen 15 feet away near
the white concrete outhouse and shower stall.
   With his new towel over his right shoulder and a lantern in his
hand, Mendes cautiously pushed the door open.
   A .20-gauge shotgun boomed. Mendes staggered back, lurched past
the kitchen table to the door of the children's room and collapsed.
The killers fled through the back gate.
   ``I was on the sofa feeding the kids and raced back to the
kitchen,'' Ilzamar said. ``I passed the two bodyguards running the
other way. They jumped out of the window.
   ``Chico had his hands up to his head like he was in a lot of
pain. I just saw a little blood at first and thought, good, it's not
serious; he's going to live. But it was just that the towel was new
and it took awhile for the blood to soak through.''
   The shotgun blast blew a hole in the towel and left nearly 50
pellets in his chest and arms. He died almost immediately.
   ``I wanted to cry but couldn't,'' said Julio Barbosa de Aquino,
who succeeded Mendes as union president. ``Nobody believed they
could kill a man like that, who never hurt anybody.''
   A lifelong battle to preserve the rain forest made powerful
enemies for Mendes.
   He became a rubber tapper as a boy of 10 and believed the jungle
should be exploited for latex and Brazil nuts, not destroyed to make
cattle ranches. In the past decade, a section of rain forest the
size of California has been razed and burned for farms and pasture.
   Mendes helped unionize rubber tappers, and in 1976 was elected
assemblyman for Xapuri.
   With age, his ideas became more radical.
   ``In the beginning he wasn't political,'' Aquino said. ``He just
wanted to help tappers sell their latex and not be kicked off the
land. But ... lately he was talking about defense of the forest and
union of jungle peoples like tappers and Indians.''
   Ilzamar said Mendes admired Augusto Cesar Sandino, the Nicaraguan
revolutionary of 60 years ago, and named their 2-year-old son for
him. Their 4-year-old daughter, Elenira, was named for a Brazilian
communist guerrilla killed by soldiers during the military rule of
1964-85.
   ``He became much more radical,'' she said. ``He said he wouldn't
stand for another tree to be cut down. People called him a
communist. ... He said that if being a communist was defending the
Amazon and the rubber tappers, he accepted the name.''
   One technique Mendes used was the ``empate,'' or stalemate, in
which tappers, usually unarmed, would surround a work gang preparing
to raze a section of forest. They would withdraw only when the owner
signed an agreement to leave the area intact.
   Mendes preached non-violence but gunmen working for landowners
have ambushed and killed many tappers. Few have been brought to
trial.
   ``This is organized crime, and the cattle raisers and land
speculators are behind it,'' said Moacyr Grechi, Roman Catholic
bishop of Rio Branco, the Acre state capital 110 miles from Xapuri.
``They have total impunity, and Chico Mendes was on the firing line,
facing their gunmen every day,''
   Officials generally considered Mendes too rigid in his defense of
the environment.
   ``He wanted the total preservation of the forest, but we think
it's important to have economic development of the area too,'' said
Jose Carlos Castelo Branco, the Acre state secretary of security.
   The union leader's knowledge of the Amazon environment made him a
sought-after consultant to the World Bank and other institutions. He
traveled abroad and often had foreign visitors.
   ``There were teams of gringos here almost every week; they loved
my food,'' Ilzamar said, standing beside a bookcase that held
plaques from the U.N. Environment Program and the Better World
Society.
   Fatima Carvalho Mastub, a neighbor, said she took calls at all
hours from around the world for Mendes because he did not have a
telephone.
   A successful ``empate'' at the Cachoeira rubber grove, which
covers thousands of acres, probably led to his death.
   The owner was Darly Alves da Silva, a feared rancher wanted by
police in southern Parana state in connection with several killings.
   After the confrontation at Cachoeira, the federal government
expropriated the holding and made it an ``extractivist reserve,''
meaning the rubber and Brazil nut trees would remain for tappers and
harvesters.
   Mendes said da Silva vowed to kill him. He reported the threats
and Gov. Flaviano Melo gave him police protection.
   Four days after Mendes was killed, da Silva's 21-year-old son,
Darcy, confessed. He told reporters his father had been forced into
hiding to escape persecution by police and rubber tappers.
   Romeu Tuma, the federal police chief, said police believed the
shooting was ``a family decision'' by the da Silvas.
   Chico Mendes knew he was courting death. Mrs. Mastub, the
neighbor, quoted him as saying: ``I know I'm hanging by a thread,
but I'll keep going to the end.''
   Bishop Grechi said Mendes was ``just one of 89 murder victims in
rural Brazil in 1988, and not one of the killers has been brought to
justice. The solution is land reform, but the government doesn't
have the authority to carry it out.''

<HEAD>Controlling Chemical Weapons Nearly Impossible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the sidelines of the world chemical weapons
conference, experts say bleakly no headway has been made on the most
worrisome threat: keeping the chemicals away from terrorists or
leaders bent on genocide.
   Sentiment aside, they say, poison gas works and it is nearly
impossible to control its components without energetic, voluntary
action by governments and private industry.
   At the same time, they add, many small nations refuse to ban such
weapons while neighbors have atomic bombs, the way a streetwise
youth carries a switch-blade because of bullies down the block.
   Few technicians among the 151 delegations attending the five-day
Paris conference wanted to be named, leaving the limelight to
statesmen drafting a declaration against producing and using
chemical or biological weapons.
   A European specialist summed up the mood: ``This conference is
one thing. Controlling the stuff is another. You have to conclude
that chemical weapons won the war for Iraq. That sends a very strong
negative message.''
   Iraq acknowledged using poison gas in its eight-year war with
Iraq, in which a cease-fire was reached Aug. 20.
   An American expert said many Third World military strategists are
seeking advice from Iraq, which he said had five years of experience
with mustard gas and nerve gas.
   Another U.S. specialist said gas and biological agents would
remain effective against ``inconvenient minorities'' even if nations
could be kept from using them outside their borders.
   Iraq has been accused of using poison gas against rebellious
Kurds.
   Terrorists could wreak havoc with small amounts of nerve agents,
without complex delivery systems.
   Max Friedersdorf, U.S. envoy to the Geneva disarmament talks,
agreed in an interview that a gulf exists between what probably will
be negotiated and what can be applied.
   ``There is a technical gap, and 100 percent verification ... is
almost impossible, but that doesn't mean we should not continue,''
he said.
   Richard Perle, the former senior Defense Department official
involved in negotiations, went further in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   ``In this case, 100 percent non-verification is the fact,'' he
said. ``You cannot control this.''
   Perle and most experts agreed the only effective measure is to
stop companies from exporting essential chemicals or helping other
countries make weapons.
   Although some poison gases are easy to make, they say, mass
production and accurate delivery systems require sophisticated
assistance.
   ``You cannot let yourself be put off by the hand
thrower-uppers,'' one American delegate said. ``Of course it is
hard, but the horse is not all the way out of the barn. We have to
do this fast.''
   U.S. and West German specialists estimated 20 to 25 companies
regularly sell chemicals to Third World countries making deadly
agents, and about another 300 have made sales in recent years. They
said most of the companies were West German.
   The only control now is the informal Australia Suppliers Group,
representatives of 19 nations who meet regularly in Paris to discuss
possible dangerous sales by private suppliers.
   ``We have to rely on each country to provide information and take
action,'' said a delegate who regularly attends those meetings.
``Our effect is limited.''
   Even with the best of political will it would take two to three
years to agree on a treaty and 10 more to eliminate chemical
weapons, he said, and ``that is a long time to keep up political
pressure.''
   West German authorities say they want to prevent dangerous
exports but are hampered by lack of an international code.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, addressing the
conference, appealed for a ban on chemical weapons combined with
mandatory inspections on 48 hours notice in cases of suspicion.
   U.S. negotiators first suggested such challenge inspections in
1984, Perle said, but subsequent study showed that, ``in a matter of
days, even hours, all evidence can be removed.''
   He added, referring to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi: ``Even
if an accord were reached for investigators to leave the moment they
had a suspicion, who in their right mind would believe that someone
like Colonel Gadhafi would allow it to happen?''
   The United States accuses Libya of building a chemical weapons
plant with the help of a West Germany company. Libya says it is a
pharmaceutical factory.
   Perle said the West Germans should police their own exporters.
   ``They allow their companies to get involved in this, cover it up
and go around lecturing us,'' he said. Another American delegate
commented: ``It is not an accident that people as efficient as the
Germans cannot control these people.''

<HEAD>Army Officers Arrested For Issuing Political Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military authorities have arrested five
junior officers who urged the military not to meddle in politics and
charged them with violating the military code by engaging in
political activity.
   Dissidents and opposition parties backed the officers, who were
arrested Monday, and demanded they be exonerated.
   The Defense Ministry said Capt. Lee Dong-kyun and four colleagues
from an army engineering battalion near Seoul issued a statement
Thursday at the Korea National Council of Churches, calling on the
military to stay out of politics.
   They also were charged with accusing some ``political officers''
of disgracing the military's image by meddling in political affairs
in the past.
   The officers were charged with taking collective action to
express their political view. Conviction could mean two years in
prison.
   South Korean military codes strictly ban political activity by
soldiers.
   The military has played a strong role in South Korean politics
since the late President Park Chung-hee, then an army general,
staged a coup and toppled a civilian government in 1960.
   In 1980, Chun Doo-hwan, a former army general, seized power with
military backing. The ex-president has been accused of corruption
and other abuses since he stepped down last February.
   President Roh Tae-woo, also a former army general and once close
ally of Chun, has promised to end military intervention in politics
and to introduce complete democracy.

   ``The Naked Gun,'' featuring Leslie Nielsen as a bumbling police
detective, drew $4.7 million. ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' with
Steve Martin and Michael Caine as dueling con men, grossed $3.5
million.
   In seventh place was Robert Towne's ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring
Mel Gibson as a drug dealer trying to go straight, with sales of $3
million. Next was the animated film ``Oliver and Co.,'' the Oliver
Twist-inspired tale of a homeless kitten, which got $2.6 million.

   Music sensation Michael Jackson will receive a
special American Music Awards tribute this month to acknowledge the
international impact of his ``Bad'' album.
   The American Music Award of Achievement trophy will be presented
to the entertainer Jan. 30 during ceremonies televised nationwide by
ABC-TV.
   The trophy honors Jackson ``because his album `Bad' is the first
ever to contain five No. 1 singles, and in recognition of its
international impact in becoming 1988's best-selling album in the
world,'' the organizers said in a statement Monday.
   Jackson, who already has received 13 American Music Awards, is
also a double nominee this year _ for male vocalist in the pop-rock
and soul-rhythm and blues categories.
   International sales for ``Bad'' have reached 20 million. The
album's five singles reaching the No. 1 position were ``Dirty
Diana,'' ``Man in the Mirror,'' ``The Way You Make Me Feel,'' ``I
Just Can't Stop Loving You'' and ``Bad.'' A sixth single, ``Smooth
Criminal,'' is in the Top 10.

   Actor Gary Busey moved into a private
rehabilitation center a month after his near-fatal motorcycle crash,
but his publicist said he was improving and dismissed concerns about
the slow recovery.
   ``He did have a serious head injury and they are very
optimistic,'' spokeswoman Carla Schalman said. ``Everything is going
very well. The primary reason for the move is so that Gary can have
some privacy.''
   Busey, 44, left Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Friday and was
taken to the rehabilitation center, hospital spokesman Ron Wise
said. The actor was in fair condition and ``seemed to be doing
well'' when he left, Wise said.
   The family didn't want the name of the rehabilitation center
disclosed.
   Busey, an active opponent of mandatory helmet laws, wasn't
wearing a helmet Dec. 4 when he lost control of his motorcycle in
Culver City, fell and hit the back of his head on a curb.
   The actor underwent 90 minutes of neurosurgery shortly after
arriving at Cedars-Sinai, and his condition has steadily improved.
Wise said the prognosis for a full recovery still holds up and that
the recovery time wasn't unusually long for someone with such a
serious injury.
   Busey, whose movie credits include ``Big Wednesday,'' ``Carney''
and ``Lethal Weapon,'' was nominated for an Academy Award for his
starring role in ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' Most recently, he
portrayed a journalist in the HBO miniseries ``A Dangerous Life.''

   President Reagan's son Michael is following in
his father's footsteps ... in radio.
   Michael Reagan has signed a two-year contract to do news, weather
and sports as co-host of a morning radio talk show in San Diego.
   ``I'm excited about it. You can be the ugliest person ever and do
well on radio,'' Reagan, 43, said Monday from his suburban Sherman
Oaks home.
   Reagan, adopted son of Ronald Reagan and ex-wife Jane Wyman,
makes his KSDO radio debut Monday with co-host Jack Merker. They
will be on the air weekdays 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m.
   Reagan's father was a radio sports announcer in the 1930s,
re-creating Chicago Cubs baseball games from wire-service
play-by-play on stations in Iowa.
   Michael Reagan wouldn't divulge financial terms of his contract
with the ABC affiliate.
   ``It's not the money. The biggest thing is keeping yourself out
in public,'' said the younger Reagan, who has frequently filled in
for vacationing talk show hosts at KABC Radio in Los Angeles.
   Asked if he planned to have the president on his show, Reagan
said: ``I imagine he will be in the news so I will be talking about
him.''

   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles Jr. started
his first day as a university professor by being late for his first
class, then telling his students they'll learn the federal budget
process from the inside out.
   ``It's great to see a bunch of bright young people who are
interested,'' Chiles said afterward. ``For the first day, we got by.
No one jumped up and said, `This guy's a fraud.'''
   Chiles was 13 minutes late for the ``Legislative Politics''
class. He later said he had trouble finding a parking place and had
to park four blocks away.
   Chiles is the University of Florida's first Manning Dauer Eminent
Scholar in Political Science. In taking the teaching assignment,
Chiles returned to the university where he received his
undergraduate and law degrees.
   The 58-year-old Democrat, who was chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee when he decided not to seek re-election last fall, passed
out thick copies of this year's federal budget and a booklet
explaining the budget process.
   ``We'll see how the process works and some of the motivations
behind it,'' he said.
   Chiles asked each of his 20 students, mostly seniors, to tell how
they became interested in politics.
   When one student mentioned he had been a volunteer for Ronald
Reagan, Chiles quipped, ``Brother, you are in the right place. We
may be able to save you.''

<HEAD>Surgeon General Increases Estimate of Smoking-Related Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new surgeon general's report on smoking scheduled
for release this week increases the estimate of smoking-related
deaths by 30 percent to 390,000 a year, The Christian Science
Monitor reported Monday.
   The report, which comes 25 years after the first surgeon
general's report on smoking, also cites cigarette smoking as the
cause for nine out of 10 lung cancer deaths among women, the
newspaper said.
   Other conclusions in the report by Dr. C. Everett Koop are that
lung cancer now surpasses breast cancer as the leading cancer killer
among women, 43 chemicals in tobacco are now confirmed as cancer
causing and smoking is a major cause of cerebral vascular disease.
   Koop's increase in his estimate of smoking-related deaths from
300,000 annually is due to more accurate accounting rather than more
lethal cigarettes, The Monitor said in a release it distributed two
days before the report was to have been made public.
   Koop estimates that 50 million Americans still smoke, the
newspaper said.
   Children, especially girls, are smoking at younger ages, the
Monitor quoted the report as saying, with 80 percent of smokers born
since 1935 starting before the age of 21, despite state age
restrictions on the purchase of cigarettes.
   However, Koop found that in 1987, nearly half of all adults who
had smoked had quit, with the trend particularly true among men.
   Before the report was issued, the Tobacco Institute began a
campaign in newspapers around the country. In ads headlined,
``Enough is enough,'' the institute said the results of a nationwide
poll it commissioned shows that the majority of Americans do not
want an increase in cigarette taxes, more smoking bans or the
elimination of cigarette advertising.

<HEAD>Astronomers Say Star-Eating Pulsar Explains Celestial Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have spotted a star as it devoured its
companion orb, and perhaps solved a celestial mystery.
   Scientists have long argued about how some superdense stars
called pulsars could get themselves spinning hundreds of times a
second. The question may now be answered by the discovery of a black
widow binary _ a star that like the spider uses its companion and
then destroys it.
   If current theories are correct, the star represents a celestial
missing link, a bridge between fast-spinning stars that have mates
and those that do not.
   The combination of the star and its companion, labeled PSR
1957-20 in astronomers' shorthand, was detected last spring by
Andrew Fruchter of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
   At a meeting Monday of the American Astronomical Society,
scientists described the significance of the find in understanding
the life and death of the stars.
   The duo is made up of a pulsar, an incredibly dense dead star
that transmits rhythmic beats of radar. It is orbited by a much
larger ordinary star known as a brown dwarf.
   Astronomers have evidence that the pulsar is transmitting a
powerful blast of energy that is literally blowing its companion
away. They believe this is the late phase of a long, one-sided
relationship between the two in which the pulsar steals matter from
its mate to boost its speed, then turns on it with a blaze of atomic
particles.
   ``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio of
Cornell University. ``It is constantly losing matter. Eventually it
could completely disappear.''
   The pulsar is one of six known pulsars that spin extremely
rapidly. The newly discovered pair is important because they seem to
help explain how they get to spin so fast.
   ``It offers a missing link between two classes of objects,'' said
Steve Maran of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ``That's why
astronomers are so excited.''
   A pulsar is the collapsed remains of a large star that has
exploded in a spectacular disaster called a supernova. Pulsars emit
no light, but broadcast twin rotating beams of radar, like
lighthouses in the sky.
   While a pulsar is only 14 miles across, its mass is 50 percent
greater than the sun. One teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions
of tons.
   Most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down.
However, the newly discovered one spins about 600 times a second.
   Astronomers theorize that such fast-moving pulsars speed up by
stealing a stream of matter from a companion star. The companion
``spins up the pulsar like a top,'' said Fruchter.
   However, astronomers have noticed while some of these
fast-spinning pulsars have companions, others do not.
   ``People wondered, `If you spin up the pulsar with a companion,
where is the companion?''' said Fruchter. ``This may explain that.
The pulsar has evaporated the companion.''
   In the newly spotted couple, the companion is close to the
pulsar, a distance of only 2{ times the sun's diameter. Yet it is
being bombarded with atomic particles 5,000 times more intense than
the sun.
   Astronomers were able to study the pair because the companion
regularly eclipses the pulsar. The companion revolves around the
pulsar once every nine hours, and each time it blocks out the
pulsar's radar beam for about 50 minutes.
   ``This is the only one (mate-eating pulsar) that we have seen in
the galaxy,'' said E. Sterl Phinney of the California Institute of
Technology. ``But there is the exciting possibility that there will
be many more.''

<HEAD>Reagan Leaves Issues Of Contras, Moscow Embassy For Bush to Solve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is leaving office proposing a
truce in his battle with the United Nations and a boost in arms aid
to friendly nations, but tossing the question of Nicaragua's Contra
rebels to successor George Bush.
   Reagan's foreign policy positions were reflected in the fiscal
1990 budget plan he sent to Congress on Monday. Officials say his
$13.2 billion foreign aid spending budget should remain relatively
unchanged by the new Bush administration.
   Consistent with past practice, there was no request for Contra
assistance in Reagan's final budget. The president routinely has
treated that issue separately, and this time it will be Bush's
decision.
   Another difficult problem to be resolved by Bush is what to do
about the bug-riddled new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow.
   In his budget plan for next year, Reagan proposed to give the
United Nations and other international organizations the full U.S.
share of their budgets for the first time since 1986.
   In addition, Reagan proposed to throw in $46 million as a
downpayment on the $572 million in cumulative U.S. arrears to
international organizations.
   Reagan has held back part of the one-fourth U.S. share of U.N.
financing since 1986 to protest what he charged was the world body's
wasteful bureaucracy and anti-American tone.
   The budget document pronounced that pressure successful and said
the organization has reformed enough to warrant a reward.
   Of the $14.8 billion in total foreign aid budget authority Reagan
asked for next year, military assistance to U.S. allies comes to
slightly more than $5 billion, about 7 percent over the current
year. As he has in the past, Reagan sought to convert loan programs
for military sales into straight grants.
   Direct economic aid to friendly nations would amount to $3.3
billion, a slight increase from the current figure.
   As usual, Israel and Egypt were the two largest recipients of
proposed aid. Israel was earmarked for $1.8 billion in military aid
and $1.2 billion in economic assistance, or $3 billion in total
spending authority.
   Egypt was proposed to receive $2.3 billion, including $1.3
billion for military purposes and $815 million in economic aid.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said Bush's nominee for
secretary of state, James A. Baker III, had not been consulted about
the budget made public Monday.
   But Whitehead said that ``I have no reason to believe there will
be any sharp differences'' in the new administration over the Reagan
budget proposals.

   A Trident 2 submarine missile hurled
a dummy warhead to an Atlantic Ocean target, its 14th success in 18
test launchings, the Navy says.
   One or two more land pad tests are planned before the Navy begins
test firings from a submerged submarine.
   The $23.7 million missile roared off a land launching pad Monday.
   The 44-foot missile, the Navy's most powerful, has a range of
nearly 6,000 miles. Officials declined to disclose how far the dummy
warhead traveled.
   The first sub designed to carry the Trident 2, the USS Tennessee,
was commissioned Dec. 17 and is due at Cape Canaveral soon for sea
trials. The Tennessee is scheduled to begin test-firing the new
missile within a few weeks.
   The submarine is to go on patrol late this year with the first
operational Trident 2s. It will carry 24 missiles, each capable of
delivering 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.

<HEAD>Shultz May Sit Out Conference Unless Greece Yields On Turkey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George P. Shultz plans to cancel his last
official trip overseas _ to a human rights conference in Vienna _
unless Greece gives ground in a dispute over how much of Turkey
should be covered by an East-West arms control agreement.
   A decision by the Secretary of State to stay home also means he
would miss a 32nd and final meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   At the root of this uncertainty is an effort by the Greek
government to expose more Turkish territory to conventional arms
control coverage.
   Boundaries have been drawn for conventional arms control
negotiations designed to follow the close of the rights conference,
but Greece, suspicious of Turkey and fretful about Cyprus, is
holding out.
   Everyone else in the 16-nation NATO alliance has agreed on the
precise expanse of Europe to be covered in the Conventional
Stability Talks with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce troops,
tanks and artillery across the European landscape.
   But unless a compromise is struck with Athens and its mercurial
prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, the Vienna conference _ which
makes its decisions by consensus _ cannot close and negotiations
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact will be put off indefinitely.
   The rights conference, which opened in November 1986, has
reviewed compliance with the Helsinki agreement. The 35-nation
accord signed in the Finnish capital in 1975 provided for human
rights improvements and a lessening of tensions between East and
West.
   The arms control talks are covered by the conference because they
aim at reducing those tensions.
   The end of the Vienna conference would set the stage for the
opening within weeks of the arms control talks between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   The United States and Moscow had agreed in 1983 that the area to
be covered by reductions would stretch from the Atlantic to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union. But it took years of negotiations to
define the area more exactly.
   NATO wanted to include the Caucasus mountain region in the Soviet
Union. The Warsaw Pact wanted the U.S. air base at Incirlik, Turkey,
covered, as well.
   Turkey, meanwhile, stretches from Europe, the focus of the
negotiations, to Asia, which is not part of the mandate. The Turks
are nervous about three of their neighbors, Iran, Syria and Iraq,
and have tensions with Greece over Cyprus to the south. They would
like to keep as many men under arms as they can.
   The Turkish army invaded Cyprus in 1974 and still holds about
one-third of the island where Turkey set up a separate state that
only Ankara recognizes as legitimate. The Greek Cypriots, who are in
the majority on the island and have Greece's support, want the Turks
to withdraw.
   In Vienna, a deal was struck between Turkey and the Soviet Union.
It excluded a large area along Turkey's southern coast from the
negotiations _ thereby guaranteeing that Turkish forces in the area
would not be part of any reduction NATO and the Warsaw Pact work out.
   NATO went along with the deal, but Greece did not. Papandreou's
government wanted more of Turkish territory and southern ports
included in the arms control negotiations. Greece's goal is to
reduce Turkish forces facing Cyprus.
   The United States is not directly involved in the dispute.
``We've always felt the working out should be done by the Soviets
and the Turks,'' said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But he stressed that the Greeks, who initially accepted the
exclusion of an even larger area of Turkey from the negotiations,
were at odds with all of NATO.
   ``Everybody was taken aback when they changed their position,''
the official said.
   There is still some time to reach a settlement before Shultz's
scheduled departure for Vienna on Sunday. But the time is running
short.

<HEAD>Administration Steps Up Spending In War On Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war on drugs outranked cutting the deficit
as President Reagan proposed a 14 percent increase in the money
spent to beat back the tide of illegal narcotics in the United
States.
   ``I think this clearly gives the message that drug law
enforcement remains a priority of this government and this
administration,'' said John C. Lawn, administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. The DEA would add 164 agents and more
than 100 supporting workers if the proposed outlays are approved by
Congress.
   The total outlay requested Monday for fiscal 1990 starting Oct. 1
is more than $5 billion for all the agencies involved in prevention,
treatment and law enforcement. That reflects a $633 million increase
over the $4.4 billion to be spent in the current fiscal year.
   The DEA expects to increase arrests by more than 1,100 in 1990,
the government said in budget documents.
   Of the $5 billion proposed for spending on drug-related matters
in 1990, some $3.5 billion would go for law enforcement, $915
million for drug abuse prevention and $633 million for treatment
programs, according to an administration official who has seen the
documents summarizing the proposed drug-related budgets of all
federal agencies.
   The U.S. Customs Service, for which Reagan is seeking outlays of
$415 million, ``will greatly expand the number of intensive
examinations of high-risk containerized cargo shipments,'' the
budget documents said.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard would get an additional $47 million to
pay for two surveillance aircraft and two land-based balloons to
help spot drug smugglers, according to the documents.
   The government said the addition of 940 positions proposed for
the U.S. Attorneys' office is expected to increase the number of
drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3,600 cases. In addition, money has
been requested to fund 6,685 new prison and jail bed spaces as well
as leasing authority for 1,160 more.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions noted that ``the bureau's
national drug strategy is aligned purely to go after major drug
trafficking and money laundering organizations and heroin and
cocaine.''
   ``So with us, every incremental increase means that we can attack
that many more organizations,'' said Sessions, referring to a
proposed $12 million boost in FBI spending on drugs next year.
   When the FBI received $15 million more as a result of the 1986
drug bill, ``I indicated that I felt that we could attack anywhere
between 5 and 10 percent more that a current one-third to 40 percent
of approximately 450 major drug trafficking organizations,''
Sessions said at a Justice Department news conference.
   ``We feel that with the allocations we have received _ that is
the positions we've received of 128 agents and 159 support _ we'll
be able to make a significant increase and impact on major drug
trafficking organizations,'' Sessions said.
   Deputy Attorney General Harold G. Christensen, asked whether the
proposed increase were enough to convey the administration's
seriousness about the war on drugs, said, ``I think that this
program, given the constraints, does address that problem.''
   The newly created office of drug czar would get $3.5 million and
would be able to control up to $136 million in forfeitures of
property seized in drug-related cases.
   Within the law enforcement category, interdiction efforts would
receive the largest allocation: $1.22 billion.
   Also proposed to receive hefty amounts would be corrections
facilities including prisons and support for prisoners, $722.3
million; investigations, $716.4 million; prosecutions, $306.7
million and international programs, $238.3 million.
   The departments or agencies that would receive significant
amounts of money to battle illegal drugs under the budget proposal
are the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, $897.5
million; Coast Guard, $646.9 million; federal prisons, $614.4
million, with authorization for $664 million; the Drug Enforcement
Administration, $522 million; and the U.S. Customs Service, $415
million.
   Other agencies for which substantial amounts for drug work are
proposed are the Education Department, $344.7 million; Defense
Department, $323.8 million; U.S. Marshals Service, $148.4 million;
State Department, $112 million; U.S. attorneys, $112.2 million; and
the FBI, $87.4 million.

<HEAD>Transportation Budget: Boost FAA and Coast Guard, Cut Amtrak and
ICC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is asking Congress to
stop paying the freight for people who ride trains, go to small
towns in planes or get around in big-city buses.
   Congress hasn't bought the administration's transportation
package in the past and the proposed 1990 fiscal outlay of $27.3
billion, a $207 million cut, hasn't been discussed with
Transportation Secretary-designate Samuel Skinner. But outgoing
Secretary Jim Burnley said Monday his budget is ``by no means
irrelevant.''
   Burnley said it will form the basis for President-elect Bush's
spending proposals. ``I expect changes related to this versus
starting over,'' Burnley told a news conference.
   Burnley stressed the budget's proposed increases for the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard and for safety programs.
The budget also outlines cuts in federal subsidies to Amtrak, mass
transit systems, highways and little-used airline routes, and it
would scrap the century-old Interstate Commerce Commission.
   None of the budget cut proposals is new and all have failed to
pass the Democrat-controlled Congress.
   ``We have asked for reduction or elimination of budget authority
where we believe federal funding serves only parochial or local
interests,'' Burnley said. ``Those who use specialized government
services for commercial or recreational purposes ought to pay for
them.''
   Under the proposals, 76 percent of federal transportation costs
in 1990 would be paid for with fees or taxes paid by people who use
the subsidized air, rail or highway transportation systems, said
Burnley. When Reagan took office in 1981, 45 percent was covered by
such fees, according to the president's budget proposal.
   The proposed budget includes $6.6 billion for the Federal
Aviation Administration, a 16 percent increase over the fiscal 1989
budget.
   ``It is absolutely critical that Congress fully fund this
request,'' Burnley said, but he noted that Congress had rejected
similar proposals in the past to cut transportation subsidies in
favor of building up the FAA's air traffic control system.
   The administration proposes $3.05 billion in outlay for the Coast
Guard, a 28 percent increase. Coast Guard Vice Commandant Clyde T.
Lusk said the Coast Guard has been shortchanged in past budgets and
has had to cut back other operations in favor of a Congressional
mandate to battle illegal drugs traffic.
   One new proposal was for a new icebreaker after two of four used
by the Coast Guard were taken out of service because of increasing
maintenance costs.
   Highway subsidies would total $12.4 billion, compared with $13.4
billion projected for 1989.
   The administration says in the budget proposal that funding of
mass transit systems in a few large cities ``is not an appropriate
federal role'' and recommends that gasoline tax receipts be
redistributed to benefit all states and urban areas and that nearly
all discretionary grants which total more than $2 billion for 1989
be eliminated.
   The administration has wanted for several years to sell Amtrak,
but Congress has not agreed. The budget would dissolve the national
passenger rail system's $584 million appropriation. Burnley said in
some cases it would be cheaper for the government to buy travelers
airline tickets rather than subsidize long-distance Amtrak trips.
   Another proposal would cut $25 million in subsidies that go to
airlines flying routes that would otherwise not be served because
they are unprofitable. FAA administrator Allan McArtor said many of
the routes could be served by airports in other communities. Nearly
three-fourths of the subsidized routes average 10 or fewer
passengers per day, according to the administration.

   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's
major abortion decisions:
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court, in an opinion by Justice
Harry A. Blackmun, based its 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional
right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the
second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take
steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester. State
authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not
made absolute, however.
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Bolton, the court that same day struck
down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to
perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
   _July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a separate
5-4 vote, the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed
girls be given an absolute veto.
   _June 20, 1977. In Maher vs. Roe, the court, 6-3, ruled that
states have no legal obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic''
abortions.
   _Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ``fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek to
protect a fetus that has reached viability but that determination is
up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
   _July 2, 1979. In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that
states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an
alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the
minor seek a state judge's approval instead.
   _June 30, 1980. In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment
was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court ruled that the federal
government and individual states are under no legal obligation to
pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women on
welfare.
   _March 23, 1981. In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some young girls _
those still dependent on their parents and too ``immature'' to
decide such matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents before
performing a requested abortion.
   _June 15, 1983. In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City
vs. Ashcroft and Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, 6-3, said
states and local communities may not require all abortions for women
more than three months pregnant to be performed in a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down
Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it
invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
   The court also struck down requirements that doctors performing
third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use procedures least
risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb, and that two
doctors always be present for abortions performed in the third
trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring doctors to
make a record, which could become available to the public, of every
abortion they perform.
   _Dec. 14, 1987. In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The
effect was to invalidate an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The decision was announced two months before Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined the court and replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, who
had retired the previous June.

<HEAD>Majority Of Japanese Support Emperor As Symbol Of State: Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The demise of Emperor Hirohito has made the Japanese
people more aware and sympathetic toward the imperial system and
more than 80 percent support the monarch as the symbol of state, a
poll released today indicates.
   The survey, conducted shortly after Hirohito died from intestinal
cancer Saturday, showed 82 percent of the 1,876 people responding to
a random telephone interview supported the Japanese monarch as the
symbol of state.
   The figure was up 10 percentage points from a similar poll taken
three years ago, said the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper, which conducted the survey.
   Those who support that the emperor be given more power as a
``head of state'' rose 5 percentage points to total 9 percent, while
those who said they were indifferent to the monarch fell by 13
percentage points to 1.7 percent, the Yomiuri said.
   Regarding Akihito, Hirohito's successor to the Chrysanthemum
Throne, 70 percent of the respondents said they feel friendly toward
the new monarch, while 17 percent answered that they respected him.
Less than 1 percent of the people said they disliked the 55-year-old
Akihito.
   The poll also revealed that 50 percent of the people want the
imperial system to be more open, while 40 percent said there is no
need for change. The paper said 3,000 people were surveyed. It did
not give a margin for error.
   Under Japan's Constitution, the emperor, once considered a living
god, has no real political power and is regarded as ``a symbol of
the state and the unity of the people.'' His duties are largely
ceremonial and include meeting visiting dignitaries and fixing his
seal on bills passed by the government.

<TEXT>
   When President-elect Bush sits down later this
week with his Cabinet choices, the question is whether there will be
an empty seat at the table.
   A top adviser conceded Monday that the search for a Secretary of
Energy has proven more difficult than the transition team
anticipated.
   Craig Fuller, vice presidential chief of staff as well as
co-director of the transition, said it was taking longer to fill the
job because ``there are real technical difficulties and it's fraught
with a lot of political problems.''
   One of the political problems was the furor that knocked James
Schlesinger, an early choice for the post, out of contention.
   Fuller acknowledged that Gov. William Clements of Texas, among
others, strongly opposed the choice of Schlesinger, defense
secretary under President Ford and energy secretary under President
Carter. Schlesinger and Clements became bitter enemies when they
were the two top Pentagon officials.
   But Fuller insisted that Clements ``did not cause anybody to be
put on or be taken off the list by himself.''
   A new name circulating for the energy post was Harold Brown,
defense secretary under Carter.
   Fuller said Bush planned to meet with his Cabinet designees on
Thursday. The president-elect has named people to head 13 of the 14
Cabinet departments.
   One top adviser who turned down an offer of a White House job
after weeks of agonizing was pollster Robert M. Teeter, who informed
Bush that for personal and family considerations he preferred to
remain in Michigan.
   In a statement announcing his decision, Teeter said he had
planned to return home after the presidential campaign. Although the
offer of a White House post ``presented me with a very difficult
decision,'' Teeter said, ``I have decided to stand by my original
decision.''
   Fuller said Teeter, who recently sold his share in the polling
firm Market Opinion Research, would ``be available for
consultation'' on strategic planning, message and themes.
   Fuller, who had hoped to be named White House chief of staff,
also is returning to private business. He and Teeter have been
co-directors of the transition.
   The chief of staff job went to New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.
   Bush spoke to political supporters on Monday and urged them to
act as talent scouts to fill thousands of administration jobs.
   ``We are staffing a mandate,'' Bush told the Presidential
Personnel Advisory Committee. ``That mandate isn't a set of issues
and policies picked out of a hat or chosen at random since Nov. 8.
   ``It's a program we've run a winning national campaign on, a
program ratified in the light of intense national examination.''
   Bush said that ``talk about an issue-less, mandate-less election
is unfair to the intelligence of the American people.''
   ``Voters had strong opinions on the most important issues facing
this country in the years to come,'' he said. ``Where they agreed
more with my opponent on the issues he won their votes and where
they agreed more with me, I did.''
   He went on to point out he defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis by
nearly 7 million votes while carrying 40 states.
   He said he was ``looking for men and women _ Republicans and
Democrats alike _ who understand what we understand about Election
Day 1988.''
   Bush said he was ``particularly concerned that our search reach
regions, the men and women in America who are too often overlooked
in such efforts, Americans who _ let's be frank _ our party has
perhaps done too little to include in the past.''
   ``I want them too,'' he said. ``Black Americans, Hispanic
Americans, Asian Americans, disabled Americans. Not as tokens, but
as talent. Not for show, but for strength of character and for
skill.''

<HEAD>Reagan Proposes Modest Increase In Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan wants Congress set aside money
for the next wave of military weaponry and increase spending on Star
Wars in a defense budget with little chance of winning approval as
it is, say congressional leaders and defense experts.
   Overall, the two-year budget the Reagan administration released
Monday proposes an increase in defense spending by 2 percent above
the rate of inflation with $315.2 billion in budget authority for
1990 and $330.89 billion for 1991.
   Outlays _ the money to be spent during the 12 months of fiscal
1990 _ total $303 billion, including $9.2 billion for Energy
Department nuclear weapons and research programs. Outlays for fiscal
1991 amount to $314.4 billion.
   President-elect Bush is expected to amend the Reagan budget after
he takes office Jan. 20. The vice president has talked about a
budget request that matches inflation instead of providing real
growth.
   If Bush fails to change the budget, Congress will surely do so.
For the past four years, Congress has cut defense spending increases
to levels below the rate of inflation. The reaction from legislators
to the latest Reagan budget indicates that this time will be no
different.
   ``We know one thing about this defense budget, it isn't likely to
be approved the way it was submitted _ with an increase of 2 percent
over and above inflation,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, in a statement he issued Friday.
   ``What we need to know before Congress can go to work is what
George Bush wants in his defense budget. I am eager not only to read
the new president's lips on defense, but also his first defense
message to Congress,'' Aspin said.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said the budget is a ``good foundation,''
but reserved comment until further study.
   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are
$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million the
next year for research on a new Navy anti-satellite weapon and
elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental ballistic
missile, the Midgetman.
   The budget also calls for moving into production the new B-2
stealth bomber, the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile
and a rail-mobile version of the giant MX intercontinental ballistic
missile.
   ``What worries me is the hasty rush to the next generation of
military hardware,'' said Gordon Adams, director of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent analysis group.
   Congress is likely to question a budget that ``shaves the edges
of readiness and sustainability,'' Adams said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the administration made
some hard choices in either canceling or delaying two dozen
programs, but the budget will not weaken the nation's ability to
defend itself.
   ``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budget
is an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible course
that allows the United States to maintain its current force
structure and to acquire the weapons systems necessary to ensure our
national security,'' he said.
   The budget includes an increase in spending authority on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars, from $4.1
billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in 1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
   Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remains
unclear how quickly he will pursue the program.
   Star Wars is a ``softball for cutting,'' according to Adams, who
believes the inflated total will give Bush a chance to trim the
budget by about $2 billion.
   ``SDI is destined to be no more than a research program,'' said
John Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
   The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting down
unneeded military bases, reduce the Defense Department's civilian
workforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift more than two
dozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.
   Meanwhile, Reagan asked Congress for a small increase in funding
for veterans' medical care and pensions as he proposed outlays of
$29.9 billion for the new Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefits
and services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2
billion in fiscal 1989. The budget for the new department, which
assumes Cabinet status in March, calls for a $700 million increase.
   Among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays for
medical care, from $11.4 billion in 1989 to $11.5 billion in 1990.
Proposed outlays for total pensions are $4 billion, a $94 million
increase over the estimated total for fiscal 1989.

   With less than two weeks to go as one of the
longest-serving cabinet officers in American history, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz offered a rare glimpse of some of the things
that try his patience.
   It was a valedictory speech of sorts, delivered Monday night on
the occasion of a ``farewell event'' for Shultz sponsored by a
private group called the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs.
   Shultz touched only peripherally on foreign affairs in the
speech, focusing instead on the things that trouble him in
Washington, where he has lived off and on for 30 years, more than 11
in the cabinets of Presidents Reagan and Nixon.
   Some of Shultz's pet peeves:
   _People who say that America is in decline. ``These are false
prophets,'' Shultz said, contending that great powers that have
declined were imperial, absolutist or dominated by ``tradition-bound
classes.'' America, he said, is none of these because American
democracy holds the potential for resilience and rejuvenation.
   _Lie detector tests. Within an office or department or any
organization, Shultz said, putting trust in people will produce
trustworthy people _ the foremost of many reasons against the
widespread use of lie detector tests. ``Management through fear and
intimidation,'' he said, ``is not the way to promote honesty and
protect security.''
   _People who leak and lie and don't know when to give up. There's
nothing wrong with fighting before a decision is reached, he said,
but ``leaks and lies subvert honest discourse.'' Once decisions are
made, they should be carried out, like it or not.
   _Legislative sabotage. As Shultz described it, ``dialogue between
the branches cannot yield productive results when, no matter what
the apparent agreement, any faction, any staffer, any subcommittee,
any member of Congress can delay and impede even the will of the
majority.''
   _Bureaucratic encroachment. The Defense Department shouldn't tell
the State Department how to negotiate with the Soviets and ``the CIA
shouldn't find policy more fun than intelligence and objective
analysis _ because when it does, its intelligence and analytic
products have no credibility.''
   Shultz was too polite to name names, but his comments on the CIA
seemed aimed primarily at agency's late director, William Casey, who
was better known within the State Department establishment for his
advocacy of hard-line policies than for disinterested analysis
during his six years at the CIA.
   As for the Pentagon's perceived encroachment on State's turf,
there seems little doubt that Shultz had in mind former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, with whom Shultz had many a run-in.
   Concerning those lawmakers who Shultz says don't play fair, none
gave him a harder time than Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who
singlehandedly was able to hold up confirmation of State Department
appointees not to his liking for months at a time.
   Casey, Weinberger and Helms all are known for their conservative
views, but Shultz took on some liberals as well. He expressed
satisfaction that all the candidates who advocated protectionism
(mostly Democratic presidential aspirants) last year were soundly
defeated.
   And he also seemed to have liberals in mind when he attacked the
``declinists'' _ people who espouse an American withdrawal from the
world in order to regain economic or moral security.
   ``They play to the darker side, to the idea that America no
longer has anything to give the world,'' Shultz said.
   Despite the many disappointments and discouraging times Shultz
encountered, he seems satisfied that most change has been for the
better since he first came here.
   ``On the whole, the facts suggest optimism, especially optimism
about America's future,'' he said. ``I find that while some things
are worse, much is better.''

<TEXT>
   The Labor Department, responding to concerns by
health care workers about contracting AIDS and other blood-borne
diseases, is proposing new safety regulations requiring that all
blood and body fluids be handled as if they were infected.
   The proposal would affect the 5.3 million health care workers at
620,000 worksites who have frequent contact with potentially
infectious materials, the Labor Department said.
   ``Any standard should meet the critical needs by giving health
care workers the protection they want and have every right to
expect,'' Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said Monday in announcing
the proposal. ``It can literally be a lifesaver.''
   A department spokesman said a draft of the proposed regulations
would be published in the Federal Register in about two weeks.
Public comment will be accepted before the department decides on
final language.
   Current worker-safety laws in general require employers to
provide safety equipment and worker education when there are
potential hazards, but there are no specific regulations concerning
blood-borne diseases.
   The Occupational Health and Safety Administration, an agency
within the Labor Department, promised last year to draft the
regulations as part of a program to address concerns raised by
health care workers.
   McLaughlin said the proposed regulation would require the use of
safety equipment, worker training in handling infected blood and
body fluids and other specific precautions tailored to the specific
worksite.
   About 12,000 health care workers are infected with Hepatitis-B
each year, resulting in approximately 200 deaths annually, according
to government figures.
   The department had no specific figures on the number of health
care workers who contract AIDS because of their jobs.
   ``Where diseases like AIDS and Hepatitis-B are concerned, our
health care professionals are truly on the front line,'' McLaughlin
said. ``They're working to contain the problem. We must ensure that
they are not victims of it.''

<HEAD>Former Congressman, Coors Added To Witness List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The prosecution in the trial of Oliver North
says it has added to its witness list the names of a former
congressman whom North is accused of misleading over aid to the
Contras and beer magnate Joseph Coors, who says he gave the
Nicaraguan rebels $65,000 after meeting with North.
   Also on the revised list of prosecution witnesses against the
fired National Security Council aide is William Langton, president
of Southern Air Transport, a former CIA proprietary involved in both
the Contra resupply operation and the administration's secret arms
sales to Iran.
   The new names were on a list that actually contains fewer names,
40 rather than 87, reflecting a motion by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh to dismiss the two central charges of conspiracy and
theft against North.
   But at a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said
he wouldn't dismiss the charges until Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh explains the administration's refusal to declassify
information Gesell says must be released for North to get a fair
trial.
   An interagency intelligence group in the Reagan administration
has declined to declassify certain material in 300 prosecution
exhibits Walsh wants to present at trial, which forced Walsh to seek
dismissal of the two central charges. Twelve charges remain.
   Walsh said he is ``quite sure'' he can get an affidavit from
Thornburgh and Gesell said he hopes to receive it by Thursday.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined to comment on
whether Thornburgh would supply an affidavit, but a department
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he assumed the
attorney general probably will submit one.
   Former U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes, newly on the prosecution witness
list, in mid-1985 asked the NSC whether the staff was assisting the
Contras and requested all information pertaining to contact between
North and rebel leaders.
   North prepared then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane's
written response to the Democrat from Maryland, according to the two
counts in the indictment against North that charge him with
obstruction of Congress and making false statements.
   The response to Barnes said that ``none of us has solicited
funds, facilitated contacts for prospective potential donors, or
otherwise organized or coordinated the military or paramilitary
efforts of the resistance.''
   Barnes at the time was chairman of the House subcommittee on
western hemisphere affairs. In congressional testimony on the
Iran-Contra affair in 1987, North testified that ``I probably''
helped draft McFarlane's response to Barnes, but that ``I don't
recall specifically, there were a number of these'' responses to
congressional inquiries.
   The letter to Barnes accounted for one of the misdemeanor charges
of withholding information from Congress to which McFarlane pleaded
guilty last March in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Coors made the $65,000 contribution to the Contras after meeting
with North in 1985, less than three months before the letter to
Barnes from the NSC.
   Coors has said he met in June 1985 with then-CIA Director William
Casey, who referred Coors to North when Coors expressed an interest
in giving money to the Contras at a time when U.S. military aid to
them was banned by Congress.
   At a meeting in Casey's office in the old executive office
building next to the White House, the CIA director ``said Ollie
North is the guy to see,'' Coors said in 1987 in congressional
testimony on the Iran-Contra affair.
   Coors then walked over to see North, who said the Contras needed
a Maule aircraft and gave Coors the number of a Swiss bank account
where he could send his contribution.
   The account number was for Lake Resources Inc., part of the maze
of companies which Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, who also are
charged in the Iran-Contra case, used to funnel money to the Contras
from the administration's arms sales to Iran as well as from a
private fund-raising network.
   Coors arranged for $65,000 to be sent to the Lake Resources
account and then contacted North, saying he had made it clear he
wanted to give humanitarian, non-military aid to the Contras. Coors
said North ``indicated that this plane would fit into that pattern.''
   North denied in 1987 congressional testimony that he had
solicited the funds, saying instead that Coors ``offered the money,
and I told him where to send it.''

   U.S. commercial and private airplane accidents
killed 875 people in 1988, the lowest number this decade, with small
planes showing the most improvement, government figures indicate.
   The decrease, shown in preliminary figures from the National
Transportation Safety Board, came despite steady increases in the
number of hours and miles flown and a 30 percent increase in the
number of commercial flights over the last decade.
   The most dramatic reduction was in the number of people killed in
small, private plane accidents, down from 1,556 in 1978 to 782.
Flying hours for small planes have decreased about 20 percent since
then, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The next lowest number of fatalities came in 1986, when 1,034
people died in commercial and private airplane accidents. The NTSB
figures do not include military crashes.
   The 875 total fatalities in 1988 do not include the 270 people
killed when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland,
Dec. 21, because investigators have determined it was not an
accident but an act of sabotage.
   They do include two other crashes that received widespread
attention. A Delta Airlines Boeing 727 crashed during takeoff Aug.
31 near Dallas, killing 14 people, and a flight attendant was killed
when an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 lost the top of its fuselage
before landing near Maui, Hawaii, on April 28.
   The board said the accident rate for scheduled airline flights
was 0.389 per 100,000 departures, which means that roughly one out
of every 257,000 flights resulted in an accident.
   The rate for fatal accidents last year was one in 3.6 million
flights. The safety board tallied 7.2 million U.S. airline
departures in 1988.
   Major airliner accidents dropped to 29, from the 13-year high of
33 in 1987, the board said.
   Twenty-one people were killed in 20 commuter airline crashes last
year, down from 61 fatalities and 34 accidents in 1987. The accident
rate for commuter flights dropped by nearly half from 1987.
   In general aviation, which includes all small, private plane
flights, the number of accidents dropped to 2,332, from 2,471 in
1987. The board said it was a record low since it began collecting
statistics and the sixth consecutive annual decrease in the accident
rate.
   The total of 438 accidents with one or more fatality in 1988 was
three more than in 1987.
   The accident rate for small planes, which is reported as
accidents per 100,000 flight hours, decreased from 8.46 to 7.95. The
board estimates that small planes flew 29.35 million hours in 1988.
   Charter airline flights had only one accident, an incident in
which no one was killed, for their best record since 1981 when there
was also one accident. The accident rate of 0.346 per 100,000
departures last year was more than five times better than in 1987.
   Small aircraft operating nonscheduled services, known as air
taxis, had 97 accidents, two fewer than in 1987. Fifty seven people
died, seven fewer than a year earlier.
   The total killed in all types of airplane crashes was at a high
of 1,919 in 1978, the first year included in the current statistics.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.5 Billion in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans let their plastic do the purchasing
in November, running up $4.5 billion more in consumer debt than they
paid off as the holiday season approached, the government reports.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Monday that the November increase
followed a jump of $3.9 billion in October and a tiny $2 million
rise in September.
   November's increase represented an 8.2 percent rise in the annual
rate of credit growth, up from a 7.2 percent pace in October. The
November gain was pinned on brisk growth in the category of debt
that includes credit cards, while auto loans grew at about the same
rate as in October.
   ``It's just another piece of evidence that consumers started to
spend more for the holiday season,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington consulting firm. ``Consumers became more optimistic about
spending and about borrowing. For the moment, consumers are
relatively satisfied with the way the economy is going.''
   Evans noted that retail sales took off in the days after
Thanksgiving and that retailers reported strong sales continuing
into December.
   Consumer spending is watched as a barometer of economic health
because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.
   Revolving debt, the category that includes credit cards,
increased by $3.1 billion during November, a 20.3 percent annual
rate of growth. That followed a $2.6 billion increase during
October, or a 17.5 percent rate of growth.
   Auto loans rose by $1.4 billion during November, a 5.8 percent
annual rate of growth, after having risen by $1.3 billion during
October.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate decreased
by $49 million in November, a 0.4 percent drop in the annual rate,
after falling by $50 million a month earlier and by $158 million in
September.
   Loans for mobile homes increased by $73 million, or a 3.4 percent
annual rate of growth, in November, after rising by $30 million in
October.
   Overall, total consumer debt reached a seasonally adjusted $661.7
billion in November, up 8.7 percent from a year earlier.

<DATELINE>XAPURI, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the last years of his abbreviated life,
ecologist Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes may well have spent more time
in boardrooms and conference halls than in the Amazon rainforest he
died defending.
   As president of the Xapuri rubber tappers union and as a senior
environmental consultant for the World Bank and other institutions,
Mendes was often far from his beloved rubber groves in this western
Amazon town.
   To his friends, however, he confided a desire to return to the
virgin rainforest where he was born and raised.
   ``Chico was a great tapper, always five or six trees ahead of the
rest of us,'' said Miguel Teixeira Mendes, Francisco Mendes' cousin
and himself a rubber tapper. ``He loved the jungle and always talked
about coming back some day. But his political duties were too
great.''
   The virgin forest provides tappers with food and livelihood. The
giant rubber and Brazil nut trees only produce in the uncut
wilderness. The abundant deer, monkeys, birds and other game supply
meat.
   Most tappers live in wooden cabins set in clearings among stands
of trees more than 100 feet high.
   As parrots and monkeys screech from branches overhead, the tapper
daily works his ``trails'' of rubber trees. He collects the white
latex, or ``milk,'' in hollow Brazil nut pods about the size of a
grapefruit.
   Each tapper has two or three trails, each about 11 miles long
with 250 to 300 trees. He sells the raw latex to a middleman for
about 40 cents a pound and earns about $180 a month _ three times
Brazil's minimum wage. Harvesting of Brazil nuts also is lucrative,
though it only lasts two months.
   ``Rubber tapping is a man's work. A real man. I know. But a
tapper who works hard can thumb his nose at a lot of city folks,''
said Miguel Mendes, smiling.
   Tappers say the problem is the encroachment of cattle breeders
and land speculators, who cut down the forest and drive the tappers
out. Francisco Mendes died opposing them, one week after his 44th
birthday. He was killed by a shotgun blast on the night of Dec. 22.
   A rancher's son confessed to the murder.
   This week, rubber tapper Luiz de Oliveira surveyed the landscape
here of bare slopes and black, burned stumps.
   ``When I came here 35 years ago, this all was untouched forest,''
he said. ``Our fight is to save what we still have.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, in his final report on the
state of the economy, took credit today for ``an unparalleled period
of peacetime prosperity'' and said a tax increase could undermine
his legacy.
   Reagan's eighth and final economic report says that the
stagflation _ high inflation coupled with slow growth _ of the 1970s
has given way during his tenure to the longest economic expansion
since the 1960s and the lowest unemployment rate in 14 years.
   ``Today, it is as if the world were born anew,'' the president
said in a nine-page introduction to this year's report, prepared by
his Council of Economic Advisers.
   ``By reducing taxes and regulatory bureaucracy, we have unleashed
the creative genius of ordinary Americans and ushered in an
unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity,'' he said.
   Although the report credited the administration with favorable
economic developments, it sought to minimize the importance of the
U.S. budget and trade deficits and it placed the blame for the worst
year for bank and savings institution failures elsewhere.
   Also, Democrats point out that Reagan's military buildup had the
effect of running the economy on a wartime footing. His deficit
spending, they say, had the effect of creating prosperity now at the
expense of future generations, who will have to pay the bill.
   Beryl W. Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said
the new report was aimed at placing the Reagan record in the context
of post-World War II economic history. He said Reagan was the first
president since Harry Truman to leave office with both lower
unemployment and inflation rates than when he took office.
Unemployment dropped from 7.6 percent in 1981 to 5.5 percent in 1988
and consumer price inflation from 10.3 percent to 4.4 percent.
   After suffering a sharp recession in the beginning of Reagan's
term, the country in October finished its sixth year of economic
expansion, a record for peacetime, but short of the nearly nine-year
expansion during the Vietnam War.
   ``The length, strength and resilience of this expansion are ample
testimony to the wisdom of the policies that we have pursued,''
Reagan said.
   The president's report said the budget deficit, as a percentage
of the economy as measured by the gross national product, has shrunk
from 5.2 percent in 1985 to 3.2 percent in 1988. And, Reagan said
that attempting to shrink the deficit with tax increases would sap
economic growth.
   ``The large budget deficit that this nation faces is not a result
of too few taxes, but too much spending. ... All that is required to
reduce the deficit is to halt, or moderate, the increase in
expenditures,'' Reagan said.
   Sprinkel, in projections in the report, predicted continued GNP
growth of 3.2 percent this year and at least that each year through
1994. But, he said that was predicated on the assumption that taxes
would not rise and that the Federal Reserve Board, which has sought
growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent as a means of holding inflation
in check, would keep interest rates low enough to foster growth.
   The report said monetary policy so far has produced solid
results, but it criticized the central bank for apparently basing
its policy on short-term economic developments rather on long-term
goals for the growth of the money supply.
   The report also said, in effect, that the U.S. trade deficit,
which hit a record $170 billion in 1987, was caused by the strength
of the American economy. Low inflation and high growth encouraged
foreign investors to drive up the value of the dollar. That in turn
made foreign goods cheaper in the United States and American goods
more expensive overseas.
   It said the U.S. status as a net debtor has been greatly
exaggerated in new accounts, partly because most measures
underestimate the value of U.S. holdings abroad. Foreigners hold
only about 3.1 percent of U.S. assets, it said.
   Banks and S&amp;L failures, which in 1988 reached post-Depression
records of 221 and 217, respectively, stem from improper incentives
in the regulatory system, the report said. It recommended reducing
federal deposit insurance from its current level of $100,000 per
account to encourage depositors and thus bank and S&amp;L owners to be
more cautious.
   It said if reforms recommended in 1984 by a panel chaired by Vice
President George Bush had been adopted, current bank and S&amp;L
problems ``would probably be much more manageable.''
   Congress, ignoring one the recommendations, lowered the amount of
investment money, or capital, S&amp;L owners have to place behind public
deposits, it said.

<HEAD>Corps of Engineers Seeks Starts on 10 New Water Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army Corps of Engineers is seeking $85.5
million to start 10 new water projects from California to New York,
undaunted by a rare rebuff from Congress last year during a budget
squeeze.
   The Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation, meanwhile, plans
to devote 60 percent of its proposed $655 million in construction
money to just three projects in Arizona, Utah and California.
   For the third straight year, the reclamation bureau isn't
planning any new project starts, in line with its transition from
building dams and canals to becoming a water management agency.
   Last year, Congress refused to give money to the corps for the
six new starts it proposed. In the Reagan administration's proposed
budget for fiscal 1990, sent to Congress on Monday, those six were
expanded to 10 projects.
   New starts on water projects have been declining because of tight
budgets and a 1986 law that requires affected communities to put up
their share of funds in the beginning.
   Overall, spending by the corps would total $3.2 billion during
the 12 months starting next Oct. 1, down slightly from the current
$3.26 billion.
   Its construction spending would total $1.22 billion, up 8.9
percent from $1.12 billion.
   The bureau planned to spend $946 million, down 14 percent from
$1.1 billion this year. Its construction spending would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year, with the
majority of funds going toward the Central Arizona Project, the
Central Utah Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   Several projects were slated for only minimal spending, said
Interior Undersecretary Earl Geljde, because ``we didn't have enough
money to put them on an efficient construction schedule (and) we're
better off to not start them.''
   The bureau requested $3.7 million to buy equipment for the
Animas-La Plata project in Colorado and New Mexico and $8.75 million
to wind up construction at the Garrison Diversion Unit in North
Dakota, but neither project will get a major push.
   Following are the 10 new Army Corps of Engineer projects. Dollar
figures are given in budget authority, which usually approximates
appropriations in the case of water projects. Outlay figures were
available for spending totals but not for specific projects listed.

<HEAD>Huge Budget Deficits a Reagan Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president who rode to the White House on an
anti-Washington sentiment, promising to balance the books while
shaking things up, is leaving office after the largest credit binge
in the nation's history.
   The final budget submitted Monday by President Reagan symbolizes
what he admits is one of his biggest disappointments and possibly
the biggest failure of his eight years: the legacy of red ink he
leaves behind.
   The federal budget Reagan sent to Congress, his last as
president, was like all the others that bore his name. It was far
out of balance under even the rosiest of economic forecasts.
   Reagan said in delivering it that by getting the deficit under
$100 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, his budget would show that
``gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without raising
taxes.''
   At his inaugural eight years ago, Reagan declared: ``You and I,
as individuals, can, by borrowing live beyond our means, but for
only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that
collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by the same limitation?''
   In one of his farewell addresses last month, Reagan spoke of the
deficits with regret. ``One of my great disappointments as I leave
office is that the federal budget itself is not yet balanced,''
Reagan said.
   He leaves to his successor George Bush that legacy of deficits,
one that together with his no-tax increase pledge severely limits
the new president's options.
   As Democrats frequently point out, the federal debt under Reagan
grew more than under all the presidents before him. From under $1
trillion when he took office in 1981, the national debt has risen to
more than $2.6 trillion.
   Many point to the 25 percent tax cut Reagan fought for and won
early in his first term, reducing the government's revenue and
increasing pressure to borrow.
   Reagan's first budget director, David Stockman, left office a
vocal critic of the administration's tax and budget policies. In his
book ``The Triumph of Politics,'' Stockman called the result ``the
Reagan era's fabulous free lunch'' and spoke of frustration in
trying to get the president to confront the deficit problem.
   The administration's version, however, is that the tax cuts
stimulated the economy and generated growth _ and that Congress is
to blame for failing to carry out all the cuts in spending proposed
by Reagan. In his budget, Reagan also blamed the 1981-1982 recession
for lowering government revenues.
   In his farewell speech, Reagan blamed a new ``iron triangle,''
giving a new definition to a term often used in Washington to
represent the triad of special interests, Congress, and the
bureaucracy that supports various programs. Reagan's version removed
the bureaucracy _ for which as president he was responsible _ and
replaced it with the press, for what he said was uncritical
reporting of the special interests' views.
   But none of his cuts would have been enough to balance the budget
_ Reagan has never proposed a balanced budget.
   Among the projections of his 1990 budget document are a balanced
budget by the year 1993, though many doubt it possible. Even so,
that's 10 years later than candidate Reagan was saying in 1980.
   The target began slipping even before he was sworn in. In his
first budget he predicted a surplus by 1984. Instead of a surplus,
the government suffered a deficit of $185.3 billion that year.
   It got worse, peaking at $221 billion worth of red ink in fiscal
1986. It's been lower since, but the deficit has not been on a
downward trend; it grew in 1988 over 1987 and is estimated to do so
at the end of fiscal 1989, too.
   While he succeeded in trimming many domestic programs, Reagan
ruled out targeting the major middle-class government benefit
programs, including Social Security.
   With the increase in debt has come the increased burden of
interest payments. In the new budget, 15 cents of every dollar in
government spending will go to pay interest on the debt.
   Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a
labor-backed think-tank, called Reagan's final budget ``sad
testament to eight years of borrowing from our children.''
   But Stephen Hess, government analyst at the Brookings
Institution, said the budget deficits may not be a harmful legacy.
``I'm prepared to say it may not be so big a deal,'' Hess said.
``The man left us at peace, literally, and employed, and with low
inflation. And it's going to take some time to figure out how big a
price we paid for that, but that is pretty exceptional.''

   Residents of this Panhandle resort are
charging to rescue from developers a 30-foot-tall,
steel-and-concrete Green Knight outside a lounge and liquor store of
the same name.
   The armor-clad statue has been a tourist attraction along U.S. 98
for more than 20 years. Community supporters raised money to repair
the sentinel after a 1985 hurricane took off an arm.
   Now, about 200 fans of the knight have signed a petition urging
City Hall to save the statue from developers who want to take it
down to make way for a shopping center.
   The knight qualifies as roadside architecture, a part of
Americana that is rapidly disappearing, said city Librarian Dooney
Tickner, who is leading the petition drive.
   ``If they don't keep him there, I've proposed that they move him
to a new park ... to serve as a focal point for the children's
playground,'' Tickner said.
   The green warrior has received at least a temporary reprieve
because of a delay in plans for the shopping center, said W.G. Ivey,
owner-manager of the lounge and package store. Ms. Ivey said she has
been surprised by the support because some people had criticized the
statue recently for detracting from the city's appearance.
   ``Now we get people in here all the time who aren't even
interested in buying anything,'' she said. ``They just want to ask
us not to tear it down, and sign a petition if we have one. It's
strange how things change.''

   This southeastern Virginia community averages
800 pieces of mail a day, but lately Joseph E. Clark has been
getting more than his share.
   Clark has received more than 3,000 pieces of mail recently from
Exxon Travel Club Inc. in Houston, said postmaster Emmett Raney. A
total of 1,874 pink-and-white envelopes arrived for Clark in the
first batch, followed by 995 a few days later and 300 more soon
after.
   Last week, 400 more arrived, including 50 on Friday, Raney said.
   Clark took time off from deer hunting recently to read one of the
letters and told Raney to throw away the rest, the postmaster said.
   A note on the mailbag advised to contact Bill Cooper of R.L. Polk

   Cooper, who said he runs a shop mailing thousands of pieces of

   ``It's obvious that we had a computer hang-up,'' Cooper said.

   A Wisconsin legislator proud of the state's
dairy heritage is urging a national fast-food chain to promote
specials on cheeseburgers as well as hamburgers.
   Democratic Rep. Mary Hubler wrote Burger King officials Monday
that she was concerned that the chain was offering reduced prices
only on Whoppers without cheese and regular hamburgers. She said it
was the second straight year the chain had excluded cheeseburgers
from its specials.
   ``In the Dairy State, Burger King should be promoting their
sandwiches with cheese and taking an active role in the overall
promotion of the dairy industry,'' Ms. Hubler said.
   A Burger King official said his company wasn't discriminating
against cheese.
   ``We try to rotate the specials, and a number of them have
involved Whoppers and cheeseburgers,'' said Tim D. Thorpe, marketing
manager in Burger King's regional office in Minneapolis.
   ``Our franchises in Wisconsin are well aware that they are in the
dairy state,'' Thorpe said.

   Poor old Amtrak. Even in Ronald Reagan's last
shot, his proposed budget for fiscal 1990, the president is trying
to kill off the rail passenger service as a waste of taxpayers'
money.
   Reagan complains that the government pays $30 to Amtrak every
time a passenger gets on a train to anywhere. Without that federal
subsidy of about $600 million a year, Amtrak officials say, the
entire rail network would have to be scrapped. The Reagan
administration favors a regional system instead.
   If Reagan's budget plan succeeds this time, Amtrak's demise would
be one of many ways that Americans would get less from the
government, or pay more for what they get.
   ``On many routes it would be cheaper for the federal government
to buy bus or plane tickets for Amtrak passengers rather than
subsidize train travel,'' says the administration, urging Congress
to just say no to Amtrak.
   ``Amtrak is not economically viable,'' the budget message said
Monday. ``About 85 percent of its routes recover less than 57 cents
on the dollar.''
   Proposed saving: $515 million a year.
   Another cost-cutting measure would require taxpayers to pay 50
cents or $1 to call what currently is the government's toll-free
number for help with their income tax returns.
   The charge would be called ``a user fee.''
   Under Reagan's budget plan for next year, the government would
charge more or provide less to boat owners, veterans with slightly
disabling war injuries, commuters, air travelers, federal retirees,
doctors, people who lose their jobs to foreign competition and
middle-class youngsters who eat subsidized lunches at school.
   Reagan noted that even students at ``high tuition private schools
can get meal subsidies.'' He proposed eliminating all 40-cent
lunches for children from families well above the poverty line. The
price of a lunch would rise about 26 cents, unless state or local
school districts made up the difference.
   The president wants to save $1.2 billion over the next five years
by ending ``trade adjustment assistance,'' which provides weekly
cash benefits, training, job search aid and relocation allowances to
those who lose their jobs because of imports.
   ``It is inequitable for the federal government to provide a
special program to benefit one group of unemployed workers or
uncompetitive firms,'' the budget message says.
   Reagan also would cut down on the 8,000 map makers working in
more than 20 federal departments and agencies at a cost of more than
$1 billion a year. The administration will see whether it's cheaper
to contract some of the work out.
   For the homeless, Reagan proposes a program under which the
government would buy enough food to supply food kitchens and food
banks with 256 million meals.
   He called for ``an aggressive prison building program'' to ease
overcrowding, but would eliminate subsidies that help operate
subways and buses for commuters and a program that assures air
service for many small communities.
   Military veterans with service-connected injuries that give them
disability ratings of 20 percent or less would have to look to
private health insurance for their care in veterans' hospitals,
under Reagan's plan. The government now pays for that care.
   Doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the
elderly under Medicare and the poor under Medicaid. Getting
especially less would be radiologists, anesthesiologists and
surgeons.
   Homebuyers would see a nearly fourfold increase _ to 3.8 percent
_ in the current 1 percent fee for VA mortgage loan guarantees.

<HEAD>Reagan Proposes $3 Billion For Cleanup, Modernization of Atomic Arms
Complex</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is proposing a
half-billion dollar increase in spending next year to begin cleaning
up and modernizing the nation's nuclear bomb factories, lately
crippled by environmental and safety problems.
   The proposal, contained in the administration's proposed fiscal
1990 budget for the Department of Energy, was called a first step
toward revitalizing the government's nuclear weapons production
complex, which is administered by the department.
   ``The process is in place ... to address this problem in the long
term,'' said Joseph F. Salgado, the deputy energy secretary. He said
priorities were being developed for a cleanup and modernization
effort that could last 50 years or more.
   Cleanup work is expected to cost at least $81 billion over the
next 20 years.
   The department, in the budget proposals unveiled Monday, said it
would seek $18 billion over the next five years to build new atomic
arms plants and to improve the existing weapons complex of 17 major
factories and laboratories in 12 states.
   For the 1990 budget year, which begins next Oct. 1, President
Reagan asked Congress to approve spending of $3 billion for
modernization, environmental and safety programs at the weapons
plants. That is $478 million more than is being spent on such
programs in the current fiscal year.
   The proposal quickly drew criticism from Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
who likened the environmental threat posed by pollution from the
nuclear production facilities _ including a uranium processing plant
at Fernald, Ohio _ to a time bomb.
   The amount proposed by Reagan for cleaning up the plants in 1990
is ``just a token of what is needed,'' Glenn said at a Capitol Hill
news conference. ``The reality is that these ... sites are an
environmental time bomb. It's still ticking.''
   Glenn said he hoped the incoming Bush administration would ask
Congress for much more money _ as much as $4 billion a year for
cleanup and modernization.
   Energy Department officials gave no comprehensive breakdown of
proposed spending on individual nuclear weapons manufacturing
plants, although they said the budget proposal included a request
for $55 million to clean up the Fernald plant. That compares with
$50 million expected to be spent in the current budget year.
   Also, the department asked for $54 million for cleanup at the
Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., an increase of $26
million from this year; and $56 million for the Savannah River plant
near Aiken, S.C., up from $19 million.
   The department also requested $303 million to begin developing
two new nuclear weapons facilities to replace three 35-year-old
reactors at Savannah River, which have been shut down since last
April for safety and technical reasons. The Savannah River facility
is the nation's only source of tritium, a highly perishable gas used
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   The department has estimated the cost of building the two new
reactors at $6.8 billion. Both would be expected to be in operation
by the turn of the century.
   Among other spending proposals in the overall $15 billion energy
budget are:
   _$145 million for research on energy conservation, down from $156
million in the current budget year.
   _$383 million for fossil energy research and development,
including projects aimed at finding ways of getting more crude oil
from existing wells, and to expand the use of coal. That is down
from $446 million in the current budget for such projects.
   _$322 million on nuclear energy research, a decline from $357
million in the current budget year.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Budget Will Test Bush's Ability To Keep Promises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's parting budget presents
George Bush with an early test of political leadership as he seeks
to fulfill campaign pledges of budget austerity and government
humanity without raising taxes.
   Leaders of the Democratic-led Congress say they will give Bush
the benefit of the doubt on his ``flexible freeze'' approach to
budgeting _ where increases in spending above the rate of inflation
must be offset by accompanying decreases in other areas.
   But at the same time the Democrats are pointing out the distance
between Reagan's $1.15 trillion spending blueprint and Bush's
campaign promises.
   Bush's aides are letting it be known that he will revise Reagan's
work within weeks.
   Reagan's farewell budget, calling anew for expanded military
spending and contracted social programs, ``provides a formula for a
meaner, harsher America,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee.
   And House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the Reagan budget
``obviously does not respond to the promises made by President-elect
Bush during the campaign. ... Obviously, this is not a kinder,
gentler budget.''
   Those ``kinder, gentler'' programs promised by Bush include large
proposed increases for education, for the Head Start program, for
expanded Medicaid payments to low-income pregnant women and their
babies, and for environmental cleanup.
   Vice presidential chief of staff Craig Fuller was asked Monday at
a news briefing whether Bush, as president, would continue to
support such programs, and wouldn't they cost the government a lot
of money it didn't have?
   ``Yes and maybe,'' Fuller responded.
   The Bush camp was trying to keep above _ or at least out of _ the
fray as Reagan's final spending plan went to the Hill, where it
seemed guaranteed to be ignored as congressional budget writers
await the Bush amendments.
   The vice president is expected to outline his modifications
within a few weeks after his inauguration on Jan. 20, most likely in
an address to a joint session of Congress. However, aides say the
exact format of his budget submission has not yet been decided.
   It's still ``too early to say'' how much of the Reagan budget
Bush will keep and how much he'll chuck, said Nicholas Brady, who is
Treasury secretary now and will occupy the same post in the Bush
administration.
   ``It is certainly possible that much of the current budget will
remain on the table,'' Brady suggested. However, Fuller observed,
``there are surely going to be variances.''
   During Bush's campaign, he often seemed to be having it both ways
politically: seeking to bask in Reagan's popularity as loyal vice
president for the past 7{ years while distancing himself from some
of the more unpopular Reagan deeds and policies.
   Now, however, with the final Reagan budget in and the government
about to change hands, Bush will no longer have the luxury of being
able to seek refuge in Reagan's shadow.
   Regardless of who penned the initial budget proposal, once the
inauguration has passed, the budget that Congress sets to work on
will be Bush's.
   Although Reagan's budget appears to smooth the way for some of
Bush's modifications by not seeking such drastic cuts in social
programs as previous budgets, in many cases it appears at odds with
Bush's campaign statements.
   For instance, Bush has proposed an increase in Medicaid to help
cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies.
Reagan, in the new budget, has proposed more than $1 billion in
Medicaid reductions.
   Reagan's budget again calls for austerity in social spending and
would eliminate 82 programs. At the same time, the plan would
protect his military buildup by advocating a 2 percent increase in
Pentagon spending authority above inflation.
   Congressional budget writers have said they expect military
spending to be among the areas Bush looks at most closely as he
seeks to find offsetting reductions to make his ``flexible freeze''
work.

<HEAD>Critics Say Reagan Health Cuts Would Deprive Needy And Raise State
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's critics say his proposed
cuts in Medicaid and Medicare would curtail health care for the 56
million elderly, disabled and poor Americans and could drive up
state taxes.
   Public policy analysts, members of Congress and state officials
all rejected Reagan's claim that the cuts will simply force states,
hospitals and physicians paid under the programs to be more
efficient.
   The giant federal health-care programs have been the fastest
growing segments of the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the largest federal agency, spending 37 percent of the
government's entire budget.
   Reagan's spending proposal for fiscal 1990 would trim Medicaid
growth chiefly by cutting grants to states by 3 percent and reducing
payments to hospitals and physicians serving Medicare patients.
   Even with the proposed reductions totaling $1.4 billion, the
Medicaid budget would grow by 5 percent to $36 billion. The Medicare
cuts, $3.5 billion, would reduce that program's growth rate to 10
percent with $94.6 billion in projected spending.
   The federal government shares the cost of the Medicaid program
with the states, which administer the program and retain certain
eligibility options.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House health
subcommittee, said the Medicaid cuts would ``put the states in a
financially untenable situation'' and wipe out President-elect
George Bush's promise to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income
children.
   States ``will be unable to come up with the replacement dollars
to continue coverage to the 12 million children now eligible for
Medicaid, much less to expand coverage to the millions of low-income
families that still have no coverage at all,'' Waxman said.
   Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit group that researches policy issues
affecting the low-income, noted that even HHS Secretary Otis Bowen
objected to the cuts in grants to the states when they were proposed
by the Office of Management and Budget. In a letter to OMB last
month obtained by Greenstein, Bowen said the cuts _ 3 percent in
fiscal 1990, 4 percent in 1991 and 4.5 percent in 1992 _ were
``unjustified and unsupportable.''
   Greenstein said the cuts ``in substantial part will be passed
along in benefit reductions.''
   ``Unless states are have or are willing to come up with more
money, which many aren't, their only options are to restrict
eligibility, reduce medical services or reduce fees paid to
doctors,'' he said.
   Further reductions in payments to physicians, he said, would make
it harder for Medicaid recipients to find a doctor willing to treat
them.
   For New York state, the cuts will not affect the poor, ``but it
will affect everyone else in the state,'' said Brad Johnson,
director of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's Washington office.
   ``We will have to raise revenues or divert resources from other
programs,'' he said.
   The state would see its federal Medicaid payments drop by $180
million in fiscal 1990, ``and I don't think we can find that much in
administrative savings,'' he said.
   Martin Corry, director of federal affairs for the American
Association of Retired People, said he was more alarmed over the
proposed Medicaid cuts than those for Medicare because of the
``inordinate pressures it puts on states.''
   The effect of the Medicare cuts, however, would depend on how
Congress implemented them, assuming they could even get passed.
   ``On the surface, it would appear that they haven't done much to
directly affect (Medicare) beneficiaries, but in reality the
potential for cost-shifting'' could change that balance, he said.
   If physicians continue to charge the same as they have been while
Medicare reimbursement drops, Medicare recipients would be forced to
make up the difference out of their own pockets, he said.
   ``Everyone expects some reduction in Medicare,'' which has grown
about 12 percent annually since 1980, ``but the problem here is the
magnitude,'' Corry said.

   President Reagan's proposed budget provides
generous support for science and space research next year, with a
boost in total outlays to $14.9 billion and emphasis on developing a
permanently manned space station.
   In the budget plan for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, space
and science spending would rise by $2.4 billion. The space station
planned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would
get $2.1 billion and an unusual advance commitment for billions more
over a three-year period.
   The final budget of the Reagan administration, sent to Congress
on Monday, also supports the $4.4 billion superconducting
supercollider proposed by the Department of Energy, and would
bolster basic research programs of the National Science Foundation
by $2 billion.
   The suggested outlay for the space station is more than double
the current fiscal year's spending ceiling of $900 million.
   The space station, a huge orbiting craft designed to house
astronauts permanently in space, is America's major effort to
reclaim undisputed leadership in space research.
   Spending authority of $250 million was proposed for the
supercollider, a massive project that is to be built in Texas for
the study of sub-atomic particles. The funds would cover early
expenses for the start of construction.
   Money for the space station helps boost the suggested outlays for
NASA by $1.8 billion. In addition to the station, the increase would
finance nine space shuttle flights, compared with five during fiscal
1989.
   It also would help pay for improvements in the current shuttle
fleet and allow continued work on a replacement for the destroyed
space shuttle Challenger.
   Under the Reagan plan, laws would be passed to limit space
station construction costs to $13 billion in 1984 dollars. Allowing
for inflation, that would limit the station project to $16 billion.
   However, this does not include operating costs, which are
estimated to about equal construction spending.
   Two unusual provisions cover the NASA proposal.
   One provides for a three-year advance of $8.5 billion in spending
authority ``to maintain the current schedule of development
activities leading to an operating capability in the mid-1990s'' for
the space station.
   The other, imposed by requirements of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law, would give President-elect Bush the opportunity
effectively to block space station development by ordering funds
withheld.
   If Bush chooses to, he can notify Congress that he does not wish
to spend $515 million appropriated last year for the station, a
powerful signal that he does not approve of a further
much-accelerated effort. If he takes no action the appropriated
money will be spent beginning May 15.
   The proposed 1990 funds would also pay for:
   _ Improvements in the shuttle fleet to allow missions of up to 30
days.
   _ Launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Galileo space probe
to Jupiter and collection of data from Voyager II's rendezvous with
the planet Neptune.
   _ Start of development of a flight past an asteroid and a comet.
   _ Upgrading research on sub-atomic particles at the Fermi
National Laboratory and the Stanford (Calif.) Linear Accelerator
Center.
   _ National Science Foundation contributions to a research program
aimed at understanding the Earth-warming ``greenhouse effect'' and
other changes in the Earth's climate and weather. Funds for studies
of climatic changes also would be increased from $9 million to $20
million in the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration's proposed budget.

   Survivors of the Boeing 737 crash
praised the skill and cool nerves of the pilot for guiding the
crippled aircraft over a village as he attempted an emergency
airport landing.
   ``Considering the trouble he was in, he must have nursed that
plane to get so close (to the airport). He must have done a
brilliant job. I pray for him and hope he is OK,'' said Gareth
Jones, 38, who suffered chest injuries.
   Pilot Kevin Hunt, 43, managed to keep the 12-week-old British
Midland Airways jet, with one engine on fire and the second
apparently failing, skimming over rooftops as he made for East
Midlands Airport in central England.
   The Belfast-bound plane plowed into a highway embankment a
half-mile short of the runway on Sunday, killing 44 people and
injuring the 82 others on board.
   David Thomas, a surgeon at Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, one of the
hospitals handling the casualties, said: ``It is incredible to have
this number of survivors from a major accident. That has got to be
down to the skill of the pilot.''
   A radio ham operator was quoted today as saying the crew was so
calm before the crash it was hard to imagine anything was wrong.
   ``Whoever was in cockpit contact with the East Midlands (Airport)
controller sounded so calm it was difficult to image anything was
amiss,'' Richard Whittington was quoted as saying in The Times of
London.
   ``There was no panic or fear detectable in his voice. Instead, he
was precise, as though he was receiving everyday instructions. Only
when I heard the air traffic controller, who certainly did not sound
as calm, did I realize something must be terribly wrong.''
   Hunt, a 22-year veteran with the airline, was seriously injured
with spine and leg fractures. He was trapped for 2{ hours before
rescuers managed to free him from the smashed cockpit.
   Skillfully, Hunt kept the plane from plowing into the
2,000-resident village of Kegworth.
   Village resident Bill Tidy said: ``The pilot hung on until the
last minute. What a man.'' Another resident, Andrew Pendleton, said:
``Suddenly the pilot seemed to pull the nose up and the plane just
glided past.''
   Transport Minister Paul Channon, who visited the crash site
Monday, also praised firefighers who arrived within minutes,
spraying foam over the plane to prevent a blaze. He said their speed
saved many lives.
   Survivor Mary McHugh, 23, said: ``We were only on the ground for
three of four minutes before people started pulling us off. But
first there was the foam. It just hit us. Large amounts of it. I
thought, wow, it was great. It meant we weren't going to get
burned.''
   Jones said he held the hand of a young woman next to him during
the rapid descent. ``When the first engine went she started crying
and held my hand,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``I tried to joke about how these things could fly on one engine
and glide down. Then the second engine went and she gripped my hand
and I said there was no way we were not getting out of that plane
together. I knew if I showed I had any fear she would have been
worse.''
   Firefighter Eric Moss, who worked more than six hours helping
free survivors and getting out the dead, told a grimmer story.
   ``The conditions inside were very difficult. Very tight and very
hot. We were taking away layer upon layer of wreckage inside the
fuselage ... There were layers of bodies.''

   Unions representing federal employees are
urging President-elect Bush and Congress to reject President
Reagan's budget recommendation of a 2 percent pay raise for
government workers.
   Advocates for federal retirees also attacked the spending plan
Monday, saying it was unfair for Reagan to recommend that the
retirees be denied a cost-of-living adjustment next year while
awarding such an increase to Social Security recipients.
   Both groups said the principal ammunition in their fight against
the Reagan budget proposals will be the 50 percent raise the
president recommended for members of Congress, federal judges and
other government executives. The unions also complained that Reagan
recommeded a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel but only 2
percent for civilian government workers.
   ``President Reagan is leaving office as he entered _ bashing the
federal work force,'' John N. Sturdivant, president of the American
Federation of Government Employees, said Monday after the president
released his farewell budget.
   ``AFGE will be counting on President-elect Bush to work with us
in reforming the present civil service pay system, which is totally
inadequate and outdated,'' said Sturdivant, whose union is the
largest representing federal workers.
   Sturdivant and Robert M. Tobias, president of the National
Treasury Employees Union, said federal pay scales lag about 26
percent behind those for comparable private sector jobs.
   ``Federal employees will not settle for paltry 2 percent raises
while top government officials get increases of up to 50 percent,''
said Tobias.
   He expressed hope that Congress, which is expected to delay any
action on the budget until Bush makes his own recommendations for
fiscal 1990 spending, would be more sympathetic to federal workers _
especially at a time when the lawmakers stand to see their annual
pay rise from $89,500 to $135,000.
   ``We're confident that Congress will act in the best interest of
the nation and provide a substantial pay raise for the rank-and-file
and not just a substantial pay raise for themselves,'' Tobias said.
   Reagan said the government would save $1.4 billion by freezing
the cost-of-living adjustments for federal retirees next year. The
president also suggested future COLAs for that system be capped at
one percentage point below inflation.
   But Reagan requested no such changes to Social Security.
   ``Here we go again,'' said Judith Park, legislative director for
the National Association of Retired Federal Employees. ``Our advice
to Congress would be to remember that inflation doesn't discriminate
and neither should inflation protection.''
   The approximately 3.6 million retirees received a 4.2 percent
cost-of-living adjustment in January 1988.
   The raises for Congress, federal judges, Cabinet members and
other federal executives were suggested by a commission that meets
in presidential election years to review federal salaries.
   Reagan last week said he endorsed the proposal, and the budget he
submitted to Congress on Monday contained $380 million to pay for
the raises.
   If approved, those raises would also increase the pensions paid
to Reagan after he leaves office and to other former presidents,
whose pensions are tied to the salaries given Cabinet members. The
raises will take effect unless both chambers of Congress vote to
reject them, which is not expected.
   Chief among the complaints of the federal workers' unions was
that their members' annual raises have lagged behind inflation.
   Most federal workers received a 4.1 percent pay increase
effective Jan. 1. In January 1988 they got a 2 percent raise and in
January 1987 a 3 percent pay boost. Their last raise prior to that
was a 3.5 percent raise in 1985.
   Annual inflation for 1987 and 1988 was 4.4 percent, up from 1.1
percent in 1986 and 3.8 percent in 1985, according to government
figures.

   In a ceremony where gowns in ``Reagan red'' were
a favorite among the glittering guests, the fashion industry saluted
first lady Nancy Reagan for her style and contribution to American
design.
   Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual
awards ceremony Monday night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   The evening represented her farewell as first lady to the fashion
industry. ``As one chapter in my life closes, and another chapter
begins, I want to tell you that I'll miss you,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has been criticized for borrowing much of her
high-priced White House wardrobe, said, ``There are many pluses and
minuses to being in the White House.
   ``One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of
the most important in our country and I think the American fashion
designers are the best,'' said Mrs. Reagan, who was wearing a
brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of
that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so.''
   In presenting the award to Mrs. Reagan, ABC-TV's Barbara Walters
said the first lady and the president, during his eight years in
office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ... that
intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.
Presence. A sense of beauty.''
   Critics of the first lady's borrowing habits argue the practice
amounted to providing free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be
``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
   Her comment caused the 500 guests to applaud vigorously.
   Also recognized at the ceremony was Geoffrey Beene, who was
saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
   Performer Liza Minnelli, one of many women attending the ceremony
who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she
called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
   Her floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit was designed by
Mizrahi.
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown with a feathered
bodice designed by Givenchy, presented a Lifetime Achievement Award
to photographer Richard Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to
American fashion and his photographic reportage of historical
events.''
   Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design. Nina Hyde,
fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her
reporting on American fashion.
   Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the House of Chanel, received a
special award for his international fashion influence.
   Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was
recognized for promoting American fashion in the media.
   Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special
humanitarian award.
   The nonprofit council was founded in 1962 to promote American
fashion. Proceeds from the $850-a-ticket awards dinner were donated
to the Metropolitan's costume institute.

   Share prices topped Monday's record high on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar edged down from
the previous day's close.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which reached a record high
of 30,678.39 Monday, gained another 328.12 points, or 1.07 percent,
to close at 31,006.51, a new record high.
   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 125.70 yen, down
0.38 yen from Monday's finish of 126.03. The currency moved between
125.50 yen and 126.00 yen.
   Dealers said trading was fast with institutional investors and
individuals actively buying stocks.
   Foreign securities firms also bought up spot issues to help push
the market's main economic barometer up, added a dealer with a major
securities firm in Tokyo who spoke anonymously.
   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency's lower opening
followed an overnight decline in New York, dealers said. The dollar
closed at 125.95 yen on Wall Street Monday, down from a 126.78-yen
close the previous session.
   ``The sentiment toward the dollar's bearishness has basically
remained in the market,'' said a Bank of Tokyo dealer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Report: Thais Turned Back Boat People in 1988; Hundreds Die</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Vietnamese boat people
drowned or otherwise died violent deaths last year after Thai
authorities turned the refugees back to sea, a U.S. human rights
group charged today.
   The government rejected the report as ``prejudiced'' and said all
refugee boats were allowed to land.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, in its 193-page report,
detailed several alleged incidents of murder and brutality by Thai
authorities.
   It said Thai pirates ``ravaged, raped, and killed hundreds of
Vietnamese boat people'' pushed out to sea.
   The New York-based committee said Thailand continued to refuse
refugees permission to land despite its January 1988 announcement
that it renounced the policy. In addition, about 330,000 Cambodian
and Vietnamese refugees were exposed to lawlessness and cross-border
warfare in camps along the Cambodian frontier last year, says the
report entitled ``Refuge Denied.''
   ``Accounts by survivors received by the Lawyers Committee through
their relatives in the U.S. reveal a pattern of murder, sexual abuse
and robbery by Thai security forces authorized to `push off' new
Vietnamese arrivals,'' the report declared.
   A written statement from the Foreign Ministry described the
report as ``unbalanced, prejudiced and at times sensational.'' It
said all refugee boats were permitted to land and that arrivals were
taken to a special camp in cooperation with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   Kasit Piromya, chief of the Department of International
Organizations, disputed the committee's assertion that hundreds of
Vietnamese drowned.
   ``Most of the fatalities that occurred resulted from capsizing of
unseaworthy boats outside of Thai territorial waters,'' he said in
the statement.
   He said piracy against Vietnamese boat people declined from
attacks on 77 percent of boats in 1981 to 10 percent in 1988. The
U.N. refugee agency also has reported a decrease in attacks.
   Thailand has been praised for giving temporary asylum to hundreds
of thousands of Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laotian refugees who have
fled their homelands since the communist victories in Indochina in
1975.
   But the Thais have been criticized for the treatment some local
authorities give refugees, reluctance to act against pirates and
policies that sometimes cause undue suffering to those seeking
asylum.
   In one case, the report says, 74 Vietnamese refugees who came via
Cambodia in June 1988 were surrounded by Thai soldiers and towed
back to sea in four small boats. The soldiers abducted eight young
girls, shot at one of the boats, tried to ram another and abandoned
the survivors, the report says.
   It says that in another case that month, only two boys survived
of 61 Vietnamese who were towed to sea in small boats and fired on
by soldiers with automatic rifles.
   ``Thai fishermen have interpreted the push-back policy and
attitudes expressed by Thai officials and police as a mandate to
rape, rob and murder Vietnamese boat people,'' the report said.
   Officials should ``ensure respect for the basic human rights of
the Vietnamese boat people,'' it said. It accused Thailand of
deterring refugees by creating poor living conditions at refugee
camps.
   The report was based on interviews and trips to Thailand by
committee members last year.

   The Navy has awarded the contract to build the
first Seawolf submarine, touted as faster, quieter and having twice
the fire power of the subs it is expected to replace.
   The Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp. won the
$725.95 million contract over the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. of
Virginia, the Navy announced Monday. The two companies compete
annually for SSN-688 Los Angeles class submarine contracts.
   The SSN-21 Seawolf, which has been in the research and design
stage for seven years, had been criticized by some lawmakers who
charged that it was not advanced enough to meet the Soviets' planned
successor to their Akula attack sub. A House subcommittee tried to
delay funding in 1987, but full research funding was later restored
by Congress.
   Navy officials say the Seawolf is faster, quieter and has double
the fire power of the Los Angeles-class subs, which it is expected
to replace as the nation's chief fast-attack submarine.

<NOTE>Labor Department Reports Record Low Mining Fatalities in 1988</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of deaths in the nation's mines
dropped to 100 in 1988, a decline of 30 from the previous year and
the lowest number in the 87 years the federal government has tracked
mine fatalities, the Labor Department said.
   Fifty-two of the 1988 deaths were in coal mines, eclipsing a
record low of 63 fatalities in that sector of the mining industry in
1987, the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
announced Monday.
   In other types of mines, there were 48 reported fatalities in
1988, a decrease of one from the previous low of 49 in 1986, the
agency reported.
   The overall previous low for mine deaths was 125 in 1985.
   A contributing factor in the 1988 total was a sharp decline in
deaths blamed on roof collapses in underground coal mines. There
were eight such deaths recorded in 1988, down from 18 the year
before and 26 in 1986.
   The Labor Department speculated that use of new temporary roof
support systems, required by the government since January 1988, may
have contributed to the decline in roof collapses. The temporary
supports are used while miners install permanent supports.

   Paul Fleischman and Stephen Gammel won the 1989
Newbery and Caldecott medals for the best children's books of the
year, the American Library Association has announced.
   Fleischman, of Pacific Grove, Calif., received the Newbery Medal
for ``Joyful Noise: Poems for Two Voices,'' which celebrates the
insect world in imagery, rhyme and onomatopoeia.
   Gammel, of St. Paul, Minn., received the Caldecott Medal for his
illustrations of ``Song and Dance Man,'' a book written by Karen
Ackerman about a grandfather recreating his vaudevillian past for
his grandchildren.
   The awards were announced at a news conference Monday at the
American Library Association's midwinter meeting. The winners were
chosen by two 15-member committees of its Association for Library
Service to Children division.
   The Caldecott and Newbery prizes often mark books for best-seller
status among both children's librarians and parents. The Newbery
Medal has been awarded annually since 1922 and the Caldecott Medal
since 1938.
   The committees also named six runner-up or ``honor'' books.
   The two Newbery Honor books are: ``In the Beginning: Creation
Stories from Around the World,'' by Virginia Hamilton, and
``Scorpion,'' by Walter Dean Myers.
   The four Caldecott Honor books are: ``The Boy of the Three Year
Nap,'' illustrated by Allen Say, written by Dianne Snyder; ``Free
Fall,'' illustrated by David Wiesner; ``Goldilocks and the Three
Bears,'' illustrated by James Marshall, and ``Mirandy and Brother
Wind,'' illustrated by Jerry Pinknew, written by Patricia C.
McKissack.

<HEAD>Sajak Takes on Carson, Letterman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it's true that if you can't beat 'em, you
should join 'em, then Pat Sajak is CBS' white flag in the late-night
network talk-show war.
   From his Midwestern folksiness, to his Middle American
naughtiness, with his hip band, his plain vanilla sidekick and the
Hollywood Hills backdrop behind the blue curtain, desk-and
move-down-one sofa, Sajak is Carson Lite, Carson Jr., Carson
wanna-be.
   There is simply no reason for ``The Pat Sajak Show'' other than
to wait for Carson to retire and hope to inherit his ratings.
   In most markets, Sajak's 90-minute nightly show goes up against
NBC's `Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' and the first half of
NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman.'' In his first night
Monday, Sajak was up against Carson's guest host Jay Leno.
   Sajak's entire show was a tribute to Carson, but his one bow to
Letterman was a bald-faced copy of a ``Late Night'' remote segment.
Pat took viewers along on his physical _ and performed such
side-splitting antics as building a wooden fort out of tongue
depressors while waiting for the doctor. The bit was actually pretty
funny.
   If CBS can afford to keep him for a few years of slim ratings,
Sajak might be an acceptable heir to Carson. He's quick but
occasionally over-relaxed, letting his less-than-riveting guests,
such as Joan Van Ark, take over for too long.
   He did play off sidekick Dan Miller for easy laughs. But a man
who's been making his living cracking wise at the expense of
contestants on ``Wheel of Fortune'' had no trouble playing off the
first night's standard-issue guest list.
   The first guest, Chevy Chase, provided the only comic or any
other relief during guest Peter Ueberroth's deadly monologue on
baseball player drug use by leaving to use the bathroom.
   Later, Michael Gross of NBC's ``Family Ties'' said he hoped his
TV family, the Keatons, ``die in a plane crash'' to avoid future
``Family Ties'' reunions. But any dozing viewers had probably been
jolted into switching to Letterman by then. They would have
thankfully missed comedian Dennis Wolfberg, whose routine centered
around a proctology exam.
   By then, it seemed that a 90-minute talk show was awfully long.
It seemed years since Sajak had opened with his monologue. Most of
the jokes were lame, but that, too, is a Carson tradition. Sajak's
best lines made fun of third-place CBS. He checked his watch and
explained, `In less than one minute we will officially become CBS'
longest-running program.''
   In fact, Sajak as Carson clone has a better shot at the master
than a long list of contenders who have tried and failed, including
Joan Rivers in 1986 and Alan Thicke in 1983. The last time CBS
mounted a Carson attack was with Merv Griffin in 1972.
   Carson, 62, signed an undisclosed multi-year contract in 1987,
but he has been on the air for 26 years. Letterman has long been
considered the heir apparent at NBC, though he professes
occasionally to feel his more biting humor belongs after midnight.
   CBS is gambling with Sajak, a former heartland weatherman whose
only claim to fame is tossing quips opposite Vanna White on the
enormously popular ``Wheel of Fortune.'' But CBS has little to lose,
since it can't do much worse than it has been doing with reruns and
low-budget original dramas in late night. They've been pushed back
until after Sajak.
   ABC has long been happy to take the high road in late-night with
the long-running news show `Nightline.''
   The last pretender to the Carson throne, Miss Rivers, left Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s ``The Late Show'' and was replaced by a series of
fill-ins. Fox finally settled on the most successful of these,
comedian-actor Arsenio Hall.
   Ironically, or perhaps symmetrically, Hall also has a new
late-night talk show, in syndication. It premiered last week.
   `The Arsenio Hall Show'' shows signs of developing a personality,
though viewers with a low tolerance for cutesiness may give up on it
before it does. The brash Hall started out with a demographically de
riguer guest list that included singer Luther Vandross, actor Leslie
Nielsen and, er, personality Brooke Shields, about whom Hall gushed,
`The perfect first guest!'' in a display of vapid sentimentality or
high satire, depending upon the viewer's generosity.

<HEAD>Bench, Yastrzemski Elected To Baseball Hall of Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catcher Johnny Bench and slugger Carl Yastrzemski
were overwhelmingly elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in their
first year of eligibility.
   Bench got 431 votes from 447 ballots cast Monday night by members
of the Baseball Writers Association of America. Yastrzemski, the
American League's only batter to compile 3,000 hits and 400-plus
home runs, received 423 votes.
   To be elected, a player must be named on 75 percent of the
ballots cast. A player needed 336 votes to be elected this year.
   Bench got 96.4 percent and Yastrzemski 94.6. Only immortals Ty
Cobb, 98.2 percent, and Hank Aaron, 97.8, received higher
percentages than Bench. Yastrzemski's percentage was the
seventh-highest.
   ``There's a finality to it all, to reach a level so few people
reach,'' said Bench, the former Cincinnati Reds star.
   ``It's a thrill. It's the culmination of many years of hard work.
It's something, as a player, you don't think about,'' said
Yastrzemski, who played with the Boston Red Sox.
   Only one other player in this year's balloting received as many
as 300 votes. Gaylord Perry, a 300-game winner, finished third with
304, missing election by 32 votes.
   Induction ceremonies at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown are
scheduled for July 23.
   Only 17 of the 200 current members were elected in their first
year of eligibility. Players are eligible five years after they
retire.

<HEAD>Arias Postpones Summit Over Ortega's Objections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over Nicaragua's objections, a
Central American summit scheduled for next weekend in San Salvador
has been postponed until after the inauguration of President-elect
Bush.
   The meeting of five Central American presidents would seek to
advance a stalled regional peace plan. El Salvador's foreign
minister said it could convene as early as Jan. 29.
   Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto told a news conference in
San Jose on Monday that the presidents of Honduras and El Salvador
had agreed with President Oscar Arias' suggestion that the summit be
postponed.
   Arias proposed the delay on Friday, saying Bush should be given
time to formulate a Central American policy. Bush takes office Jan.
20.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua insisted late Monday that
any decision to delay the meeting should be made jointly by all five
regional presidents.
   Speaking on Nicaragua's state-run radio, he added, however that
if the meeting is not held next Sunday and Monday as originally
planned, ``it must be held as soon as possible.''
   Ortega had said a postponement could ``practically kill'' the
peace plan. His leftist Sandinista government has been fighting
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who lost Washington's military support
nearly a year ago. The belligerents signed a cease-fire accord on
March 23, but peace talks have stalled.
   Guatemala also objected to the postponement.
   ``We reiterate: it is urgent that the five Central American
leaders converge in one place to analyze the Central Amercian
situation,'' Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo said Monday.
   Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo of El Salvador said President
Jose Napoleon Duarte believed the summit could be held on schedule
only if the presidents of all five countries agreed.
   He said Jan. 29-30 or Feb. 20 were being considered as alternate
dates.
   Honduras did not comment. President Jose Azcona Hoyo traveled to
Washington on Monday and was to meet today with President Reagan and
Bush.
   Madrigal Nieto said foreign ministers from the five countries
would converge in the Nicaraguan capital on Jan. 17-18 to discuss an
agenda.
   He denied that postponement could jeopardize the regional peace
plan, which was authored by Arias and signed by the five presidents
in August 1987.
   The plan calls for greater democracy, an end to civil wars,
political amnesties and an end to the use of one country by rebels
fighting in another. It has been stalled since the presidents last
met a year ago in Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Report: Bush Heading To Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush plans to attend the Feb. 24
funeral of Emperor Hirohito in his first foreign trip as the U.S.
leader, the Kyodo news service quoted the head of Bush's transition
team as saying.
   The Kyodo report from Washington quoted Craig Fuller, the
transition chief, as saying Monday ``our understanding at present''
is that Bush will attend the state funeral.
   Kyodo said the dates of Bush's visit to Japan would be decided in
consultation with James Baker, Bush's secretary of state, and Brent
Scowcroft, the new national security adviser.
   Fuller was quoted as saying the trip to Tokyo would be Bush's
first foreign trip after he takes the oath of office Jan. 20.
   Washington so far has not announced who will be the U.S.
representative at Hirohito's funeral, and an official at the Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's office said today that he had no
information about a Bush visit.
   Representatives of more than 100 countries are expected to attend.
   The government today announced that it will allocate $61.4
million for the funeral and a mausoleum for Hirohito, who died
Saturday of cancer at age 87. The Cabinet approved the amount at a
morning meeting, Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa told a
briefing. He said the amount will include $25.6 million for the
funeral and $19.2 million for security.
   More than 30,000 police will be mobilized to ensure the safety of
visiting foreign dignitaries and to ward off any disruptive actions
by extremists, Shigenobu Sakano, chairman of the National Safety
Commission, said at the Cabinet meeting.
   Tazawa said $14.4 million will be allotted to constructing the
late emperor's mausoleum in Hachioji, 28 miles west of the capital.
   ``That will be an appropriate amount to make solemn but not showy
(events),'' Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told Japanese reporters.
   Hirohito death ended a 62-year reign. His eldest son, Akihito,
ascended to the throne, which has limited powers.
   In some countries, the issue of attending Hirohito's funeral has
caused controversy because of his role as Japan's titular ruler in
World War II. Historians generally agree that he went along with
wartime decisions by military leaders, but made the decision to
surrender to the Allies in 1945.

<HEAD>Budget Proposes Modest Hikes in Education, Health Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration proposes modest
spending increases in education, health and poverty programs but
wants to save money by cutting school lunch subsidies and home
heating assistance along with some student loans and grants.
   In its proposed 1990 budget unveiled Monday, the administration
outlined a 5.7 percent increase for the Department of Health and
Human Services and a 3 percent boost in outlays for education.
   Health and Human Services, the largest federal department, would
receive $424.4 billion in 1990.
   The budget called for a 13 percent increase in spending for AIDS
research and prevention, raising that to $1.4 billion.
   However, the budget proposed saving some $935 million by cutting
off school lunch subsidies that benefit middle and upper class
students. Currently all students, regardless of family income, are
entitled to school lunches subsidized by the government.
   But under the administration plan, students whose family income
is 185 percent higher than the poverty line _ about $21,553 for a
family of four last year _ will be on their own.
   Overall, the government will spend an estimated $5 billion on
school and day care center lunch programs this year. Cutting off the
subsidy for middle and upper income families would cost them about
28 cents per lunch, the administration estimated.
   A group pushing for nutrition programs for the poor attacked the
proposal as ``inexcusable.''
   ``No matter how they defend it, these proposals will mean the
denial of millions of meals to needy children in schools and day
care centers,'' said Robert J. Fersh of the Food Research Action
Center.
   The administration also proposed to save $283 million by reducing
money to help the poor pay their heating and light bills to a $1.1
billion spending authority.
   ``Now that the energy crisis has ended, low-income households are
spending smaller and smaller portions of their income on heat,'' the
budget document said.
   Meanwhile, education lobbying groups said they hoped George Bush,
who ran on the pledge of being the ``education president,'' would
correct what they believe are inadequacies in the final Reagan
budget.
   ``We would hope that when the Bush administration submits its own
budget, we will see a substantial increase,'' said Susan Frost,
executive director of a coalition of education groups. ``If we were
to see ... basically no changes in the Bush administration, we'd be
very disappointed.''
   Under the proposed budget, education outlays would rise slightly
from an estimated $20.6 billion to $21.2 billion next year.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said the administration hoped
to save some $750 million by cutting out two dozen programs,
including some student loans and grants.
   However, many of the programs up for elimination have survived
past administration attempts to do away with them.

   A homeless man who lived secretly at Bellevue
Hospital was wearing a surgical gown and stethoscope when he
murdered and raped a pregnant physician during a robbery in her
hospital office, police said.
   Steven Smith, 23, was arrested at a men's shelter Monday
afternoon after three other homeless men brought the slain woman's
identification and credit cards to police, Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward said at a news conference.
   The men told investigators Smith had given them the items to sell
and had given a mink coat stolen from the doctor to another man to
sell, the commissioner said.
   Police recovered the coat with Dr. Kathryn Hinnant's initials
embroidered inside from a man at the shelter, Ward told reporters.
   Smith was charged with second-degree murder, first-degree robbery
and first-degree rape in the strangulation death of Hinnant. Smith
had been arrested at the hospital on Jan. 1 for illegally possessing
a hypodermic needle but was released and his case adjourned until
Feb. 2, said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the district
attorney's office.
   The body of the 33-year-old physician, who was five months
pregnant, was discovered Sunday by her husband, Eric Johnson, after
she failed to meet him the night before.
   Ward said Smith masqueraded as a doctor and his ``normal behavior
when he is at the hospital is to steal IDs'' and eat at the hospital
cafeteria.
   ``He's a kind of a con person who seems to take a great joy in
getting over on the staff,'' Ward said.
   Police said Smith was wearing a blue scrub suit, a lab coat and a
stethoscope when he attacked Hinnant on Saturday afternoon.
   Smith told detectives he had lived periodically on the 22nd floor
of the 25-story hospital, where police said they found a dirty
hospital bed, a stethoscope and bloodied hospital gloves presumedly
used in the attack and empty beer cans.
   Detectives also found bloodied clothing, including a blue scrub
suit, jeans and socks, in a garbage container at the shelter where
Smith was arrested. They also recovered a shawl that police believed
belonged to the victim.
   Bellevue is a major municipal hospital where many of the city's
homeless are taken for treatment.
   The 22nd floor is a maintenance area that houses machinery and
was not usually patrolled, according to Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford,
president of Health and Hospitals Corp., the city agency that runs
Bellevue. She said security at the 1,200-bed complex would be
reviewed but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary at
the time of the murder.
   ``Hospitals are not prisons, they have to be open environments to
a degree, for the people to get their work done,'' she said.
   Hinnant had been struck in the face and had her nose broken, then
was strangled with an appliance cord and raped, authorities said.
   Smith told investigators a man he identified only as John
participated in the assault and raped Hinnant, but Ward said police
had ``not even confirmed that this person exists other than in the
mind of Steven Smith.''
   Apparently Hinnant kept the door of her windowless office ajar
with a small box, police said. Smith told detectives he and John
walked by, then returned to talk to the physician.
   She didn't have to work Saturday, but ``she did it because she
was always looking for this extra mile and that extra piece of
excellence she could give,'' said Dr. John Pearson, Bellevue's chief
pathologist.
   ``Whoever did this wiped out a brilliant mind,'' the doctor's
father, Thad Hinnant, said from his home in Columbia, S.C. ``I just
can't imagine it.''
   The Hinnants last saw their daughter Nov. 26 when she came to
Columbia for her parents' 40th wedding anniversary.
   ``She was just so happy,'' said her mother, Jane. ``She loved New
York.''
   But Mrs. Hinnant said her daughter was thinking about returning
to the South. ``She thought it was a better place to raise
children,'' she said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who had called the killing ``the No. 1 case
to be solved,'' congratulated police on the prompt arrest and said
Ward's insistence on offering a $30,000 reward immediately was a key
in getting the three homeless men to come forward.
   However, a police spokesman said Monday it wasn't known if the
men would receive the money. ``They haven't asked for it yet,'' Sgt.
Maurice Howard said.

   An earthquake capable of severe damage shook the
western tip of New Guinea, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, according
to the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, calif.
   The tremor measured 6.5 on the Richter scale and struck at 7:55
p.m. HST Monday (12:55 a.m. Tuesday EST), according to the Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center here.
   No Pacific-wide tsunami was generated, the center reported.
   The USGS measured the quake at 6.7 on the Richter scale.
   The quake was centered in the Ceram Sea, off western New Guinea.
The area is about 500 miles southeast of the Philippines and 700
miles north of Darwin, Australia.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. A magnitude
7 quake is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Last Four Former Klansmen Plead Guilty In 1979 Clash With Marchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``sordid chapter'' in Alabama history
ended when four former Ku Klux Klansmen pleaded guilty for their
part in a decade-old clash with black marchers that wounded nine
people, a federal judge said.
   The four were the last of nine former Klansmen who were indicted
and eventually pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the gunfire
that turned the Decatur parade route into a racial battleground.
   No one was killed in the May 26, 1979, confrontation. Five police
officers, two marchers and two Klansmen were wounded.
   The Klansmen were trying to block a Southern Christian Leadership
Conference march protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded
black man charged with raping a white woman in Decatur.
   Ray Winford Steele and William Riccio pleaded guilty Monday to
felony obstruction of justice, which carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, and a misdemeanor count of
conspiring to violate civil rights.
   William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White pleaded guilty to the
misdemeanor, which carries a maximum one year prison term and $1,000
fine.
   ``You have ended a very sordid chapter of your history and the
history of this state,'' U.S. District Judge John Hancock said in
accepting the pleas. He delayed sentencing for up to a month.
   In return for the pleas, federal prosecutors agreed to drop other
charges alleging that Klansmen aided and abetted in an injury to a
police officer.
   Mason, White and Steele entered their pleas before the start of
the trial Monday. Riccio indicated he wanted his trial to proceed,
but pleaded guilty before a jury was picked.
   His attorney, Jerry Quick, said Riccio wanted to end the case.
   ``He is just glad it's over with,'' Quick said, adding he hoped
the judge would be lenient.
   Al Moskowitz, a Justice Department attorney overseeing the
prosecution, said he was confident there would have been convictions
had the cases gone to trial. But he said he agreed to the plea
arrangement in part to let the case finally come to rest.
   The case was broken open when the Montgomery-based Southern
Poverty Law Center sued the Klan. That litigation produced testimony
from former Klansmen against Klan colleagues, leading to a federal
grand jury indictment against the nine on criminal charges.
   Their trial was delayed after a federal judge ruled that the
testimony produced in the civil case could not be used in the
criminal case. But that ruling was set aside on appeal.

<HEAD>Former Nazi Propagandist Seeks Refuge In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Nazi propagandist and Yale University
lecturer who was stripped of his U.S. citizenship and failed to
appear for a deportation hearing has surfaced in Canada and applied
for asylum, Canadian television reported.
   Russian emigre Vladimir Sokolov, 75, disappeared in July, when
the deportation hearing was to have been held in Hartford, Conn.
   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status
in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming his life would be in
danger if he were forced to return to the Soviet Union, the Canadian
Broadcast Corp. reported Monday night.
   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian
language newspaper German army occupiers published in his hometown
of Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared
under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive
tracts were written by Nazi censors.
   Nevertheless, the German army awarded Sokolov medals for his work.
   Sokolov's Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, contended there were no
grounds to return his client to the United States ``since he's out
of the country, he's not in violation of any law.''
   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have
called him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to death
or given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would be
the end of his life.''
   CBC quoted the Soviet embassy in Ottawa as saying they were aware
of the Sokolov case but did not know whether there are charges
against him in the Soviet Union.
   Grey said Sokolov is in very poor health.
   In one World War II article that appeared under Sokolov's name,
Jews were compared to rats. The article expressed the hope that
during the war, Jews would ``be destroyed finally and forever.''
   Grey, who is Jewish, said his client ``certainly doesn't exhibit
any (anti-Semitic) ideas now, whether he ever had them or not.''
   ``Even if he did write those scurrilous articles 40 years ago
it's not an overwhelming thing. He's never been accused or charged
with a war crime _ the test for war crimes is, `Did you commit any
atrocities?'''
   The Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews in what they
called The Final Solution.
   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he
entered the United States as a displaced person.
   He became a citizen in 1957 and two years later began lecturing
on Russian language and Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he
later resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before
filing a complaint to strip him of his U.S citizenship.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Murphy stripped Sokolov of his
citizenship in 1986, finding that he had concealed his Nazi past.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Immigration Policy That Stranded Asylum-Seekers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central American immigrants prepared to
travel to other cities after a judge blocked a new immigration
policy that stranded hundreds of aliens in south Texas while their
asylum requests were processed.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela blamed the policy for a sharp
increase in the number of Central Americans living in makeshift
camps and condemned buildings in Cameron County, Texas' southernmost
county.
   ``I am a human being; I do live in this community,'' Vela said
Monday as he issued a temporary restraining order suspending the
policy.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, under the Dec.
16 policy, told applicants they could not travel from the area or
work while awaiting a decision on their asylum status, a period of
at least 30 days.
   They said the policy was intended to curb the backlog of cases in
other cities, particularly Miami and Los Angeles, and reduce
applications from those entering the country for economic reasons,
not political.
   The judge's order came in a lawsuit by advocates for the aliens
that accused the INS of improperly changing the policy and depriving
asylum-seekers of their rights to representation and access to the
asylum process as required under the Refugee Act of 1980.
   Vela will hold another hearing on the lawsuit Thursday.
   Vern Jervis, an INS spokesman in Washington, said the agency will
contest the restraining order.
   One plaintiff attorney, Linda Reyna Yanez, said she expected ``a
substantial exodus'' from the area by Thursday.
   ``We're going to advise people that they do not have to live here
in the (Rio Grande) Valley in the rain and the cold and vacant lots,
that they can now be with their family, with their friends and they
can pursue their asylum claims in those cities,'' said Mark
Schneider, an attorney with Proyecto Libertad, a co-counsel to the
lawsuit filed Friday.
   ``It's marvelous,'' said Maria Isabel Fernandez, 28, of Honduras,
who has camped for two weeks. ``What else could we ask for?''
   Ms. Fernandez and eight relatives said they planned to travel to
Houston, where family members live.
   Sister Juliana Garcia, director of the Casa Oscar Romero shelter,
said many people prepared to travel as soon as they heard about the
court order.
   ``I think it will alleviate the situation for a lot of people,''
she said. ``People are already making a big line to fix their papers
and leave.''
   About 300 people had set up camp in a field across from the
filled shelter but most had left by Monday. The owner of the land
had posted ``No Trespassing'' signs on the property Sunday, and the
campers had been told to leave.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez on Monday gave them an extra 24
hours, but most had found shelter elsewhere by Monday night.
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, said a special team from the Justice
Department's community relations service would arrive in the area
today to consider federal assistance for the Central Americans.
   ``I kept telling the administration that since the Department of
Justice had created the problem, the Department of Justice must pay
for the problem,'' Ortiz said. ``Thankfully, they agreed.''
   Ortiz estimated that 2,500 homeless Central Americans are in the
Rio Grande Valley, and ``there's a lot of people coming through the
pipeline.'' The INS estimates that between 5,000 and 7,000 Central
Americans are in the area.
   Ortiz said of a recent group of 272 people who applied for
political asylum in the INS Harlingen District, only two were
approved.

   Health authorities seeking to learn how many
Americans carry the AIDS virus hope the offer of $50 and a plea for
cooperation will attract people in high-risk groups to participate
in a pilot survey.
   ``That's one of the major problems with which we're wrestling and
which we've spent a lot of time trying to determine how to
evaluate,'' said Dr. James R. Allen, an assistant deputy director at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   The survey began Monday with the mailing of letters to 350
randomly selected households in Allegheny County asking people to
anonymously reveal their sexual practices and give blood for $50. If
the effort succeeds, the survey could be extended nationwide.
   ``If high-risk individuals avoid the survey, there's no point''
in conducting a national survey, said Dr. Bruce W. Dixon, chief of
the sexually transmissible disease program of the county health
department.
   In August, officials abandoned an attempted pilot survey in
Washington, D.C., after opponents said the effort unfairly targeted
blacks, said Peter Hurley, an associate director of the National
Center for Health Statistics.
   Officials say they learned their lesson and planned the
Pittsburgh-area survey with the unanimous consent of a 21-member
advisory panel drawn from the community.
   ``Every concern that was expressed by members of the advisory
panel was taken into consideration and changes were made,'' said
panel member Leslie Hunt Turner, assistant administrator of the Alma
Illery Medical Center, which is located in a predominantly black
neighborhood.
   ``Everyone was skeptical,'' said Mrs. Turner. ``It wasn't a thing
where we said, `Yeah, this is a great idea. Let's go for it.' ''
   Success here, ideally in the form of 85 percent participation,
will lead to an expanded preliminary survey elsewhere, officials
said. Dallas and San Diego are among the communities on the CDC's
short list for the next round, Allen said.
   If all goes well, the planners could ask Congress as early as
next year for the estimated $25 million needed for a national
survey, Allen said.
   The advisory panel persuaded the planners not to ask for the
individual's day of birth, just the month and year, to ensure
privacy.
   A question on marital status accounts for divorce and same-sex
cohabitation to reflect ``a lot of differences in living
arrangements in today's society,'' Mrs. Turner said.
   The actual results will be meaningless because so few of the
county's 850,000 housholds are to be questioned, Dixon said.
   The effort could, however, define the methods to be used
nationwide. People who decline to participate will be asked why and
their answers will be used to delete objectionable aspects from the
survey, officials said.
   On Saturday, professional interviewers and technicians trained to
draw blood, working in teams of two, will begin the four- to
six-week job of knocking on the 350 doors, asking one person age 18
to 54 in each home to participate.
   Those who agree will be paid $50. They will be asked such
questions as whether they have ever engaged in behavior that risks
exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. Risky behavior includes sex with an infected partner,
intravenous drug use by addicts and blood transfusions.
   Officials said each participant will complete the questionnaire
out of sight of the interviewer and technician and will seal it in a
tamper-proof wrapper for mailing. Neither the blood sample nor the
questionnaire will be labeled with the person's identity.
   Officials said the interviewer and technician will never see the
answers and they risk being fired and fined $5,000 for opening the
sealed questionnaire.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index climbed
sharply to a record high for the second consecutive day today, while
the dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shot up
468.85 points on Monday, gained another 328.12 points, or 1.07
percent, closing at 31,006.51 today.
   Trading was very active with both individuals and institutional
investors participating, dealers said. Volume traded on the first
section was estimated at 1.5 billion shares.
   ``The market was inactive for quite a while until last week,
mainly due to concerns over the late emperor's condition, but I
never thought investors had kept so much money to buy stocks,'' said
one, speaking on condition that he not be named.
   Emperor Hirohito died of intestinal cancer on Saturday at age 87.
He had been seriously ill since Sept. 19, and caution had prevailed
on the stock market, with investors anxious about the effects of a
temporary halt to business for mourning.
   But markets canceled only their half-day Saturday sessions.
   The dealer said foreign securities firms also were buying on
Tuesday, helping to push prices up.
   Dealers said a majority of buyers were interested in stocks newly
issued in the Heisei era, the official name given to the reign of
the new emperor, Akihito, who ascended to the throne when Hirohito
died. The reign name is used on Japanese calendars and official
documents. Hirohito's reign name was Showa.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 125.70 yen,
down 0.38 yen from Monday's close of 126.08 yen and unchanged from
today's opening. It ranged between 125.50 yen and 126.00 yen in
today's trading.
   Traders selling West German marks for yen helped to strengthen
the yen against the dollar too, dealers said.
   He said the dollar-yen rate was likely to stay within a narrow
range until the next U.S. monthly trade figures are announced in
mid-January.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities have risen to the highest level since early 1985.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $7.2 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.36 percent, up
from 8.24 percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.48 percent, up from
8.37 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.41
percent on March 25, 1985, and six-month bills averaged 8.56 percent
on April 8, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.66 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,788.70 and and 8.98 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,571.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 9.17
percent last week after averaging 9.07 percent the week before.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Barr, a Broadway producer and director
who presented the Tony-award winning ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, has died at age 71.
   Barr, a Manhattan resident, died Monday of liver failure at Mount
Sinai Hospital. He had been suffering from exposure to HIV, the
virus associated with AIDS, said Shirley Herz, his spokeswoman.
   Barr, who was president of the League of American Theaters and
Producers for 21 years until his death, was preparing a new Albee
drama, ``Marriage Play'' for Broadway.
   He presented many of Albee's plays on and off-Broadway including
``Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?'' ``A Delicate Balance'' and
``Seascape.''
   Barr also presented some of the first works by such authors as
Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson, John Guare, A.R. Gurney and Terrence
McNally through the Playwrights' Unit, a production company he
founded with Albee and Clinton Wilder.
   Born on Sept. 6, 1917, Barr grew up in Washington and graduated
in 1938 from Princeton University, where he acted in plays.
   He began his theater career in the late 1930s working for Orson
Welles' Mercury Theater and was a production assistant for Welles'
radio program ``War of the Worlds.'' He also worked as Welles'
executive assistant on the film ``Citizen Kane.''
   Barr first began producing plays on Broadway and on tour during
the late 1940s and early '50s, but attracted considerable attention
off-Broadway in 1960 with a double bill of one-act plays, ``Krapp's
Last Tape'' by Samuel Beckett and Albee's ``The Zoo Story.'' He went
on to present more works by Albee off-Broadway including ``The Death
of Bessie Smith,'' ``The Sandbox'' and ``The American Dream.''
   One of Barr's biggest successes was the Broadway production of
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' The story of a disintegrating
marriage, the play starred Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill and opened on
Broadway at the Billy Rose Theater in October 1962. It won the Tony
award for best play the following year.
   Among Barr's other successes were ``The Boys in the Band'' in
1968 and ``Sweeney Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheim musical, in 1979.
His last production was James Duff's ``Home Front'' which had a
short run on Broadway in 1987.
   Barr is survived by his mother, Ruth Baer, and two sisters, Carol
Fischer and Barbara Luchs, all of Washington.

   Kenneth McMillan, a veteran character
actor who appeared in movies, television shows and plays on and off
Broadway, has died. He was 56.
   McMillan, who died Sunday of liver failure at St. John's
Hospital, played Jack Doyle, Rhoda Morgenstern's boss in the hit
1970s CBS series ``Rhoda,'' and appeared in such movies as
``Ragtime'' and ``The Pope of Greenwich Village.''
   The Brooklyn-born actor McMillan appeared on Broadway in the
original production of David Mamet's ``American Buffalo.'' He
received an Obie award for his off-Broadway performance in
``Weekends Like Other People.''
   McMillan also appeared Joseph Papp's productions of ``Henry V,''
``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' ``Where Do We Go From Here,'' ``Kid
Champion,'' and the original Mike Nichols-directed ``Streamers.''
   The ``Rhoda'' assignment was his first full-time television work,
and his first movie appearance was in 1973's ``Serpico.''
   He also appeared in the movies ``Eye Witness,'' ``True
Confessions,'' ``Reckless,'' ``Dune,'' ``Runaway Train,'' and
``Protocol.''
   He recently completed a leading role in the Disney film, ``Three
Fugitives,'' said his publicist, Frank Liberman.
   He is survived by a wife, Kathryn, a former Broadway dancer, and
a daughter, Allison, an actress.
   Private services will follow cremation. A memorial service will
be held Jan. 29 at the Debbie Reynolds Studios in Burbank, where
McMillan often taught classes. The family has requested that any
donations go to the Actors Fund.

   Prospects for a 150-nation conference on chemical
arms achieving consensus that would help curb proliferation of the
weapons appeared dim as delegates bickered over who should be
allowed to possess the poisons.
   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim a
right it denies others?'' Foreign Minister Jadallah Azouz Ettalhi of
Libya asked Monday, reiterating the Arab stance that the U.S. is
being discriminatory.
   The United States has alleged a Libya has built a chemical
weapons plant, a charge Libya denies.
   Both Washington and Moscow acknowledge having huge stocks of
chemical weapons _ the only nations to do so _ and both support
efforts to ban the arms. But a bloc of Arab delegates to the
conference has advocated linking elimination of chemical arms with
destruction of nuclear weapons.
   Romania added its voice on Monday to the Arab position, while
Britain joined the United States in opposing any linkage.
   The dispute risks weakening a final statement, to delivered
Wednesday, and reducing the impact of the five-day conference.
   The Libyan minister accused Israel of maintaining stocks of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, with the assistance of the
United States. Charges that Israel has nuclear weapons are at the
heart of the Arab effort.
   Both types of arms are viewed as machinery for mass destruction,
but, unlike nuclear arms, chemical weaponry has not in the past been
considered a weapon to deter attack.
   ``Obviously, we want the strongest possible (final) communique
that meets our objectives and is compatible with our security
interests,'' U.S. arms control official Lynn Hansen said Monday.
   ``The fact that there are countries that want other things means
that we will have difficulty in reaching a consensus,'' said Hansen,
director of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S. Arms
Control Agency.
   The final declaration must be reached by consensus, meaning there
can be no disagreements.
   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 Geneva Protocol
banning the use of chemical weapons and giving impetus to
negotiations in Geneva for a total, verifiable ban on the use,
production and stocking of chemical arms.
   The planned conference statement, political in nature, will have
no legal or binding weight. A working version obtained by The
Associated Press makes no direct reference to linking nuclear and
chemical arms. But it refers to the need to obtain ``general and
complete disarmament.''
   The version also voices ``serious concern at recent violations''
of the Geneva Protocol. The statement, if adopted, is not binding.
   The statement ``will have to take into account the preoccupations
of certain Arab countries,'' said a French conference source,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But it is a bit too early to
say what that form will take.''
   Iraq's use of chemical arms in its eight-year war with Iran, the
latest verifiable use of the weaponry, serves as a backdrop for the
conference.
   About 20 countries are thought to have chemical weapons
capabilties, and there is a growing fear that non-nuclear nations
will stock chemical arms.

<HEAD>Jury Selected In Night Stalker Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of 12 jurors has been selected from a
pool of more than 1,500 people to hear the trial of ``Night
Stalker'' defendant Richard Ramirez, charged with a series of savage
nocturnal murders.
   The jury, whose selection was completed Monday, were chosen after
five months of intense questioning on prospective jurors' views on
the death penalty and their ability to afford sitting through a
trial that could last two years.
   At least six of the 12 jurors are Hispanic, according to court
records. Defense attorneys wanted significant Hispanic
representation and had once charged that standard selection
procedures could not ensure the desired ethnic balance for their
Hispanic client.
   Ramirez, 27, faces 13 counts of murder in the attacks, most of
which occurred in 1985. He also is charged with 30 other felonies
including rape, robbery and attempted murder.
   The defendant, who was said to have dealt in the occult and once
yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' in court, had been quiet during jury
selection, often dressing in black and wearing sunglasses.
   Opening statements are scheduled for Jan. 23. Attorneys in the
meantime will continue to select 12 alternate jurors, said Deputy
District Attorney Alan Yochelson.
   Yochelson said he sees no delay in selecting the alternate jurors.
   ``We anticipate meeting that deadline and proceeding on that
date,'' he said.
   He said that prosecutors were not looking to fill an ethnic quota.
   ``We are just looking for fair and impartial jurors, regardless
of their ethnic backgrounds,'' he said. ``During extensive pretrial
hearings, evidence clearly demonstrated that the ethnic makeup of
juries in the Central District of Superior Court fully reflect the
diverse racial and cultural backgrounds of this community.''
   A message left at defense attorney Daniel Hernandez's office
after hours was not immediately returned.
   The jury pool of more than 1,500 people was whittled down last
month to 143 potential jurors who were questioned for the final
panel. Hundreds were excused because they could not afford to hear
the potentially lengthy trial. More were dismissed because they
believed Ramirez, a drifter from Texas, was guilty of the brutal
``Night Stalker'' slayings.
   The selection process began July 21, and was conducted in three
phases.
   If jurors convict Ramirez of even one murder and special
circumstance allegation, they must then decide whether to impose the
death penalty or decree life in prison without possibility of parole.

<HEAD>Landmark Hotel Closes For Remodeling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palace Hotel, where the Great Caruso was
spooked during the 1906 earthquake and where President Warren G.
Harding died in 1923, has closed its doors for the second time in
its 113-year history.
   The hotel, which shut down on Monday, will go through an
18-month, $60 million renovation that will leave the exterior
untouched and restore much of its historic decor.
   ``It's very strage. It's very lonely,'' said Donald Timbie, the
Sheraton Palace's general manager and vice president after the doors
closed.
   The only other time the Palace shut down was in 1906, after the
great earthquake and fire.
   One of the guests who fled from the Palace during the temblor was
tenor Enrico Caruso, who was so upset he vowed never to return to
San Francisco.
   Because of the hotel's 12-foot brick walls, the original
seven-story building survived the earthquake but was gutted by the
fire. The present, eight-story building opened in 1909 with
additions in 1915, 1919 and 1925.
   The hotel on San Francisco's Market Street was also where Harding
died in 1923.
   Other guests have included other presidents Ulysses S. Grant,
William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Charles Lindberg, Amelia Earhart, Charlie
Chaplin, Nikita Khrushchev and Winston Churchill also stayed at the
Palace.
   The hotel's most striking feature is the Garden Court, a huge
covered courtyard that has long been a popular place for San
Franciscans to meet for lunch.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan imported a record 133,583 cars in 1988, the
third straight year auto imports increased, the Japan Automobile
Importers Association announced today.
   Three West German carmakers _ Bavarian Motor Works, Volkswagen
and Mercedes-Benz _ were the most popular, the association said.
   The association credited intensifying competition and advertising
for the 35.5 percent increase in imports over 1987. It said 17,135
cars were imported in December, marking the 60th consecutive monthly
increase on a year-to-year basis.
   It said tax laws, due to take effect April 1, are expected to
lead to increased sales of larger import cars. The law abolishes the
23 percent tax for cars with engines over 2,000 cubic centimeters,
adding a 6 percent sales tax instead.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow or rain fell in the East, the Midwest and the West today
after wet weather in Oregon caused mudslides that closed three
highways and triggered a flood warning.
   Snow fell at higher elevations in Virginia, Tennessee and North
Carolina, and rain stretched from Delaware to Florida, and in
Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   In New York state's snowbelt, a snow squall warning was posted
east of Lake Ontario. On Monday, Barnes Corners received 20 inches
of snow, Adams got 18 and Lowville got 12 to 14.
   Snow fell today in Michigan and Minnesota and from Montana to the
Idaho Panhandle and the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. Rain
fell from the Pacific Northwest to the northern coast of California.
   Heavy snow warnings were in effect for Idaho and Montana, and
snow advisories were issued for Washington state and Oregon.
Advisories for snow and blowing snow were up in Utah, Wyoming and
Colorado. In Utah, the Highway Patrol closed a state road because of
blowing, drifting snow.
   Three western Oregon highways were closed Monday by mudslides
that followed heavy rains. The National Weather Service issued a
flood warning for the Wilson River near Tillamook about 50 miles
west of Portland. The river was expected to crest 1 foot above flood
stage today.
   In northeastern Oregon, 4 to 10 inches of snow closed most Union
County schools Monday.
   In California, chilly weather gripped inland San Diego County for
the fourth day in a row, prompting a frost advisory and a prediction
of crop damage. Temperatures were expected to drop to 27 degrees in
some areas.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the lower Great Lakes to
New Jersey, and north to southern New England, with snow changing to
or mixed with rain in southern New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware,
northern Virginia and West Virginia. Rain showers were expected from
the rest of Virginia to northern Florida, the central Gulf Coast
states and the western Gulf Coast; show showers from upper Michigan
to eastern Wisconsin; snow from the upper Missouri Valley to the
northern and central Rockies; and rain in the northern and central
Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were predicted in the single digits and teens
from the upper Missouri Valley to North Dakota, most of South
Dakota, the upper Mississippi Valley, northern Wisconsin and upper
Michigan; teens in northern New England; and 20s and 30s from
southern Maine to the Great Lakes and the Virginia and from Ohio to
Iowa, Nebraska and the Rockies. The 60s were expected for northern
Florida and from southwest Texas to Southern California; near 80
degrees in the Florida Keys; and in the 40s and 50s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from minus 27
degrees at Williston, N.D., to 72 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   Baseball Hall of Famer Bill Terry, the
National League's last .400 hitter, has died. He was 90.
   Terry died Monday in Jacksonville, where he had been living for
40 years, after several months of failing health.
   Terry, a first baseman who spent all 14 of his major-league
seasons with the New York Giants, batted .401 in 1930.
   Terry had a lifetime average of .341 and drove in 100 or more
runs for six consecutive seasons, starting in 1927. He finished his
career with 1,078 RBI.
   He also was one of baseball's rare player-managers, holding the
dual role for the Giants from 1932 until his retirement in 1941.
Under his leadership, the Giants won the National League pennants in
1933, 1936 and 1937 and the World Series in 1933.
   Terry almost quit baseball before he reached stardom. He began
playing for Atlanta of the Southern League _ before he was 16 years
old _ in 1914 as a pitcher.
   He left organized baseball in 1918 to begin operating a chain of
gas filling stations for an oil company. But Terry returned to
baseball in 1922, and after minor-league stops in Toldeo, Ohio, and
Shreveport, La., he joined the Giants in 1923.
   Terry finished his career with 2,193 lifetime hits and 154 home
runs. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1954.
   A few months after the honor, he was made president of the Class
A South Atlantic League. Later, Terry went on to become president of
the minor-league Jacksonville Braves.
   The Atlanta native also ran a highly successful automobile agency
for many years in Jacksonsville.
   Terry's wife, Vena, died in 1983. He is survived by three sons
and a daughter.

<HEAD>Australian Team Champs In World Universities Debating Contest At
Princeton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Australian students turned society's
love of money into a winning argument to capture debating's most
prestigious tournament for the University of Sydney Union.
   ``Let's look at the real world,'' said Warren Lee, who teamed
with Andrew Bell to win the 9th Annual World Universities Debating
Championship at Princeton University.
   ``People don't say, `Let's all join the Peace Corps and be nice
guys.'''
   That thrust helped the pair defeat the University of Toronto and
win the title Monday for Sydney for the second time.
   Two U.S. teams, from Yale University and the University of
Pennsylvania, were eliminated in the semi-final round Monday
morning. A total of 116 teams of word wizards competed.
   Using a forcible debating style mixed with wit, the Australians
were the clear crowd favorite as Lee and Bell argued that modern
society reveres those who acquire wealth.
   University of Toronto team members Justin MacGregor and David
Conklin, acting as ``the government'' in the British parliamentary
style argument, had the task of proving that ``it profits a man
nothing to gain the world and lose his soul.''
   ``It was a good debate,'' Lee said after the Australians
finished. ``The masses were laughing and hooting and screaming. You
always like to see that.''
   Conklin admitted the subject ``was a tough one. Any value today
involving some notion of justice or injustice is difficult to get
across.''
   In the debate, Conklin argued that figures such as Jesus, Gandhi
and Martin Luther King Jr. shunned the material world for larger
social gains.
   ``Christ, in his death, was far more important than he would have
been had he compromised his values,'' Conklin said.
   MacGregor scored a few points by saying ``justice was served in
the movie `Wall Street.' Michael Douglas did go to jail in the end,
before he won his Academy Award.''
   But it wasn't enough to overcome the Australians' contention
``that the people who get the stuff are not punished, they get the
wealth, the respect, and the happiness.''
   Earlier in the day, the Australians defeated Yale University by
opposing the concept that ``the emperor has no clothes.''
   The University of Toronto advanced to the championship by
defeating the University of Pennsylvania with a successful argument
that the sky is not falling.
   The championship drew a record 232 participants from 18 nations.
   The debaters delivered some spirited arguments during the
week-long tournament.
   For example, Cheryl Strauss of Cornell University last week
suggested that vegetables be the focal point of a new religion.
   ``I think we should all pray to vegetables,'' she said. ``Then we
could all look down and that would make us feel good.''
   Mark Voyce of the University of Maryland had an offbeat response
Sunday when given the topic, ``How to Make Sports More Violent.''
   Voyce said archery should include human targets.
   ``Who wants to shoot an arrow into a bunch of hay?'' he said.

   Three men shot and wounded a leading
investigating magistrate as he left his home for work today,
authorities said. No group claimed responsibility, but police blamed
leftist extremists.
   Constantinos Androulidakis, known for his tough stand against
suspected terrorists, was hit in the arm and leg, police said. He
was taken to a nearby Evangelismos Hospital, where he was reported
in stable condition.
   A police spokesman, speaking on conditon of anonymity,
characterized the attack as an attempt by leftist extremists to
intimidate other judicial officials.
   Androulidakis was shot when he stepped out of his apartment in
the Zographos area of the capital, the police spokesman said. The
three gunmen fled in a stolen car, which was later found abandoned
near the scene of the shooting, police said.
   In October 1987, Androulidakis ordered the arrest and pre-trial
imprisonment of two people on suspicion of involvement in terrorist
activities.
   The two _ Gerasimos Boukouvalas and Evanghelia Voyatzi _ were
arrested following an Athens shootout with police that killed
Michalis Prekas, who was believed to be a member of the leftist
Anti-State Struggle and the Revolutionary Popular Struggle groups.
   Revolutionary Popular Struggle has claimed responsibility for
hundreds of bomb explosions around Athens since 1975. No one has
been injured in the attacks, which usually target U.S. military
facilities and tax offices.
   Anti-State Struggle claimed responsibility for the killing of
District Attorney Giorgos Theofanopoulos in 1985.
   No members of either group have ever been arrested.
   Boukuvalas and Voyatzi were jailed 18 months on orders from
Androulidakis and set free when another judge said no concrete
evidence connected them with terrorist acts.

<HEAD>Knife Emereges As Key Evidence In Women's Deaths</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The knife used in the 1987 slaying of a
prostitute is identical to the one found near the bodies of seven
women discovered weeks later on a hillside in a remote area, a
prosecutor said.
   Dayton Leroy Roger is serving a life sentence for the
prostitute's death and faces trial next month in the slayings of six
of the seven women. The seventh victim has not been identified.
   The prosecution disclosed Monday that the bodies of the seven
women were nude and that their legs and feet had been sawed off.
   Information about the knife and the condition of the bodies was
revealed at a Clackamas County Circuit Court hearing on pretrial
motions. Roger's trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 6.
   The seven young women, all known or suspected prostitutes, were
abducted, mutilated and stabbed to death and their bodies dumped in
a remote area near Molalla, about 30 miles southeast of Portland.
   Rogers, 35, was charged with six counts of aggravated murder.
   Deputy District Attorney Andrejs Eglitis said the knife was found
``a matter of feet'' from four of the victims. He characterized the
knife as ``identical in size and shape'' to one Rogers admitted
using to kill Jennifer Lisa Smith.
   Smith, a Portland prostitute, was tortured and stabbed to death
in a parking lot of a suburban Portland restaurant a few weeks
before the bodies were found near Molalla in August and September
1987.
   Rogers told jurors last year he killed Smith in self-defense, but
he was convicted of aggravated murder.
   Among the motions considered by Judge Raymond R. Bagley Jr. was a
defense request to suppress certain evidence, including the knife,
that Eglitis said would be important to his case.
   Eglitis said there were knife wounds in the bodies of some of the
Molalla victims that were consistent with the type of wound that
would be made by Rogers' knife.
   ``There is every reason to believe that knife is the one that
caused the wounds on the Molalla victim,'' Eglitis said.
   Rogers' attorney, Christopher Burris, argued that no human blood
or tissues were found on the knife and that it would be inflammatory
to introduce it as the probable murder weapon.
   Burris also argued against the introduction of bones from the
legs of the Molalla victims. The bones, he said, had ``tool marks''
showing they had been sawed from the bodies.
   Eglitis said the tool marks proved that the bones weren't severed
from the bodies by foraging animals.
   During the Smith trial, several former prostitutes testified that
Rogers has a foot fetish and was sexually fascinated with the arches
of women's feet.
   Burris also asked to supress a hacksaw taken from Rogers' small
engine repair shop. Eglitis said the saw could have been used to cut
the women's legs.
   The judge made no immediate rulings on the motions.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today but traders said the market appeared poised to test how high
central banks are willing to let the currency rise. Gold prices rose.
   Central banks in the United States, West Germany, Switzerland,
Austria and Canada all reportedly intervened in the market on Monday
to slow the dollar's climb.
   ``The intervention has run out of effect,'' said one trader in
Rome.
   ``Europe is clearly inclined to buy dollars for now and it is
waiting for the U.S. to open and see whether the Fed (U.S. Federal
Reserve) will intervene again,'' said another.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 125.70. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8253 West German marks, up from 1.8245
   _1.5580 Swiss francs, up from 1.5555
   _6.2190 French francs, down from 6.2300

   _1,338.50 Italian lire, down from 1,339.75
   _1.1995 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7695, slightly more
expensive for buyers than late Monday's $1.7650.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold of $405.50 a troy ounce at midmorning today, unchanged from the
opening bid but higher than $402.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $405.25, up from $402.75 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 5 cents to close at a bid
$407.23.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.96 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.94.

<TEXT>
   Experts today examined the flight
recorders and wreckage of a British jetliner to determine how the
brand-new Boeing 737 apparently lost use of both engines and
crashed, against 10-million-to-one odds, killing 44 people.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon said no evidence of sabotage
surfaced in the British Midland Airways disaster, but Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher would not rule it out. ``We rule out nothing _ we
simply can't,'' she said.
   Pilot Kevin Hunt crash-landed the Belfast-bound jet at the edge
of a major highway Sunday night, barely avoiding hitting the village
of Kegworth at the edge of East Midlands Airport.
   The badly injured flier was being hailed today for his skill.
   Investigators' work should be greatly assisted by Hunt and the 81
other survivors, many of whom are well enough to describe the
flight's last minutes as Hunt struggled to make an emergency landing.
   Police said 78 survivors remained hospitalized today, thirteen of
them in intensive care units.
   Survivor Dr. John McCrea said they had been on the plane for 10
or 12 minutes when ``I felt a shudder and I looked over at the left
wing,'' and saw flames. The pilot told them he had shut the engine
down and was diverting to East Midland.
   ``We went on flying for a further five minutes,'' McCrea said.
``The plane seemed to drop. ... We carried on two or three minutes
and there were more flashes over the left side.''
   Then the captain told passengers to prepare for an emergency
landing. ``It seemed like only five seconds later we were down,''
said McCrea.
   The plane crashed a half-mile short of the runway, plowing into a
grassy embankment at the edge of the M1 highway 100 miles north of
London.
   Hunt, 43, a 22-year veteran with the airline, was in poor
condition with spine and leg fractures, but hospital officials said
he spoke with his wife.
   Credit for the high survival rate was being given to Hunt's
flying, to airport firefighters who smothered the burning engine and
fuel-laden wings in foam within minutes, and to motorists who rushed
from cars to help.
   Mrs. Thatcher visited hospitalized survivors on Monday, talked
with relatives of those killed and went to the scene, where the
broken blue and white fuselage lay crumpled among trees.
   Last month she was in Lockerbie, Scotland, the village struck by
wreckage when a bomb blew apart a Pan Am jumbo jet on Dec. 21,
killing 270 people. She said she ``almost couldn't believe it'' when
she heard about the new crash.
   Channon, who also inspected the Kegworth scene, said, ``So far
the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is consistent with
the right engine having stopped before impact and there are also
signs of fire in the left engine.''
   Asked whether it was almost certain that both engines
malfunctioned, the transport minister replied: ``That certainly
looks probable at the moment.'' His department said results of tests
on the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder
were not expected for several days.
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Investigation Board, said the odds against a double engine failure
on a Boeing 737 were 10 million-to-1. He suggested a ``technical
mistake such as something incorrect being done to the engines during
turnaround (servicing between flights), either inadvertently or
deliberately.''
   Freddie Yetman, spokesman for the British Airline Pilots'
Association, said a double-engine failure was ``astonishing.''
   The Boeing 737-400 was 12 weeks old and had flown less than 500
hours, the airline said. Boeing said the two CFM-56 engines were
built in France by a consortium of General Electric Co. and the
French company SNECMA.
   A Northern Ireland Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, flew
to England to comfort the bereaved: ``It is very suspicious-looking
because this flight is used by servicemen.''
   Soldiers are targets of Irish guerrillas in Northern Ireland, but
they have never been known to attack civilian airliners.
   Authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland were
on the flight, and four were killed along with at least two Northern
Ireland police officers.

<TEXT>
   Police believe they have one of the
U.S.-Mexico border's most notorious drug traffickers behind bars,
and they want to keep him there this time.
   Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero was arrested on drug charges Monday at
a house in Juarez, said Esteban Garcia Villalon, coordinator of the
Mexican federal judicial police's anti-drug campaign in Chihuahua
state.
   It marked Ontiveros' second arrest on drug-trafficking charges in
less than three years. He was jailed in April 1986, but a Juarez
federal judge dropped all the charges last May and set Ontiveros
free.
   About 45 to 50 federal police officers began searching for
Ontiveros on Dec. 29 after police found nearly eight tons of
marijuana in warehouses in south Juarez. Officials believe Ontiveros
was planning to smuggle the Mexican marijuana into the United States.
   Juarez is across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas.
   Ontiveros is believed to smuggle marijuana by the ton and cocaine
in loads of hundreds of pounds each, said Phil Jordan, district
director of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Dallas.
   ``They don't come any bigger than Ontiveros along the
U.S.-Mexican border in terms of tonnage of narcotics smuggled into
the U.S.,'' Jordan said.
   Ontiveros is one of the DEA's most-wanted men, and a warrant was
issued for his arrest in the United States in December 1986.
Extradition to the United States, however, is unlikely because of
the charges Ontiveros faces in Mexico.
   Police seized two AK-47 assault rifles and three pistols, all
loaded, during their search of the house where Ontiveros was
arrested, Garcia said.
   A few hours later they seized a Cessna Conquest airplane at the
Juarez airport and arrested two pilots from the Gulf port of
Tampico, Garcia said, adding the pilots had been hired to fly
Ontiveros to Mexico City.

<HEAD>Cuban Family Stranded In Canada After Niagara Falls Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christmas Eve trip to Niagara
Falls is keeping a Cuban family from returning to the United States
until they can prove they have refugee status to live there.
   Carlos Fajardo Hernandez claims to have refugee status in the
United States and says he owns a home in Miami, but U.S. immigration
officials will not let the family into the country without
documentation.
   ``They have nothing to support their claim of being refugees,''
said Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Buffalo.
   Hernandez, his wife and two children have been forced to stay in
a motel in Niagara Falls for the past two weeks.
   ``The kids wanted to see the Christmas lights,'' Hernandez said
from his hotel room Monday night, explaining the family's visit to
the Canadian side at Niagara Falls.
   Ferro said immigration officials in Buffalo and Miami were
searching for information on the family. He said the family may have
been living in the U.S. illegally.
   Hernandez said he has a Florida driver's license and an
immigration document he described as a work permit.
   Hernandez; his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers; children Yoandys
Diaz-Zamora, 12, and Yordalys Diaz-Zamora, 9, have received
assistance from a Canadian refugee organization.
   Sister Kathleen Rimar, an immigration lawyer with the
organization, said she's asked U.S. officials to allow the family to
return ``because of humanitarian concerns.''
   ``I don't know what will happen to them if they aren't allow back
into the U.S.,'' Sister Rimar said.
   The family has no legal status in Canada.

   State corrections officials are being
deluged with requests to visit soul singer James Brown in prison.
But, like the busload of fans who showed up at the prison a week
ago, most have been turned away.
   ``It's not like a hospital, and it's not like some social camp,''
said Department of Corrections spokesman Francis Archibald.
   Brown, 55, is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault
and failing to stop for police during a wild, two-state chase last
September.
   Archibald said although dozens of news organizations have asked
to interview Brown since he entered prison Dec. 16, ``We are not
facilitating any interviews at this time.''
   Any reporters wishing to speak with Brown must write him a letter
asking him to call them collect, Archibald said. Brown, who works in
the kitchen of the 275-inmate, minimum-security State Park
Correctional Center near Columbia, is allowed to use the pay phones
in his dormitory whenever he isn't on the job.
   Inmates at the prison can have visitors on Saturdays and Sundays,
but they either must be family members or have their names included
on a list of no more than six people submitted by the inmate.
   Ministers can visit at other times, if they show prison officials
their credentials. ``There have been a couple of people who saw him
in their capacity as ministers,'' Archibald said.

<HEAD>Police Question Havel, Charter 77 Spokeswoman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in Czechoslovakia questioned banned
playwright and human rights activist Vaclav Havel about an anonymous
threat of self-immolation at an anti-government rally planned for
Sunday, he said today.
   Czechoslovak authorities banned the weekend rally and the
Communist Party's chief ideologist warned Monday of threats to
Communist rule. Party leaders are facing growing calls for economic
and political reforms.
   Havel, who has frequently been harassed by authorities, said by
telephone from Prague that he was questioned for about two hours
Monday after he received an anonymous letter from an unknown
``Committee for Collective Suicide.''
   The letter contained a threat to emulate the suicide of student
Jan Palach on Prague's Wenceslas Square 20 years ago.
   Sunday's rally intends to commemorate Palach's deed. He burned
himself to protest the Soviet-led invasion a year earlier that
quashed a broad-based reform movement supported by then-Communist
leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Human rights activists say the rally will go on despite the ban.
   Havel taped an appeal that was broadcast by the Czech-language
services of Western radio stations Monday night urging the anonymous
committee not to go ahead with the action.
   He said police would today question Dana Nemcova, a spokeswoman
for the Charter 77 humanr rights group, who received an identical
letter, Havel said.
   Palach set himself ablaze Jan. 16, 1969 and died three days
later. Thousands of Czechoslovaks, shocked and moved by his protest,
attended his funeral.
   Havel said representatives of Charter 77 and four other groups
who have called the rally were to meet today with authorities to
discuss the event.
   On Jan. 21, the same five groups plan to hold a vigil at Palach's
grave in his home village of Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague.
   Palach's body was secretly exhumed from a Prague cemetery and
reburied in Vsetaty in 1973.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today he
remains ``as opposed to abortion as ever'' but that a study by his
office cannot prove whether having an abortion affects a woman's
mental and physical health.
   The surgeon general, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said a full scientific study should be done ``that will
settle the question once and for all.''
   On Monday, Koop sent a letter to President Reagan declining to
issue a report on a study of the effects of abortion on women.
   ``I remain as opposed to abortion as ever, but I've always been
able to separate my personal beliefs from my responsibilities as
surgeon general,'' Koop said in the interview today.
   ``The focus of the various groups that are pro-life has been on a
post-abortion syndrome, and they would like to be able to prove that
that is a specific thing, and I can't prove that for them except by
anecdotes,'' he said.
   ``If you take the whole abortion issue ... at one end there are
people who are so relieved to be rid of their pregnancy that they
consider it a positive health benefit,'' the surgeon general said.
``At the other end there are people who are really psychologically
upset ... I have dealt with women at both ends of the scale.''
   Koop's letter declining to issue the report came on the same day
the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal that could to reverse or
narrow the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortions nationwide.
Koop noted that reversal of the decision has long been a goal of
Reagan and the president's advisers.
   ``At the time the report was requested, there were those advising
you and intimately involved with the social issues of abortion who
truly believed that such a report could be put together readily,''
Koop said.
   ``In the minds of some of them, it was a foregone conclusion that
the negative health effects of abortion on women were so
overwhelming that the evidence would force the reversal,'' he said.
   Koop said almost 250 studies about the psychological effects of
abortion are under way. He said the Public Health System he heads
looked at the most significant of those studies but found flaws in
the methodology.
   The studies' data ``do not support the premise that abortion does
or does not cause or contribute to psychological problems,'' Koop
said.
   Some physical problems can result from abortion, such as
infertility or damage to the cervix, but they also occur in women
who don't have abortions and there has never been any scientific
attempt to track the physical effects, he said.
   An effective study would cost at least $10 million a year over
the next five years, Koop told Reagan.

   Attackers wielding knives,
clubs and shotguns killed five men outside the Indian Ocean port
city of Durban, police said today.
   Another group of blacks tossed firebombs and raided a home
outside the city of Pietermaritzburg, stabbing to death a
17-year-old woman and injuring a 20-year-old woman, police said.
   Both black-on-black attacks occurred in Natal province, where
more than 1,000 blacks have been killed in faction fighting in the
past 18 months.
   The sketchy police unrest report, which covers incidents from the
previous 24 hours, did not release any additional details.
   The main combatants in the faction fighting are Inkatha, a
political organization headed by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
and the United Democratic Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheid
coalition. The front was banned in February.
   Buthelezi also opposes apartheid, but many United Democratic
Front supporters view him as too conservative because he
participates in the government's homeland system and refuses to
endorse confrontational tactics such as economic sanctions, boycotts
and protests.
   Buthelezi accuses the front of supporting the bombing and
sabotage campaign waged by the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate schools and districts.

   Reversal of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision
legalizing abortion would touch off political chaos and social
upheaval across the country, an abortion-rights leader said today.
   The justices said Monday they will study a federal appeals court
ruling that struck down key provisions of a Missouri law regulating
abortions.
   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve
the Missouri controversy without disturbing the 1973 decision. But
Missouri officials and Justice Department lawyers are urging the
justices to use the case to overturn the landmakr Roe vs. Wade
ruling.
   A reversal of that ruling would ``create political chaos and
social upheaval across this country,'' Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said on
``CBS This Morning.''
   ``There would be firestorms all across this country on the
question of abortion,'' she said. ``... We will mobilize this
country the likes of which you have not seen in a long, long time.
This country, women and men alike, will never accept going back to
the day when women have to risk their lives, their health, their
families' lives in order to seek an abortion.''
   William Bradford Reynolds, who as an assistant attorney general
pushed for a review of Roe vs. Wade, said on the CBS program that
``there is certainly good reason for optimism that the court is
going to differ with the lower court as far as some of the
strictions that have been placed in the Missouri statute on
abortion.''
   He added that he hopes ``it would go further and entertain the
whole question of Roe vs. Wade and reconsider it, and I would hope
that if it did that, it would come to a result that is
constitutionally sound and that we could correct the error that was
made some years ago in this area,'' he said.
   Reynolds maintained that the 1973 decision ``does not stand on
very firm constitutional footing.''
   ``Women's lives are literally on the line'' if the court reverses
its most famous abortion ruling, said Eleanor Smeal, president of
the Fund for the Feminist Majority.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
added: ``We are now declaring a state of emergency for the women of
America.''
   Yard, speculating on a ``worst-case scenario,'' said, ``Women
will not accept an overturn. We will not go back to illegal
abortions. It's going to be like Prohibition. We aren't going to
obey the law.''
   Judith Sewderowitz, executive director of the Center for
Population Options, said her organization is ``deeply concerned that
the court may be preparing to repeal the right to abortion.''
   ``For adult women, retreat from the principles of Roe would be a
major setback,'' she said. ``For adolescents _ for whom too-early
childbearing poses the threat of physical and emotional harm _
retreat from Roe would be a disaster.''
   Eve Paul of Planned Parenthood said, ``We can't predict what the
Supreme Court will do but abortion has become a safe, legal
procedure which millions of women have had.''
   Mark Chopko, a lawyer for the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said he was ``cautiously optimistic that today's
development signals the beginning of the court's reconsideration of
Roe vs. Wade.''
   Samuel Lee of the anti-abortion Missouri Citizens for Life,
called the case acted on Monday ``our best shot in a number of years
to undo Roe, really our best shot since 1973 because of changes on
the court.''
   The court is viewed as deeply divided on abortion.
   Although Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or
greatly modify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping to
attract five votes for such a result.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
dissented from the 1973 ruling and from several subsequent abortion
decisions.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned the
court's reasoning in its 1973 decision.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortion
decision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in
1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,
likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views on
abortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in any
significant detail.
   ``We don't know what Kennedy is going to do,'' said the Missouri
anti-abortion group's Lee, ``but I'm more optimistic about him than
Planned Parenthood is.''
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July struck down,
among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these five
provisions:
   _A ban on using public hospitals and other facilities for
abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting in an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus believed to
be older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb by
testing for weight and lung capacity.
   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''
   Missouri Attorney General William L. Webster, in seeking Supreme
Court review, said the 1973 decision ``should itself be
reconsidered'' if it cannot be squared with the disputed Missouri
law.
   Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's civil rights
division, wrote to Missouri officials last summer urging them to
include a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's appeal.
   And in a brief filed two days after the presidential election
Nov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.
   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have a
constitutional right to abortion, based on the right of privacy. The
court most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983, but the court's
membership has changed since then.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw, as it tried to do
in a 1988 law, all sexually explicit telephone dial-up message
services, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''
   _Let stand, over two dissenting votes, a lower court ruling in an
Alabama case that allows criminal defendants to exclude potential
jurors because of their race.
   _Refused to let the federal government permit Japanese salmon
fishermen off the Alaska coast to use huge nets in which porpoise
and other marine mammals become trapped.

<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson has issued a
disaster declaration for four southeastern Illinois counties that
bore the brunt of damage from a tornado that tore through parts of
three states.
   In issuing the declaration Monday, the governor estimated damage
to a four-county area of Illinois at between $10 million and $15
million.
   The twister hit the towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and Allendale
late Saturday afternoon, destroying more than one-third of
Allendale, a town of 600 people near the Indiana border, and leaving
about 300 people homeless.
   It then moved into Indiana, touching down near Vincennes, and cut
a two-mile path through the southern Kentucky community of Franklin.
   No deaths were reported, although 50 people were injured in
Illinois and three in Indiana. Five people in Indiana remained
hospitalized in serious condition Monday.
   Thompson's declaration covered Edwards, Wabash, Wayne and White
counties. But the governor said he did not know whether the counties
qualified for a federal disaster declaration because the damage was
not spread over a large geographic area.
   The Illinois declaration allows local residents to seek property
tax reassessment and to apply for federal assistance.
   In Wabash County, which includes Allendale, the cleanup effort
continued Monday as bulldozers and farm tractors helped clear
debris. About 75 Illinois National Guard personnel and volunteers
from surrounding communities pitched in, and sunny skies aided the
recovery effort.
   ``Things are progressing very well,'' said Sheriff Randy Grounds.
   Grounds said partial water and gas service was available Monday,
but the area remained without electricity and telephone service was
unreliable. Officials set a 5 p.m. curfew to prevent looting.
   Local residents were trying to get over the shock of their
losses, Grounds said.
   ``I think spiritually, they're up,'' he said. ``They're thankful
they have a life.''

<HEAD>Murders In LA Down, But Gang Violence Up In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of murders hit a 10-year low in Los
Angeles last year, but the decline was overshadowed by a sharp rise
in gang-related killings, police said.
   Murders in the nation's second-largest city fell to 734 in 1988,
down from 832 in 1987 and the lowest since 1978, when there were 678
homicides, according to statistics released Monday.
   Gang-related killings escalated to 257 last year from 205 in
1987, while overall gang-related crimes rose to 5,371 from 5,129 the
year before.
   The Sheriff's Department also reported that gang-related slayings
in unincorporated areas of the county rose to 96 last year from 79
in 1987. The department has not completed overall homicide totals
yet.
   Police Cmdr. William Booth attributed the jump to a sharp rise in
the number of gang members. Last year, investigators listed nearly
28,000 known gang members compared with just 15,000 the year before.
   Booth credited the drop in murders overall to the addition of 900
extra street cops provided by extra overtime funds and a greater
willingness by officers to make arrests in domestic disputes.
   The Los Angeles murder rate of 22.9 killings for every 100,000
residents runs lower than that of many other large cities, Booth
said.
   Washington, D.C., lists 59.2 murders per 100,000 persons, the
highest in the country, followed by Detroit with 58 murders per
100,000 and Dallas with 56.7.
   ``In my own view,'' Booth said, ``Los Angeles is what it has been
all along, one of the safest major cities in the United States.''

   The body of Pan Am Flight 103 victim Karen
Hunt has been identified as the one mistakenly shipped to a family
in Masschusetts, and the Massachusetts family is convinced the body
sent to Rochester is their daughter's.
   The fathers of Karen Hunt of Webster and Mary L. Johnson of
Wayland, Mass., also a victim of the crash, said Monday that
officials from the FBI and Scotland Yard have told them the two
women's bodies were flown to each other's hometown by mistake.
   ``Karen has definitely been identified,'' said Robert Hunt.
``We're extremely relieved. Hopefully, as soon as we get Karen back,
we can put this episode to rest.''
   Ms. Hunt's body is at the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center in Worcester; Ms. Johnson's is at the Monroe County medical
examiner's office. Each father said he hopes to receive the correct
body shortly.
   ``We're satisfied that she's our daughter,'' Johnson said. ``We
have no feelings at all of anger and bitterness about this. ... It's
one of those simple mistakes that can be made. It seems terrible at
the time, but it's not a big mistake.''
   The two women were among the 259 passengers and crew killed in
the Dec. 21 crash over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Ms. Hunt, who would have turned 21 Saturday, was one of 35
Syracuse University students participating in a study abroad program
who were killed in the crash. Ms. Johnson, 25, had been overseas 14
months when she boarded the plane in London.
   Officials in Rochester determined over the weekend that the body
sent there for burial was not Ms. Hunt's.
   The body reported to be Ms. Hunt's arrived Thursday in Rochester.
But Hunt had become concerned that it was not his daughter two days
earlier when Scottish authorities gave Ms. Hunt's aunt, Judy
Charest, a description in London of the clothing on the body.
   The description included slacks and a blouse unfamiliar to the
family and Ms. Hunt's three London roommates. Also on the body were
a scarf, silver bracelet and ring, items her family said Ms. Hunt
never wore.
   The Johnson family was an hour from burying Ms. Hunt's body in
North Cemetery in Wayland on Sunday when FBI agents arrived at their
home to tell them it was not the body of their daughter.
   How the mix-up occurred was not immediately explained.
   Gregory Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said Scottish
authorities recovering bodies from the crash apparently identified
the bodies of Ms. Hunt and Ms. Johnson correctly but flew the
caskets to the wrong cities.

   A Palestinian who had allegedly cooperated with
Israeli authorities was shot and killed by fellow Arabs in the West
Bank, and four other Arabs were reported shot and wounded today in
clashes with Israeli troops.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said for the first time that he
would accept a U.N. role in peace talks with Palestinians, but he
insisted only direct talks between Israel and its Arab enemies could
bring peace.
   Speaking to visiting European Parliament officials, Shamir also
denied reports that a new Israeli peace plan had been submitted to
U.S. officials in Paris this week.
   Arab reports said Palestinians collaborating with Israeli
authorities killed 27-year-old Kayed Muhammad Tmaizi on Monday in
the village of Idna because he had stopped collaborating.
   Tmaizi suffered three gunshot wounds and died en route to a
hospital in nearby Hebron, Arab reports said.
   Family members told an Arab reporter that Tmaizi was under
increasing pressure from security forces to renew his role as an
informant. They said he stopped cooperating with Israeli officials
when the Arab uprising started 13 months ago.
   Tmaizi's relatives saw the assailants flee and take refuge in the
home of another Idna man who is known as a collaborator, the Arab
reporter said. They said the attackers were later picked up by cars
with Israeli license plates.
   The army clamped a curfew on Idna and took Tmaizi's body from a
hospital in nearby Hebron to determine the cause of death, a
military official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a
shooting death occurred and said security forces had nothing to do
with it.
   ``It was apparently an argument between families in the
village,'' said the official. ``The army denies any connection
betweeen the military and the shooting of this man.''
   The slaying followed a series of attacks on suspected
collaborators after a new leaflet issued by PLO-backed underground
leaders called for attacks on Palestinians who work for Israeli
authorities.
   Two alleged collaborators were killed and two others wounded in
the past week.
   Tmaizi's death raised to 349 the number of Palestinians killed
since the start of the uprising against Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have been killed.
   The army lifted curfews today from four refugee camps in the Gaza
Strip as Palestinian merchants opened stores following general
strikes that paralyzed the occupied lands Sunday and Monday. The
strikes have been a constant feature of the uprising.
   Three Palestinians were shot and wounded in the Gaza Strip and
one was wounded in a clash with troops in the West Bank town of
Ramallah, Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   Shamir told the European deputies today he would accept a role in
the peace process for the United Nations or the superpowers
``providing they refrain from any involvement in the substance of
the talks.''
   The right-wing prime minister previously had rejected any U.N.
involvement, claiming the world body was biased against Israel.
   Shamir denied a report in the new English-language daily The
Nation that Foreign Minister Moshe Arens submitted a new Israeli
peace plan to U.S. officials in Paris. He said Israel has not yet
formulated its peace proposals.
   ``There are some ideas, but nobody should speak now of a formal
peace plan laid down by the Israeli government,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pathologist Says Any Adult Could Have Killed Lisa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical pathologist, testifying for the defense
in the child abuse and murder trial of Joel Steinberg, said it
didn't appear that 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg was hit with full force
by a man Steinberg's size.
   Dr. John Plunkett of St. Paul, Minn., testified Monday that
Lisa's fatal injuries would have been more extensive if she had been
hit forcefully in the jaw and head by a man as large as Steinberg,
who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.
   ``I would expect her jaw to be shattered,'' Plunkett said,
observing that Lisa's jaw was small and fragile and she still had
her baby teeth.
   The prosecution contends that Lisa was killed by blows from
Steinberg, and a medical expert for the prosecution had previously
said those blows had the force of a fall from a third-floor window.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree
murder in the girl's beating death. Steinberg obtained Lisa
illegally from an unwed Long Island teen-ager, and he and his
companion Hedda Nussbaum raised her as their own.
   Lisa was removed unconscious from their apartment Nov. 2, 1987.
She was hospitalized and died of a brain hemorrhage three days later.
   Steinberg has told police he did not hit the child, and his
lawyers are suggesting that Ms. Nussbaum could have struck the fatal
blow.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book author and editor,
testified that Steinberg told her he hit Lisa the night she was
fatally injured. Ms. Nussbaum was initially charged along with
Steinberg, but the charges were later dropped after prosecutors
concluded that Steinberg had abused Ms. Nussbaum so severely she
couldn't have acted to save Lisa. She became a prosecution witness.
   In his testimony, Plunkett said he believed small bruises on
Lisa's left jaw and right forehead and an injury to the back of her
head were caused when she was vigorously shaken and thrown against a
wall.
   These ``injuries could have been inflicted by any adult'' strong
enough to pick up a 43-pound child, he said.

<TEXT>
   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas,
trapped in a mountain enclave in south Lebanon, today fought off a
tank-led assault by pro-Syrian rivals who outnumbered them
two-to-one, police reported.
   A police official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
Syrian-backed Amal militia stormed positions held by the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the village of Jbaa.
   The 1,000 Amal militiamen, spearheaded by Soviet-designed T-54
battle tanks, launched their assault after two days of savage
fighting for control of the predominantly Shiite region near
Israel's self-designated ``security zone,'' along Lebanon's southern
border.
   Police said the estimated 500 Hezbollah fighters, cornered in a
mountain enclave after being driven out of several strategic
villages Monday, later counterattacked and pushed Amal out of the
hilltop village.
   Amal ``is currently launching another attack,'' the spokesman
said.
   Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of the port city of Sidon, is a key part
of the Hezbollah-held sector.
   Abu Hussein, an Amal commander in Sidon, said the battle would be
a fight to the finish.
   ``There will be no cease-fire,'' he told reporters. ``It's either
us or them. The attack will not come to an end until we finish
Hezbollah in the whole of south Lebanon.''
   Police had no word of casualties in today's fighting. But at
nightfall Monday, they reported that at least 105 people had been
killed and 300 wounded since early Sunday.
   Nearly 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded in fighting
between the Shiite factions since Dec. 31, when the latest round in
a 9-month-old battle for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites
broke out.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Amal now controls most of the Iklim Tiffah, or
Apple Province, in the south.
   Amal fighters on Monday dislodged Hezbollah from a several
villages east of Sidon, which the fundamentalists had seized on
Sunday.
   The police spokesman said Hezbollah gunmen ``stabbed to death
several civilians and Amal militiamen. Some of the victims were
found with their throats cut and other with their heads chopped
off.''
   The Hezbollah fighters were sandwiched in a narrow, 9-square-mile
strip between the advancing Amal force and the western flank of
Israel's self-designated security zone, cut off from reinforcements
and supplies, police reported.
   The fundamentalists, who seek to create an Iranian-style Islamic
republic in Lebanon, were dug in around Jbaa, the nearby hamlets of
Ein Bouswar and Louwiazah and the wooded slopes of Jabal Safi.
   Sheik Kamel Wehbeh, Jbaa's imam, or preacher, said the region's
predominantly Shiite population ``does not want Hezbollah, which
commits massacres, kills prisoners and destroys villages.''
   Police said about 15,000 civilians had fled their villages
because of the fighting and taken refuge in Amal-controlled regions.
   The fighting raged despite intensified efforts by Iran and Syria
to rein in their militias.
   Iran's first deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, was
in the Syrian capital of Damascus seeking to mediate a cease-fire.
Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was
expected in Beirut today.
   Amal's Abu Hussein said his men were ``determined to finish
Hezbollah in the south, even if Besharati tries to work out a
settlement.''
   Amal rejects an Islamic government and advocates a government in
which Moslems have an equal share of power with Lebanon's
traditionally dominant Christians. It drove Hezbollah out of most of
south Lebanon in a four-day battle last April. A month later,
Hezbollah retaliated and stormed Amal territory in Beirut's southern
slums, a Shiite stronghold.
   More than 350 people were killed and 1,150 wounded in those
clashes.
   Syria sent in its army to quell the fighting. But the violence
erupted again in November, spilling over into west Beirut. Forty
people were killed and 87 wounded in six days of street battles.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces and Moslem sectors of
Beirut.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a 19-year-old Marine on a training
mission in California was the result of ``misfeasance'' and a
breakdown in leadership, according to a Marine Corps investigation.
   Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother of Minneapolis probably died 24 hours
before the Marines began searching for him in the California Mojave
Desert last August, the report said. Rother was reported missing 40
hours after he was last seen, and his skeletal remains were found
Dec. 4 _ three months and three major searches later.
   ``The American people ... will not _ nor should they _ accept our
maiming and killing their sons and daughters in so-called training
`accidents.' Neither will I!'' wrote Marine Commandant Gen. Alfred
M. Gray in endorsing the investigative findings.
   ``Rother's death was not an accident ... (but was the result of)
misfeasance,'' Gray wrote.
   Rother had been posted alone as a nighttime guide on Aug. 30 for
trucks that were to carry Marines to a major training exercise.
   No one noticed that Rother didn't climb aboard any of the trucks
as they passed, and the next day platoon sergeants issued an ``all
present'' even though he hadn't been seen, the report said.
Colleagues finally noticed he was missing in late afternoon on Aug.
31, the report said.
   The investigation recommended disciplinary action against a
lieutenant colonel and a major in charge of the training exercise
and against squad, company and platoon leaders involved in the
incident.
   A recommendation is expected this week at Camp Lejeune, N.C., on
whether Lt. Allen Lawson, who was in charge of posting road guides
at the time, should face court-martial, administrative action or if
charges should be dropped. Lawson is accused of dereliction of duty
and willful disobedience of an order to post the road guides in
pairs and to provide a logistics officer with a list of Marines
assigned as road guides.

<HEAD>Striking Workers, Students Demand Ouster of Local Communists Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand striking workers and
university students demonstrated today in Montenegro's provincial
capital, Titograd, to demand the ouster of local communist leaders,
Tanjug state news agency said.
   About 10,000 demonstrators gave the entire Communist Party
leadership of southern Montenegro ``a two-hour ultimatum'' to
resign, ``or they will break into the republic's parliament building
by force,'' state television reported. Police violently broke up a
similar Titograd protest in October.
   Tanjug said flag-waving protesters ``in a crowd which was
constantly growing'' gathered this morning in front of Montenegro's
Parliament building chanting ``We want resignations!'' and ``The
people are hungry!''
   They also demanded Montenegrin leaders take responsibility for
police force used to halt Oct. 7-8 demonstrations.
   ``Who dares to beat the workers!'' Tanjug said the crowd chanted.
   Police injured at least 10 people when they fired tear gas and
wielded rubber truncheons to disperse crowds in the October
disturbance. It triggered one of the worst political crises in
postwar Yugoslavia.
   Yugoslavia is facing its worse social and economic crisis in
history, with annual inflation hovering at about 250 percent and
unemployment at 15 percent.
   Last year, 388,000 workers staged a record 1,720 strikes,
officials said. Montenegro, one of the country's most underdeveloped
regions, has been particularly hard-hit, with thousands of workers
losing jobs through closures of money-losing enterprises.
   As in October, today's demonstration was led by workers of the
Radoje Dakic machine tool factory who went on strike to demand the
resignations.
   Montenegro's government, which is chiefly responsible for
economic matters, gave in to the protesters last year and resigned.
However, the communist leadership in charge of formulating policies
did not.

   West Germany said today it has
charged a Polish-born West German resident with spying for Poland
for nearly 40 years.
   Charges against Jerzy Edward Romanowski, 64, say he first agreed
to spy for Poland in 1948, received intelligence training in 1952,
and slipped into West Germany in 1953.
   The federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said in a statement
it will show that from 1953, Romanowski provided the Polish
intelligence service with sketches and descriptions of civil and
military facilities and information on naval fleet movements in the
Baltic Sea.
   Over the years, Romanowski lived in several northern West German
towns before moving to Hamburg, and he made regular contact with his
Polish intelligence counterpart in East Berlin, Vienna, and towns in
Yugoslavia, Greece and Scandinavia, the statement charges.
   Romanowski was arrested in July and is awaiting trial at a jail
in Hamburg.

<HEAD>Soviet Troop Pullout Reportedly To Begin Within Weeks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz was
quoted as saying today that Soviet troops will begin withdrawing
from his country within weeks.
   The state news agency MTI quoted Grosz as telling the Japanese
newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun the pullout ``is to commence within
weeks.'' No date was given for the start of the pullout.
   The pullout was believed to be the first announced in connection
with a speech by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 7.
Gorbachev said in the speech at the United Nations that the Soviet
Union would withdraw about 50,000 troops from Hungary, East Germany
and Czechoslovakia over the next two years.
   Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Ferenc Karpati said in an interview
with Hungarian television that preparations for withdrawal of
``major military units,'' including an armored division, were
nearing completion.
   The Soviet Union has about 62,000 troops stationed in Hungary,
according to the Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag.
   ``The withdrawal covers major military units, including an
armored division, which is a major proportion of the armored units
stationed in Hungary,'' Karpati said.
   He said other airborne units also would be withdrawn. Most of the
Soviet trooops going home are stationed in western Hungary, he said.
   Asked whether there might one day be a full pullout of Soviet
troops, Karpati said that question should be discussed at
forthcoming East-West talks in Vienna on reducing conventional
forces in Europe.
   The 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations have virtually
completed a mandate for those new talks to begin, possibly as early
as next month.
   Karpati also said he hoped the Hungarian army could be trimmed
and defense spending curbed.
   Asked about a possible new law allowing alternative military
service, Karpati said this is ``on the agenda of action to be taken
in the first half of this year.''
   Poland is currently the only Soviet bloc country which allows an
alternative to compulsory service in the armed forces.

<HEAD>Washington Beach Cleanup Proceeds as Canadians Fear for Otters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SHORES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms have continued to push an oil
spill from Washington state into British Columbia, prompting calls
by the Canadian government for compensation.
   Acting Canadian Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said
meetings with U.S. officials to discuss compensation were planned
today in Washington, D.C.
   ``We will explore all possible avenues of compensation for
affected parties, including native communities whose source of food
and income have been jeopardized,'' Bouchard said.
   ``It is an acceptable principle that the polluter make
reparations,'' he added. ``It is commendable that the American firm
fully and quickly accepted its responsibility.''
   As many as 231,000 gallons of bunker oil are believed to have
spilled Dec. 22 when a tug ran into a barge it was towing in heavy
seas off Grays Harbor, Wash.
   Oil has come ashore as far south as Newport, Ore., but the worst
damage has been to wilderness beaches in Olympic National Park on
Washington's northern coast and to the west coast of Vancouver
Island, including parts of Canada's Pacific Rim National Park.
   Officials of Sause Bros. Ocean Towing Co. of Coos Bay, Ore.,
owner of the tug and barge, have said the company would pay for
cleanup in both countries.
   The most recently affected shoreline is near Nootka Sound on
Vancouver Island, about 160 miles north of Grays Harbor.
   Bouchard toured the area Monday with his British Columbia
counterpart, Bruce Strachan, and Canadian Fisheries Minister Tom
Siddon. They met later with local and federal officials, Indian
leaders and cleanup volunteers.
   In Washington state, stormy weather and high tides in recent days
have removed oil from some beaches and redeposited it on beaches
farther north, officials said.
   ``This rough weather is definitely causing some movement of the
oil,'' said Ron Holcomb, of the state Department of Ecology. ``We're
keeping an eye on the effect of that.''
   The weather was rainy and windy Monday for the third straight
day, with only a slight easing of conditions expected through
Wednesday.
   ``I can't tell you how long it's going to take to get all of (the
oil),'' Holcomb added.
   Susan Ewing, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Wildlife,
said crews hoped to finish cleaning Washington's southern beaches
within a few days.
   ``The crews are not being pulled out from the southern areas but
are making really good progress toward finishing it off,'' she said.
   Bird-cleaning operations will continue for at least a couple of
more weeks, she said.
   Ms. Ewing said 62 birds were cleaned Monday, with a backlog of
more than 1,300 awaiting a scrub. Only 12 live birds were brought to
the center Monday, while 111 were found dead on the beaches.
   About 4,950 birds are known to have died on the Washington coast,
the most from any oil spill in state history. An additional 1,000
birds have been found dead in British Columbia.

   A former transit system manager who said he
resented co-workers who earned more than his $69,000 salary has been
sentenced to five years in prison for accepting kickbacks on
maintenance contracts.
   Arnold J. Flores, 45, also was fined $40,000, ordered to repay
more than $16,000 to the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, and
sentenced to five years on probation after his prison term.
   Last September, Flores, of El Sobrante, pleaded guilty to
accepting about $16,400 in kickbacks over three years. The money was
paid by undercover FBI agents who posed as contractors.
   Flores, who resigned from his $69,000-a-year job as a BART
maintenance manager last summer, told U.S. District Judge Marilyn
Hall Patel that he took kickbacks out of revenge for receiving less
pay than other BART managers.
   ``I am ashamed of what I've done,'' Flores said. ``I've hurt
myself, my family and my community.''
   Patel however, told Flores their was no justification for his
actions.
   Prosecutor Charles Burch said Flores' claims of being underpaid
were unfounded.

<TEXT>
   A 71-year-old woman has vowed she will not
be moved from a ramshackle homestead she has lived in for nearly two
decades after her nearby home was razed to make way for a state park.
   The state finally wants to develop the 300-acre park on the shore
of Long Island Sound, but Doris Gagnon ignored a Monday deadline for
leaving the property where she lives in a camper and shacks that sit
among tall marsh grass about 100 feet from the shore.
   ``I'd like to see it a park, but I don't want to have suffered in
vain,'' Gagnon said, arguing that she deserves millions of dollars
in compensation for her ordeal. ``I want to show they can't do this
to an American citizen.''
   The state will begin eviction proceedings once officials in
Milford verify that Gagnon is not leaving, Assistant Attorney
General Grace Dodier said Monday. The process is expected to take up
to two months, officials said.
   Authorities served notice Nov. 28 that they wanted her out of
Silver Sands State Park. They gave her until Monday to leave, even
though the law required only eight days' notice, Dodier said.
   ``As much as we can empathize with her, the woman has no legal
right to be there,'' said Wanda Rickerby, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Environmental Protection, which plans to develop the
park property.
   The Milford health department filed a complaint with the state
after an inspection discovered bags of human sewage piled up behind
Gagnon's living quarters, said Charles Motes, chief of environmental
health.
   ``We all feel she would be better off elsewhere,'' Rickerby said.
   But Gagnon is adamant about staying.
   ``I'm not leaving, not until I get justice,'' she said.
   Chicken-wire fencing surrounds her property, which is also home
to five cats, three dogs, and about 50 chickens, geese and ducks.
   Gagnon said she has propane gas to heat her dilapidated 18-foot
camper, and that friends bring her water and let her shower at their
homes. She said she also has an electric generator.
   ``People are very good to me,'' she said, adding that she is able
to survive on Social Security payments.
   Gagnon's battle with the state began in the mid-1960s when
officials bought and demolished about 100 cottages to expand and
develop the fledgling park. Gagnon refused to sell, but a judge in
May 1969 ruled the state would be able to take her property through
eminent domain. Her beachfront cottage was demolished in 1971.
   Gagnon said she refused to accept a $15,000 payment for the
property. The money was disbursed by the state to satisfy two liens
in 1974, according to state records.
   Part of the beach at the park is used during the summer, but
there are still no permanent facilities at Silver Sands. Funding and
environmental problems held up development of the park, and it won't
be completed for at least three years, officials said.

   Militants threw bombs and opened fire

   Police blamed the militant Sinhalese People's Liberation Front
for the attack at Waduwa, 20 miles south of the capital, Colombo.
   The victims were identified as Indrapala Abeyweera, secretary of
the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and Wijeyalal Mendis, also a candidate
for the Feb. 15 polls. The third victim was a bodyguard identified
by police only as Martin.
   The killings came in the wake of a statement by President
Ranasinghe Premadasa saying he would allow emergency rule to lapse
next week.
   ``We have lived under emergency rule for now more than five
years. I feel that is enough for everybody,'' Premadasa told a group
of high-ranking government officials and lawmakers while outlining
an ambitious program to eliminate proverty on this Indian Ocean
island.
   The state of emergency, which expires Sunday, was imposed in May
1983 to curb violence between the Buddhist Sinhalese majority and
the predominantly Hindu Tamils. It has been extended by Parliament
every month since then.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people, claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government. Militant
Tamils have been fighting six years for an independent nation, and
more than 8,500 people have died.
   The People's Liberation Front opposes an accord the government
signed that was aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency and vowed to
kill anyone who supported the government.
   The state of emergency gave police and soldiers broad powers to
arrest and detain a person for up to 90 days without charges,
dispose of bodies without inquests and raid homes without search
warrants.
   Premadasa said everyone imprisoned under the emergency will be
released and that some already have been freed.
   According to government officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, 574 political prisoners were released between Jan. 1-6.
   During his campaign for the Dec. 19 presidential election,
Premadasa said he would work to eliminate poverty and malnutrition.
   His anti-poverty program outlined today would allocate about $75
a month to each of the country's 7 million impoverished people, or
45 percent of the population. The average annual income in Sri Lanka
is about $360.
   Premadasa, who also holds the finance and planning portfolios,
did not explain how he will finance his program.
   In a bid to create harmony on this ethnically divided nation,
Premadasa offered cash incentives to government employees who are
bilingual.
   ``Everyone likes money. So we will pay more to those who speak
more than one language,'' said Premadasa, who speaks the two
official languages, Sinhalese and Tamil, in addition to English. He
did not say how much more a bilingual employee would earn.
   Premadasa served as prime minister for 11 years before he was
elected president last month. One of his two opponents, Sirmavo
Bandaranaike, has asked the Supreme Court to nullify the election,
alleging fraud.

   Rep. LeRoy Ufkes' career in the Illinois
House is literally a case of here one day, gone the next.
   Ufkes took his seat in the House for the first time Monday. Today
is his last day.
   The Republican was chosen by five county GOP chairmen in their
western Illinois district to serve out the term of Rep. Kent Slater,
who resigned last month to become a judge. Republicans, who hold a
minority of state House seats, decided not to risk further weakening
their strength by leaving the seat vacant even for a short time.
   Ufkes was sworn in on Dec. 6, shortly after lawmakers concluded
their fall session. The session reconvened Monday to consider extra
spending proposals. The 85th General Assembly session and his tenure
were to end today.
   Democrat Bill Edley, elected in November to succeed Slater, takes
office Wednesday.
   Ufkes, an attorney and former assistant state attorney general,
will pocket nearly $6,000 of the $36,551-a-year legislative salary
for his work.
   ``It's a little different experience than what I have been used
to in the courthouse,'' he said. ``I knew what I was voting on.
That's the main problem, knowing what you're voting on.''
   In his first vote Monday, Ufkes supported a bill extending a
program to help poor people pay utility bills. His vote was hardly
crucial. The measure passed 114-0 vote.
   For his brief Springfield assignment, Ufkes retained Slater's
staff and office and accepted his predecessor's advice to ``just be
my own man.''
   ``I just said `Hi' to him, that's all,'' said Rep. Gene Hoffman,
a 22-year Republican veteran of the House. ``In two days you can't
do much. ... Well you might be able to do some damage, but I doubt
much.''
   Ufkes, a 20-year member of the Hancock County Republican Central
Committee, said the GOP county chairmen gave him no instructions on
how to vote.
   ``They just said they trusted me,'' he said.

   Israeli troops operating north of Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon killed eight
guerrillas during a weekend clash, the army announced today.
   The clash was on Saturday night west of the village of Aaramta,
11 miles north of the Israeli border, the army said. It gave no
explanation for the delay in the announcement.
   The military command said an Israeli force encountered a squad of
Lebanese guerrillas and opened fire, killing eight. There were no
Israeli casualties, according to the military command.
   No further details were released. But Israel army radio quoted
reports from Lebanon as saying the squad apparently belonged to the
radical Shiite Moslem movement Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The clash, the first reported battle between Israeli soldiers and
guerrillas in southern Lebanon this year, followed at least three
attempts by guerrillas to infiltrate into Israel late in December.
   Israeli troops killed six guerrillas from radical Palestinian
groups in two aborted infiltrations Dec. 26 and Dec. 28. Three other
guerrillas drowned Dec. 26 on their way to Israel in a boat.
   The operation Saturday was one of Israel's rare incursions north
of the security zone, a six-to-10 mile buffer strip north of the
border.
   Israel carved out the zone in 1985 when it withdrew my militia and
Israeli troops.

   Billy and Mary Jo Wilson's church is signing up
volunteers to help them care for five new babies, but the couple
hasn't received many offers of material help for their quintuplets,
the new mother says.
   ``We hope we do, because it's hard enough to raise one child,''
Mrs. Wilson said Monday in her first news conference since the three
girls and two boys were born Thursday at Detroit's Sinai Hospital.
   Mrs. Wilson, 30, said she will go home from the hospital
Wednesday or Thursday but doctors tell her the babies can't come
home for about 10 weeks.
   She and her husband, 34, a truck repairman for General Motors,
will bring them home one or two at a time to give themselves and son
Brad, 2{, time to get used to a houseful of new arrivals, she said.
   Brad is expecting company, Mrs. Wilson said.
   ``You've told him that there are babies,'' she said, gesturing
toward her husband, ``but it's not going to sink in until they all
show up.''
   ``They're beautiful,'' she said.
   Mrs. Wilson, a GM reliability analyst, said she never thought of
reducing the number of babies to give the remaining ones a stronger
chance.
   Doctors raised the possibility of ``selective reduction'' after
four babies were detected about six weeks into Mrs. Wilson's
pregnancy and a fifth wachael, Shelby Nicole, Rebecca Irene and Elizabeth
Ashley Wilson.
   Mrs. Wilson took a fertilit drug that produces multiple births up
to 30 percent of the time. She had been hospitalized since Oct. 20.

<TEXT>
   The first contingent of 450 Cuban troops
left Angola today, weeks before a deadline set by an accord aimed at
bringing peace to this nation and independence to Namibia.
   The departing troops are part of a group of 3,000 who must be out
of Angola by April 1.
   Their early departure was ``a goodwill gesture on the part of
Cuba and Angola,'' Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told
25,000 people gathered to say farewell in Luanda's May 1 Square.
   ``The names of those Cubans who fell here will be engraved
forever in our hearts,'' dos Santos said.
   Men and women who survived the fighting marched single file to
strains of a military band between ranks of their Angolan comrades
into three waiting Cuban and Angolan planes.
   U.N. military observers oversaw the beginning of a resolution to
one of Africa's thorniest problems.
   South Africa, which has administered Namibia as South-West Africa
since capturing it from Germany in World War I, agreed to its
independence in return for a Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   Under a Dec. 22 agreement signed in New York by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, the Cubans, who first came to the aid of the Angolan
government in July, 1975, are to withdraw 3,000 of their estimated
50,000 troops by April 1.
   All the Cuban troops are to pull back north of the east-west
Benguela railroad by Nov. 1, in time for Namibian elections.
   Cuban Brig. Gen. Samuel C. Rodiles Planas, chief of staff of
Cuban forces in Angola, and Angolan Navy Chief Maj. Gen. Ciel Da
Concessao signed withdrawal agreements on the airport runway today,
then handed them to the chief U.N. observer, Brazilian Gen. Pericles
Ferreira Gomes.
   Norwegian Col. Arvid Geirulv, second in command of the 28-man
U.N. observer force in Angola, said another 1,000 Cubans would leave
the port of Luanda on a Soviet ship late today or Wednesday.
   By Jan. 15, 550 more Cubans will have left by air and another
1,000 by boat, he said.
   The remainder of the U.N.'s 70 military and 20 civilian observers
were to arrive in Angola by March 20.
   South African troops entered Angola in 1975 to support right-wing
rebels who also are backed by Washington.
   Pretoria withdrew its troops to Namibia Aug. 22 following a
decisive defeat by the Cubans in the southern garrison town of Cuito
Cuanavale.
   All but 1,500 South African soldiers are to leave Namibia by Nov.
1.
   Cuba's deputy minsiter of armed forces, Gen. Abelardo Colome
Ibarra, told the flag-waving crowd in May 1 Square, the ``real
authors of this agreement are the men and women who fought here and
destroyed the myth of South African superiority.''
   Cuba and Angola have given no death toll, but Western
intelligence sources estimate 5,000 Cubans died in Angola.
   Luanda has asked the United Nations to pay the estimated $800
million to ship the Cubans home.

   A man walked into a downtown travel agency

   James Crowley shot his wife, Patricia, Monday night at her desk

then shot himself, police Lt. Donald O'Halloran said.
   Mrs. Crowley, 33, was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at

   Police would release no other details about the murder-suicide.
Several travel agency employees present at the shooting refused to
answer reporters' questions Monday night.
   An official at Fleet Bank of Maine, which owns the agency,
described Mrs. Crowley as a well-liked, responsible employee. He
said she had been with the agency three years.
   ``She's just the kind of person you'd expect to find in a travel

<HEAD>Gadhafi Vows To Retaliate If U.S. Hits Rabta Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said if the United States
attacks a Libyan plant it claims is intended to make chemical
weapons, Libya will respond by destroying ``anything American which
we can reach.''
   In a speech broadcast live Monday by Libyan radio and monitored
in London, Gadhafi again denied U.S. allegations the plant is
intended for chemical weapons.
   ``We built a factory for medicines,'' the Libyan leader told a
meeting of the Basic People's Congress in Tripoli, a grass-roots
political committee.
   ``They said this constitutes danger. America with all its
greatness said, `I want to destroy this factory.' Why? Because it is
a factory that constitutes a danger.
   ``Even the factories which make atom bombs are a cause of danger
and so we should destroy them. And this is what should happen. If
they (the United States) destroy this factory we should get ready to
destroy anything American which we can reach.''
   President Reagan has said he could not rule out the option of a
military strike on the plant, about 60 miles southwest of Tripoli,
the Libyan capital.
   In an interview published today in USA Today, Gadhafi said ``the
whole world is amazed and surprised'' by the U.S. claims.
   Asked if he approved of chemical weapons, Gadhafi said: ``We are
against the use of any type of weapons.''
   Gadhafi also said he expected relations with Washington to
improve when Reagan leaves office.
   ``We should bury this silly and stupid policy with the previous
administration,'' he said.
   The Libyan leader again denounced last week's shooting down by
U.S. fighters of two Libyan jets over the Mediterranean. U.S.
officials said the incident was an act of self-defense unrelated to
the Rabta plant.
   Libya claimed its planes were attacked during an unarmed
reconnaissance mission and said the incident was a prelude to a
larger-scale U.S. attack.
   But when asked in the interview if the Libyan planes had been
armed, Gadhafi said only: ``This is something new to us, to debate
if a military plane should be armed or not ... this is silly.''
   In Cairo, Egypt, Libyan dissident leader Mohammed Yusef Magariaf
said in an interview Monday his group needs U.S. help to overthrow
Gadhafi but advised Washington that bombing Libyan targets would be
the wrong kind of help.
   Magariaf, secretary-general of the National Front for the
Salvation of Libya, denied an unattributed report in the
London-based newsletter Africa Confidential that the front is being
trained militarily by U.S. and Israeli experts in Chad, Cameroon and
other African countries.
   ``This is a stupid lie,'' he said, adding that Israel probably
benefits with Gadhafi in power because it keeps Libya in turmoil.
   The front is considered the most powerful anti-Gadhafi. Its aim
is to end Gadhafi's rule.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman would not comment
on the Africa Confidential report. Another ranking U.S. defense
official, speaking anonymously, denied the Defense Department was
involved but said he could not speak for the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Magariaf said such action as the air battle might backfire by
depicting Gadhafi as a victim.
   ``In (the Arab) world, that is not the course to get rid of
Gadhafi,'' he said. ``This is not the task of the United States.
Instead of bombing this or that ... all efforts should be directed
to helping Libyans get rid of Gadhafi.''
   He said his organization maintains a ``dialogue'' with the United
States and other powerful countries, but refused to elaborate.

<HEAD>Students Will Vote To Change Name Of Mascot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HENRYETTA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fighting Hens is no name for a
football team, say students at Henryetta High School who squawk at
the notion that female fowl can conjure up the right image for their
gridiron boys.
   On Wednesday, students will vote on a new name for their athletic
teams _ something that inspires a little more fear in opponents,
like ``Knights'' or ``Diamond Backs.'' A poll shows that four out of
five favor the change.
   ``Our male athletes object to being named for a female chicken,''
said Willie Wind, student body president. ``And it's redundant to
call the girls' teams Lady Hens.''
   The Hens have been around since the 1930s, when a newspaper
account of a game played in a downpour referred to the team as the
Mud Hens, Wind said. The ``Fighting'' was added later.
   Most alumni have opposed a change in the name, arguing that it
has become a tradition. But Wind said there has always been some
opposition to the mascot.
   ``This is something that has been discussed as long as I've been
in school here,'' said Wind, a senior. ``But there are a lot of
people in the community who didn't want the change.''
   The school mascot has received some national attention recently
because of the success of UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman, a 1984
graduate of Henryetta High who is expected to be a top National
Football League draft choice.
   But that doesn't mean that students are proud to be Hens. A poll
of senior high students conducted last month showed support for a
change in mascots by a 352-81 margin.
   Even if the vote favors a change, it's still possible that the
school board will veto it. The Fighting Hens say they'll cross that
road when they get to it.
   ``If that happens, we'd be disappointed,'' Wind said. ``But we
wouldn't give up. We'd keep working within the system for the
change.''

<HEAD>Court Decides Issue on Suing Government Employee in New York Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an important decision for
anyone who sues a government employee over alleged civil rights
violations, today clarified how to determine the filing deadlines
for such lawsuits.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that a man who says he was
unlawfully arrested and beaten by campus police at the State
University of New York in Albany did not wait too long to sue two
police officers.
   The ruling means Tom Ukure's lawsuit against Javan Owens and
Daniel G. Lessard over a Jan. 27, 1984, incident can proceed to
trial.
   The two police officers had sought a ruling that Ukure, who sued
22 months after his arrest, missed the appropriate filing deadline,
or ``statute of limitations.''
   Ukure's federal lawsuit is based on a much-used civil rights law
in which people whose rights have been violated can collect monetary
damages from government officials and employees.
   But in passing the 1870 civil rights law and in amending it
since, Congresss has never specified what statute of limitations to
impose.
   In a 1985 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that suits filed
under the civil rights law, most often referred to as Section 1983
because that is where it appears in the U.S. Code, must meet the
same deadline as personal injury suits filed in the same state.
   But some states have more than one deadline for personal injury
suits, depending on what type of wrongdoing is being alleged. The
court's 1985 decision, in a case called Wilson vs. Garcia, did not
clarify what deadline should govern in such cases.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Thurgood Marshall said that
in such multiple-deadline situations, a state's catch-all deadline
for personal injury cases should be used.
   In Ukure's case, that means New York's general three-year statute
of limitations for personal injury cases governs _ not the state's
one-year deadline for certain specified personal injuries as the two
police officers had argued.
   ``Our decision in Wilson promised an end to the confusion over
what statute of limitations to apply to Section 1983 actions; with
today's decision, we hope to fulfill Wilson's promise,'' Marshall
said.
   He noted that courts should resort to general filing deadlines
only when state law provides multiple deadlines for personal injury
suits and the general deadline ``embraces, either explicitly or by
judicial construction, unspecified personal injury actions.''
   The case is Owens vs. Okure, 87-56.

<TEXT>
   Investigators said today they found fire
damage in one of the engines of a Boeing 737 that crashed in central
England and that the other engine had been inexplicably shut off
before the crash.
   Eddie Trimble, the Transport Department's chief engineering
inspector at the crash scene, told reporters that while the left
engine showed fire damage, the right engine showed no sign of having
been on fire and was ``in a zero-thrust or shut-down condition.''
   He said the engine appeared to have been turned off ``at a
previous point in the flight,'' rather than in the moments before
the plane crashed into a highway embankment while trying to make an
emergency landing at nearby East Midlands Airport.
   Trimble refused to speculate on whether pilot error was to blame
for shutting down the engine.
   ``At this stage in the investigation, all possibilities are open
in that regard,'' he said.
   Investigators are listening to the flight recorders and will be
able to question the seven crew members, including the pilot and
co-pilot.
   The British Midland Airways jet crashed into an embankment beside
England's main north-south highway Sunday night, killing 44 people.
It was flying from London's Heathrow Airport to Belfast when the
pilot reported engine trouble.
   ``The left engine has fire damage,'' Trimble said. ``The fire
damage is consistent with witness reports of fire associated with
the left engine in flight. We have no evidence at the moment of a
mechanical failure in the right engine.''
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon repeated Trimble's findings to
Parliament and said investigators ``are now concentrating on
information about the engines, from the flight data and cockpit
voice recorders, both of which were recovered.''
   Investigators rummaged on hands and knees looking for debris that
might yield more clues. Theories advanced by experts included
contaminated fuel, a rupture in a combustion chamber, improper
servicing or a mechanical fault allegedly missed during tests of the
engine.
   Channon said Monday there was no evidence of sabotage, but Prime
Margaret Thatcher said ``we rule out nothing _ we simply can't.''
   The crash occurred less than three weeks after a bomb destroyed a
Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 on board and 11
people on the ground.
   At the government's sophisticated laboratory at Farnborough,
south of London, tests began on the Boeing 737's two flight
recorders and the digital flight data recorder.
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Investigation Board, said the odds against double engine failure on
a Boeing 737 were about 10 million to 1.
   He suggested a ``technical mistake such as something incorrect
being done to the engines during turnaround (servicing between
flights), either inadvertently or deliberately.''
   Or, Tench said, ``it could be inadvertent fuel contamination.''
   The Evening Standard newspaper said today evidence was emerging
that at least one of the plane's engines broke apart.
   ``Wreckage thought to be engine blades has been found six miles
from the crash scene,'' the newspaper said.
   A Transport Department spokesman, requesting anonymity, confirmed
that debris, ``probably engine fragments,'' was found at a distance
from the crash, but he did not know the distance.
   Lawyer Jim Helmer of Cincinnati, who is suing the airplane
engine's maker, alleges the engines contained parts that were not
properly tested.
   Helmer identified the parts as timer valves but told The
Associated Press he didn't know if they could have caused the crash.
   The CFM56 engines were made jointly by the U.S.-based General
Electric Co. and the French company SNECMA. General Electric
spokesman Dwight Weber said Monday night that failure of the timer
valves would not have caused an engine to go out.
   SNECMA spokesman Olivier Fagard said the timer valves are
inspected and tested in each engine.
   ``Our records reflect all engines performed normally during the
testing and there is no evidence whatever of any characteristics
which could be associated with a malfunctioning timer. We deny this
has anything to do with an engine malfunctioning,'' he said.
   Investigators expect to be aided by accounts from pilot Kevin
Hunt and the other crew members. Hunt, 43, a 22-year veteran with
the airline, was in poor condition with spine and leg fractures, but
hospital officials said he spoke with his wife.
   Co-pilot David McClelland was hospitalized with a broken leg and
spinal injuries.
   The plane crashed a half-mile short of the runway, plowing into a
grassy embankment at the edge of the M1 highway 100 miles north of
London.
   The Boeing 737-400 was 12 weeks old and had flown less than 500
hours, the airline said.

   The Supreme Court ruled today the rights of
criminal defendants are not violated when they are denied the
opportunity to confer with their lawyers during brief trial recesses.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the murder, kidnapping and
criminal assault convictions of Donald Ray Perry of South Carolina.
   During a 15-minute trial recess while Perry was testifying, his
lawyer sought to speak to him to advise him about his rights during
cross-examination. But the judge refused to allow them to talk.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in his opinion for the high court,
said, ``The federal Constitution does not compel every trial judge
to allow the defendant to consult with his lawyer while his
testimony is in progress if the judge decides that there is a good
reason to interrupt the trial for a few minutes.''
   The truth more likely may emerge if a defendant who has been
testifying and is about to undergo cross-examination is denied the
chance to talk to his attorney, Stevens said.
   ``Permitting a witness ... to consult with counsel after direct
examination but before cross-examination grants the witness an
opportunity to regroup and regain a poise and sense of strategy that
the unaided witness would not possess,'' he said.
   Stevens drew a distinction between Perry's case and one in 1976
in which the court ruled that a defendant's right to the assistance
of his lawyer was violated when he was barred from talking with the
lawyer during an overnight recess.
   ``The normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs
during an overnight recess would encompass matters that go beyond
the content of the defendant's own testimony ... such as the
availability of other witnesses, trial tactics or even the
possibility of negotiating a plea bargain,'' Stevens said.
   The Constitution guarantees a defendant will be allowed to talk
to his lawyer about such matters, Stevens said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said the
ruling is ``a lapse in this court's commitment to fundamental
fairness for criminal defendants.''
   Marshall said prosecution witnesses routinely are allowed to
confer with the prosecutor during brief recesses.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joined
Marshall's dissent.
   Perry was sentenced to life in prison in the killing of Mary
Heimberger, whose body was found on March 7, 1981, in a wooded area
in Richland County, S.C.
   Perry confessed to police that he shot the victim, but said it
was an accident.
   Ms. Heimberger had been raped, shot in both kneecaps and fatally
shot in the chest.
   Perry filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled that
his rights were violated when the trial judge refused to allow him
to talk to his lawyer.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the
conviction in 1987.
   The appeals court said there must be evidence that denying a
defendant the opportunity to confer with his attorney prejudiced the
case against the defendant.
   The Supreme Court did not adopt that reasoning today. Citing the
case of the overnight recess, Stevens said there are instances when
the defendant must be allowed to confer with his lawyer without any
proof of prejudice against the defendant. But brief recesses do not
qualify for that treatment, Stevens said.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Clarified how to determine the filing deadline for anyone who
sues a government employee over alleged civil rights violations.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that a man who says he was
unlawfully arrested and beaten by campus police at the State
University of New York in Albany did not wait too long to sue two
police officers.
   _ Upheld a 5 percent tax Illinois imposes on all telephone calls
charged to in-state numbers.
   The court, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said the
tax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce.
   The case involving criminal defendants is Perry vs. Leeke,
88-6325.

   Three self-styled revolutionaries
plotted to bomb courthouses, military offices and corporations in an
attempt to overthrow the U.S. government, a prosecutor said today.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks also told a federal jury
that the three defendants, plotted roberies from Maine to Virginia
and attempted to murder an off-duty policeman ``to further the
conspiracy's personal, political goals.'' They are accused of
seditious conspiracy, or conspiring to overthrow the government;
racketeering conspiracy; and racketeering enterprise.
   Loucks described the 1976 bombing of the Suffolk Superior
Courthouse in Boston, which blew down walls and injured several
people, as an attempt by the group ``to cripple the Massachusetts
penal system.''
   Opening arguments from defendant Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, of
Maine, who is presenting his own case, and attorneys representing
Levasseur's wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, 40, and Richard Williams,
41, of Boston, were to follow.
   Loucks maintained that Levasseur and his wife, who joined in
1976, were core members of the group that claimed credit for the
bombings under the names of the United Freedom Front and the Sam
Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit, while Williams joined in 1981.
   About 50 spectators packed the tiny courtroom. At least 10 U.S.
marshals guarded the defendants and security was tight throughout
the courthouse.
   Attorneys estimate the trial could last a year.
   The defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets. It
was enacted in 1918 to keep draft resisters from interfering with
the conscription laws.
   ``What's at stake here is not just the rights of the people on
trial, it's the rights of every American,'' William Newman, who
represents Mrs. Levasseur, said Monday.
   The defendants have described themselves in a press release as
``North American anti-imperialists who believe armed resistance is
one of the necessary responses to apartheid, racism, sexism, the
massacres of Native Peoples and capitalist-backed wars.''
   They face up to 60 years in prison and $60,000 in fines if
convicted.
   Selection of a 12-member jury was completed Monday from a
prescreened pool of 45 prospective panelists after 68 days of
questioning that began in April but was delayed by pretrial motions
and wrangling over evidence.
   U.S. District Judge William G. Young reminded the jurors that it
was the prosecutors' responsibility to prove the defendants guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.
   ``The government has to prove somebody actually did something to
make a conspiracy come about,'' he said. ``On no account can a
person be prosecuted for his political beliefs.''
   The courtroom is outfitted with closed-circuit television
monitors and guarded by about 40 marshals, who have set up two
walk-through metal detectors at the courthouse's entrances.
   The three defendants were among eight people who were arrested in
Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts in 1982 and 1984. The trial was
moved from Boston to Springfield.
   Charges were dropped in August against two defendants _ Thomas W.
Manning, 42, of Maine, and Jaan Karl Laaman, 40, of East Boston _
because they were already serving long sentences on bombing
convictions in New York.
   Manning's wife, Carol, 33, pleaded guilty last month to the three
charges and was sentenced to a five-year prison term to run
concurrent with her 15-year term in New York on bombing and
conspiracy charges.
   Young decided last week to hold a separate trial for Laaman's
wife, Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31.
   Another defendant, Christopher King, 38, has been tried
separately and found guilty on the single count of seditious
conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.

   The Kremlin's top envoy to Afghanistan said today
there is ``a serious danger'' the Soviets will not have their troops
out of Afghanistan by a Feb. 15 deadline.
   Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Soviets' first deputy foreign minister and
the ambassador to Kabul, blamed the United States and hard-line
elements among Afghan guerrillas for a deteriorating situation in
the country.
   ``The opposition says it wants to topple the current government
in Kabul militarily,'' said Vorontsov, who recently met with leaders
of the Afghan resistance in Iran and Pakistan. ``They don't want to
see a broad-based government.''
   Vorontsov also told reporters at a government news briefing that
U.S. arms are still being shipped to the Afghan guerrillas and that
the U.S. government has not given ``any indication of its genuine
desire to work for an Afghan settlement.''
   Asked if the Soviet Union might further delay withdrawal of the
50,000 troops it still has in Afghanistan, Vorontsov replied: ``It's
a serious danger. Things might shape up in such a way that the
Soviet Union will be unable to do what we'd decided to do as a
matter of principle.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration expects the Soviets to hold to the Feb. 15 pullout
date.
   ``We still expect them to meet the deadline,'' Fitzwater said.
``I don't believe we've had any official notification to the
contrary ... The last thing they officially told us was that they
would be out.''
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April, the Soviet Union
agreed to have all its troops out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15. The Red
Army entered the country in December 1979 to back up the government
against Afghan guerrillas, sending in an estimated 100,000 soldiers.
   The guerrillas are backed by the United States and Pakistan.
   Vorontsov said the Soviets are seeking establishment of a
national Afghan assembly, called a Jurgah, to represent all parties
in the strife-torn country.
   Formation of such an assembly should be accompanied by a
cease-fire to ``stop the shedding of Afghan blood,'' Vorontsov said.
   The Soviets suspended their troop withdrawal in fall after
complaining that the United States and Pakistan were continuing
their support of the guerrillas trying to overthrow the
Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Top Soviet officials have said
repeatedly since then, however, that Moscow would meet its
obligation to complete the withdrawal by Feb. 15.
   Afghan rebel leaders refused Monday to resume direct talks with
the Soviets, claiming Moscow was trying to secure a place for its
communist allies in a post-war government.
   Vorontsov's talks with the rebels reached an impasse in Islamabad
on Saturday over the composition of a post-war regime.
   A rebel spokesman, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, said the guerrillas
would not attack departing Soviet troops, but he ruled out a
cease-fire sought by the Soviets.
   Vorontsov had said in the past that the Soviets would meet their
withdrawal deadline unless departing troops were attacked by the
guerrillas. He indicated today the conditions for completion of the
pullout depended on the military and political situation in
Afghanistan, but he gave no criteria on which the Kremlin would base
its decision.

   It remains to be seen whether CBS' Pat Sajak can

guest host Monday night.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings from the 17
biggest television markets, Sajak's 90-minute talk show had a rating
of 7.0 and a 25 share, to a 6.1 and 18 for the hour-long ``Tonight.''
   Sajak also was up against the first half of ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' and ABC's half-hour news show ``Nightline.''
Ratings for those shows were not immediately available.
   The rating is a percentage of total homes with televisions in the
markets surveyed. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Sajak and Carson won't go head-to-head until Wednesday night.

   The government began closing arguments today in
its case against top Teamsters officials, describing for jurors how
the union's late president and two associates allegedly carried out
a $700,000 embezzlement scheme.
   The case was expected to go to the jury late today or Tuesday
following closing arguments by defense attorneys for the two
surviving defendants and instructions by U.S. District Court Judge
George M. White.
   The embezzlement and labor racketeering trial began 2{ months ago
and included testimony from 80 witnesses, many of whom were asked
detailed questions about day-to-day union operations as long as 10
years ago.
   The indictment, issued in May 1986, named the Teamsters
then-president, Jackie Presser, along with Harold Friedman, an
international vice president for the union, and Anthony Hughes,
Local 507 recording secretary.
   Presser died July 9 of brain cancer.
   ``The evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by Harold
Friedman, Anthony Hughes and Jackie Presser for the benefit of their
friends and cronies in the amount of $700,000,'' government
prosecutor Stephen Jigger said during closing arguments today.
   Jigger reviewed in detail the testimony of three of the alleged
``ghost employees,'' who allegedly were paid for doing no work. They
are Allen Friedman, who is not related to Harold Friedman; George
Argie; and John A. Nardi Jr.
   ``We told you up front that these three were unsavory characters,
but it was not the government that paid them up to $1,000 a week,''
Jigger said.
   Friedman, 66, and Presser, who was 61 when he died, were accused
of paying the ``ghosts,'' while Hughes, 52, was charged with being a
no-show employee at the Bakery Workers' Local 19, which is
affiliated with Teamsters Local 507.
   Friedman testified that Hughes worked and that Allen Friedman
often was too ill to work. He said the other two ``ghost employees''
worked for Presser and that it would have been uncharacteristic of
Presser to pay people for doing no work.
   ``Jackie Presser was not the type to pay someone ... and not have
him do any work,'' Friedman said last week. ``If he did, then shame
on Jackie Presser.''
   Court documents have indicated that Presser and Hughes were FBI
informants. Presser's former attorney, John R. Climaco, has said
that resser's defense would have been that the FBI authorized him to
hire the ``ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his status as an
FBI informant status.
   But government prosecutors contend Presser didn't begin working
as an FBI informant until 1977, so he couldn't have been authorized
to hire ``ghost employees'' as early as 1972, when the scheme
allegedly began.
   Friedman's attorney said last week that Presser was a government
informant as early as 1963.

   A baby sitter convicted of involuntary
manslaughter in the death of a 6-month-old child and the abuse of
two other infants has received the maximum sentence of eight years
and eight months in prison.
   Vickie Maas, 28, buried her face in her hands and cried Monday as
Superior Court Judge Howard J. Schwab announced the sentence.
   ``Today's my birthday and this is the best present I've gotten,''
said the baby's mother, Karen Duncan, after sentencing. ``It makes
us feel better that she's in jail.''
   Ms. Maas was found guilty Dec. 16 in the death of David Allen
Duncan, who died Jan. 8, 1988, of brain injuries two days after Ms.
Maas had shaken him violently because he was crying.
   She also was convicted of three counts of felony child abuse
related to David's death and injuries sustained by a 6-month-old boy
who suffered a bruised ear and a 7-month-old boy who suffered a
broken leg while in her care.
   A psychiatrist called by Ms. Maas's attorney had testified that
the baby sitter suffered a brain disorder that led to periodic bouts
of violent behavior similar to seizures.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Anti-Satellite Program Is Crucial To National Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Tuesday he approved requests for several anti-satellite projects in
the fiscal 1990 budget because such a weapon is crucial to national
security.
   ``I think it's deplorable that we do not have an anti-satellite
deterrent capability,'' Carlucci said.
   ``The Soviets have an operational system and contrary to some
reports I've read, it is an effective system. I think our lack of an
ASAT (anti-satellite) capability is our single most vulnerable point
if there were to be a conflict.
   ``For us to be deprived of our eyes and ears would gravely weaken
our military capability.''
   According to Carlucci and other Reagan administration leaders,
the Soviets have a crude but operational missile system for
attacking the low-flying U.S. spy and reconnaissance satellites that
would be crucial in a war.
   The United States spent years developing such a weapon _ and
tested it effectively once against an object in space _ before
Congress blocked further development work.
   Congressional Democrats maintain the current Soviet system poses
little danger to modern American satellites, note the Soviets have
stopped all testing of the weapon, and argue that further
development of an American counterpart would set off an arms race in
space.
   Carlucci was asked about anti-satellite work during a breakfast
meeting with Pentagon correspondents Tuesday, one day after the
Reagan administration sent a $315.2 billion military budget request
for fiscal 1990 to Congress.
   Included is a request for $94.6 million to begin development of a
sea-based anti-satellite weapon. The request was surprising, because
it was Carlucci who just last year bowed to the congressional
demands to halt development of an ASAT missile that could be fired
from land-based jets.
   ``That does not mean that I was prepared to give up on developing
an ASAT capability,'' Carlucci said of his decision to scuttle that
Air Force program.
   ``I think it's vitally important that we go ahead with some ASAT
capability. And we have a number of supporters in the Congress.''
   The defense secretary added the Navy effort would be one of at
least three programs to study ASAT applications. The Army and
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, which oversees ``Star
Wars'' work, also are studying ASAT applications with different
types of lasers, Carlucci said.
   The Navy program will study the potential of a kinetic energy
ASAT missile _ or one that would destroy a satellite through impact
and not explosives.
   On other matters, Carlucci said he had spoken with his designated
successor, former Sen. John Tower of Texas, on Monday and that Tower
expected to recover rapidly from recent surgery.
   Carlucci said Tower now expects to undergo a Senate hearing and
gain confirmation by the end of the month. As a result, Carlucci
said he planned to step down from office on Feb. 1 and seek a job in
the private sector.

   A special meeting between Pope John Paul II
and the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States
will take place here March 8-10, the Vatican announced Tuesday.
   Thirty-five U.S. archbishops and top Vatican officials will take
part in the talks, which are expected to cover a variety of issues
and problems.
   The specific agenda was not given. The announcement said
``challenges facing the church'' would be discussed.
   U.S. church leaders asked for the meeting two years ago when many
were concerned about Vatican disciplining of liberal Archbishop
Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle. Hunthausen later was restored to full
authority, but church leaders still wanted the meeting.
   During the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops in Washington two months ago, its president, Archbishop John
L. May of St. Louis, described the pope as being ``bullish on the
church in the United States.''
   Differences between the U.S. bishops and the Vatican have
surfaced, however. At the Washington meeting, the bishops sent back
a Vatican draft document that questions the authority of national
bishops conferences, marking it as not ``suitable as a basis for
discussion.''

<TEXT>
   A 65-year-old rape victim, allowed by a judge
to select her attacker's sentence, chose the shortest of three
alternatives but one that guaranteed there would be no trial.
   ``Wasn't that something?'' the great-grandmother said Monday
after she chose to have James Halvorson serve a 54-month sentence.
Halvorson, 25, had pleaded guilty last November to raping the woman
in her suburban home.
   Hennepin County District Judge William Posten began the
sentencing hearing by calling the victim to his chambers, along with
Kevin Johnson, an assistant county attorney, and Cindy Clarkson, who
works with sexual assault victims for the county.
   Posten presented the victim with three alternatives: She could
choose to have Halvorson serve a 54-month sentence for first-degree
sexual assault. That would be in keeping with Minnesota guidelines
and would allow Halvorson to be free in three years.
   Or, she could have Halvorson serve a 100-month sentence
recommended by probation authorities, or a 108-month sentence
requested by the county attorney's office.
   But if she chose either of the longer sentences, Halvorson would
be allowed to retract his guilty plea and there could have been a
trial to determine his guilt or innocence, Posten told her.
   The victim consulted with Johnson and Clarkson and had only one
question.
   ``I knew it could be months before there'd be a trial,'' she
said. ``The only thing I wanted to know is if he would be in jail
during that time.''
   When she was told he probably wouldn't be in jail, she said she
wanted the 54 months and she wanted it now.
   The victim called the judge ``just beautiful. He was so kind. He
said, `It's your decision.' I liked that. I think three years is a
long time for a young person. Maybe (Halvorson) will think about
some things.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial today in the
stock manipulation case against chemical company GAF Corp. and one
of its key officers, deciding that the government's failure to
disclose possible tampering with a key piece of evidence unfairly
hurt the defendants.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Mary J. Lowe stunned a packed
courtroom, but the judge said she intended to start picking a new
jury Wednesday morning for a new trial.
   She denied an immediate defense motion to have all the charges
dismissed, and defense attorneys said they would appeal her denial,
contending that another trial violates their clients' constitutional
rights.
   Jury selection in the now-halted trial began Dec. 12.
   The stock manipulation charges against GAF and vice chairman
James T. Sherwin is one of the major cases arising out of the Ivan
Boesky insider trading scandal. It was considered a major test of
the government's ability to successfully prosecute Wall Street
trading abuses.
   The government's case relied partly on an invoice sent to GAF by
Jefferies &amp; Co., a Los Angeles brokerage that conducted stock trades
for the company.
   A line on the invoice produced by the government was partly
obscured, but U.S. prosecutors failed to inform the defense about
the possible tampering prior to the trial as required under criminal
rules of evidence.
   A federal grand jury indicted GAF and Sherwin last July on
charges they manipulated the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock
through Jefferies in an attempt to drive up its price.
   The alleged motive was to maximize the gain GAF would realize by
selling its chunk of Carbide stock following a failed takeover
attempt of the larger chemical company.

<HEAD>Officials Say Bomb Was in Front Cargo Hold</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to add that Channon didn't say which wing.

   The bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 was in a
front cargo hold in front of a wing, Transport Secretary Paul
Channon said today.
   Channon told the House of Commons the fact that Semtex plastic
explosives were probably used to make the bomb pointed to a highly
organized terrorist group planting the device.
   The Boeing 747 exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on
Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
   The Department of Transport's Air Accident Investigation Branch
had narrowed ``the area (of the bomb's location) to that of the No.
1 cargo hold just forward of the wing,'' Channon told lawmakers. He
didn't say which wing.
   He said it was too early to tell where the luggage or article
that contained the explosive originated.
   ``It is essential that we discover who put the bomb in the
aircraft and how it got there ... The signs of the use of
high-performance plastic explosive _ which was very probably but not
certainly Semtex _ point to a well-orgnized and well-supported
terrorist group,'' he said.
   Channon did not say how investigators had determined the location
of the bomb.
   Western terrorist experts have said they suspect Semtex, an
explosive made in Czechoslovakia, was used to sabotage the jumbo jet.
   Although Czechoslovakia denies Semtex was used in the Lockerbie
incident, it has promised to send experts to help in the
investigation.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said four Czech experts planned to arrive Wednesday for a one or
two-day visit.
   In Lockerbie, police said today they had recovered and identified
another body from the crash. They said they still were searching for
the bodies of seven local residents and 21 passengers.
   Police released for burial the body of Rosaleen Somerville, 40,
whose husband, John, and children, Paul, 13, and Lynsey, 10, also
died in the crash. The childrens' bodies are among those missing.

   The Communist Party leadership today went back on
its promise of multiple-candidate elections for Parliament by
choosing all 100 candidates for the party's 100 seats in the new
Parliament.
   A historic political reform passed into Soviet law Dec. 1 said,
``conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited number
of candidates'' for the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies are to be elected by the general
public on March 26. The other third is to be chosen by certain
organizations, including the Communist Party, which has the right to
choose 100 deputies.
   The election reform did not say whether the party members would
vote directly on multiple candidates for their seats, and Kremlin
watchers were waiting for today's plenum to find out.
   The official news agency Tass reported that party members
suggested 31,500 nominees, but these were winnowed down and finally
just 100 were chosen by the 12-member ruling Politburo. Those 100
candidates were nominated by the party's 300-member Central
Committee today, Tass said.
   But rank-and-file party members won't have the chance to vote on
the party's candidates, Tass said. Only party leaders will cast
ballots in a special meeting March 15 and 16, and they will not have
a choice of candidates.
   Still, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Central Committee
he expects a variety of political platforms to emerge in the public
campaign. Tass said Gorbachev offered a draft platform to the plenum
today, but details were not released.
   ``The Soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasks
formulated by the party for the immediate future, and the platform
it takes to elections,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``We should proceed from the premise that the other social
organizations will come to the elections with their own campaign
documents,'' and individual candidates can also offer their views,
Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev was referring to other national organizations,
including trade unions and scientific groups, which have been
empowered to directly elect deputies to the congress. The Communist
Party is the only legal political party in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidates
nominated so far in the three-month election campaign are supporters
of his restructuring policy, called perestroika.
   Under the political reform he championed, the new congress will
meet once a year to elect a working parliament of 424 members and
retaining the name of the old rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme
Soviet.
   Tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies,
``all Communists will have an opportunity to express their attitude
to any of the candidates.''
   Those actually voting for the Communist Party's legislators will
be the members of its Central Committee, its Auditing Commission,
first secretaries of the republic and regional party organizations,
second secretaries of the republic party organizations, presidents
and prime ministers of the republics, ministers and heads of state
agencies, and commanders of military districts, Tass said.

<HEAD>Government Against Legalizing Independent Journalists Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it opposes
legalizing a group of independent journalists who reject the
government-backed professional organization set up after the 1981
martial-law crackdown.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said a final decision on whether
to legalize the Association of Polish Journalists will be made by
city administrators in Warsaw, but the central government takes a
firm ``political position'' against it.
   In practice, Urban's statement appeared to doom the application,
drafted at a meeting over the weekend, for the legal revival of the
journalists' association dissolved seven years ago.
   The government is ``decisively against organizational divisions
of the journalistic community by political directions. We speak for
maintaining one professional organization ... gathering people of
various views,'' Urban said at his weekly news conference.
   He said the government especially opposes legalizing this group
because its leaders ``collaborate with Radio Free Europe'' _ the
U.S.-financed radio station that broadcasts uncensored news to
Eastern Europe.
   Asked how the stance could be reconciled with government promises
of greater freedom of association under legislation being drafted
for the parliament, Urban said that ``obviously'' any new bill will
retain ``restrictions of a political kind.''
   The Association of Polish Journalists, with about 7,600 members,
was dissolved in 1982 because its leadership was considered
pro-Solidarity. It was replaced by an ``Association of Journalists
of the Polish People's Republic'' that supported martial law.
   Urban said the new association has 8,700 members, about 80
percent of whom were in the old group. He said 90 percent of Polish
journalists are members.
   Many journalists who refused to join the organization lost jobs
in the state-run press or were shunted aside to obscure publications
during a ``verification'' of political views that followed the
martial-law crackdown. The new organization accepted the
verification campaign.
   About 300 press and broadcast journalists gathered for the
two-day meeting in Warsaw over the weekend and voted to ask for
registration of their old association.
   With the former association's chairman, Stefan Bratkowski,
presiding at the meeting, they said that recent government promises
of political pluralism and reform made it seem the right time to
seek reinstatement.
   While announcing the position, Urban defended the government's
record on the press.
   ``The freedom of expression of various views in Poland has
recently been very broad and is still expanding,'' he said.
``Journalists of opposition character have broader and broader
opportunities for work.''
   Dariusz Fikus, deputy chairman of the Polish Journalists
Association when it was dissolved, said he was disappointed by the
government stance.
   ``I think it is pure nonsense,'' he said. ``If Mr. Urban treats
pluralism in the Polish press seriously and agrees that various
orientations exist ... Why can't there be two journalists'
organizations?''
   He said that the application for reinstatment of the organization
was still being prepared and would be filed ``in the next few days.''
   In a related development, Urban at his news conference said there
was a possibility for future legalization of a banned students'
group, the Independent Students Association.
   Members of the group, which existed legally before martial law,
came to a meeting of young people at Communist Party headquarters
Friday and were thanked by a top party official for offering
criticisms of official policies.

   A man whose rampage at a restaurant
left three people dead and two officers wounded died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound during the incident, police said
Tuesday in a preliminary report.
   Wayne Strozzi, 35, of Loveland shot himself in the head with a
pistol the night of Jan. 3, ending a one-hour standoff at the
Riverhouse Restaurant, Police Chief Bruce Glasscock said.
   The episode began as a domestic dispute between Strozzi and his
estranged wife at her home. He ran to his home after police were
summoned, and shot and wounded a sheriff's deputy there before going
to the Riverhouse Restaurant, where he took 15 people hostage.
   Strozzi wounded a police officer in the restaurant parking lot
before the shootings that left him and two other people dead.
   Glasscock said the preliminary police report showed Strozzi had
announced he would begin killing hostages in the restaurant at 9
p.m. Two minutes before that, a police sharpshooter opened fire on
Strozzi, wounding him, according to the report.
   The report said Strozzi fell to the floor and deliberately shot
waitress Sally Mills, 40, killing her, then placed his pistol to his
head and shot himself.
   The third person killed in the incident was Fenton Crookshank,
45, a restaurant customer who was shot four times by a Loveland
police officer after he went out a restaurant window and failed to
heed orders to stop.
   A preliminary police investigation has ruled Crookshank's
shooting was justified. The prosecutor's office will make a final
ruling on the whether the shooting was justified, with its findings
expected in about two weeks.

   Argentina is opposing efforts to
launch the first ferry service between the Falkland Islands and
South America since the 1982 Anglo-Argentine war, shipping sources
say.
   The 777-ton Indiana I is in Stanley harbor awaiting word on
whether a planned Thursday sailing to Montevideo, Uruguay and Punta
Arenas, Chile, will go ahead, according to the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Several island businessmen have booked passages.
   It would take 3{ days to sail to Montevideo and two days to sail
to Punta. It offers big freight savings over the present trade route
to Britain 8,000 miles away. For example, a prefabricated three-room
bungalow imported from Britain costs $52,000, compared with $21,000
from Uruguay.
   Argentina opposes the venture because it claims sovereignty over
the British colony it calls the Malvinas. Uruguay and Chile
reportedly support Argentina.
   The Nassau-registered Indiana I has a British crew and flies the
Bahamian flag. It is owned by a consortium including British,
Japanese, French and Taiwanese fishing companies.
   Argentinian troops overran the islands March 1982 and were driven
out by British soldiers in a 74-day war.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS
   
   The court ruled the rights of criminal defendants are not
violated when they are denied the opportunity to confer with their
lawyers during brief trial recesses.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the murder, kidnapping and
criminal assault convictions of Donald Ray Perry of South Carolina.
   During a 15-minute trial recess while Perry was testifying, his
lawyer sought to speak to him to advise him about his rights during
cross-examination. But the judge refused to allow them to talk.
   The case is Perry vs. Leeke, 88-6325.
   
   FILING DEADLINES
   
   The court clarified how to determine the filing deadline for
anyone who sues a government employee over alleged civil rights
violations.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that a man who says he was
unlawfully arrested and beaten by campus police at the State
University of New York in Albany did not wait too long to sue two
police officers.
   The case is Owens vs. Okure, 87-56.
   
   PHONE TAX
   
   The court upheld a 5 percent tax Illinois imposes on all
telephone calls charged to in-state numbers.
   The court, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said the
tax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce.
   The case is Goldberg vs. Sweet, 87-826.

   Iranian authorities smashed a major drugs
and arms smuggling ring in southeastern Kerman province and arrested
46 people, Tehran Radio reported Tuesday.
   Gang leaders were among those arrested in the operation, which
also netted an an arms cache and 30 stolen vehicles, said the
broadcast, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   It did not say whether any narcotics were seized, but reported
gang members admitted they had smuggled 52 tons of opium into Iran
from neighboring Pakistan.
   Tehran Radio quoted a spokesman for the revolutionary committee
that is the region's main law enforcement agency as saying the gang
operated a network stretching from the southern gulf states to
Pakistan.
   The raid was part of a burgeoning nationwide crackdown that
includes new laws giving mandatory death sentences to drug smugglers
and people caught with more than an ounce of narcotics.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
has reported more than 900 people were arrested last month on
narcotics charges and 19 drug smugglers convicted by Islamic courts
were hanged in Tehran and other cities in two days last week.

   About 20,000 parents and their children lined up
outside Macao's security police headquarters Tuesday after the
government announced an amnesty for children living illegally in
this Portuguese territory.
   Security Force Commander Col. Proenca de Almedia announced Monday
the amnesty covers children under 18 years whose parents have a
Macao identity card or who were born in this tiny south China
enclave.
   Police said the turnout surprised them as an official survey last
year indicated there were only 3,500 illegal child immigrants at
Macao schools. Many were smuggled in by illegal Chinese immigrant
parents.
   Police said they will open a new registration center Wednesday,
the last day of the amnesty, to process the large numbers.
   They also said they detained Chinese school principal Dr. Wun
Kin-wah on charges of selling school ID cards to people not
attending his school so they could register under the amnesty.
Thirty parents and students also were arrested.
   Macao, the oldest European settlement in Asia, has a population
of 450,000 and will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1999.

   A 5-year-old boy recognized a 7-year-old
retarded former neighbor on television, leading to the arrest of a
couple accused of abandoning their child at an Idaho rest stop.
   ``It's fair to say the major break came from a 5-year-old,'' said
Ada County Sheriff Vaughn Killeen in Boise. ``He pointed at the TV
and said, `That's Eddy.'''
   Eddy Tuinman was found Wednesday at a rest stop on Interstate 84
east of Boise. The boy, called ``Johnny Doe'' before he was
identified, was discovered clad only in a T-shirt in a pile of
urine-soaked clothes.
   Edward Donald Tuinman, 29, and his wife, Deborah, 28, of suburban
Sandy were arraigned in Salt Lake City today. Circuit Judge Michael
Hutchings set a Feb. 10 preliminary hearing for the couple and
ordered a public defender appointed.
   They have been charged in Idaho with felony abandonment of a
child, and faced Utah charges of theft of services in an unrelated
matter. Utah authorities said they also were investigating the
possibility the Eddy was abused while in his home state.
   Only Tuinman spoke during today's brief hearing in a packed
courtroom, complaining that Salt Lake County Jail officials had
refused to allow him make telephone calls and questioning whether
the fairness of his wife being charged along with him in the theft
of services case.
   The couple were arrested by the Utah Highway Patrol on Saturday
in Nephi, 80 miles south of Salt Lake City, after Debbie Maddera of
Salt Lake City, the mother of the 5-year-old boy who recognized the
abandoned child, contacted Idaho officials. The boy's name was not
disclosed.
   The Tuinmans reportedly had stopped in Idaho while they were
traveling from Washington to Sierra Vista, Ariz., looking for
employment, Killeen said.
   Hospital officials at St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise
said Eddy was developmentally disabled and unable to speak.
   They also said he weighed 44 pounds, and had old, healed
fractures, bruises and cigarette burns on his body.
   Police Detective Patti Smalley of Sandy said the Tuinmans' other
children, ages 1, 6 and 11, were examined at a Nephi hospital, where
doctors found no signs of neglect. None of the other children was
retarded.
   ``They were fairly healthy in comparison (to Eddy),'' she said,
adding that Eddy was ``probably the one everything was directed at.''
   Eddy is staying with a foster family in Idaho and his sister and
brothers were in protective custody in Utah. At a juvenile court
hearing Monday in Salt Lake City, the children's grandparents
requested custody, Smalley said.
   The court ordered a study of the home environments of the
children's relatives.
   The Tuinmans also have been charged with the theft of services in
Sandy. They are accused of turning on the natural gas at least twice
after Mountain Fuel had shut it off because of delinquent payments
of $2,000, according to police reports.
   Eddy's grandmother, Doris Seddell, 53, Salt Lake City, said Eddy
was declared mentally retarded because of oxygen deprivation at
birth. She said she cannot believe her daughter would abandon her
son.
   ``She's the kind of mother who sacrificed for her children. She's
gone without herself to try and provide for them,'' she said. ``No
one who has known her can believe she would have allowed this to
happen.''

<HEAD>Soviets May Not Complete Afghan Withdrawal Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's top envoy to Afghanistan said Tuesday
there is ``serious danger'' the Soviets won't resume their troop
pullout in time to meet a Feb. 15 deadline for a total Red Army
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The statement from Yuli M. Vorontsov was the plainest yet from a
Soviet official that the Kremlin may delay or freeze its military
withdrawal from Afghanistan, which by U.N.-brokered accord is to be
completed by the middle of next month.
   However, it was not clear whether Vorontsov's comments to
Moscow-based reporters signaled a change in Soviet intent, or were
designed to pressure Moslem guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's
Moscow-backed government to accede to peace proposals floated by the
Kremlin, including talks between the insurgents and the government
of President Najib.
   The Soviets announced last fall they had completed the first half
of the withdrawal of their more than 100,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan. They have not yet announced when the pullout of the
remaining 50,000 troops would begin.
   Five weeks from a U.N.-set deadline that the Soviet Union agreed
in April to observe, Vorontsov said it was still ``too early to talk
about the schedule.''
   Asked if the Soviets might delay or suspend the pullout of the
remaining troops, Vorontsov, who is also Soviet first deputy foreign
minister, said: ``It's a serious danger. Things might shape up in
such a way that the Soviet Union will be unable to do what, in
principle, we've decided to do.''
   The diplomat blamed the continuation of hostilities in
Afghanistan on ``die-hard elements'' among the resistance and
continued military support from the United States.
   ``We don't see from the United States any indication of its
genuine desire to work for an Afghan settlement,'' Vorontsov told
the government news briefing. ``U.S. arms continue to be shipped to
(guerrillas in) Afghanistan.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S.
administration expects the Soviets to hold to the Feb. 15 pullout
date.
   ``We still expect them to meet the deadline,'' Fitzwater said.
``I don't believe we've had any official notification to the
contrary.... The last thing they officially told us was that they
would be out.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Soviets had
taken preparatory steps a few days ago to resume a troop withdrawal.
   ``I am not going to go into specifics in terms of what that means
in actual units or of people crossing borders, other than to say we
have indications that it has resumed,'' he said. ``There certainly
is no reason they cannot be out by Feb. 15.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in Stockholm,
Sweden, said he was sure the Soviet Union would pull all of its
troops out in time to meet the U.N.-arranged deadline.
   As well as brandishing the threat of a continued Soviet military
presence in Afghanistan, Vorontsov used his appearance before Moscow
reporters to make political overtures to the guerrillas, saying his
talks last week with Afghan opposition figures in Pakistan and Iran
convinced him a political settlement to Afghanistan's 10-year-old
civil war is possible.
   ``The main issue now is the formation by the Afghans themselves
of a broad-based government where all opposing groups and basic
political forces of the country would be represented,'' Vorontsov
said. ``This is something that's quite logical, and this is a
conclusion that those who are directly involved are coming very
close to now.''
   Guerrilla leaders, who ended talks in Pakistan with Vorontsov on
Saturday, refused Monday to resume direct talks with the Soviet
Union, contending the Kremlin was trying to secure a place for its
communist allies in a postwar government.
   ``Because the Soviets use threats, look for war rather than
peace, and disrespect Afghans' right of self-determination, we
believe that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary,'' said
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed guerrillas
based in Pakistan.
   Mojaddidi said the Soviets were trying ``to impose a government
of their choice'' on Afghans, and said the Soviets threatened to
supply Najib's government with new weapons if their terms were not
accepted.
   Vorontsov said the Kremlin is seeking the formation of a national
Afghan assembly, called a jurgah, to represent all parties in the
country. He indicated Moscow will continue to insist on inclusion of
Najib's government and People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in
the assembly.
   ``If it just brings together the Alliance of Seven, the Alliance
of Eight, or some new Alliance of 15, then there could be no use
that could be derived from that council,'' Vorontsov said, referring
to various coalitions of Afghan insurgent factions.
   He said the Soviets had not received a reply from Afghan
insurgents about the creation of a national assembly, but added, ``I
think they have understood that it's only diehard fanatics who
proclaim their wish and intention to continue the bloodletting....
we keep the door to negotiations open.''
   Vorontsov said that since Jan. 1, Soviet troops had joined Afghan
government forces in a cease-fire, and ``will not fire unless
attacked by the armed opposition.''
   Mojaddidi on Monday ruled out participation by the guerrillas in
the cease-fire, which had been sought by Vorontsov, but said they
would not attack departing Soviet soldiers.
   The Soviets intervened military in Afghanistan in December 1979
to prop up its battle-weary communists with more than 100,000 Red
Army troops. But in April 1988, after U.N.-sponsored talks in
Geneva, the Kremlin agreed to bring all its troops home by
mid-February 1989.

   A record 270 movies are eligible for Academy
Award consideration and will be listed in a pamphlet mailed next
week with Oscar nominations ballots, it was announced Tuesday.
   There were 263 contenders for Oscar consideration last year.
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce
1988 Oscar nominees in 21 categories Feb. 15, and trophies will be
presented March 29 during the 61st annual ceremonies.
   Feature-length motion pictures are eligible for 1988 Oscars if
they were publicly exhibited in 35mm or larger format for at least
seven days in a Los Angeles-area theater during the calendar year,
the academy said.
   Separate consideration is given to films competing for the
foreign language film Oscar. Foreign film contenders must have been
released in the country of origin between Nov. 1, 1987, and Oct. 31,
1988.
   Most films competing for documentary and short film Oscars aren't
included in the pamphlet because they are viewed and nominated by
special academy committees.

   A retired Navy chief petty officer was arrested
today on charges he tried to sell highly classified information
about anti-submarine warfare tactics to the Soviet Union, the FBI
said.
   Craig D. Kunkle, 39, of Virginia Beach, Va., was arrested by FBI
agents from the Norfolk, Va., field office on charges of espionage,
gathering or delivering classified information to a foreign
government and disclosure of classified information, said FBI
spokesman Charles W. Steinmetz.
   Steinmetz said the arrest resulted from an undercover
investigation by the FBI and the Naval Investigative Service that
began last month. ``We did stop him from providing the information''
to the Soviets, he said.
   The suspect was arrested while trying to sell classified
information to an undercover agent posing as a Soviet spy, according
to a source familiar with the case.
   The investigation was triggered when the suspect telephoned the
Soviet Embassy in Washington with an offer to pass along secret
information, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Telephone calls to the Soviet Embassy are routinly monitored by
U.S. counterintelligence agencies.
   Kunkle, a 12-year veteran of the Navy who was discharged in 1985,
could be given a life sentence if convicted.
   A private investigator and security guard in the Norfolk area,
Kunkle had served in anti-submarine squadrons in the Pacific and
Atlantic fleets during his Navy career, Steinmetz said. Kunkle held
a secret clearance, the spokesman said.
   Kunkle's activities were unrelated to the Norfolk-area spy ring
spearheaded by former naval officer John Walker, who is serving a
life sentence for selling valuable Navy secrets to the Soviets,
Steinmetz said.

<HEAD>A Million Tires Shredded In War on Mosquitos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since June, a million tires have been
shredded and hauled away from a tire dump here. The shredding ends
this week, completing destruction of a major mosquito breeding
ground.
   The tires had been home to the dreaded Asian Tiger mosquitoes,
which were thought to have been imported from Asia inside used tires
brought to Jacksonville for recapping.
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri tossed a ceremonial last tire in the shredder
Monday, although 3,000 to 4,000 still remain to be shredded. The
work is being done by the Oxford Tire Co. of Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``I'm extremely happy to see that our city has taken the
necessary steps to eliminate a serious health and fire hazard. It's
wonderful to see this 12-acre site become usable land again,''
Hazouri said.
   Night foreman Norm Park said the work would be finished by
Wednesday, and grass will be planted on the site later this week.
The site was called the Frasier Tire dump after the retreading
company that first began dumping unusable tires there.
   Ann Shorstein, an aide to Hazouri, said she is optimistic the
city will be able to recoup the $538,000 it paid for the project
through a new exise tax on tires. The law, which took effect Jan. 1,
adds 50 cents to the price of a new tire this year and $1 next year.
   Workers at the Frasier Tire dump had been shredding since June
21, six days a week, up to 20 hours a day.
   The shredded tire chips, about the size of charcoal briquets, are
sold by Oxford to a Greek firm, Titan Cement Co., which uses the
rubber for industrial fuel in a cement plant in Athens.
   Oxford hired an entomologist to ensure that neither the
mosquitoes nor their eggs could survive the shredding.
   The Asian mosquitoes are more aggressive than native mosquitoes
and can withstand lower temperatures, officials said. They also have
been known to carry dengue fever, which in rare cases can be fatal.

<HEAD>Georgia O'Keeffe's Tree Turns Topsy-Turvy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exhibition planners went out on a limb in
hanging a familiar painting by Georgia O'Keeffe upside-down from
what her fans are used to, but a curator says that was what the
artist wanted.
   At the Wadsworth Atheneum, which owns the 1929 painting ``The
Lawrence Tree,'' the work was hung with the tree extending from the
lower right-hand corner of the canvas. The painting depicts a
ponderosa pine O'Keeffe encountered on D.H. Lawrence's Taos, N.M.,
ranch.
   But since the painting has been part of a traveling retrospective
of O'Keeffe's work organized by the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., it has been hung with the base of the tree at the
top left corner.
   The position was changed because of a 1930 photograph and a 1931
letter by the artist that were made available to exhibition planners
by O'Keeffe's longtime companion and the manager of her estate, said
Elizabeth Kornhauser, the Wadsworth's curator of American painting,
sculpture and drawing.
   When O'Keeffe sold the painting to the Wadsworth, ``she indicated
to us that it could be hung in any direction,'' Kornhauser said
Tuesday. ``Of course, you have to keep in mind that ... a lot of
time had elapsed betwen 1929 and 1979, when we bought the painting.''
   The artist died in 1986 at age 98.
   However, the new evidence shows the artist cared very much about
the position at the time she did the work.
   A photograph of a 1930 exhibit of the painting hung by O'Keeffe
herself shows the tree with its trunk extending from the top. Also,
in a letter from O'Keeffe to a friend written in 1931, she
complained that in a later exhibition the work was hung the opposite
way and that was not what she had in mind.
   When the painting was first exhibited in the new-old position at
the National Gallery, ``there was quite a big outcry,'' Kornhauser
said.
   ``People do know the picture and have gotten used to it the other
way,'' said Katie Ziglar, the National Gallery's public information
specialist. ``They blinked and said, `What's this?'''
   Kornhauser said she is convinced that the retrospective is
correct in the way it is displaying the painting, and the atheneum
will follow suit when the painting is returned later this year.

<HEAD>Hungarians Announce Soviet Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary said Tuesday some Soviet
soldiers would be leaving its soil soon, but it was vague in making
the first announcement of action on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge to
withdraw forces from Eastern Europe.
   In a speech Dec. 7 at the United Nations, the Soviet leader
promised to reduce military forces by half a million in two years
and pull 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks out of East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Gorbachev's commitment was seen as a boost to East-West talks in
Vienna on reducing conventional forces in Europe, which could begin
by March.
   Col.-Gen. Ferenc Karpati, the defense minister, said in a
television interview Tuesday the preparations for withdrawing some
of the 62,000 Red Army troops from Hungary were nearly complete. He
said an armored division was among the units scheduled to leave.
   The official news agency MTI quoted Communist Party chief Karoly
Grosz as telling the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai the pullout
``is to commence within weeks,'' but neither he nor Karpati gave a
date.
   Karpati refused to name a date when asked later by an Associated
Press reporter. He said the Gorbachev speech indicated withdrawal
would be more likely late this year, but ``it could also be a
shorter period (sooner). The preparatory work is ending.''
   He would not answer a question about whether a symbolic
withdrawal of a small force might come before the Vienna talks on
conventional forces begin.
   The defense minister said pulling out some Red Army forces was a
``political step ... intended to show the world the Soviet Union is
not insisting on the idea of having troops in these countries.''
   Hungary, a leading proponent of reform in the Soviet bloc, has
welcomed Gorbachev's plans for reduced defense spending and
political liberalization.
   In the Hungarian parliament Tuesday, members debated two new laws
on freedom of assembly and association that should give citizens the
right to hold demonstrations and form independent organizations and
political parties.
   Several deputies objected to a provision in the bill on
associations that, in effect, would prevent political parties from
being active until next year.
   Votes were scheduled for Wednesday.
   Dozens of independent political groups have sprung up in recent
months, many with specific platforms. At least two are full-fledged
parties and want to enter candidates in the 1990 elections.
   Frigyes Puja, a former foreign minister voicing the reservations
of more conservative Communists, asked that reference to ``political
parties'' be removed and a separate statute regulating parties be
passed next year.
   Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said in the debate the rights of
association and assembly are ``inalienable.'' He also outlined plans
to make Hungary the second nation in the Soviet bloc after Poland to
allow an alternative to compulsory military service.
   Karpati said in the TV interview the alternative-service program
should become law by midyear. About 100 Hungarians are in jail for
refusing to serve the required 18 months in the army.
   Poland and Hungary have serious economic problems, including
large debts to Western banks, and are reducing their defense
budgets. After Gorbachev promised the Soviet troop withdrawals,
Karpati announced cuts in defense spending for 1989 of 17 percent in
real terms.
   In a speech made public over the weekend, Gorbachev said
preliminary study had shown Soviet defense spending could be reduced
without endangering security.
   Hungary pioneered economic reform in the Soviet bloc during the
1960s, but stalled in the 1970s. Grosz is promoting market-oriented
changes in hopes of improving the economy and reducing the $17
billion foreign debt, highest per capita in the Eastern bloc.
   Price increases for many foodstuffs took effect Monday. Thousands
of workers in northeastern Hungary held a 10-minute warning strike
and official trade unions demanded wage hikes to catch up.
   Statistics published Tuesday said 2.6 million of Hungary's 10.6
million people were officially classified as poor in 1987. No
figures are available for 1988.

   His fans thought James Brown might be a
captive audience. But they've found imprisonment hasn't much
improved their odds of seeing the ``Godfather of Soul.''
   Officials say they have turned away many requests to visit Brown
in prison. ``It's not like a hospital, and it's not like some social
camp,'' said Department of Corrections spokesman Francis Archibald.
A busload of fans was turned away last week.
   Brown, 55, is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault
and failing to stop for police during a two-state chase last
September.
   Brown, who works in the kitchen of the 275-inmate,
minimum-security State Park Correctional Center near Columbia, is
allowed to use the pay phones in his dormitory when he isn't working.
   And inmates can have visitors on weekends, but they either must
be relatives or have their names included on a list of no more than
six people submitted by the inmate. Ministers can visit at other
times.

   U.S. soprano Carol Vaness finally got to sing in
``Die Fledermaus'' from start to finish at the Royal Opera House.
   ``I've sung all the famous bits before but this was the first
time I had to put them together,'' she said after plaudits Monday
from a crowded house for her Rosalinde in the first Covent Garden
production of the new year.
   ``I was surprised it got moving so well because there's so much
talking in it, but there's a lot of care in this opera house,'' she
said in a dressing-room interview.
   The production has an English libretto, rewritten with wit and
topical jokes about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and glasnost by
John Mortimer, who adapted for television Evelyn Waugh's
``Brideshead Revisited'' and his own ``Rumpole of the Bailey.''
   Ms. Vaness, who lives in New York but regards Los Angeles as her
hometown, is the only foreigner in the cast. She said she tried a
British accent.
   ``But the producer shouted at me, `No, no.' He said I sounded
like a cross between Batman and Mae West. So I went original and was
just myself _ no problems. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.''

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was awarded the Olof Palme Prize for public service Tuesday,
and said he would set up a scholarship for peacemakers with the
$16,000 prize.
   Perez de Cuellar accepted the award from Lisbet Palme, widow of
the four-term Swedish prime minister and U.N. mediator who was
assassinated nearly three years ago.
   The U.N. chief said the award would go toward building a trust
fund to establish ``a scholarship for students interested in
peacemaking and peacekeeping.''
   In a speech, he said the focus of his efforts this year would be
to consolidate the ``very favorable trends which have emerged and
bring them to bear on the quest for a solution of all major
international disputes.''
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson told the audience of dignitaries
that Sweden had set aside money in next year's budget, submitted
Tuesday to Parliament, to contribute soldiers to the U.N. peace
force being created to monitor Namibia's transition to independence.
   The Palme Prize was first awarded last year to Cyril Ramahosa,

   Walt Disney Co. chief Michael Eisner
earned $40.2 million last year, mainly in profits from a
stock-option plan, to remain among the nation's highest paid
executives.
   Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, realized a
$32.6 million profit from the company stock options program last
year and a $6.8 million bonus in addition to his $750,000 salary, a
proxy statement shows.
   The studio executive was given the option to purchase up to 2
million Disney shares at $14.54 per share when he joined the company
in 1984. At the close of trading Monday, Disney stock was selling at
$68 a share.
   Eisner's bonus, up from about $6 million in 1987, is calculated
using a formula calling for a bonus equal to 2 percent of the amount
Disney earnings exceed a 9 percent return on shareholder equity.
   Proxy material disclosed Monday that Eisner purchased 683,857
shares of Disney stock last year. Of that, he sold 330,390 for a
profit of $32.6 million. He still holds options to purchase n
additional 948,143 shares.
   Eisner now holds 353,467 Disney shares directly, or less than 1
percent of outstanding shares. His wife and children hold an
additional 28,800 shares.
   Under Eisner, Disney has had a string of hit movies and increased
revenues at its theme parks.

<HEAD>Man Pleads Guilty In Campaign Scheme To Help Cranston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance broker has pleaded guilty to
making illegal campaign contributions in a scheme to help re-elect
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston because of his outspoken support for Israel.
   Michael B. Altman of the Sherman Oaks area faces a maximum of one
year in prison and a $360,000 fine when he is sentenced March 27 by
U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew.
   Altman pleaded guilty Monday to a single misdemeanor count of
aiding pro-Israel activist Michael R. Goland in making illegal
campaign donations during the 1986 election narrowly won by
Cranston, a Democrat. He also agreed to testify against Goland and
two other men charged in the case.
   Authorities said Cranston was not involved in the scheme.
   Goland and two associates plotted to support Cranston, who was
outspokenly pro-Israel in the campaign, by illegally contributing
$120,000 to the campaign of American Independent Party candidate Ed
Vallen, the indictment alleged.
   Goland and the two associates have pleaded innocent to four
felony counts in the same case. The others charged are Lyle R.
Weisman, 31, of Beverly Hills, and Sandor E. Habalow, 45, of West
Los Angeles.
   Prosecutors said the aim of the scheme was to win some support
for Vallen through a television campaign that would siphon votes
away from Republican challenger Ed Zschau, thus improving Cranston's
chances for victory.
   After paying for production of the advertisement, the defendants,
in order to circumvent federal election laws limiting the size of
individual donations, sought $120,000 in contributions from 55
individuals who were later reimbursed for amounts ranging from
$1,000 to $4,000, prosecutors said.
   Vallen wound up getting 109,916 votes in the election _ about
5,000 more than Cranston's slim victory margin over Zschau.

<HEAD>Court Rules Judges May Prevent Defendant-Attorney Talks During Trial
Recess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminal defendants have no constitutional
right to talk to their lawyers during brief trial recesses, the
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   By a 6-3 vote in a case from South Carolina, the justices said
trial judges, in the interest of furthering the search for truth,
may prevent a defendant about to undergo cross-examination from
conferring with his or her attorney.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously that states may tax all telephone calls _ even
interstate calls _ charged to in-state numbers. The court upheld a 5
percent tax imposed by Illinois, which raises $10 million a month
for the state.
   The justices were told that 10 other states have similar taxes.
They are Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
   _Clarified, in an important decision for anyone suing a
government worker for alleged civil rights violations, how to
determine filing deadlines for such lawsuits. The 9-0 decision said
a man who accused two police officers at the State University of New
York of beating him did not wait too long to sue.
   In the trial-recess case, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
court, ``When a defendant becomes a witness, he has no
constitutional right to consult with his lawyer while he is
testifying.''
   The truth more likely may emerge if a defendant who has been
testifying and is about to undergo cross-examination is not allowed
to talk to his attorney, Stevens said. The search for truth will be
aided even if the defendant was not about to receive improper
coaching from his lawyer during the break, he continued.
   ``Permitting a witness ... to consult with counsel after direct
examination but before cross-examination grants the witness an
opportunity to regroup and regain a poise and sense of strategy that
the unaided witness would not possess,'' Stevens said.
   The court in 1976 ruled that a defendant's right to help from his
lawyer was violated when he was barred from talking with the lawyer
during an overnight recess.
   But brief recesses are different, Stevens said, because
lawyer-client talks during such breaks would be limited to the
defendant's own testimony. During an overnight recess the talks
could encompass such broader matters as ``the availability of other
witnesses, trial tactics or even the possibility of negotiating a
plea bargain,'' he said.
   The Constitution guarantees a defendant will be allowed to talk
to his lawyer about such matters, Stevens said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said the
ruling is ``a lapse in this court's commitment to fundamental
fairness for criminal defendants.''
   Marshall said prosecution witnesses generally are free to confer
with the prosecutor during brief recesses.
   Also, he said, the search for truth could be furthered by ``a few
soothing words from counsel to the agitated or nervous defendant
facing the awesome power of the state.''
   Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joined
Marshall's dissent.
   Voting with Stevens were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The ruling upheld the conviction of Donald Ray Perry, sentenced
to life in prison for murder, kidnapping and criminal assault in the
killing of Mary Heimberger. Her body was found March 7, 1981, in a
wooded area in Richland County, S.C.
   Perry confessed to police that he shot the victim, but said it
was an accident.
   Ms. Heimberger had been raped, shot in both kneecaps and fatally
shot in the chest.
   Perry was barred from talking to his lawyer during a 15-minute
trial recess.
   He filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled that
his rights had been violated.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the
conviction in 1987.
   The appeals court said there must be evidence that denying a
defendant the opportunity to confer with his attorney prejudiced the
case against the defendant before his conviction can be overturned.
   The Supreme Court did not adopt that reasoning. Citing the case
of the overnight recess, Stevens said there are instances when the
defendant must be allowed to confer with his lawyer without any
proof of prejudice. But brief recesses do not qualify for that
treatment, Stevens said.

   The round of talks, the 13th since negotiations began in November

   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos would not comment on the
talks. He said a statement would be issued after negotiators brief
Premier Andreas Papandreou at their conclusion Thursday.
   A five-year agreement giving the United States access to the
bases _ two near Athens and two on the southern Aegean Sea island of
Crete _ expired Dec. 20.
   Under the old accord, the United States has 17 months to
dismantle the bases or negotiate a new agreement.
   A major obstacle blocking a new agreement is Papandreou's
insistence that the United States help solve Greece's disputes with
neighboring Turkey over military control of the Aegean, its seabed
mineral rights and the Cyprus problem.
   U.S. officials have said they don't want to involve regional
disputes in the bilateral bases talks.
   Papandreou, who has said he will hold a national referendum on
the installations, is expected to use the bases issue to attract
leftist votes in the June elections.
   Popular support for the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement has
eroded in recent months after scandals implicated senior government
and party officials.
   The premier has already said his government plans to scrap one of
the U.S. installations _ Hellenikon Air Force base adjacent to
Athens Airport.

   Nancy Reagan urged school children from various
nations gathered at the Rockefeller Center skating rink Tuesday to
carry the anti-drug ``Just Say No'' message around the world.
   The first lady told the group of about 50 children, some from the
United Nations International School, that they should feel good
about themselves, ``not just because you're standing on skates. Feel
good because you've chosen to say no to drugs and alcohol.''
   Brian Boitano, the 1988 Olympic figure skating champion, former
Olympic skater Jo Jo Starbuck and members of the New York Rangers
hockey team joined the youngsters for the ``Just Say No'' rally. NBC
television weatherman Willard Scott was master of ceremonies.
   On Monday night, Mrs. Reagan was saluted by the fashion industry
for her contribution to American design. She received a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America
at a ceremony at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<HEAD>Drug Test Accuracy 97 Percent in Test of Selected Labs, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-one laboratories following the
guidelines of an association of lab professionals and researchers
had an overall accuracy rate of 97 percent in testing urine samples
for narcotics, the director of a new study said Tuesday.
   ``After today, inaccuracies should not be used as an argument
against drug testing,'' said Christopher S. Frings, director of the
study conducted by the American Association of Clinical Chemistry
   Another expert said a problem of accuracy still exists among the
150 to 200 American laboratories that test for drugs.
   However, Frings said, ``The AACC does not extrapolate these
findings to say that all labs do good drug testing. We maintain that
labs that follow key procedures can test at a very high accuracy.''
   Frings, a professor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
said the overall error rate of 3 percent in the association's study
included no findings of false positives, meaning that none of the
drug-free samples was inaccurately identified as showing evidence of
drug use.
   The study involved sending urine samples that had been
adulterated with drugs to 31 selected laboratories that agreed to
the accuracy test. The test specimens were disguised so the
labortories could not identify them, and they were included with
other samples that were to be routinely tested.
   ``The laboratories had no way of knowing when they received the
(test) specimens,'' said Frings.
   Each of the samples was tested for evidence of five different
drugs _ cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine
(PCP).
   Frings said 29 percent of the laboratories scored an accuracy of
100 percent; 64 percent had an accuracy of 97 percent or higher, and
the lowest score was 89 percent. He declined to identify the
laboratories or to give a numerical breakdown of the findings.
   All of the laboratories included in the study had participated
earlier in an open proficiency test by the association, and Frings
said the labs that participated in the new study all complied with
the standards approved by the association.
   Kenneth H. Davis Jr., senior research chemist at the Research
Triangle Institute in North Carolina, and a co-author of a federal
study on laboratory accuracies published last September in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, said in a telephone
interview that results in the association's study could be biased by
the pre-qualifying of the test laboratories used in the blind test.
   Davis said his survey of 50 laboratories showed 69 percent of the
samples were tested accurately in blind surveys. About 82 percent of
the tests were accurate in open surveys, when the laboratories knew
which samples were being tested. He said the false positives in his
study ranged up to 1.6 percent.
   ``A problem does still exist'' in the accuracy of testing for
drugs, Davis said. However, he agreed with the association that with
proper facilities, personnel and techniques, ``I see no reason why
drug testing canot be extremely accurate.''
   Drug-testing accuracy has become a subject of rising interest,
partly because of President Reagan's 1986 order calling for a
drug-free federal workplace. A federal program calls for the random
testing of workers, and an estimated 50,000 federal employees were
tested last year despite court challenges. The number to be tested
this year could pass 200,000, officials say, and there are plans
later this year to require testing of millions of transportation
workers in private business.
   Many cases challenging the constitutionality of drug testing are
on appeal in federal courts.

<TEXT>
   When a library evicted Muffin the cat
from its corridors and crannies after seven years' residence, a
93-year-old animal lover was so miffed she wrote the library out of
her will.
   ``Everybody loved that cat,'' Marjorie Horton, who had planned to
leave the Putnam Valley Library as much as $30,000, said Tuesday.
``I was furious. I wrote them a nice letter. I'm not some young
snotnose. But no one listened. Now, not one penny will go to the
library.''
   Muffin appeared on the doorstep of the privately run library as a
kitten one cold February night seven years ago and settled
comfortably among the volumes of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Tolstoy,
Eliot and the rest.
   But her fate took a Dickensian turn last year.
   Amid allegations that Muffin had swatted some children without
provocation and, more importantly, that one of the library trustees
was allergic to cats, the facility set about finding the tabby a new
home.
   Muffin was formally evicted by a trustees' vote in September,
although she stayed on for a few more months while a new home was
found and her supporters wrote letters and gathered petition
signatures.
   ``We had to make a decision,'' said Peter Grosewald, library
board chairman. ``The only issue is access. We have to assure access
to everybody.''
   Grosewald said the unidentified trustee, a volunteer like the
rest, complained that she could not work in the library despite
taking allergy shots and efforts to confine the cat to an upstairs
room.
   The trustee offered to resign, he said, but the board decided
that in light of other complaints about allergic reactions and the
alleged swipes at children, it was Muffin who had to go.
   The September vote, which was confidential, prompted threatening
phone calls, Grosewald said.
   Former trustee Kathleen Devlin, who gathered 300 signatures to
keep Muffin, pointed out that the cat had earned her keep as a
mouser.
   ``I feel so badly about that cat,'' said Mrs. Horton, who had
split her time between Putnam Valley and Manhattan for more than 80
years before moving permanently to Manhattan with her own cat last
year.
   She said Grosewald didn't even answer her letter on the cat's
behalf and that a new will has been drafted directing that whatever
money remains after her death be divided among three animal shelters.
   Grosewald emphasizes that Muffin now has a good home and that
access to the library has been opened to everyone.
   He said the library relies on contributions and donations, but
that Mrs. Horton's money wasn't everything: ``Even if it were a
million dollars, it would still be a hard choice.''

<TEXT>
   The former law partner of ex-Rep. Mario Biaggi
was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison and fined $220,000 for
his role in the Wedtech racketeering case.
   Bernard Ehrlich, 59, who has admitted to having mental problems,
cried intermittently during sentencing.
   ``I feel terrible about the employees and shareholders of
Wedtech, especially the employees who I've worked closely with,''
Ehrlich said. ``I feel sick over what I've done.''
   Ehrlich, who was found guilty of 11 counts of racketeering,
conspiracy, extortion and bribery, remains free on bail pending
appeal.
   He was convicted last summer with Biaggi and three other people
of turning the Wedtech Corp., the now-defunct South Bronx military
contractor, into a racketeering enterprise for their personal gain.
   ``You played a major and extensive role in this criminal
enterprise,'' U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley said. ``You
weren't only doing the bidding of Biaggi, but you corrupted your
co-defendant John Margiotta (a former Small Business Administration
official).''
   Also convicted in the scheme, which charged the defendants
received $1.8 million in cash and stocks from Wedtech, were Biaggi's
son, Richard, and former Bronx borough President Stanley Simon.
   Ehrlich was a former major general of the National Guard, where
he served as commander of the Rainbow Division. He was stripped of
his National guard rank at an administrative hearing in 1986.
   He was acquitted in December 1987 of state charges that he bribed
a former National Guard general to win favored treatment for Wedtech.
   Ehrlich's attorney, Peter Driscoll, asked Motley for leniency.
   ``He has both an overwhelming and relentless guilt about the
wrong he has caused,'' Driscoll said, adding that Ehrlich is
receiving counseling and had been hospitalized twice for mental
problems.
   Biaggi, who resigned after serving as congressman of the district
that included the Bronx for almost 20 years, was sentenced to eight
years in the Wedtech case. He is appealing the conviction.

   Syrian-backed Shiite militiamen buried
their dead Tuesday but vowed a fight to the finish against
Iranian-backed rivals, rejecting moves from Damascus and Tehran to
halt three days of savage battle.
   Police said seven people were killed and 20 wounded in Tuesday's
fighting, bringing the total to 87 dead and 220 injured since Sunday.
   Militiamen of the mainstream Amal used Syrian-provided tanks,
howitzers and rocket launchers to bombard a mountain enclave where
they have trapped rival Hezbollah militiamen, but they failed to
dislodge the fundamentalists from their strategic perch.
   A police spokesman said the Hezbollahis have ``shaken off
repeated assaults'' on Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of the provincial
capital, Sidon.
   The village is the key to a triangular stronghold where 500
pro-Iranian fighters are under siege just northwest of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said about 1,000 Amal fighters were attacking in a pincer movement.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, President Hafez Assed met Iran's
first deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, to discuss
the situation, Syria's official news agency reported without
elaboration.
   Shiite sources said Besharati is expected in Beirut to mediate
between the warring factions.
   However, one Amal commander vowed there will be no cease-fire.
   ``There is no room for negotiations with the Iranian delegates.
There is no room for any truce. Our decision is to finish off
Hezbollah in the south,'' said area commander Atef Aoun.
   Nearly 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since the
rival militias first clashed in April in an ongoing battle to
dominate the 1 million Shiites who are the biggest sect among
Lebanon's 4 million people.
   Amal on Monday recaptured a chain of hilltop villages in Iklim
el-Tiffah, or Apple Province, which Hezbollah had seized Sunday.
Police said both groups have committed ``horrific atrocities.''
   Aoun spoke in Kfar Filla village, 1.2 miles west of Jbaa, during
a funeral procession for five militiamen.
   Women ululated in grief, waving photographs of the deceased and
chanting anti-Iranian slogans.
   ``Death to Khomeini, Death to the Party of Satan,'' they wailed
as male mourners, several in fatigues and toting automatic rifles,
yelled the Islamic war cry ``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is great!''
   The police spokesman said Hezbollah fighters now were sandwiched
in a narrow nine-square-mile strip between advancing Amal forces and
the western flank of the Israeli security zone.
   They also are entrenched in two nearby hamlets and some pine
woods.
   Sheik Kamel Wehbeh, Jbaa's imam, or preacher, told the reporters
the region's predominantly Shiite population ``does not want
Hezbollah, which commits massacres, kills prisoners and destroys
villages.''
   Wehbeh, who suffered shrapnel wounds in the neck, left arm and
left leg during a tour of the region Monday, spoke from his bed in
Sidon's Hammoud hospital.
   The police spokesman said about 15,000 predominantly Shiite
civilians have fled their villages and sought refuge in
Amal-controlled regions of south Lebanon.
   He said Hezbollah gunmen ``stabbed to death several civilians and
Amal militiamen ... Some of the victims were found with their
throats cut and others with their heads chopped off.''
   Hezbollah wants to create an Islamic republic in Lebanon
fashioned after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iran. The more secular
Amal rejects Iran's influence.
   Amal drove Hezbollah out of most of south Lebanon in a four-day
crackdown in April. Less than a month later, Hezbollah retaliated
and drove Amal out of south Beirut slums in a three-week
confrontation.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, sent in its army to
quell the fighting. But violence erupted again in November and
spilled over into west Beirut.

   Investigators had few clues to the
killing of a Roman Catholic priest whose body was burned atop a
trash fires, officials said Tuesday.
   ``We have no idea who did it or why,'' Tuscaloosa County Homicide
Chief Warren Miller said.
   The burned body of the Rev. Francis Craven, 53-year-old pastor of
St. Williams Catholic Church in Guntersville, was found Saturday on
a dirt road by a man taking his daily walk. The body was identified
Monday through dental records.
   He died of head injuries, said Kenneth E. Warner of the Alabama
Department of Forensic Sciences. Warner said it appeared that more
than one person was involved.
   Capt. Shirley Fields of the Sheriff's Department said authorities
were looking for Craven's blue and silver van, which he had picked
up that afternoon at the airport after returning to Birmingham from
Fort Myers, Fla., where he was visiting friends.
   Craven had called the friends to tell them he had arrived in
Birmingham and was going to return to Guntersville, where he was to
say afternoon Mass, said Lacy Galloway, chief deputy with the
Marshall County Sheriff's Department.
   He never made it home, prompting colleagues to report him missing.
   A funeral was scheduled Fridday in Birmingham.

<HEAD>Commerce Secretary: Let Private Business Work in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing Commerce Secretary C. William Verity
likened the nation's space agency to ``a glorified trucking
operation'' Tuesday and said government is not stepping aside fast
enough to allow private enterprise to flourish in space.
   ``Our interest in space, quite simply, has outgrown the space
agency,'' Verity said. ``Consequently it's time to rethink that
agency's mission. I suggest we recognize that NASA should do what
was envisioned in its original charter 30 years ago; NASA should be
responsible for promoting space science, research and exploration.''
   Speaking to the Space Business Roundtable, whose members include
representatives of companies doing business in space, Verity said
government must quit competing.
   ``There can be no real private sector space commerce if
government is intimately involved in the planning, ownership, and
operation of the underlying infrastructure,'' he said. ``By
exercising restraint in purchasing new hardware and facilities and
instead purchasing services from you, government can make way for
private capital to be invested in the national space
infrastructure.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has financed
the space shuttle and the space station ``at the expense of space
science and exploration,'' Verity said.
   Only Monday, the Reagan administration proposed to back the space
station with $2.1 billion construction startup funds this year.
``Can we really justify spending 30 billion taxpayer dollars on
something we aren't sure how we're going to use?'' Verity asked.
   According to the commerce secretary, ``NASA still seems to
believe that the drama of humans in space is needed to win attention
and congressional support, but an unmanned space program could put
the U.S. back into front-line technology _ at far less cost.''
   He said he speaks not only as a government official but also as a
grandfather who sees space as a place where his grandchildren will
live and work.
   ``Will the future Columbus study space science, only to discover
on graduation that his career options are limited to a government
bureaucracy that runs a glorified trucking operation, or a cost-plus
contractor that just fills orders?'' Verity asked. ``I hope that
person finds a system with room for entrepeneurs and explorers.''

<HEAD>Bomb, Probably Semtex, Blew Up in Front of Wing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 ruptured
the fuselage in the area of the cargo hold just ahead of the wing,
and probably contained Semtex plastic explosives, authorities said
Tuesday.
   ``Initial examinations have established that the explosive device
ruptured the fuselage on the left side in the area of the No. 1
cargo-baggage hold just forward of the wing,'' said a bulletin from
the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
   It did not say what explosives were used, but Transport Secretary
Paul Channon said it was ``very probably, but not certainly,
Semtex.''
   The authorities did not disclose how they arrived at their
conclusions.
   Semtex, made in Czechoslovakia, is a powerful plastic explosive
that is difficult to detect and is believed to be available to
several terrorist groups.
   The indications that Semtex was used ``point to some
well-organized and well-supplied terrorist group,'' Channon told
Parliament.
   ``It is too early to say yet where the article which contained
the explosive originated,'' he said.
   Although Czechoslovakia denied it was Semtex that blew up Flight
103 on Dec. 21, it is sending four experts to Britain to assist the
investigation. Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said they
would arrive Wednesday and Thursday.
   Flight 103 blew up at 31,000 feet, killing all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, the Scottish town that bore
the brunt of the falling debris.
   Channon rejected accusations that the government refrained from
warning the public of a bomb threat against Pan Am.
   Referring to evidence that U.S. embassies were warned of a
specific threat to blow up a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to London,
he said such warnings were constantly being received, and ``in the
rare circumstances'' where changes are needed in airport security,
these were implemented.
   But in this case, he said, the British were given to understand
that the threat ``had little credibility.''
   Channon said the warning reached his department Dec. 9 in a
Federal Aviation Administration bulletin, and ``as is usually the
case, it contained the explicit caveat that it was not to be further
disseminated without the specific approval of the FAA's Director of
Civil Aviation Security.''
   The warning identified the airline and the Frankfurt-U.S. route,
he said, but ``no mention was made of London. And the warning
threatened that an attack would take place within two weeks, which
expired before the tragedy took place on Dec. 21.''
   Therefore, he said, it was decided that security at British
airports was tight enough and no further measures were needed.
   Immediately after the bombing, additional hold and cabin baggage
checks were ordered, along with tighter security around parked
aircraft, he said.
   On Jan. 5, further measures were ordered ``in relation to cargo,
misrouted baggage and cabin baggage,'' he said without elaborating.
He added that other longer-term measures ``are now being vigorously
pursued.''
   Channon promised to consider a suggestion by lawmaker Michael
Colvin that every air ticket carry a $1 levy to raise $180 million a
year for better security systems.
   In Lockerbie, meanwhile, police said Tuesday they had recovered
and identified another body from the crash. They said they still
were searching for the bodies of seven local residents and 21
passengers.
   Police released for burial the body of Lockerbie residents
Rosaleen Somerville, 40, whose husband, John, and children, Paul,
13, and Lynsey, 10, also died. The children's bodies are still
missing.

   Mountaineer Tom Whittaker once hovered
between life and death for 10 days, rallying out of the pain he
incurred in a car accident to persuade doctors to save one of his
feet.
   Nine years later, equipped with a high-tech artificial foot,
Whittaker will join the American Everest Expedition with the goal in
May of becoming the first handicapped climber to conquer the world's
highest peak.
   Watch out if he gets to the top of the world.
   ``That'll blow my drawers off and it will take years to get the
silly grin off my face!'' he laughed.
   Then the man who has devoted his life to helping others overcome
their handicaps addded:
   ``It's a challenge of life as much as a challenge of Everest. You
have to reach deep into yourself to do something like this.''
   Whittaker was driving back to his home in Sun Valley, Idaho, from
a Thanksgiving holiday when an out-of-control car struck his car
head-on. He suffered multiple fractures and damage to both knees.
   ``The original prognosis was they were going to take both feet
off,'' Whittaker, 40, recalled.
   ``I managed to impress on them how important feet are to
mountaineers. I was able to convince them, and they left my foot
intact,'' said Whittaker, who had moved from his native Wales a year
before.
   Surgeons repaired what they could and reconstructed what they
could not of Whittaker's crushed legs. His right foot had to be
amputated, but he still had his left _ and a desire to overcome his
handicap and repay the kindness of a community.
   Before his accident, the mountaineer with expeditions to the
Alps, Spanish Pyrenees and Alaska's Mount McKinley had earned a
master's degree in counseling at Idaho State University and served
as a graduate assistant in an outdoor recreation program.
   The university established a relief fund that helped defray some
of his $30,000 in medical bills not covered by insurance. The school
also provided him with a room and living expenses during the three
months he was bedridden.
   ``I felt I had this debt of gratitude I wanted to pay back to the
community, so I put my master's degree in counseling to work in a
local hospital'' helping others adjust to their handicaps, Whittaker
said in a telephone interview from his Pocatello home.
   While giving a kayaking lesson to a struggling man with a spinal
cord injury, Whittaker noticed tears pouring down the student's face.
   ``I feared I shouldn't have forced him and was trying to blurt
out an apology,'' Whittaker said. ``But he said, `Hey, Whittaker,
you're way off base. You don't need to apologize. This is the first
time I've felt alive in 2{ years.' That basically gives me my
validation for what I do now.''
   Six years ago, he started the university's Cooperative Wilderness
Handicapped Outdoor Group with fewer than 20 students. Today 400 are
enrolled and he lectures throughout the world.
   ``The motto of our group is `Dare to be different.' The whole
idea is to empower people with disabilities and help them with their
personal rehabilitation,'' he explained. ``We're ordinary people
doing stuff; we're not outdoor jocks.
   ``We have children 4 years old, we have disabled people of up to
72 years old in our program _ everybody from kids to grandfathers
and grandmothers.''
   The courage of his students inspired Whittaker, too. Equipped
with an artificial foot fashioned by a blacksmith friend, he
returned to the peaks, climbing Canada's notorious Bugaboos during a
snowstorm in 1981 and scaling the tough north face of Wyoming's
Grand Teton in 1987.
   But until three weeks ago, a shot at conquering Everest was a
dream Whittaker considered out-of-reach. Then came a call from the
Salt Lake City-based American Everest Expedition.
   The March-through-May expedition also includes New Zealand's
Peter Hillary, son of Sir Edmund Hillary. In 1953, the elder Hillary
and the Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay became the first men to conquer
Everest.
   ``When I was involved in my car accident, all hopes and dreams of
aspiring to Everest died for me,'' Whittaker said. ``When the
telephone rang and (I was) asked if I would like to go ... it just
about knocked me off my stool.''
   Expedition co-leader Peter Athans, of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., said that
while Whittaker will be the first handicapped person to assault
Everest, he ``is a very fit and active guy.''
   Whittaker said if he conquers the mountain it will be on his own
merits, not ``on the backs'' of his teammates.
   San Diego's Daw Co. is designing $40,000 worth of new artificial
feet to enable Whittaker to handle a 150-mile trek over snowfields
to the mountain's base camp and the climb itself.
   ``I don't have to go to the top to have a fullfilling
experience,'' said Whittaker, who conceded high-altitude swelling
and circulation problems with his stump could halt his ascent.
   ``To be successful ... we just have to get one of our (team)
members on the summit. I'm a member of the team. All I need to know
is that I've tried hard and did well.''

   Delegates to the world conference on chemical
weapons say privately the intense efforts to find common ground
illustrate how hard it will be to achieve a ban.
   Public speeches evoke horrifying images of children frozen in
anguished death from poison gas, but national interests clash over
what to do about it.
   Attention focused Tuesday on Arab demands to link a chemical
weapons treaty with a nuclear ban. This and deep-seated conflicts
paralyzed movement toward what American and French organizers hoped
would be consensus.
   Even if wording is found for a political declaration in Paris,
several delegates said, the implications are not promising for
negotiations in Geneva that have made little headway toward a treaty
in 10 years.
   ``Export controls on chemicals and technology are just too
sensitive for the Third World,'' said a senior U.S. delegate, who
like most others interviewed declined to be identified. ``They won't
have it. This means we can't expect anything with teeth in it.''
   American negotiators want tough export controls to stop West
Germans and other Europeans from selling chemicals that can be
blended into poison gas, or from providing the expertise needed to
wage chemical warfare.
   The Germans want provisions for rapid challenge inspections,
which Washington says are inconclusive and pose a problem in the
United States, where local courts protect access to private property.
   There also is disagreement over ``dual use precursors,'' or
chemicals that are essential to poison gases but also useful for
pesticides or even medicine.
   ``Let us not be fooled; there are economic interests at stake
here,'' said an expert in the American delegation. A West German
official made a similar remark, referring to the Americans.
   In the corridors, spokesmen from several delegations spoke of
inconsistencies of their rivals.
   On Tuesday, three days after Secretary of State George P. Shultz
appealed for ``consciousness raising'' to abolish chemical weapons,
West German reporters noted the new American budget provides for two
new chemical weapons plants.
   Some Middle Eastern countries and nations that profess
non-alignment clearly were stalling to be able to keep chemical
arsenals, and others that favored a ban had conflicting interests,
Western delegates said.
   Roberto de Abreu Sodre, the Brazilian foreign minister, told the
conference no accord should hamper the economic and social progress
of nations, ``a process in which the chemical industry certainly
plays an important role.''
   He echoed the popular argument for banning chemical and nuclear
weapons simultaneously: Nations without nuclear capacity should not
be stripped of their only deterrent.
   In an interview later, he said Brazil opposed chemical weapons
but was raising concerns heard among delegates of advanced
developing countries.
   Newly industrialized countries produce not only chemicals but
weapons systems, and several are suspicious of measures that might
limit them as competitors or allow international access to their
trade secrets.
   African states worry as much about toxic wastes dumped by
industrial countries as about the threat of chemical weapons in
their region.
   ``We have been chosen as a dumpsite for these dangerous
substances and we must guard against this,'' said Mamadou Dagra of
Niger.
   Soviet arms negotiator N.P. Smidovitch, asked in an interview
what Moscow did not want to see in the Paris declaration, replied:
   ``I can't think of anything we would object to. This is a
political conference and we should have a consensus document.''
   Nicaraguan delegate Julio Icasa told The Associated Press:
   ``We don't agree with the Arab League position to link chemical
and nuclear weapons. We just want to rid the world of this stuff.''
   Asked whether anyone in Central America had chemical weapons, he
laughed and said: ``Only the asphyxiating gas of debt and the poison
of U.S. intervention.''

   A biomedical foundation is establishing a
pension plan for 81 AIDS-infected chimpanzees.
   The Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research plans to invest
more than $1.77 million over the next 10 years into chimpanzee
retirement accounts that are expected to grow into $2.9 million
through the year 2026, officials said.
   ``We always have had a moral obligation to take care of the
animals that we use, but we can have the best intentions in the
world, but if we don't have the money, there is little that we can
do for them,'' John Speck, controller of the biomedical foundation.
   The fund will help in their care and is sure to be enough to buy
bunches of bananas and lots of apples, cucumbers, celery and
watermelon over the next 40 years for the chimpanzees, who cannot be
used for other research after being exposed to AIDS.
   But Roger Fouts, a psychology professor at Central Washington
University in Ellensberg who has studied chimpanzees for 20 years,
said the biomedical foundation's humanitarian attempt is admirable,
but it might not be enough.
   ``If you look at $3 million for about 40 years, that's bare
minimum,'' he said. ``Giving a chimp enough food, enough water and
making sure that they have a dry and warm cage doesn't seem to be
enough.''
   Foundation officials said the chimps exposed to the AIDS virus
have shown no signs they have developed the fatal disease. It is
probable the chimps will live their normal life span of about 40
years or more, pushing their care bill to $5,000 each annually, they
said.
   The biomedical foundation is among the leading facilities
worldwide that conducts AIDS research using primates.
   Speck and Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary resources,
began discussing two years ago how to pay for care for the chimps,
and started the investment program in the spring.
   Eichberg, who in June 1983 became the first scientist to infect a
chimpanzee with the AIDS virus, said he hopes the chimp retirement
program would silence animals rights groups critical of the
foundation's use of animals for experiments.
   ``We are really genuinely concerned that these animals get the
best treatment available,'' Eichberg says. ``We have to combine our
emotions with pragmatism in our work and I think we have done a
pretty good job.''
   But Fouts said research groups should do more for the chimpanzees.
   ``They must ensure that they lead as much as possible a normal
life,'' he said. ``What we have with chimpanzees is a species that
has been exploited by biomedical concerns, but this attempt by the
Southwest foundation to help the chimpanzees is an admirable one.''

<HEAD>Deficit Panel Gets Go-Ahead From Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incoming Bush administration gave a
high-level advisory panel the go-ahead Tuesday to begin work in
earnest on forging a solution to the federal government's huge
deficit problems.
   Officials of the National Economic Commission said they had
received word from Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will stay
on as the Bush administration's chief economic spokesman, that Bush
will be looking for the panel's report March 1.
   Commission co-chairman Drew Lewis said the panel would not have a
problem meeting that reporting date. Some commission members hailed
news of the early deadline as a sign Bush may actively use the panel
in his effort to reach a budget compromise with Congress.
   The 14-member commission, split evenly between Republicans and
Democrats, was created by Congress with the hopes that the panel
could come up with a deficit-reduction package that would be
politically acceptable to the new administration and to Congress.
   Last month, Bush made his two appointments to the panel,
selecting former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., and longtime friend
former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio. The stature of those appointments
had eased fears that Bush would ignore the panel's eventual
recommendations.
   Ashley, who attended his first commission meeting along with
Laxalt on Tuesday, said he viewed the March 1 reporting date as an
indication the Bush administration had a strategy for reducing the
budget deficit that included the commission's report.
   ``The new administration feels it would be more helpful if we
report early, when the advice would be more timely,'' said Ashley,
who has been a close Bush friend since their days together at Yale.
   ``I think there is an overall Bush strategy on the economy, some
portions of which haven't been announced yet, which forms the
backdrop for this decision on a March reporting date,'' Ashley said.
   March 1 was the deadline for the commission's recommendations
that had been set by law. But the law also gave Bush the power to
extend the reporting date to Sept. 1. There was speculation that
Bush might choose the later date in an effort to play down the
significance of any recommendations the commission makes.
   Bush was critical of the panel during the presidential campaign,
saying that it was little more than a stalking horse for tax
increases, which Bush has vowed to oppose.
   Since winning election, however, Bush has stressed the importance
he places on reducing the federal deficit, partly to calm fears of
foreign investors, who have an increasing stake in the U.S. economy.
   President Reagan sent Congress his final budget plan Monday,
recommending spending of $1.15 trillion in the 1990 fiscal year.
However, to reach a deficit goal of $92.5 billion, Reagan's budget
called for sharp cuts in many domestic programs, efforts which have
failed in the past.
   Bush has said he will unveil his own budget proposals soon after
taking office.
   The deficit commission began two days of hearings Tuesday on
economic assumptions and a review of deficit-reduction proposals
submitted to the commission by various special interest groups and
research organizations.
   The advisory panel, which is headed by Lewis, a Republican, and
by Democrat Robert Strauss, has scheduled a string of hearings in
January and February to craft a plan. Originally, those hearings
were to be held in secret, but a group of news organizations won a
court victory last week when a federal judge ruled that the sessions
had to be in public.
   At Tuesday's meeting, Strauss asked for the commission's legal
counsel to determine whether the open-meeting requirement would
prohibit him from discussing deficit-cutting proposals with other
commission members if less than a quorum was present.
   Commission members have wrangled publicly over whether new taxes
are needed to erase the budget deficit, which is expected to rise to
$161 billion this year.
   Lewis, former Transportation secretary in the Reagan
administration and now chairman of Union Pacific, said Tuesday there
was a possibility that the commission might be forced to issue a
majority and a minority report.
   He said it would be ``very hard to get a consensus'' of 10 to 12
members voting for a deficit-cutting package. That is the type of
unanimity many believe will be necessary for the panel's
recommendations to have an impact with Congress.
   Lewis said Brady told him during a phone conversation Tuesday
that the commission should plan on meeting the March 1 deadline
unless it hears otherwise from Bush once he takes office Jan. 20.
   Lewis said there was a possibility that even after the commission
issues its report, it may be called back into session by the
administration if a deadlock develops with Congress over the budget.
   ``If the president-elect and Congress can't solve this problem,
then we probably would be brought back into action,'' Lewis said.
   Lewis and Strauss also met with Reagan at the White House to
bring him up to date on the panel's activities.

<HEAD>Shostakovich Work Critical of Stalin to Get Premiere in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich
will present the world premiere Thursday of a musical satire
secretly written nearly 30 years ago by the late composer Dmitri
Shostakovich to express his contempt for the Stalinist regime.
   Rostropovich told a news conference Tuesday that until recently,
performing the 15-minute theatrical piece entitled ``Rayok'' in the
Soviet Union would have meant being ``hidden away in a jail'' or
sentenced to death.
   But all that has changed with the ``very promising and very
hopeful'' moves toward artistic freedom and repudiation of the
Stalinist era under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost or openness, he said.
   Rostropovich, a cello virtuoso and music director of the National
Symphony Orchestra who fled the Soviet Union in 1974, was a close
friend of Shostakovich, who died in Moscow in 1975. Rostropovich was
stripped of his Soviet citizenship in 1978, the year he was hired by
the National Symphony.
   ``Rayok,'' which means ``Little Eden'' in Russian, will be
performed publicly for the first time in the Kennedy Center Concert
Hall, with three more performances through Tuesday.
   The cast will include Rostropovich at the piano, four bass
singers and a small mixed choir following Shostakovich's meticulous
stage directions contained in a foreword to the work.
   The piece also will be performed Sunday afternoon at Carnegie
Hall in New York. Rostropovich said that Maxim Shostakovich, the
composer's conductor son who defected to the United States in 1981,
was expected to attend the New York performance.
   Rostropovich said that today, under Gorbachev, ``you can do this
even in the Soviet Union,'' although he knows of no plans for a
public Soviet performance.
   He said he has no fears that his production might jeopardize the
safety of Shostakovich's family. ``If I thought this would make it
difficult for the family, I wouldn't do it,'' he said.
   In words and music, ``Rayok'' is a scathing put-down of Stalin
and two of his senior officials in the Soviet Communist Party
hierarchy, Dmitri T. Shepilov and Andrei Zhdanov, who directed a
crackdown on Soviet writers, artists and musicians in the late 1940s.
   About 1960, Shostakovich wrote the score and a literary ally,
L.N. Lebedinsky, wrote the libretto for ``Rayok.'' It was based on
speeches at a meeting of the party's central committee in 1948 where
a host of prominent Soviet composers _ including Shostakovich and
Sergei Prokofiev _ were denounced for ``formalistic tendencies'' and
instructed to write music of ``realism'' for the masses.
   Privately, Rostropovich said, Shostakovich scorned Zhdanov as an
ignoramus whose claim to musical distinction was his ability to sing
and play the piano with one finger.
   Publicly, Shostakovich confessed to his errors but nevertheless
was kicked out of the Moscow Conservatory during a purge of the arts
that even today is known as the ``Zhdanovshchina.''
   Shostakovich gave the four bass singers the roles of a master of
ceremonies, Stalin, Shepilov and Zhdanov. According to his foreword,
the choir represents ``musical activists'' who greet the
bureaucrats' pronouncements with ``sycophantic delight and
amusement.''
   Rostropovich, who until recently has cautiously reserved comment
on Gorbachev's domestic reforms, called them ``very, very positive''
at Tuesday's news conference.
   ``The changes that are taking place are very promising and very
hopeful,'' he said.
   Rostropovich said, however, that he has no plans to visit his
homeland, which he left nearly 15 years ago and where his name is
rarely mentioned publicly by government authorities.
   ``They have no time for me now,'' he said.
   Once the recipient of the Lenin Prize and two Stalin Prizes and
given the highest honor as ``Peoples Artist,'' Rostropovich sought
exile in the West after he and his wife, Bolshoi Opera soprano
Galina Vishnevskaya, suffered worsening government harassment,
including cancellation of foreign appearances and drastic
curtailment of their activities in the Soviet Union.
   ``It all depends on their approach to me,'' Rostropovich said.
``If they are planning to do something like that, they'll let me
know. I'm not asking to go. Washington is a very cozy place for me.''

<TEXT>
   Vietnam and Thailand reported progress
Tuesday in talks on how to end the decade-long Vietnamese occupation
of Cambodia and a guerrilla war that has filled refugee camps inside
the Thai frontier.
   ``I'm satisfied with the result of the talks,'' Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach said after two days of meetings with the Thai
foreign minister, Siddhi Savetsila, who cautiously described them as
``good.''
   Referring to Cambodian guerrilla factions, Thach said: ``The two
sides are moving closer ... but to say no more gap is not yet
realistic because the gap is not yet solved by the Kampuchean
(Cambodian) parties.''
   Asked where the gaps existed, the Vietnamese official said: ``You
must ask Sihanouk and Hun Sen.'' Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former
ruler of Cambodia, is nominal leader of the guerrilla alliance and
Hun Sen is premier of Hanoi's client government in Phnom Penh.
   Siddhi and Thach said a joint statement would be issued Wednesday.
   Thach, who also is also deputy premier, said Monday both
countries agreed the Cambodian question could be resolved by
September. When asked if peace was near, he said it would ``be at
hand during the first six months of 1989.''
   Jetn Sucharitkul, spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry, said
after Siddhi arrived Monday that new approaches would be discussed.
He said a Thai proposal to resume a 1978 agreement on cooperation in
aviation, ocean commerce, telecommunications posts and trade also
was on the agenda..
   Siddhi is the most senior Thai official to visit Vietnam since
1976. Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan also has announced plans
to visit Vietnam.
   Since taking office in August, Chatichai has said he would
improve ties with communist Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and increase
trade, provided all Vietnamese forces leave Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge
regime of Pol Pot, under which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
were killed or starved to death in less than four years.
   Thailand backs the three-party Cambodian guerrilla alliance,
which includes the Khmer Rouge.
   Fears of a Khmer Rouge return to power have grown as Vietnam
withdrew some of its troops. The Vietnamese say the pullout will be
completed this year.
   Last week, the government of President Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh
suggested an earlier withdrawal target of September 1989 if Thailand
denied sanctuary to Cambodian guerrillas and supplies of weapons to
the rebels were halted. Vietnam put Heng Samrin in power in January
1979.
   One round of informal talks on ending the Cambodian conflict has
been held in Indonesia by the Phnom Penh government, guerrillas,
Vietnam, Laos and members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations: Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines
and Brunei. ASEAN is trying to arrange a second meeting for next
month.

   The syndicated show ``Inside Edition''
stumbled badly in its first attempt to challenge Fox's ``A Current
Affair,'' according to preliminary ratings announced Tuesday.
   Despite a $7 million promotion budget, the largest in syndicated
television history, ``Inside Edition'' drew an unspectacular rating
of 6.9 in 15 cities. One A.C. Nielsen Co. rating point is equivalent
to approximately 900,000 households with television.
   The show's producers have guaranteed a national rating of eight,
according to a report in the trade weekly Electronic Media.
   ``Inside Edition,'' a half-hour ``news'' show with host David
Frost, was beaten in both New York and Los Angeles by the Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s ``A Current Affair.'' ``Inside Edition'' gathered
a strong rating in Sacramento, topping ``A Current Affair'' there.

   Angola sent 450 Cuban soldiers home
Tuesday, several weeks early, as part of a plan to remove foreign
forces from the country after a decade of war and bring independence
to neighboring Namibia.
   South African soldiers withdrew from southern Angola into
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, last summer.
   A U.S.-mediated agreement signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, which controls Namibia, requires 3,000 Cuban soldiers
to be out of Angola by April 1 and all 50,000 to be gone in 27
months.
   U.N. military observers looked on while Cuban soldiers _ men and
women _ strode between ranks of Angolan troops and into three
waiting passenger aircraft at the airport in Luanda, capital of
Angola. An Angolan military band played marches.
   Brig. Gen. Samuel C. Rodiles Planas, commander of the Cuban
forces, and Maj. Gen. Ciel da Concessao, Angola's navy commander,
signed the withdrawal agreements at a table on the runway and handed
them to Pericles Ferreira Gomes, the Brazilian general in charge of
U.N. observers.
   The 450 soldiers were accompanied by a dozen ranking military
officers who came from Cuba for the occasion.
   Col. Arvid Geirulv, second in command of the 28-man U.N.
observers in Angola, said another 1,000 Cubans would be taken out on
ships by Wednesday, and 550 more would leave by air and 1,000 on
ships by Jan. 15.
   Geirulv said the rest of the 70 U.N. military and 20 civilian
observers would be in Angola by March 20.
   In a farewell speech in May 1 Square to a crowd of about 25,000,
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said the first 3,000 Cubans were
leaving ahead of the deadline as ``a goodwill gesture.'' He said
``the names of those Cubans who fell here will be engraved forever
in our hearts.''
   No official figures are available for the number of Cuban
casualties in Angola, but most estimates put the number at about
5,000 dead.
   Cubans troops arrived in July 1975 to help the Marxist government
that won control after independence from Portugal fight rebels
supported by South Africa and the United States.
   All Cuban forces remaining are to be north of the 15th parallel
by Aug. 1 and north of the 13th parallel, beyond the east-west
Benguela railroad, by Nov. 1 in time for elections in South-West
Africa. South Africa agreed to Namibian independence in return for
Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   The South Africans captured South-West Africa from Germany in
World War I and governed it under a League of Nations mandate. The
U.N. General Assembly abrogated the mandate in 1966 but South Africa
had refused to leave.
   South African soldiers entered Angola in 1975 to support the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola rebel group,
known by its initials UNITA. South African forces also raided bases
in southern Angola of South-West Africa People's Organization
guerrillas fighting for Namibian independence.
   Neither guerrilla group was involved in the peace agreement, but
SWAPO indicated willingness to go along with it.
   Alcides Sakala, UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday the Cuban withdrawal was ``a show ... theater.
It's too early to say the Cubans are really going to leave.''
   He said U.N. observers found in rebel-controlled territory would
be attacked.
   After a cease-fire agreement, South African forces withdrew from
southern Angola on Aug. 22. All but 1,500 South African soldiers are
to be out of Namibia by election day Nov. 1.
   Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra, Cuba's deputy army minister, told
the chanting crowd the ``real authors of this agreement are the men
and women who ... destroyed the myth of South African superiority in
this part of the world.''
   He said his soldiers would ``do their duty'' until they depart.
   Geirulv said he foresaw no serious problems in monitoring the
withdrawal. ``We shall go to the locations where they have been and
verify that they are empty,'' he said.
   Angola has asked the United Nations to pick up the cost of
shipping the Cubans home, which it estimates at $800 million.
   Lt. Gen. Antonio Santos Franca, the armed forces chief of staff,
attributed the high cost to temporary housing for the departing
Cuban troops and the need to build two airstrips in the south.
   Most Cubans will leave from the ports of Cabinda in the north and
Lobito and Namibe in the south.

<HEAD>Wrigley Tests High-Tech Gum To Quadruple Your Pleasure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quadruple your pleasure? Quintuple your fun?
   The makers of Doublemint chewing gum say they're not ready to
change the product's familiar jingle _ not yet, anyway.
   But the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. is working on a high-tech approach to
ensuring that your chewing gum doesn't lose its flavor on he bedpost
overnight. Or on the store shelf, where the oils that give gum its
flavor can evaporate.
   Chicago-based Wrigley, the world's largest gum producer, said
Tuesday it had signed an agreement with Advanced Polymer Systems
Inc., of Redwood City, Calif., to develop a chewing gum that
encapsulates the flavor oils in microscopic, non-toxic sponges and
releases them only when the gum is chewed.
   The tiny sponges, patented by Advanced Polymer Systems, already
are used in some ointments, shaving creams and cosmetics, and could
be used to extend the life of food flavorings and preservatives,
officials said.
   ``By using these sponges, instead of gum releasing all the flavor
at once, it will hold onto the flavor and release it in a sustained
manner,'' said Sergio Nacht, Advanced Polymer's vice president of
research and development.
   Wrigley spokesman William Piet balked at discussing the company's
flavor-extension goals, saying the product was in an early stage of
development.
   ``The first challenge is to find out if it works,'' he said.
   Chewing gum flavor generally lasts about 10 to 12 minutes, but
David Light, an Advanced Polymer spokesman, said the companies hope
to keep a flavorful chew going up to 10 minutes more.
   Nacht predicted it could be between 18 to 36 months before the
product, which needs approval from the federal Food and Drug
Administration, hits store shelves.
   Wrigley, which holds a commanding 48 percent share of the U.S.
chewing gum market, hoped to use the technology in all its gums.
Wrigley makes Doublemint, Juicy Fruit, Wrigley's Spearmint and Big
Red sugar-sweetened chewing gums; Hubba Bubba bubble gum; and Extra
chewing gums, which are sweetened with Nutrasweet.
   The company's main competitors include Warner-Lambert Co., which
makes Dentyne, Trident, Freshen Up and Chiclets, and RJR Nabisco
Inc., maker of Carefree, Beech Nut and Bubble Yum gums. Neither
Nabisco nor Warner-Lambert immediately returned phone calls seeking
comment.
   Industry analyst Bonnie Rivers of Salomon Brothers Inc. in
Atlanta said longer-lasting flavor was top priority of chewing-gum
makers.
   ``If you can make the flavor last longer, that's a big
positive,'' she said.
   And even if it didn't work very well, the new technology still
could give Wrigley a marketing edge, she said.
   ``Anything you can do to differentiate your product _ whether
it's a plus or not _ gives you something to market.''
   Under the agreement, Advanced Polymer will receive a small
royalty from the sale of Wrigley products made with the Microsponge
system and Wrigley will get a small percentage of revenues Advanced
Polymer gets in other food applications of the technology, Piet said.

<HEAD>Demonstrations In Montenegro Against Communist Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 50,000 workers and university
students demonstrated Tuesday in Montenegro, demanding the
resignation of the republic's ruling communist elite and protesting
economic and social woes.
   The demonstrations in the capital of Titograd were triggered by
what the protesters saw as the leadership's inability to cope with
the deepening economic recession in Montenegro, one of Yugoslavia's
poorest republics.
   The protesters also called for the leadership's resignation
because of the use of force by police to break up a similar protest
in Titograd in October.
   No violence was reported, although the demonstrators earlier had
set a two-hour ultimatum for the leadership to resign, threatening
to break into parliament unless their demand was met.
   The protesters, assembled on a square in front of the parliament
building, waved flags and chanted ``Who dares to beat the workers?''
and ``The people are hungry!'' The square was ringed by a heavy
cordon of police.
   During the October unrest, when at least 10 people were hurt in
clashes with club-wielding police, the leadership resisted calls to
resign, refusing to accept blame for the region's worst-ever
economic recession.
   Subsequently, the republic's government, which is charged with
implementing economic policy, tendered its resignation. But the
communist leadership, which formulates policy, refused to step down.
   At the time, the Montenegro leadership accused followers of
Serbia's ambitious leader Slobodan Milosevic of trying to stage a
coup in Titograd in order to install his own supporters.
   Yugoslavia's protracted economic crisis, characterized by a 250
percent inflation rate, a $21 billion foreign debt, falling living
standards and rising unemployment, is most acutely felt in the
country's underdeveloped regions.
   In Montenegro, the average monthly salary has declined to the
equivalent of $80. The republic has been particularly hard hit by a
recent spate of closures of loss-making firms in which about 10,000
workers lost their jobs.
   On Tuesday, hundreds of uniformed police were seen on television
containing the ever-increasing crowd, but there was no apparent sign
of the special riot squads that were used to break up last year's
demonstration.
   ``We have come to put an end to the ignorance, cowardice and
incompetence of those who have ruled us for so long,'' said a miner
from a nearby bauxite mine who was not otherwise identified.
   ``We have had enough of those who have brought Yugoslavia to the
brink of disintegration and the people to the brink of famine,'' he
added as the crowd roared its approval.
   Montenegro, located on the southern Adriatic coast, is
Yugoslavia's smallest republic with about 550,000 inhabitants.
   Serbian nationalists have long claimed the republic should be
part of Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia, since the two
peoples share the same ethnic roots.
   Similar demonstrations in Novi Sad, capital of Vojvodina
province, that also erupted in October 1988, caused the downfall of
the entire leadership of the province after it had opposed Serbian
attempts to bring it under greater central control.
   At the time, the media in the northern parts of the country
widely reported that those demonstrations were orchestrated by
Milosevic and his supporters in Vojvodina.

<HEAD>Work Continues on Antarctic Runway Picketed By Greenpeace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction work has resumed at one site on the
French islands of Terre-Adelie in Antarctica following protests by
the environmental group Greenpeace over the building of an airstrip,
the government said Tuesday.
   The Ministry of Overseas Territories said work on a second site
was suspended after an agreement between the station
officer-in-charge, Jean-Francois Houssin, and the Greenpeace
expedition leader Peter Wilkinson.
   Greenpeace alleged Saturday that 15 of its members visiting the
Antarctic to monitor pollution and waste disposal at several
countries' bases were beaten up by the French construction workers.
The government denied there was a fight.
   France has a 60-member team, half of them scientists, at the
Dumont d'Urville base where the airstrip is being built.
   Greenpeace alleges the strip will open up the area for mining
operations, destroying the natural habitat and breeding ground of
the Emperor and Adelie penguins.
   Greenpeace said Houssin had seen a videotape of the brawl and
``admitted the construction workers were out of control.''
   In a call to Sydney, Australia, Wilkinson said the militants
planned to picket one section of the base until Sunday, providing
there were no further disputes.
   In Paris, the government denied development plans on the islands
would harm the environment. Officials say two studies were done
before the development plans got the green light.
   On Tuesday night, scientist and explorer Paul-Emile Victor went
on French TV to back the government claims.
   Greenpeace previously clashed with France in 1985 when saboteurs
found to be working for the French intelligence services blew up the
organisation's nuclear monitoring vessel, the Rainbow Warrior, in
New Zealand's Auckland harbor. One person was killed in the attack.

<TEXT>
   As a young man, Ronald Reagan was stirred by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's declaration that ``the only thing
we have to fear is fear itself.'' On Tuesday as he neared
retirement, Reagan acknowledged that upon hearing those words, he
never dreamed he'd hold the same office.
   Reagan and supporters of the FDR library in Hyde Park, N.Y.
gathered at the National Archives for a 50th anniversary fund-raiser
and to hear recordings of Roosevelt's first inaugural address in
1932.
   ``He really did convince us that the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself,'' Reagan said.
   The luncheon commemorated the anniversary of a similar gathering
on Feb. 4, 1939, when Roosevelt brought together 50 people to have
lunch and become trustees of the FDR library, which became the first
in the presidential library system.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the Senate majority leader, who
introduced Reagan, said, ``Roosevelt's legacy was to empower all
Americans to act through their government for the common good. Today
that principle is deeply engrained in our political and social
thought.''
   In one of the best-remembered passages in the recorded excerpt
from his inaugural address, Roosevelt said, ``First of all, let me
assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself _ nameless, unjustified, unreasoning terror which paralyzes
needed effort to convert retreat into advance.''
   Mitchell, recalling Roosevelt's struggle with poliomyelitis, told
the audience, ``He had known personal fear for his own future, so he
knew what he was talking about'' as he addressed the nation in the
grip of the Great Depression.
   Introducing Reagan, the majority leader drew parallels with the
32nd president, saying, ``Like President Roosevelt, President Reagan
possess a legendary ability to inspire in Americans pride in their
nation and faith in its future.''
   Reagan, a former Democrat turned Republican, said Roosevelt was
the first president he voted for and the first he ever saw, at a
campaign rally in Des Moines in 1936 while he was working as a radio
announcer.
   ``He really did convince us that the only thing we had to fear
was fear itself,'' he said. ``And it was that ebullience, that
infectious optimism, that made one young sportscaster think that
maybe he should be more active as a citizen.''
   ``I assure you, though, he never tied that to one day holding
public office and certainly never dreamed that destiny would take
him to the same office FDR held.''

<HEAD>Teen Task Force Told Adolescents Want to Be Listened to, Taken Seriously</HEAD>

   A national task force on youth meeting for the
first time got some expert testimony Tuesday from a high-school
sophomore:
   ``Don't look down on me. Give me a challenge before you assume
it's too hard. I don't want easier schools. I want harder schools,
so that I can have pride in myself,'' Sarah Karp, 15, told the Task
Force on the Next Generation.
   Miss Karp said she is not proud to be a student in the Chicago
school system, called the worst in the nation by former Education
Secretary William Bennett.
   ``A lot of times I feel like I'm nobody because I have to go to
this school. Give me an outline for success. Let me learn from
teachers who love to teach,'' said Miss Karp, a sophomore at Lincoln
Park High School and school affairs editor of New Expression, a
citywide high-school publication.
   Creation of the privately funded 19-member task force, which
includes leaders from business, labor, government, religion, sports
and ethnic organizations, was announced last week by Chicago Mayor
Eugene Sawyer, who chaired Tuesday's hearing.
   ``We are standing in the wings watching our children stumble
toward the future when we should be taking them by the hand, showing
them the way,'' said Sawyer.
   More should be done to combat such adolescent problems as drug
abuse, teen-age pregnancy, delinquency and failure in school, said
Dr. Arthur B. Elster, director of the department of adolescent
health of the American Medical Association.
   ``The interval from 11-13 years of age appears to provide an
especially promising opportunity for prevention of later problem
behavior,'' Elster told the panel.
   Successful youth programs have staff members who know how to
listen and express concern, said Nancy M. Abbate, executive director
of Chicago's Youth Service Project Inc.
   She told the task force that troubled young people often complain
of being ignored by parents and other adults, saying things like,
``I'd like my mom to listen to me more,'' or ``I got mixed up with
this guy because at least he listened to me.'
   ``Unfortunately , we don't program money for caring,'' said Ms.
Abbate.
   She called for a national youth council, made up of young people
in and out of school, to ``draft guiding principals for the next
generation.''
   The panel, which organizers hope will find ways to better serve
young people, plans hearings in Los Angeles, Atlanta and the East
Coast before presenting recommendations this spring to U.S. House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has promised a congressional review.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Murder Rate Drops, But Gang Deaths Up in '88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's murder rate dropped to its lowest
level in 10 years, but gang slayings and gang-related crimes rose in
Los Angeles last year, police said.
   Murders in the nation's second-largest city fell from 832 in 1987
to 734 last year, the lowest total since 1978, when there were 678
homicides, according to police statistics released Monday.
   ``In my own view, Los Angeles is what it has been all along, one
of the safest major cities in the United States,'' said Cmdr.
William Booth, department spokesman.
   Los Angeles' murder rate of 22.9 killings for every 100,000
residents is lower than that of many other large cities, Booth said.
   Washington, D.C., the nation's murder leader, lists 59.2 murders
per 100,000 people, followed by Detroit with 58 murders per 100,000
and Dallas with 56.7.
   Booth attributed the murder drop to 900 extra police officers on
the street and a greater willingness by officers to make arrests in
domestic disputes.
   There were 257 gang killings in the city in 1988 compared with
205 in 1987, an increase Booth said was caused by a near-doubling of
the gang population.
   Investigators listed 27,795 known gang members last year compared
with 15,000 the year before.
   Gang-related crime increased from 5,129 reported incidents in
1987 to 5,371 in 1988.
   The Sheriff's Department also reported an increase in
gang-related slayings in unincorporated areas of the county, up from
79 in 1987 to 96 last year. County totals were incomplete because
smaller city police departments have yet to compile year-end
statistics.

   Auto giant Daimler-Benz on Tuesday
unveiled a sculpture at its headquarters in memory of thousands of
workers forced to toil at company plants during Nazi domination in
World War II.
   The iron sculpture was commissioned from Berlin sculptor Bernhard
Heiliger.
   Daimler-Benz officials announced last year that the company would
pay $11 million in reparations for the use of forced labor under
Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
   Hundreds of thousands of people from countries occupied by the
Nazis were forced to work under poor conditions to help fuel the
German war effort.
   According to figures compiled for Daimler-Benz, more than 29,000
forced laborers were working at company facilities in 1944.
   Daimler-Benz's reparation payments were divided into several
parts.
   About $5.5 million was paid to the Conference on Jewish Material
Claims Against Germany in New York. About $2.7 million went to the
Red Cross and another $2.7 million went to organizations in Poland.
   The money was earmarked for medical and elderly care facilities
that treat victims of the Holocaust and former forced laborers.

<HEAD>Japan Continuing Voluntary Quotas On Car Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's voluntary quotas on car exports are
essentially symbolic limits that mean little in the marketplace, an
American analyst, a U.S. automaker and a senior auto-state
congressman said Tuesday after the Japanese government said it would
continue the restraints.
   While Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said the limits should
remain in place, General Motors Corp., the nation's largest
automaker, said the quotas have become ``less and less relevant''
and the extension is ``almost symbolic.''
   The quotas ``are not constraining shipments from Japan and are
not expected to under current market conditions,'' GM said. ``More
importantly, the focus on (quotas) distracts from the real trade
issue _ the need for further opening of the Japanese market to
exports from the United States.''
   Far from helping the U.S. auto industry, the quotas may make it
more difficult for the Big Three automakers to compete, said David
Healy, automotive analyst with the New York brokerage house Drexel
Burnham Lambert.
   ``It is almost a psychological limit rather than a real limit in
the sense that the Japanese shipped fewer than 2.3 million vehicles
to the United States in the last couple of Japanese fiscal years,''
Healy said. ``I think it could probably be scrapped without any real
effects.''
   Japanese makers have successfully circumvented the quotas by
building more cars at plants in the United States and by exporting
more expensive cars. The quotas are set by the number of vehicles
rather than by their value, and the effect has been ``more
competition in the expensive and medium price bracket for the U.S.
auto companies,'' Healy said.
   In Congress, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, said the quota as it stands today is
too high to work.
   ``There is sufficient cheating so that the number just doesn't
have that much meaning,'' Dingell said. ``The Japanese manufacturers
do everything they can to get around it. They're willing to call
cars anything from trucks to wagons ... if it will help.''
   Quotas cover cars but exclude light trucks and utility vehicles.
   After making unprecedented inroads into the U.S. auto market,
Japan in 1981 sought to deflect protectionist sentiment in the
United States by voluntarily limiting its car exports.
   The Japanese automakers are presently limited to exporting 2.3
million cars a year to the United States, a level they have failed
to attain in recent years as a stronger yen on international
exchange markets has forced up dollar prices of Japanese cars.
   Japan's minister of international trade and industry, Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, said his government was concerned the Japanese automakers
would push for more U.S. sales, thereby aggravating trade tensions
with the United States.
   The Japanese trade surplus with the United States in 1987 was
$59.8 billion and constituted the largest portion of the overall
$171.2 billion U.S. trade deficit. Japan expects to export 2.2
million cars to the United States in the fiscal year ending in
March, Mitsuzuka said.
   ``We are pleased that Japan has responded to the concerns raised
by the (United Auto Workers union) and others in agreeing to renew
the (quotas) for another year,'' said UAW President Owen Bieber.
``At the same time, we are disappointed that they did not respond to
our proposal to adjust the ... limit downward so as to make
allowance for the growth of low-U.S. content transplant assemblies.''
   Despite Japan's worries about trade tensions with the United
States, the Reagan administration considers itself to have no role
in the decision to continue the quotas, said Kelly Shipp,
spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   ``It is solely a Japanese decision,'' she said. ``The president
informed the Japanese government four years ago that the
administration considered that ... the U.S. industry had recovered
its competitiveness, and there was no need to continue the
restraint.''
   Japanese automakers produced 733,000 cars in the United States
last year through November, up 23.2 percent from the same period in
1987, according to the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo.
   Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, said it was
``pleased that the Japanese government has recognized that some form
of restraint is necessary until the serious imbalance of U.S.-Japan
trade is corrected,'' citing the U.S. deficit with Japan not only in
automobiles but in semiconductors, textiles and steel.
   Chrysler Corp. also said it believed the decision to continue the
quotas was correct.
   In the showroom, continuation of the quotas will mean prices of
Japanese cars will remain higher than would otherwise be the case,
said Martin Pierce, vice president of Alexandria Toyota in
Alexandria, Va.
   ``Anything that gives us additional product is good not only good
for us, but it is good for the consumer because having the supply of
vehicles results in lower prices as a result of competition,''
Pierce said. ``If there is a contrived shortage, the consumer is
going to pay more.''

<HEAD>President Ending State of Emergency; Militants Kill Three</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa
announced Tuesday he will end the 5{-year state of emergency and
free all political prisoners.
   Also Tuesday, Sinhalese militants killed three people, including
two candidates for parliamentary elections.
   Premadasa promised he would never again impose a state of
emergency, but did not say whether he thought it had been effective
in curbing ethnic violence between the Buddhist Sinhalese majority
and mainly-Hindu Tamil minority.
   The state of emergency, which expires Sunday, had been reinstated
every month since it was imposed in May 1983.
   ``We have lived under emergency rule for more than five years
now. I feel that is enough for everybody,'' Premadasa told a publiic
meeting of top government officials and legislators.
   Police said Sinhalese militants Tuesday firebombed and opened
fire on a car, killing opposition candidates Indrapala Abeyweera and
Wijeyalal Mendis of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and their
bodyguard, identified only as Martin. They were to contest Feb. 12
national elections.
   A police spokesman blamed the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front
for the attack at Waduwa town, 20 miles south of the capital,
Colombo. The front is an extremist Sinhalese group that opposes
government efforts to give more autonomy to Tamils.
   A military spokesman said at least 12 people have been killed
since Monday, including three Sri Lankan soldiers ambushed by Tamil
rebels in the north.
   Other victims, all civilians in the Sinhalese-dominated south,
included three members of the ruling United National Party and a
Buddhist priest. The spokesman said all the civilians were killed by
the People's Liberation Front.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the country's 16 million people and
claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese majority.
More than 8,500 people have died since militant Tamils started
fighting six years ago for an independent nation.
   Premadasa told the meeting everyone imprisoned under emergency
regulations would be released.
   The emergency gives police and soldiers broad powers to arrest
and detain people for up to 90 days without charges, to dispose of
bodies without inquests, and raid homes without warrants.
   ``If those arrested cannot be charged, they should be released,''
he said.
   Government officials who asked not to be identified said
authorities released 574 political prisoners between Jan. 1 and Jan.
6. But they did not say how many others still are in detention. The
exact figure is not known, but is estimated at 2,200.
   Premadasa said he has asked authorities to examine particularly
the case against Sinhalese students held for staging anti-government
riots that forced the closure of 10,400 schools and seven
universities last year.

<HEAD>Mayors Ask Bush to Reject Reagan Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors want President-elect Bush
to reject President Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic spending, the
president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors said Tuesday.
   Arthur J. Holland, head of the group and the mayor of Trenton,
N.J., said cities and their residents would be hurt by proposed
reductions in programs ranging from school-lunch subsidies to grants
for community development projects.
   ``We have come to the end of a decade that has seen a dramatic
shift toward defense spending, away from discretionary domestic
spending,'' Holland said at a news conference.
   ``Let us hope the end of this decade is also the end of an era,
and that the 1990s will produce a federal budget that is balanced in
every sense of the word,'' he said.
   Holland, a Democrat, commented at a news conference called to
react to Reagan's proposed fiscal 1990 budget. He said the cities
have suffered cuts in urban programs throughout the Reagan
administration and called the budget ``nothing new. It's what we've
come to expect.''
   He said he was pleased with proposed increases in spending for
AIDS programs, the Superfund waste cleanup program and education.
   But he said the proposal would reduce money for state and local
enforcement, treatment and education programs on drugs, even while
increasing the total appropriation for federal anti-drug efforts.
   Holland also pointed to proposed cuts in mass transit assistance,
reductions in child nutrition spending and school lunch subsidies,
elimination of the Economic Development Administration and a cut
from $3 billion to $2.8 billion in the Community Development Block
Grants program.
   Questioned by reporters, Holland said there is enough money now
going to waste and fraud in the Defense Department to pay for urban
needs.
   ``You say, where will the money come from? It's there, without
increasing the budget,'' he said.

<HEAD>Key Party Meeting on Solidarity Scheduled for Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party plenum to consider the
stance toward the banned trade union Solidarity will begin Monday.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, revealing the date, said he did
not know yet if the assembly of the 230-member party Central
Committee would last one or two days.
   The meeting will be the second part of a plenum that began Dec.
20-21. Its first session was highlighted by Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski's speech instructing Central Committee
members to poll the party rank-and-file for their current attitude
toward Solidarity and toward union chairman Lech Walesa.
   Members were directed to come back to the plenum in mid-January
with their answers and specific suggestions for action.
   The Rakowski speech was the strongest signal to date that
authorities are considering dropping the seven-year legal ban on
Solidarity, which is the condition that Solidarity has set for
entering talks with officials on negotiating a pact to attack
pressing economic and political problems.
   In the past two weeks, there have been signs of division among
the authorities with regard to Solidarity.
   Articles favorable to Walesa and the ``constructive opposition''
have appeared in the official press, alternating with thinly veiled
attacks.
   Urban said the party weekly Polityka plans to publish the program
of an anti-Walesa faction of Solidarity led by activist Andrzej
Gwiazda, which is on record as seeking greater confrontation with
the authorities.
   The unusual action appeared likely to spur fresh charges that
Solidarity is splintered and riddled with radicals who cannot be
trusted to engage in dialogue.
   Asked if the government is ready to change its stance toward
Solidarity, Urban declined to answer, saying the question likely
would be addressed at the plenum.
   ``I can only tell you that the results are unpredictable,'' he
said of the meeting.

<HEAD>Reagan Advisers Suggest Deposit Insurance Cut; Reaction Negative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's advisers on Tuesday
recommended curtailing deposit insurance for bank and savings and
loan accounts, triggering swift negative reaction from Congress and
the Treasury Department.
   In its final report to Reagan, the president's Council of
Economic Advisers said reducing protection for depositors would
encourage them to more closely ``monitor the financial health'' of
the institutions holding their money.
   But the Treasury Department, through Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,
senior Republican on the House Banking Committee, promptly distanced
itself from the latest proposal involving the troubled savings
industry in which a post-Depression record of more than 200
insolvent institutions were closed last year.
   At a hearing of the House committee, Wylie said, ``Curtailing
deposit insurance is not an option and will not be considered'' as
part of the S&amp;L plan being developed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady, who is staying on in the Bush administration.
   Wylie, who said he spoke after his office conferred with the
Treasury Department, said Brady will present the plan to
President-elect Bush by about Feb. 15.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, did
say a gradual reduction in deposit insurance may be considered as
part of solving the S&amp;L crisis. But he also said such a proposal
``is a very serious matter, not a matter to be thrown out as a trial
balloon.''
   Other Democratic and Republican members of Congress reaffirmed a
commitment to guaranteeing deposits up to the current $100,000 per
account limit.
   ``Congress will stand four-square behind the $100,000
agreement,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I'm appalled at the
timing of the administration. ... I think the public needs some
reassurance.''
   In its report, released by the White House, the Council of
Economic Advisers also sharply criticized Reagan-appointed savings
and loan regulators for ``postponing the day of reckoning'' in their
rescues of failed institutions.
   ``Most regulatory actions taken so far ... will sharply increase
costs to the general public,'' the report said. S&amp;L regulators'
practice of guaranteeing new owners of rescued S&amp;Ls against losses
for up to 10 years weakens the incentive to manage efficiently, it
said.
   The top regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, defended his agency's year-end spate of savings and
loan bailouts as cheaper than shutting down the failed institutions
and paying off depositors.
   Wall told the committee that his agency rescued 75 institutions
in December at a cost of $15.5 billion to be spread out over 10
years. Tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the government
an additional $4 billion.
   Liquidating the S&amp;Ls and shutting them down would have required
$47 billion in ``up-front cash,'' far more than is available
immediately to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Wall
said. However, by selling off the property of the failed S&amp;Ls,
regulators eventually would have recouped all but $22.8 billion on
the December transactions, he said.
   Wall and fellow bank board members Roger Martin and Lawrence
White cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreading
out the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money for
liquidations.
   First, Wall said, the bank board stopped the operating losses at
the rescued institutions. Second, it eased the need for the
institutions to pay above-market interest rates to attract
depositors. That in turn eases the pressure on still-healthy S&amp;Ls to
compete by raising their rates.
   For all of 1988, including December, the bank board committed
more than $38 billion to resolve the cases of 205 institutions, Wall
said.
   Several members of the committee expressed outrage that in some
deals, buyers of failed institutions are to receive tax benefits
worth more than the private money they are to put into rescued
institutions.
   ``The dealmakers who are walking away with more cash than they're
putting in from day 1 are laughing all the way to the piggybank,''
Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, told Wall. ``The acquirers have robbed you
blind.''
   Reagan's council, noting estimates up to $100 billion for solving
the S&amp;L problem, said ``a large portion of the payment of this bill
will need to come directly from the public.'' The report did not say
tax money would have to be spent, but many private analysts believe
that is inevitable.
   In the final Reagan budget, released Monday, the administration
called for spending $64 billion on S&amp;Ls through 1994 and
acknowledged for the first time that the government does not have
enough money coming in from the industry and other sources to handle
the cleanup.
   Citing the 1980 decision by Congress to boost the limit on
deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000, Reagan's economic
advisers said reducing the ceiling ``would restore much-needed
discipline to the system.''
   ``The scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantly
curtailed,'' it said. However, it did not recommend a specific
limit, nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply to
existing deposits or only to future deposits.
   Deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individuals
with a safe place for their money, but it ``also dramatically
reduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financial
health of their bank,'' the report said.
   The council's chairman, Beryl Sprinkel, said at the White House,
``Clearly, there is a big price to be paid, and some funds were
allocated by the president's last budget; additional will be
necessary in the future. But if we concentrate only on the price to
be paid and do not concentrate on reforming the industry, in my
opinion, it will be a temporary stopgap measure that will lead to
repeated losses in the future.''
   According to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, 13.3
percent of all S&amp;L accounts at the end of 1987 exceeded the
insurance limit. However, the average account had $8,440.

   The organization Citizens Action announced
plans Tuesday to campaign for changes in insurance laws in 14
states, patterned after the successful ballot initiative in
California.
   Robert M. Brandon, vice president of the federation of statewide
citizens organizations called Citizens Action, said a ``consumer
revolt against skyrocketing insurance rates'' has been spreading as
a result of the passage of Proposition 103 in California, which
ordered rollbacks in auto insurance rates.
   Brandon said the campaigns varied, but that in general they seek
tougher regulation, lower rates, full disclosure of financial
information and elimination of anti-trust exemptions for insurance
companies.
   He said campaigns were planned or underway in Connecticut,
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   Citizens Action is a federation of statewide citizens and
consumer organizations representing 1.75 million members.

   A guerrilla and a man accused
of mass murder are suspects in separate attacks on anti-apartheid
church groups last year, the government said Tuesday.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said he was releasing the
names of the suspects because the ``police were being maliciously
accused by certain people of being lax and unwilling to solve the
cases.''
   Anti-apartheid groups have said they suspect government security
forces of the attacks.
   Vlok said Shirley Gunn, who is white, and two unidentified men
were suspected in the Aug. 31 bombing of a building in Johannesburg.
   The bombing injured several people and destroyed the building,
which contained the offices of the South African Council of Churches
and several other groups opposed to the government.
   Vlok described Ms. Gunn, 33, as a member of the outlawed African
National Congress who had received ``terrorist training'' in Angola.
He said police believed the bomb went off prematurely when Ms. Gunn
and the others brought it into the house to work on it for use as a
car bomb.
   He said Hendrik Strydom, who is in custody and is accused of
killing seven people in a shooting spree in Pretoria, was a suspect
in a fire Oct. 12 that damaged the headquarters of the Southern
African Catholic Bishops Conference, also a government critic. No
one was injured.
   Police have said they saw a van with 11 people of both races
driving past the building in Pretoria just before the fire broke
out. Vlok did not refer to this in his statement.
   Strydom, 23, was apprehended Nov. 15 just following the shooting
spree, in which 15 people were injured. All the dead and injured
were black, except for one man of Indian descent.

   King Hussein told visiting U.S. lawmakers
Tuesday that he was optimistic about a solution to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, the official Jordan news agency reported.
   Hussein met with Republican Sens. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and
John McCain of Arizona, and then with Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio;
James Hansen, R-Utah; and James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
   Hussein said Jordan's renunciation in July to claims to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank has led to stronger relations between
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization, according to the
news agency.
   Kassebaum, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said in an interview before meeting Hussein that she favored ``a
little more even hand'' in balancing U.S. support for Israel and
Arab nations.
   But she said the senators told Israeli and Jordanian officials
that U.S. budget problems ``are not going to make any changes easy.''
   Kassebaum said she supported the U.S. decision to open talks with
the PLO after chairman Yasser Arafat's decision to renounce
terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist.
   But renewed terrorist activity ``would mean everything was off
again in terms of recognizing the PLO,'' she said.
   Kassebaum also said Israel's tough response to Palestinian
protests in the occupied territories has weakened U.S. public
support for Israel.
   ``Constituent mail comments back home clearly reflect that
Americans want not just to unquestioningly provide major amounts of
money to Israel without saying, `Just a minute now, you have some
problems, too.'''
   Kassebaum and McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, planned to arrive in Syria Wednesday night and in Egypt
Thursday.

<HEAD>Mary Lou Retton Sues Over Loss of Bowling-Promotion Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Mary Lou
Retton and her family are suing two bowling industry trade groups
for $250,000, alleging the organizations terminated a promotional
agreement due to changes in Retton's physical image ``caused by her
maturing as a woman.''
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court says that Retton, her
parents and a brother began representing the two trade groups in
July 1985 under a four-year agreement, with Retton to be available
for personal appearances and the other family members to be
available for the preparation of promotional material.
   The Rettons were to promote bowling as an activity for families,
young people and senior citizens under the arrangement with the
National Bowling Council Inc. of Washington and the Bowling
Proprietors Association of America of Arlington, Texas, the suit
says. The groups represent bowling alley operators.
   Last June, the trade groups notified Retton and her family that
the agreement was being terminated, the suit says, ``on the ground
that Mary Lou Retton, due to changes in her physical image caused by
her maturing as a woman, was no longer a suitable spokesperson.''
The court papers did not elaborate.
   The suit, filed Monday, alleges breach of the agreement and says
there was no provision in it permitting the trade groups to
terminate it for such a reason.
   Retton, of Fairmont, W.Va., as a 16-year-old captured the
all-around gold medal in women's gymnastics at the 1984 Summer
Olympic Games.
   A secretary at the bowling council said Tuesday that the group's
spokesman was out sick for the day. A spokeswoman for the
Proprietors Association, Connie Kerr, said she wasn't aware the suit
had been filed and had no other immediate comment.

<HEAD>Indian Film Festival Opens Amid Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 12th International Film Festival of
India opened Tuesday amid political protests by participating stars.
   At least 200 films from more than 45 countries will be screened
at eight theaters in the city in the next two weeks.
   The start of the festival was marked by protests against the
killing last week of Safdar Hashmi, a director and writer of street
plays.
   Shabana Azmi, a leading Indian actress, said Hashmi, a member of
the Marxist Communist Party, was ``murdered in broad daylight'' by
the followers of a member from the ruling Congress Party.
   The actress made the remarks while being introduced to the
audience during the function. Information and Broadcasting Minister
H.K.L. Bhagat, who inaugurated the festival, rebutted the allegation
and said strict deterrent action would be taken against those found
guilty.
   Hashmi was attacked Jan. 1 in the town of Sahibabad, on the
eastern outskirts of New Delhi, and died of his injuries two days
later. He was staging a play critical of the government when he was
attacked.
   Ms. Azmi co-stars with Shirley Maclaine, Dame Peggy Ashcroft and
Twiggy in John Schlesinger's film, ``Madam Sousatzka,'' which was
screened after the opening ceremony.
   The annual festival has broken away from the practice of holding
a competition section. The director of the festival, Urmila Gupta,
said the move was intended to attract ``a better quality of
cinema,'' since the competition section precluded screening films
that had been shown at other festivals.
   ``The quality of films this year is high and critics and
(movie-goers) will not have to take chances with unknown films which
may or may not prove good,'' Mrs. Gupta said.
   But many critics saw the move as self-defeating. The Indian
Express newspaper said the festival ``could have become important as
an alternative festival'' and ``held out hopes'' for cinema from the
Third World.
   The festival also will show retrospectives on the films of
Schlesinger, Vera Chytilova of Czechoslovakia, Lina Wertmuller of
Italy, West German-born Fritz Lang and India's Raj Kapoor.
   Special sections on Chinese films and black cinema from the
United States also are scheduled.

<HEAD>Reagan Defends Pilots' Actions as `Justified'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday defended the Navy
pilots who shot down two Libyan jets over the Mediterranean last
week, insisting the Americans ``were justified in doing what they
did.''
   Reagan, in a photo session with President Jose Azcona of
Honduras, was asked about a published report that the two Navy
pilots who downed the Libyan MiG-23s fired after their commander had
informed them they were in a cautionary ``warning yellow''
situation, rather than in the ``red'' condition reserved for
fire-at-will encounters.
   Asked if he believed the two pilots were ``trigger-happy'' and
had fired at the Libyan jets before they should have, Reagan
responded:
   ``No, I think to speculate on that is ignoring the facts. I have
said from the very beginning, I've never asked people to go any
place without the right to defend themselves against attack,''
Reagan said. ``All the evidence that we have, photographic, sound,
everything ... they were justified in doing what they did.''
   The president told his listeners, ``Remember, we're not dealing
with an earlier day with machine guns, ... today if a plane persists
in keeping you in line, when you are avoiding it, you have to assume
they are getting ready to push the button.''
   Spokesmen at both the White House and Pentagon disputed the
report, published in the Washington Post on Tuesday. The spokesmen
said the ``condition yellow'' issued by the commander on the scene
allowed the pilots to take defensive actions and to fire if
necessary.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the report in
the Post, said, ``The yellow warning indicates that pilots can take
defensive actions to defend themselves ... the fact is that under
the yellow caution, they have the right to defend themselves and to
fire, and they did.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard echoed Fitzwater's comments,
saying, that the ``warning yellow, weapons hold'' command issued by
the airborne warfare commander was intended to tell all of the
pilots ``to be careful; that there was a probability of hostilities,
and that they could shoot in self defense.
   ``I cannot go into the rules of engagement. ... But the actions
taken by the crews of the F-14's met the most rigorous
interpretation'' of the rules. ``They behaved prudently in
protecting themselves, their aircraft and their ship.''

   President Reagan knows he has a job
waiting once he leaves the White House.
   Reagan on Monday made a courtesy telephone call to businessman
Dale Cain _ he's used Cain's electrical contracting company in
speeches as an example of how hard work can pay off _ and got the
offer.
   ``By the way,'' Cain said he told the president, ``if you don't
have anything to do after Jan. 20, you always can have a job with
Cain &amp; Abell.''
   Reagan ``laughed and laughed,'' Cain said.
   Cain first wrote Reagan in early 1985 telling him about his
company and how it had grown since it was started in 1981 with
$1,000. Last year, Cain &amp; Abell Inc. had sales of more than $2
million.
   Cain was invited to the White House and met Reagan in March 1985
and has written the president several times since then. He said he
has had phone calls from Reagan at Christmas in 1986 and one
checking on his progress in mid-1987. Cain last wrote the president
on Dec. 17.
   Cain said that during the phone call on Monday Reagan apologized
for not getting back sooner. ``He said, `Things have been very, very
hectic around here' and laughed.''

   A renegade rooster sentenced to the city
dog pound has been eating dog food and then crowing about it.
   ``He starts that, and every dog in here howls,'' said Larry Cole,
dog pound director.
   ``He acts like he's in charge of the dogs. He's not scared of
anything. He eats all of his food every day _ I guess because it's
got grain in it.''
   The rooster was picked up Dec. 27 by dogcatchers after it was
spotted darting in and out of traffic.
   The law directs the ``fowl at large'' be taken to the city pound,
and the owner _ after ``briefly'' describing the bird _ must pay 25
cents per day for his release.
   Cole said to his knowledge, the pound has never kept a rooster
before.
   ``One of the guys said we had a horse once,'' Cole said.
   ``And we've had some calls about hogs running loose and goats,
but we never caught any.''

<HEAD>Defendant Says Bombings Were Protests Against South Africa Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-styled revolutionary told a
federal jury Tuesday that some of the bombings of corporations that
he, his wife and a cohort are accused of plotting were protests
against racism in South Africa.
   ``American corporations are the legs upon which the racist
community in South Africa walks,'' Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, of
Calais, Maine, said at the start of the sedition trial.
   ``You ought to ask yourself the question, `Who are the real
criminals? Those who oppose racist acts in South Africa or those who
support government interests in South Africa?''' he told the jury.
   Levasseur is one of three people facing trial in U.S. District
Court on charges of seditious conspiracy under a 1918 act that makes
it unlawful to plot to topple the government by force. The other
defendants are his wife, Patricia H. Gros Levasseur, 40, and Richard
Williams, 41, of Boston.
   The long-awaited trial is expected to last a year and to cost
upward of $10 million. The small courtroom was packed Tuesday with
10 federal marshals and 80 spectators, who entered through two
walk-through metal detectors guarded by more marshals.
   The defendants have described themselves in a handout as ``North
American anti-imperialists who believe armed resistance is one of
the necessary responses to apartheid, racism, sexism, the massacres
of native peoples and capitalist-backed wars.''
   Among the 19 bombings they are accused of plotting was a 1976
explosion at the Suffolk Superior Courthouse in Boston that injured
22 people. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks said in his
opening arguments Tuesday that the explosion was the group's attempt
``to cripple the Massachusetts penal system.''
   The prosecutor said he intended to prove the defendants conspired
to bomb courthouses, military offices and corporations throughout
the Northeast from 1975 to 1984 to further their radical aims.
   Loucks said he also would show the defendants plotted robberies
from Maine to Virginia and tried to murder an off-duty policeman
during one alleged robbery.
   He described the Levasseurs as core members of a group formed in
1976 that claimed credit for the bombings under the names of the
United Freedom Front and the Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit.
Williams allegedly joined in 1981.
   Five others who allegedly belonged to the group also have been
arrested. One will be charged separately, two have have pleaded
guilty to charges, and prosecutors dropped charges against two
others because of their long prison terms. The eight were arrested
in one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history.
   Levasseur described himself a political prisoner who had worked
for human rights among the poor, imprisoned and politically
oppressed in the United States and abroad.
   ``I believe the evidence will show a lot of the bombings were
done in support of freedom in South Africa,'' he said.
   He noted that the attempted bombing of the Union Carbide Corp. in
Needham, Mass., on Dec. 12, 1976, came shortly after anti-apartheid
demonstrators were fired upon in Soweto.
   ``The Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit attacked the property of
Union Carbide while this government collaborated with the police and
the military to kill 1,000 people,'' he said.
   Levasseur described his blue-collar upbringing in a Maine mill
town, his tour of duty in Vietnam and his imprisonment for trying to
sell $7 worth of marijuana in 1969.
   ``This is how I became a revolutionary, and that's what I am,''
he said. ``I don't feel I owe any allegiance to a system that's
going to perpetrate suffering in other peoples,'' he said.
   He bristled, however, at the charge of racketeering enterprise
and racketeering conspiracy. ``I don't think you can be a
revolutionary and a racketeer,'' he said. ``I'm neither
profit-oriented nor drug-oriented.''
   He said he had been under police surveillance much of his life
because of his work in organizing meat packers and prisoners and his
participation in civil rights and other social movements.
   ``This government is not going to be satisfied until my kids are
orphans,'' he said.

   A Continental Airlines DC-9 that skidded
off a runway was dragged out of knee-deep mud and inspected Tuesday,
officials said.
   The jet, carrying 58 passengers and a crew of five, ran off the
runway at Baton Rouge Metro Airport after landing on a flight from
Houston on Monday. No one was injured and the plane apparently did
not sustain any damage, officials said.
   A crew of workers flown in from Houston began working to free the
plane before dawn Tuesday, officials said. Airport spokesman Bill
Profita said there apparently was no damage to the runway.
   Although Continental spokesman Bill Messing said the accident
apparently was caused by a wet runway, an airport official said
there were no braking problems when Flight 1083 touched down.
   ``We tested the runway right after this happened, and the braking
action was good,'' said airport Director Iray Ledoux. ``I feel sure
the weather had nothing to do with this.''
   The runway is grooved to allow rain to drain off, Ledoux said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Emerit Lindbeck says he knows he has
some ``character failures.''
   His indictment in a vote-fraud case caused a stir in this
west-central Illinois community of 16,000 people. Then, he was
accused of slugging a man dressed as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.
   ``If I've done anything wrong, I'm sorry. And I will change,''
Lindbeck vowed at the close of Monday's City Council meeting. ``I
want you to know I wouldn't do anything to harm this community in
which I was born and raised.''
   ``I hate the publicity. I know I have certain character failures.
Maybe at times I've displayed them _ most recently, I'm sure,'' he
said.
   ``A few days ago I visited my parents,'' the mayor said. ``I was
embarrassed to go.
   ``They said ... `You're getting to be known all over the state of
Illinois and probably farther, and that may be good or bad. But
there's one spot where you're not really known that well. And that's
church.'
   ``I accept that advice,'' he said.
   Lindbeck has pleaded innocent to allegations that he struck
Ronald Heal, Kewanee Township clerk and a political rival, in a
dispute at a party on Christmas Eve.
   Heal, who was dressed as Santa Claus, said he suffered a black
eye, facial cuts and a split lip.
   In the vote-fraud case, the mayor _ charged with forgery and
mutilation of election materials _ was indicted along with several
other current and former officials. They all pleaded innocent.
   ``As I said before, I'm confident this will all work out,''
Lindbeck told the council Monday. ``I'm very proud to have been
elected to serve the community over the past 10 years, and I'm still
the mayor of Kewanee. Hopefully, and proudly, I will continue to
be.''

<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold an additional
360,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 1 million
tons authorized Dec. 30 for China under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Under the EEP arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   The wheat sales were handled by five companies: Continental Grain
Co., 40,000 tons; Entrade International Ltd., 30,000; Central States
Enterprises Inc., 50,000; Ferruzzii USA Inc., 100,000; and Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 140,000.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an
average subsidy rate of $22.79 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel.
   Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
China has 210,000 tons still available under the program.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 360,000 tons of wheat would be about 13.2 million
bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4.09 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $54 million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retiring U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield praised
President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz on Tuesday for
their interest in the Pacific region, which he said holds the key to
future world relationships.
   Mansfield, at a ceremony marking his retirement as ambassador to
Japan, said of Reagan and Shultz, ``For the first time, people in
your official positions ... have shown a continuing, a sustained, a
personal interest in the Pacific basin as a whole, in the Far East
in general and in Japan in particular.''
   ``I think that the future relationships in the world will be
decided by what happened in the 20th century (which) I look upon as
the century of the Pacific,'' he added.
   ``We are witnessing just the beginning of a new era; we are
building the foundation blocks for that era in the last years of
this century,'' Mansfield said, noting that U.S. trans-Pacific trade
has swelled from $42 billion to $250 billion since 1975.
   Mansfield spoke at a State Department gathering attended by
Shultz and by Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga.
   Japan is currently in official mourning for Emperor Hirohito, who
died last Saturday.
   Mansfield said in a brief interview that as a junior congressman
in the last days of World War II he had been among those
recommending consideration be givento allowing the emperor to stay
on in order to promote earlier surrender and orderly reforms. The
recommendation proved correct, he said.
   Mansfield, 85, was presented his ambassadorial flag and a plaque
marking 50 years of public service at Tuesday's ceremony. He had
been a U.S. Marine, copper miner, University of Montana professor,
congressman and finally Senate majority leader for 14 years when
President Carter named him ambassador to Japan in 1977.
   He said credit for successes in U.S.-Japan relations should go to
Shultz and to countless State Department foreign service specialists
``who have manned the ramparts year after year, decade after
decade,'' often at a cost of earlier promotions they might have won
by staying in Washington.

   The long-range Conservation Reserve Program has
been expanded so that certain cropped wetlands and other highly
erodible land subject to damage from occasional flooding can be
added to the program, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the lands will be eligible for the
conservation program only if cropped in two of the five crop years
1981 through 1985.
   To be eligible, the land ``must be scoured by erosion caused by
out-of-bank water flows which can be expected to flood at least once
every 10 years,'' he said.
   The deparment's Soil Conservation Service estimates there were
more than four million acres of wetlands used for crops in 1982.
Most of the land is in the north central states or in the flood
plains of the Mississippi and other major rivers.
   Land put into the program must be planted to trees or other
approved vegetative cover. In return, farmers can collect federal
assistance to establish the protective cover and annual rental
payment for 10 years.
   The next signup for CRP will be Feb. 6-24. More than 28 million
acres have been enrolled so far. The goal is to have at least 40
million acres of highly erodible land in the program by the end of
1990.

<TEXT>
   A 65-year-old woman who was raped in her home
was allowed to decide the prison term of her attacker because of her
age, the visciousness of the assault and court delays, a judge said
Tuesday.
   ``I'm not advocating that the victims decide the penalty but I
thought it was the fairest thing to do in this case,'' said Hennepin
County Judge William Posten, who said he told the woman, ``You tell
me what you want me to do and I'll do it.''
   The victim was given a choice Monday between two options in the
prosecution of James Halvorson, 25. She could accept the conditions
of a plea agreement for a 54-month prison sentence that would be
effective immediately, or she could have the case go to trial and
hope for a conviction. The latter might have resulted in a prison
term of up to 108 months.
   Assistant County Attorney Kevin Johnson said a conviction was
nearly certain because police arrested Halvorson in the woman's
home. But because Halvorson was free on bond and the victim feared
being attacked again, she chose the 54-month prison sentence in lieu
of a trial.
   ``She knew he would be going straight to prison'' and wouldn't be
eligible for parole for three years, said Johnson, who noted that
the victim had become frustrated by delays that had twice postponed
court proceedings.
   Cindy Clarkson, a sexual assault counselor who worked with the
victim, said the woman was haunted by the thought of a repeat attack
and moved in with family members. The house she had lived in for 30
years has been put up for sale, Clarkson said.
   ``She was feeling pretty powerless,'' Clarkson said. ``What the
judge did was wonderful. Just wonderful. She just couldn't believe
that someone in the system like a judge would take the time to
listen to her and actually give her a choice.''
   ``Wasn't that something?'' the woman marveled after choosing the
sentence.
   Posten said he has allowed victims to help decide the fate of
criminals in only a few cases.
   Asked why he granted the privilege Monday, Posten said,
``Somebody that is raped early in the morning and it's a little lady
that's a great-grandmother _ all this had an effect. It was the way
the whole thing developed. The delays were part of it too.''
   According to the criminal complaint, Halvorson broke into the
woman's Golden Valley house through a kitchen window about 4:30 a.m.
June 16. The noise awoke the woman and she went to investigate. The
man dragged her from the kitchen to the bedroom, covered her head
with a blanket and raped her. He fell asleep after the attack and
the woman ran to a neighbor's house to phone police, Johnson said.
   Earl Gray, Halvorson's attorney, said his client was ``drunk out
of his mind'' at the time. He said Halvorson lived near the woman.
   Halvorson had recently been convicted of drunken driving for a
fourth time. Two days before the rape occurred he received a delayed
jail sentence, said Judge Eugene Farrell.
   Prosecutors in the rape case asked that Halvorson be held in jail
under $50,000 bail, but bail was set at $25,000 and Halvorson was
released after posting a $2,500 bail-bond, Johnson said.
   The victim told the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune Monday that the
judge was ``just beautiful. He was so kind. He said, `It's your
decision.' I liked that. I think three years is a long time for a
young person.''
   Clarkson said the victim did not want to be interviewed Tuesday
because ``she's just kind of worn out and tired of it all.'' But the
woman wanted to stress that rape is horrible no matter how old a
person is, Clarkson said.
   Gray called Posten's decision ``a very intelligent move.''

<HEAD>Reagan Sends His Final Economic Message To Congress</HEAD>

   Tax cuts helped produce peacetime prosperity in
America, and ``all that is required to reduce the deficit is to
halt, or moderate, the increase in expenditures,'' President Reagan
said Tuesday.
   In his last economic message to Congress, Reagan said success in
dealing with problems of unemployment, inflation and taxes resulted
from his strategy of curbing the federal government's role in the
life of private business.
   ``I leave office secure in the knowledge that these policies have
worked, and confident that this great nation will continue to lead
the way toward freedom and prosperity for all mankind,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said the high inflation and slow growth of the 1970s gave
way during his term in office to a long economic expansion and a low
unemployment rate.
   ``By reducing taxes and regulatory bureaucracy, we have unleashed
the creative genius of ordinary Americans and ushered in an
unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity,'' Reagan said.
   After ticking off economic gains over the past eight years,
Reagan said that ``as proud as I am over these and many other
accomplishments, I will be the first to admit that the agenda is not
yet completed. First and foremost is a need to reform the budget
process and to bring federal spending under control.''
   The president said that ``the large budget deficit that this
nation faces is not a result of too few taxes, but too much
spending. ... All that is required to reduce the deficit is to halt,
or moderate, the increase in expenditures.''
   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,
told reporters at a White House briefing that gains ``were not due
to Reagan luck, but rather due to specific policies of this
administration to reinvigorate the private sector.''
   In projections in the report, Sprinkel predicted continued gross
national product growth of 3.2 percent this year and at least that
each year through 1994.
   During his briefing for reporters, he noted that some critics
have described the administration's economic growth and revenue
forecasts as ``a rosy scenario.''
   Sprinkel said the forecasts were based at least in part on ``the
assumption that the basic thrust of policy in this administration
will be continued'' in the Bush administration.
   Reagan sent his last budget to Congress on Monday, recommending a
$1.15 trillion spending plan, bearing a $92.5 billion deficit, for
the fiscal year opening Oct. 1.
   President-elect Bush has said the Reagan budget generally
reflected his own views about fiscal policies but indicated he will
offer alternatives shortly after taking office next week.
   Sprinkel said he did not think it unrealistic to formulate
projections about the nation's business health on the assumption
that a Bush administration will employ the same Reagan
administration emphasis on a free market-oriented economic strategy.
   ``I listened to the (presidential) campaign,'' he said. ``I read
the lips. I have worked with Vice President Bush rather closely.''
   ``At this stage of the game, it seems sensible to us to assume
that, yes, there will be some new priorities, but, no, we're not
moving away from market orientation,'' Sprinkel said.

   Striking students protesting overcrowding and a
lack of government aid on Tuesday threw rocks and bottles at police,
who used truncheons to disperse them at West Berlin's Free
University, officials said.
   Seven police officers were injured, officials said.
   The police officers were trying to escort students to classes
past demonstrators, who staged a boycott and tried to block an
entrance to the university, officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 200 students in Frankfurt marched through
the city's center carrying banners protesting the use of police
force in West Berlin.
   The students, most in their late teens and early 20s, marched
from Frankfurt's main train station to the city's large
``Hauptwache'' shopping area. Police in squad cars and on foot
followed the marchers. There were no incidents.
   The protest came one day after police in West Berlin were
summoned to the Kreuzberg area of the city to quell a reported
disturbance.
   When four policemen entered the foyer of an apartment building to
check on the report, about 20 young people in black leather jackets
attacked them with clubs and tear gas, police said in a statement to
the news media.
   Four policemen were injured in the attack, which broke off only
after police reinforcements arrived and a warning shot was fired in
the air.
   The four injured police were hospitalized for treatment.
   Five of the youths involved in the attack were arrested and face
assault charges, the statement said.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush told Honduran President
Jose Azcona on Tuesday that he will work to keep relations between
the two countries ``strong as they are today.''
   Azcona said they talked as friends but that the discussion
included ``the difficult situation Honduras finds itself in''
because of U.S.-backed rebels using Honduras as a staging ground for
opposition to Nicaragua's government.
   Bush, talking briefly to reporters after he met with Azcona at
the White House, said, ``I told him I felt that relations between
Honduras and the United States were good, excellent.''
   ``We know there's enormous pressures, regional pressures,'' the
president-elect said of economic and social conflicts in Central
America. ``I told him that we needed some time in the new
administration to formulate our policies. I also told him that there
would be no surprises and that the relationship between Honduras and
the United States under the new administration would be strong as
they are today.''
   Before meeting with Bush, Azcona met with President Reagan in the
Oval Office, and the Honduran president told reporters he believed
Reagan had been ``a good friend'' of his country.
   Bush did not answer directly when asked whether he had discussed
with Azcona the level of U.S. support for the Contra rebels
resisting the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   ``We discussed almost every subject you can think of,'' Bush
said, when asked that question.
   Honduran officials have spoken out against the presence of Contra
forces which have massed inside their borders.
   Azcona, speaking through an interpreter, said he discussed with
Bush ``the difficult situation that Honduras finds itself in because
of the problem of the Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries.''
   ``We said, and we have always said, that this is the product of
the lack of internal democracy inside of Nicaragua,'' he said. ``But
in any case ... we said that we felt ... a solution should be
hastened, should be pressed for and hastened inside of Nicaragua.''
   ``President Reagan and President Bush always have expressed their
concern about the Central American problem,'' he said. ``They have
also said that they were worried about it. We understand that both
of them are interested in a political situation inside of Nicaragua.
They are interested in having a democratic solution pushed for.''
   Of his meeting with Bush, he said, ``We had a very frank
conversation and a friendly one. It was a conversation without
reservations and of the kind of frankness that we like when we have
talks with friends.''

   The Justice Department, in an effort to cut
expenses, fired 21 employees Tuesday from its public affairs and
legislative affairs staffs.
   Of the 11 people laid off from the public affairs office, six are
spokesmen, including two with more than 20 years of service.
   Three of the four spokesman who will be on the payroll after the
cuts take effect Feb. 10 will be political appointees.
   ``It was like a bomb went off,'' said one fired spokesman, Brad
Marman. ``Stone shock.''
   Also being laid off are 10 employees from the Office of
Legislative Affairs, said Thomas Boyd, assistant attorney general in
charge of that office. Those workers include professional and
support staff, career and political appointees, he said.
   The reductions are ``being done to allow the department to beat
its budget requirements,'' Boyd said.
   The 21 people being laid off receive total annual salaries of
$955,983, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, deputy director of public
affairs.
   Loye Miller, public affairs director, said the decision by
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh's staff to lay off 11 people in
his office ``came as a surprise, although I did know ... that OMB
(the Office of Management and Budget) had undertaken to cut us back.
... I knew something was brewing, but I didn't anticipate anything
of this severity.''
   ``In these times of severe budgetary constraints and concern
about ensuring adequate law enforcement, the focus of our attention
and resources must necessarily be on direct law enforcement
programs,'' Deputy Attorney General Harold G. Christensen said in a
memo to Harry H. Flickinger, assistant attorney general for
administration.

<TEXT>
   A book on terrorist groups was published
Tuesday by the Pentagon which said it should make Americans more
aware of the nature of terrorism and the threat it represents to
national security interests.
   Charles S. Whitehouse, assistant defense secretary for special
operations and low-intensity conflict, said the 131-page book broke
little new ground in describing terrorist groups around the world
but should be helpful as a comprehensive reference document.
   ``This is not an intelligence document, but rather a compilation
of open-source material that has been verified by classified
sources,'' Whitehouse added.
   ``Copies will be distributed starting today to public government
agencies, to public libraries as well as to government libraries. It
will also be distributed to law enforcement activities, diplomatic
posts and domestic and overseas Department of Defense components and
activities,'' he said.
   Whitehouse said the publication had nothing to do with recent
Reagan administration claims that Libya is building a plant that
could supply chemical weapons to terrorists.
   Work on the book began in mid-1987, he said, adding the United
States has no evidence that any terrorist group has actually tried
to use chemical weapons in an attack.
   ``But the fact that weapons of this kind have been used in the
recent past (in Iran and Iraq) and are available makes the
likelihood of their being used (by terrorists) greater than it was a
year or two ago,'' he said.
   The book, ``Terrorist Group Profiles,'' describes the Abu Nidal
group in the Middle East as ``the most dangerous terrorist
organization in existence.''
   A second Defense Department official with ties to the
intelligence community, who appeared with Whitehouse Tuesday on
condition he not be identified, said Abu Nidal received that
description because of ``the indiscriminate nature of their
targeting.''
   ``When Abu Nidal wants to send a message to a government ... we
have not seen for the most part select assassinations of that
government's leaders, but attacks on the population of the
country,'' the official said.
   ``That kind of indiscriminate targeting, and the tremendous
operational security under which Abu Nidal operates, makes it a very
lethal, dangerous group,'' the official said.
   The official declined to discuss details of the investigation of
the recent bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland. But he said
the United States knows of ``eight different groups that have
successfully detonated a bomb on an aircraft in flight that resulted
in 11 different aircraft (incidents).''
   ``So the technology ... (of building such a bomb) is more
widespread than I think is generally understood by people,'' the
official said.
   The official said that while Libya appears to be increasing its
support of terrorism around the world, Iran must still be considered
the world's top supporter of terrorism.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, waving his bandaged hand for
the television cameras, said Tuesday that it feels fine and he
expects to get a splint on it soon.
   ``Isn't it pretty?'' Reagan said with a laugh as he waved his
left heavily bandaged hand for photographers during a picture-taking
session with President Jose Azcona of Honduras in the Oval Office.
   On Saturday, Reagan underwent 2{ hours of surgery at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center to have a curvature of his left ring finger
corrected. The ailment is known as Dupuytren's Contracture and
caused his finger to curve inward.
   The president returned to the White House on Sunday, after
spending two nights at the hospital for the operation, which is
considered routine.
   Asked how he felt after a day back at work, Reagan said, ``I feel
just fine.''
   The president went on to lavish praise on the team of physicians
who worked on him at the hospital, saying he wanted to ``give great
credit'' to his military doctors.
   ``I was very fortunate to have this operation here because this
is a specialty of the military,'' Reagan said of the operation.
   Dr. Stephen Shaffer, a specialist in hand surgery, said the field
of hand surgery first developed in the Army during World War II, but
has since moved actively into the civilian medicine. Extended
fellowship training and extra examinations are now required before a
surgeon can become a certified hand specialist.
   ``The guys I know at Walter Reed are all good surgeons,'' he
said, but added that such expertise is now also commonly available
in the civilian medical community.
   Reagan said he expects to have his hand put in a splint on
Wednesday.
   The president is expected to wear what is known as a ``dynamic''
splint, which allows the finger to flex _ and thereby be
strengthened with exercise _ so that the finger does not return to
the curved position caused by the ailment.

   Multiple-candidate parliamentary elections still
are promised for March, but the Kremlin set the opposite example
Tuesday by choosing only 100 nominees from the Communist Party, one
for each of the seats assigned to it.
   Historic political reforms passed into law Dec. 1 said
``conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited number
of candidates'' for the Congress of People's Deputies, the new
Soviet parliament.
   Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies are to be elected by the public
March 26. One-third are being chosen by organizations _ including
the Communist Party, which has 100 seats, and trade unions and
scientific groups.
   But based on the Central Committee action Tuesday, party members
will have no choice in electing their deputies, since only 100
candidates were nominated.
   In a speech delivered before the decision, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said 312 names remaining from tens of thousands submitted
had gone to the ruling 12-member Politburo, and it reduced the list
to 100 before sending it to the Central Committee.
   No change has been made in the language of the new election law,
but the party's example ``will set the standard'' and other
organizations will be less likely to offer real choices, a Western
diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   Multiple candidates already have been nominated in some areas.
Tass, the official news agency, said 26 candidates were chosen in 19
Moscow districts.
   Other signals from Tuesday's meeting of the party Central
Committee were conflicting.
   Gorbachev, who has promised repeatedly that the elections will be
part of his ``democratization'' of the Soviet Union, offered a draft
political platform for the party and suggested other organizations
would offer their own.
   ``The Soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasks
formulated by the party for the immediate future, and the platform
it takes to elections,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. The
document was not released Tuesday.
   ``We should proceed from the premise that the other social
organizations will come to the elections with their own campaign
documents,'' and individual candidates can also offer their views,
Gorbachev said.
   He was referring to other national organizations, including trade
unions and scientific groups, which have been empowered to directly
elect deputies to the congress. The Communist Party is the only
legal political party in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidates
nominated so far in the three-month election campaign are supporters
of perestroika, his policy of reforming the Soviet system.
   But the president complained the campaign has produced
``manifestations of group egotism, ambition and political
careerism,'' and worried that some candidates might play on ethnic
disputes.
   Under the political reform adopted in December, the new congress
will meet once a year to elect a smaller working parliament of 424
members.
   Gorbachev said that party members had suggested 31,500 nominees
for its seats in the new congress. But these were winnowed down and
finally just 100 were chosen by the 12-member ruling Politburo.
   Those 100 candidates were nominated by the party's 300-member
Central Committee Tuesday, Tass said.
   A Western diplomat said it was possible that others could be
nominated at the last minute.
   Tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies,
``all communists will have an opportunity to express their attitude
to any of the candidates.''
   But even then, rank-and-file party members won't even have the
chance to vote, Tass said. Only party leaders will cast ballots in a
special meeting March 15-16.
   Those empowered to vote for the party's legislators will be
members of its Central Committee, its auditing commission, first
secretaries of the republic and regional party organizations, second
secretaries of the republic party organizations, presidents and
prime ministers of the republics, ministers and heads of state
agencies, and commanders of military districts, Tass said.

<HEAD>Bush Supports Education</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush on Tuesday pledged to be
an advocate for public school improvement and to offer ``every
feasible assistance'' to schools and districts pursuing reforms.
   Bush told participants in a White House education workshop that
the federal government should do everything in its power to
strengthen the links between families and schools ``and that speaks
for a broader federal role in education than might immediately be
apparent.''
   Despite ``tough budgetary times,'' Bush said, ``I do intend to
provide every feasible assistance to states, to districts interested
in further experimentation with choice plans and other valuable
reforms.''
   Bush, who campaigned on a pledge to be an education president,
called for school reform fueled by state and local innovations. He
said he will ask the Education Department ``to monitor and focus
continued attention on the need for future progress and I'll be a
spokesman and advocate for further public school improvements. It's
up to all of us together.''
   Bush said the most promising reform may be public school choice _
the subject of the workshop. In choice projects around the nation,
parents are being given latitude in selecting which school their
children will attend.
   ``Too often today it is our disadvantaged children who are most
likely to be burdened by inadequate public education,'' Bush said.
``For this reason alone, for the benefit of the empowerment that it
promises to our disadvantaged kids, our disadvantaged citizens,
further expansion of public school choice is a national imperative.''
   Supporters of the choice concept say it makes schools more
competitive and responsive, improves morale and attendance, reduces
disciplinary problems and dropouts, and improves learning among
students.
   President Reagan, addressing the choice workshop earlier in the
day, cited the examples of ``a Harlem school district in which
scores have risen dramatically because parents are now permitted to
choose which school to send their children to'' and a Minnesota
program ``that is fostering unprecedented competition among public
schools to make them more attractive to parents and students.''
   Among those attending the workshop were the heads of the nation's
two teacher unions, who said Reagan's speech appeared to signify an
increased concern about strengthening public schools.
   ``With some safeguards, public school choice is an excellent
program and ought to be supported,'' said Albert Shanker, president
of the American Federation of Teachers.
   ``I didn't hear anything about vouchers or tuition tax credits
and those would be the red flags for us,'' said Mary Futrell,
president of the National Education Association. The concept of
choice ``does have potential. We are cautiously optimistic about
what we're hearing.''
   Bush addressed the educators after holding separate meetings with
Honduran President Jose Azcona and Prime Minister M. Charles of
Dominica.
   In transition personnel developments, U.S. officials said Robert
Kimmett, a Washington lawyer who served with James A. Baker III at
the Treasury Department and the White House, is the odds-on choice
for the No. 3 job at the State Department under Baker.
   The job of undersecretary for political affairs is usually held
by a career foreign service officer. But Kimmett's connections
evidently helped him vault past several experienced contenders,
including Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway.
   Only the secretary and deputy secretary have more authority.
Baker's deputy will be Lawrence Eagleburger, who spent 27 years in
the foreign service and then entered private business.
   Transition officials said Bush will name Jennifer Fitzgerald as
deputy chief of protocol at the State Department. Fitzgerald, a
longtime aide, currently runs Bush's vice presidential office in the
Senate.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday for the
first time opened the way for a United Nations role in the Middle
East peace process, but he again rejected the PLO as a negotiating
partner.
   In the occupied territories, an alleged Palestinian collaborator
was killed, reportedly by other Arabs, and 10 Palestinians were
reported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops.
   Shamir told representataives of the European Parliament that
Israel would accept U.N. involvement in Middle East peace
negotiations. The Parliament has been pressing Israel to negotiate
with the PLO.
   Shamir said any peace talks must be held directly with Arab
parties to the conflict and ruled out the Palestine Liberation
Organization's sitting at the bargaining table.
   ``Such negotiations can be launched under the auspices of the
great powers (the United States and the Soviet Union) or the United
Nations, providing they refrain from any involvement in the
substance of the talks,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir has contended until now that a U.N.-sponsored forum would
be biased against Israel and force concessions from the Jewish state.
   The Arab states want an international conference attended by the
five permanent Security Council members _ the United States, the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ who would play an active
role in negotiations.
   European Parliament Speaker Lord Plumb addressed Israel's
Parliament after Shamir's statement, saying the European Community
supported an international conference under U.N. auspices with the
PLO as a negotiating partner.
   He said European Community members also believe the conflict
could not be resolved unless Israel withdrew from the occupied
territories and recognized the Palestinians' right to
self-determination.
   ``It is clear that without the recognition of the legitimate
rights of the Palestinians there cannot be any prospect of a durable
peace for any country in the region,'' Plumb said.
   Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, appeared to
adopt the tactics used by Palestinian protesters and declared a
one-day general strike in at least 32 settlements for Thursday.
   Their leaders said the strike was to protest the death of three
Israelis in the West Bank last month and Palestinian stone-throwing
attacks.
   At least 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded Tuesday in clashes
with Israeli soldiers in a half dozen towns and refugee camps in the
occupied territories, Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   Arab hospital officials said a 12-year-old girl was shot in the
head and wounded during a confrontation between troops and
stone-throwing youths in Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
   They said a 17-year-old youth was shot in the head with a rubber
bullet in another Gaza refugee camp and a 23-year-old man was hit in
the chest with a live round in the West Bank village of Beit Lit.
   The army confirmed nine wounded and said they included a girl
from Shati taken in serious condition to an Israeli hospital.
   Arab reporters said Palestinians who collaborate with Israeli
authorities shot and killed a 27-year-old man in the West Bank
village of Idna Monday night after he refused to feed them
information.
   An Arab reporter quoted family members as saying the victim,
Kayed Muhammad Tmaizi, acted as an informant for Israeli security
forces until the Palestinian uprising began. They said he recently
was pressured to renew his cooperation.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
Tmaizi's death and maintained Tmaizi was killed in a dispute among
Palestinians. He did not elaborate.
   The death brought to 349 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Fifteen Israelis also have died since the uprising began Dec. 8,
1987.
   Shamir and the European delegates exchanged sharp words Tuesday
about Israel's peace stance and a possible European role in the
Mideast conflict.
   Shamir accused the European Community of ``adopting positions on
the substantive issues of the conflict ... which lack balance,
supporting the PLO and accepting the concept of a Palestinian
state.''
   Marco Pannella of Italy accused Shamir of refusing to make
concessions to the Palestinians. ``We're beginning to get fed up
with the fact that when you talk about peace, you do so in very
bellicose tones,'' he said.
   ``Continuing in this way, you'll be a kind of dinosaur head of
this very monolithic state of intolerance,'' Pannella said.

   Diplomats on Tuesday tried to resolve a
deadlock between Greece and Turkey that threatens to block new
East-West arms talks and a landmark human rights accord before
President Reagan leaves office.
   Weary delegations from the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations
adjourned Tuesday after five days of trying to remove the
last-minute hitch.
   They agreed to resume at 11 a.m. Wednesday, a U.S. delegation
source said on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier Tuesday, a Western diplomat said, ``If we don't have
anything this afternoon, we get very close to the time when we will
not be able to finish'' before the U.S. administration leaves office
on Jan. 20.
   The dispute between the two Balkan nations, traditionally
suspicious of each other, emerged after delegates from the East and
the West thought they had wrapped up two long years of negotiations
on new arms control talks and human rights guarantees in Europe.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Greece
surprised everybody last week by insisting that more of eastern
Turkey be included in the area covered by the new talks on reducing
conventional troops and weapons across Europe.
   Turkey had finally won agreement from the Soviet Union last week
that the port of Mersin and other parts of eastern Turkey should be
excluded from the new arms talks.
   This seemed to open up prospects for what U.S. ambassador Warren
Zimmermann in a Dec. 30 interview billed as potentially ``the most
important Europe-wide arms control negotiations ever held.''
   The talks are designed to reduce Warsaw Pact and NATO troops,
tanks and airborne forces from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains
deep inside the Soviet Union.
   They could begin as early as March, according to diplomats from
NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
   But if the Greek-Turkish dispute is not solved by the end of this
week, the new East-West arms talks cannot be set before the Reagan
administration leaves office, diplomats say.
   The overall agreement at the 35-nation Helsinki review conference
on security and human rights in Europe also would be at risk.
   The mandate for the new arms control talks is supposed to be part
of the final document agreed on by the 35 nations at the conference,
which began work in November 1986.
   A draft of the final document was presented last week, a day
before the United States and Britain removed a major obstacle by
announcing they are willing to attend a 1991 human rights meeting in
Moscow.
   Zimmermann hailed the human rights provisions in the draft
document as ``historic,'' and indicated only minor changes were
needed.
   But the agreement would be on hold _ probably subject to U.S.
review _ if it is not adopted before Reagan leaves office and Bush
takes over, he said.
   Canada still has not agreed to the Moscow conference, and Romania
also presented 17 major objections _ rejected by diplomats
responsible for the draft _ to the human rights provisions.
   The Vienna conference includes the Soviet Union, the United
States, Canada and all European nations except for Albania. All 35
nations must agree to the final accord by consensus for it to take
effect.
   Austria has invited the foreign ministers of all 35 participating
nations to a concluding session Jan. 17-19.

   Officials have begun Nazi war
crimes investigations of 670 people who the United Nations says
allegedly committed atrocities in World War II, a prosecutor said
Tuesday.
   Chief Prosecutor Christoph Schaefer told reporters at a news
conference in Frankfurt that the names were obtained from the U.N.
by West German officials who track suspected Nazi war criminals.
   Schaefer said the U.N. records, which were not made avaiable for
nearly 40 years to West German officials, contained names of people
who were not investigated previously by the West German government.
   Jochen Schroers, a spokesman for Schaefer, said authorities first
will determine ``among other things, how many of the people being
investigated are still alive.''
   ``As you know, most of them are quite old by now, and many have
probably died,'' Schroers said.
   ``Until the investigations are complete and it is determined
there is cause to file charges, I cannot release any of the names,''
he said.
   Schroers said the list included no prominent names.
   He said he did not know when the investigations would be
completed.

   A 90 trillion-mile-long stream of gas is flowing
toward the center of the Milky Way, perhaps fueling a massive black
hole at the very heart of the Earth's galaxy, astronomers reported
Tuesday.
   Researchers said their discovery is the first evidence of a thin
river of gas being sucked across the heavens by the awesome gravity
of a black hole.
   The radio telescope observation, made by an international team,
provides new support for the still-controversial idea that a massive
black hole exists at the center of the Milky Way.
   ``That is the gravitational well of the galaxy. We think that
stars drift toward the center. It's a natural place for a massive
black hole to form,'' said Paul Ho, who directed the research at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge. He
reported the results Tuesday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
   A black hole is what remains when stars collapse upon themselves,
leaving only a speck of infinite density. Their gravitational pull
is so strong that nothing escapes, not even light.
   Even though black holes cannot be seen, astronomers look for
other evidence of their existence, such as the gravitational tug on
nearby celestial orbs.
   Ho's discovery, made with astronomers from the Max Planck
Institute in Munich, the University of Cologne, West Germany, and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, may prove to be such
evidence in the Earth's galaxy.
   Astronomers had earlier spotted signs of a massive gaseous cloud
around the Milky Way's center, which is about 30,000 light years
from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. A light year is 6
trillion miles, the distance light travels in a year.
   Experts believe that this cloud is swirling around a black hole
that is 1 million times more massive than the sun. They theorize
that parts of the cloud constantly tumble into the black hole.
   Perhaps the equivalent of one-thousandth of the mass of the sun
is drawn into the black hole each year. This produces tremendous
amounts of kinetic energy, the energy released by motion.
   ``These black holes could be the most powerful generators that we
know about,'' said Ho.
   The latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across
space, providing the fuel that keeps the Milky Way's black hole
going. Ho believes that recent stellar explosion knocked loose part
of a large island of gas. This, in turn, was grabbed by the gravity
of the black hole and pulled in a stream into its own orbiting cloud.
   ``This is a complex region,'' said Bonnerd J. Teegarden of the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ``Results like these
are adding a lot to our understanding.''
   Teegarden said that most, but not all, astronomers believe that a
massive black hole exists at the Milky Way's center.
   The nature of black holes ``pushes hard on the basic concepts of
physics,'' he said. ``Physicists don't really know what happens when
you collapse a million solar masses of matter down to a point. The
laws of physics, as we know them in the laboratory, are inadequate
to explain such an extreme situation.''

<HEAD>50,000 in Lithuania Allowed to Rally Against Hitler-Stalin Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50,000 people in Vilnius on Tuesday freely
protested the Hitler-Stalin pact, which led to Soviet annexation of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, activists reported from the
Lithuanian capital.
   In September, paramilitary forces in armored personnel carriers
attacked a similar demonstration in Vilnius.
   Tuesday's two-hour rally had government approval, and authorities
even publicized it with a brief newspaper announcement, Valdas
Analauskas, correspondent in Lithuania for the unofficial journal
Ekspress-Kronika, said by telephone from Vilnius.
   ``Police were not even visible,'' he said.
   Lithuania's conservative Communist Party chief was replaced in
October with a reformer, Algirdas Brazauskas, who attended a
conference of the grass-roots political organization People's Front
later that month.
   He also returned the Vilnius Cathedral, which had been used as a
museum since the 1950s, to the Roman Catholic Church.
   At Tuesday's rally, 20 speakers demanded Lithuanian independence
and withdrawal of ``the Soviet occupation army,'' calling the 1939
Hitler-Stalin pact a ``shameful lie,'' Analauskas said. The Baltic
nations were independent from the end of World War I until Soviet
annexation in 1940.
   The 1939 agreement ostensibly was a non-aggression treaty between
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, but a secret protocol provided
for the Soviets to annex Baltic states and Germany to invade Poland.
   Speakers at the demonstration Tuesday represented the League for
a Free Lithuania, the Lithuanian Democratic Party and the National
Council of Young Lithuanians, Analauskas said.
   At the September rally, police and soldiers shoved demonstrators
and beat some with rubber truncheons. They charged four times to
disperse the tens of thousands of people singing Lithuanian songs
and carrying the flag of the former independent republic.

<HEAD>Nurse Goes On Trial Charged With Murdering 17 Elderly Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WUPPERTAL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse whose colleagues jokingly
called her ``Angel of Death'' because elderly patients died during
her shift went on trial Tuesday on charges of killing 17 patients
with lethal doses of medicine.
   Michaela Roeder is accused of killing the patients between
February 1984 and February 1986.
   ``The accused felt herself the mistress over life and death. She
decided who was allowed to live and allowed to die,'' prosecutor
Karl Hermann Majorowsky told the court.
   Majorowsky said Ms. Roeder told some patients who were able to
understand that they were about to die. ``Alone in 1985, 11 of the
patients were murdered,'' he said.
   He said Ms. Roeder used the drug Catapresan to reduce the
patients' blood pressure to fatal levels, or Caliumchloride, which
caused heart failure.
   Ms. Roeder admits giving fatal doses to six elderly patients, but
says she did it to spare them pain.
   Her attorney, Siegmund Benecken, said Ms. Roeder ``at least in
one instance'' accidentally killed a patient when she administered
the wrong injection.
   Majorowsky demanded that Ms. Roeder be tried for murder on all
counts, but the court said a lesser charge of manslaughter had to be
considered in each instance.
   On Tuesday, Ms. Roeder testified about her childhood difficulties
with her mother.
   ``My mother once told me the day I was born was the blackest day
of her life,'' she said.
   She said she felt ``nursing was my vocation'' and that her
ability to get along with patients was one reason she was assigned
to the intensive-care ward at St. Peter's Hospital in Wuppertal,
about 37 miles north of Bonn.
   She faces a possible life sentence if convicted.
   The case has gained national attention because the killings
almost went unnoticed by police.
   On a tip from a hospital employee, authorities had the bodies of
28 former patients exhumed and examined.
   Ms. Roeder, who began working at the hospital in 1978, was
arrested in March 1986.
   Most of the 17 patients she is accused of killing were in
intensive care following operations for ailments ranging from
appendicitis to cancer, West German news media have reported.
   The court, which has scheduled 26 sessions over the next several
months, is expected to hear testimony from at least 40 witnesses and
eight medical and other experts.

<TEXT>
   Pro- and anti-abortion groups, unlikely allies,
agreed Tuesday that the government does not need to spend tens of
millions of dollars to determine whether abortion damages a woman's
physical or emotional health.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop proposed such a study, he said in
an interview with The Associated Press, because ``the data simply do
not support the premise that abortion does or does not cause a
specific, post-abortion psychiatric syndrome.''
   Koop had been asked by President Reagan to prepare a
comprehensive report on the issue, but said he told the president he
could not because there is no scientific evidence to support the
pro-life belief that abortion harms women or the pro-choice stance
that abortion is beneficial.
   Koop, who said he remains firmly opposed to abortion, told Reagan
that a comprehensive study costing from $10 million to $100 million
would take five years to complete.
   ``That seems like a lot of money, but when you figure that 1.5
million women get aborted every year, that's only $75 per woman,''
Koop said.
   Pro- and anti-abortion groups said a study is not needed.
   Nancy Broff of the National Abortion Rights Action League praised
Koop for doing a ``fair study'' and said the tens of millions he
proposes spending on another study could be better used for
contraception research.
   Nellie Gray of March for Life said Koop is ``highly misguided,''
adding, ``We don't need any more studies; what we need is for Koop
to retire.''
   However, one anti-abortion group, National Right to Life, said a
study like the one Koop is proposing is ``long overdue.''
Psychological harm from abortion often surfaces five to 10 years
after the abortion, and existing research generally is based on
studies of women in their first year after abortion, said Olivia
Gans, an official of the group.
   The decision on whether such a study should be conducted likely
will fall to President elect-Bush, who upset anti-abortion forces
with his nomination of Dr. Louis Sullivan to head the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   Sullivan drew an outcry from anti-abortion forces when he said in
a newspaper interview that he supported a woman's right to seek an
abortion but opposed federal aid to pay for it. He later said he
opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life
of the mother is threatened, which mirrors Bush's view on abortion.
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for the Bush transition team, said she
did not know whether the incoming administration would pursue Koop's
recommended abortion study.
   Reagan administration officials had nothing to say about Koop's
decision not to issue a report, a decision he detailed in a letter
delivered to the White House on Monday. Presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan ``doesn't have any characterization one
way or the other'' of the letter.
   Koop said that when he left the White House after talking to
Reagan aides on Monday, ``I had the impression that I would be
hearing from Mr. Reagan.''
   In the letter, Koop told Reagan that among the president's
advisers, ``it was a foregone conclusion that the negative health
effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming that the evidence
would force the reversal of Roe versus Wade,'' the landmark Supreme
Court decision.
   Koop said he had met with 27 groups that had philosophical,
social, medical or other professional interest in abortion and
reviewed nearly 250 studies on the issue _ all of which he found to
be biased or flawed in their methodology.
   ``The data do not support the premise that abortion does or does
not contribute to psychological problems,'' he said in the letter.
``Anecdotal reports abound on both sides. However, individual cases
cannot be used to reach scientifically sound conclusions.''
   He said a comprehensive study free of bias ``would set a lot of
things to rest.''
   ``We have two groups of people saying very honestly and very
sincerely different things. The people who are pro-choice say: `Of
course there are health effects of abortion on women. They are so
delighted to get rid of their unwanted pregnancy it's a source of
relief. And I've known people like that.
   ``And there are the pro-life people, on the other hand, who say:
`We know all sorts of people who have tremendous problems with guilt
after they've had an abortion and it isn't necesarily something that
happens the first year, it can happen five or ten years later. And
I've known people like that.''
   ``But the problem is you cannot prove those things
scientifically'' with the current data.

   Union-backed workers demanded higher pay
after consumer prices rose in the first of four waves of price
increases the government plans to impose this year, official media
reported Tuesday.
   In an open letter on Monday to Premier Miklos Nemeth, the
presidium of the Csongrad County council of trade unions in southern
Hungary protested the increases taking effect the same day, the
state news agency MTI said.
   MTI said the trade unions made it clear to the government that
``the tolerance of the population has reached a critical level.''
   On Monday, tens of thousands of workers in Szabolcs-Szatmar
County in northeastern Hungary staged a 10-minute warning strike to
protest the price increases decreed by the government.
   The price rises were caused partly by cutting state subsidies of
a vast number of consumer goods, a condition set by the
International Monetary Fund for governments seeking credits or
rescheduling arrangements.
   Hungary's total Western debt is now believed to total about $17
billion, the highest per capita in the East bloc.
   MTI also said conservative estimates indicate about one out of
every four Hungarians is poor _ nearly 2.6 million out of a
population of 10.6 million.
   In 1987, 1.9 million people, or 18 percent of the population,
lived below subsistence level, MTI quoted the Central Statistical
Office as saying.
   No figures were given for last year, but government austerity
measures, new taxes and several price rises have worsened the
problem.
   MTI said that in Budapest, the capital, 25,000 families or 6
percent had rent arrears in 1987, with their total debt amounting to
an equaivalent of $2.4 million.
   Electricity in Budapest has been cut off to an average 150
apartments a week because renters were behind on their utility
bills. The total annual debt in utility fees was $15.4 million, MTI
said.
   The news agency also said that according to figures released by
the Central People's Control Committee, up to 400,000 elderly people
in Hungary had no pension or other regular income last year.
   Regular social support is given to only 48,000 of them, the
report said, indicating that the remainder must rely on relatives or
friends.

   George Bush will lead the U.S. delegation to
the funeral of the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito on Feb. 24, five
weeks after Bush is inaugurated as president, the president-elect's
spokesman announced Tuesday.
   Bush will be accompanied by his wife, Barbara, spokesman Steve
Hart said. He had no other details on the itinerary, composition of
the delegation or other travel planned by the incoming president.
   Hirohito died last Saturday of intestinal cancer at the age of
87. He was succeeded as emperor by his son, Akihito.
   The Japan trip is the first foreign travel announced for Bush,
who will be inaugurated Jan. 20.
   The announcement confirmed that the incoming administration will
continue to stress the importance of U.S. ties with Japan, described
at the State Department earlier Tuesday as the most important U.S.
bilateral relationship in the world.
   The late Japanese monarch is now known as the Emperor Showa,
using the historical name of his reign, which covered 62 years
marking Japanese military expansion, the nation's defeat in World
War II, reconciliation, reconstruction, dramatic economic growth and
new prosperity.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Tuesday publicly joined the
United States in opposing Third World demands to link bans on
chemical and nuclear weapons.
   Delegates to the 150-nation conference on chemical weapons worked
toward a compromise final declaration that could be delayed by U.S.
resistance on linkage and other issues.
   The Soviets were known to share the U.S. view, and on Tuesday
they publicly joined in opposing linkage.
   ``We are against making the resolution of nuclear disarmament a
precondition for chemical disarmament,'' Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Victor Karpov told a news conference.
   In an upbeat remark, Karpov also told reporters the conference
was ``doomed to success'' _ signifying it would achieve progress
despite wrangling.
   Western delegates said a final declaration will be issued when
the five-day conference closes Wednesday.
   The declaration will have no legal power but will carry weight as
an expression of international political will.
   The final declaration is reached by consensus, so any
disagreement could mean delay or even failure.
   Since the conference opened Saturday, Arab states demanded
linkage between nuclear and chemical weapons bans. They want to
retain chemical weapons to offset what they claim is Israel's
nuclear capability.
   Non-aligned nations offered changes to soften Arab language,
eliminating explicit references to nuclear arms. But the United
States remained opposed, conference sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   The aim of the conference is to reaffirm support for the 1925
Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of chemical weapons but not
their manufacture and stockpiling. It aims to give political impetus
to the Geneva negotiations on disarmament, which includes talks on
chemical weapons.
   The United States also opposes efforts by some countries to deny
signers of the Geneva Protocol the right to express ``reserves,''
which means retaining the right to use chemical weapons in
retaliation. Many of the 118 signers expressed such reserves.
   ``The American delegation is not prepared to agree to a bad
deal,'' said a source close to the U.S. delegation, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   However, reports filtering from the closed-door negotiations were
positive.
   Karpov referred to a Soviet pledge to start destroying chemical
weapons stocks this year, and said a trial experiment will be held
near midyear.
   But he said the pace of destruction will also depend on ``whether
there is progress or not in the preparation of a Geneva convention.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced the plan
in Paris on Sunday.
   ``We'll have a trial experimental stage of destruction when the
factory is ready for use, maybe by the middle of the year,'' Karpov
said.
   ``We'll see the effectiveness of the process. ... Then we can say
how much we can destroy each year.''
   Yuri Nazarkin, Moscow's special ambassador to the Geneva
disarmament conference, said, ``The principal problems toward a
chemical weapons agreement have been solved.''
   Reaching a compromise in Paris could be difficult.
   ``The Americans are not blocking the conference, but they are
very strict on the two points,'' said a top Western delegate,
referring to the reserves issue and linking nuclear and chemical
weapons.
   The United States has ``very real preoccupations,'' he said on
condition of anonymity.
   The Arab bloc lifted its demand for an explicit reference to
linking nuclear and chemical weapons and would accept language
contained in a 1978 special session on disarmament calling for
``total disarmament,'' Western delegates said.
   A draft proposal under study Tuesday night contains no reference
to nuclear disarmament, but refers to ``general disarmament,''
according to a conference source. But the term evidently remained
unacceptable to the United States.
   The United States and Soviet Union are the only two countries to
admit having chemical arms. About 20 nations are thought to possess
chemical weapons capability.
   Despite the differences, the final declaration will be ``firm,
precise and direct,'' a French delegate said. ``We have stayed in
the same framework'' originally foreseen when the conference was
being prepared.
   Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it has nuclear weapons
but has said it would not be the first country to introduce such
weapons into the Middle East.

<HEAD>Couple Arraigned In Utah As Idaho Authorities Begin Extradition Paperwork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple was arraigned Tuesday on fugitive
warrants stemming from the abandonment at a rest stop in Idaho of
their retarded 7-year-old son, who was identified when a 5-year-old
recognized him on TV.
   Third Circuit Judge Michael Hutchings set a Feb. 10 preliminary
hearing for the couple and ordered a public defender appointed when
Edward Donald Tuinman, 29, said he and his wife, Deborah Tuinman,
28, couldn't afford to hire an attorney.
   Utah authorities said they also are investigating whether the
child, Eddy Tuinman, was abused previously.
   Eddy was found Jan. 4 at a rest stop on Interstate 84 east of
Boise, Idaho. The boy was discovered clad only in a T-shirt in a
pile of urine-soaked clothes.
   Hospital officials at St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise
said the boy was developmentally disabled and unable to speak. They
said he weighed 44 pounds, had old, healed fractures and bruises and
cigarette burns on his body.
   The Tuinmans' other children, an 11-month-old boy, a 6-year-old
boy and an 11-year-old girl _ were examined at a Nephi, Utah,
hospital, where doctors found no signs of neglect.
   Ada County Sheriff Vaughn Killeen said a 5-year-old Utah boy who
recognized Eddy on television led authorities to the arrest of the
parents.
   The boy's mother, Debbie Maddera, a former neighbor of the
Tuinmans, notified authorities, Killeen said.
   Eddy is staying with a foster family in Idaho and his sister and
brothers were in protective custody in Utah. At a juvenile court
hearing Monday in Salt Lake City, the children's grandparents
requested custody.
   In Boise, prosecutors said they had begun drafting documents
needed for Gov. Cecil Andrus to issue a formal warrant asking Utah
Gov. Norm Bangerter to return the Tuinmans to Idaho. The couple have
been charged in Idaho with felony abandonment of a child.
   ``We're off and running,'' said Deputy County Prosecutor Jay
Rosenthal.
   He said Idaho authorities are waiting for medical reports from
St. Luke's Regional Medical Center.
   Rosenthal said he expected that Idaho's felony abandonment
charges against the Tuinmans would take precedence over the Utah
charges.
   ``We can bounce them (Tuinmans) back and forth between the
states. But that costs the taxpayers money and may not be the best
thing to do,'' he said. Idaho has 30 days to complete the
extradition paperwork.
   Authorities said the Tuinmans, arrested in Nephi Saturday, had
not decided Tuesday whether to fight extradition.
   Edward Donald Tuinman complained during a five-minute hearing
Tuesday in a packed courtroom that Salt Lake County Jail officials
had refused to allow him to make telephone calls. He also questioned
the fairness of his wife facing along with him a theft of services
charge.
   The judge ordered that Tuinman be allowed to make a telephone
call and said he would look into whether Mrs. Tuinman should face
the theft of service charge, which stems from $2,000 in unpaid
natural gas bills while the couple lived in Sandy, a Salt Lake
suburb, from April to June last year.

   Police arrested 13 demonstrators protesting the
monarchy Tuesday, but a poll showed 80 percent of the people support
for the centuries-old system.
   The government proceeded with elaborate funeral plans for Emperor
Hirohito, 87, who died of cancer Saturday after a 62-year reign.
   A spokesman for President-elect George Bush said Bush will lead
the U.S. delegation to the state funeral Feb. 24.
   The funeral will cost $74.3 million, including $25.6 million for
the state service, $20.8 million for a mausoleum in a Tokyo suburb
and $19.2 million for security, officials said.
   ``That will be an appropriate amount to make solemn but not showy
(events),'' Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said.
   The funeral for Hirohito's father in 1927 cost the government
about $24 million, Kyodo News Service said.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said in Washington that Bush will
attend the funeral in his first announced overseas trip after his
inauguration Jan. 20. Hart said Bush will be accompanied by his
wife, Barbara, but he had no other details on the itinerary or the
delegation.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has been expected to visit the
United States for talks with Bush, and the newspaper Asahi Shimbun
quoted an unidentified government source Tuesday as saying the visit
will come in early February.
   Representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to
attend the funeral, including up to 50 heads of state and government.
   The National Police Agency will mobilize more than 30,000 police
to ensure the safety of visiting dignitaries and discourage
disruptive actions by extremists, the agency said Tuesday.
   Japan's largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, said a telephone poll
conducted Saturday and Sunday of 1,876 people indicated that 82
percent support the emporer as the symbol of state, up 10 percent
from three years ago.
   The emperor once was considered a living god. But under Japan's
post-World War II constitution, he is ``a symbol of the state and
the unity of the people.'' His duties are largely ceremonial and
include meeting visiting dignitaries and fixing his seal on new laws.
   About 100 youths demonstrated against the monarchy Tuesday, and
13 were arrested after protesters on a rooftop at Meiji University
in Tokyo hurled flares and firecrackers onto a city street.
   There were no reports of injuries or major damage, police said.
   About 150 riot police were dispatched to the protest, during
which the demonstrators shouted, ``Abolish the emperor system,'' a
police official said on condition of anonymity.
   About 200 citizens marched peacefully in downtown Tokyo and
called for an end to praise for the emperor, police said.
   Flags continued to be flown with black ribbons attached or at
half staff in an official six-day mourning period that began
Saturday. Most businesses were not affected, and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's main indicator climbed sharply to a record high for the
second consecutive day.
   Florists were deluged with orders for white chrysanthemums, used
for funerals in Japan, and suppliers in Taiwan reported they were
hard pressed to meet the demand.
   Flower growers in central Taiwan, the major chrysanthemum
suppliers to the Japanese market, could provide only 30 percent of
the requirement, said the Taiwan Flowers Export Association.
   The Imperial Household Agency said 178,254 people went to the
palace Tuesday to sign a register of condolences, bringing the total
to 1.2 million. Another 350,000 people had signed registers
elsewhere in Japan, it said.
   In an editorial in its Wednesday editions, Asahi Shimbun said of
condolences from countries, including those invaded by Japan during
World War II:
   ``Such expressions of condolence are partly a result of the
efforts of the emperor himself to heal the wounds of war by paying
visits to foreign countries or meeting the heads of state who came
to Japan.
   ``We are reminded that the wounds of war remain deep more than 40
years after the end of the war and that it takes still more time to
heal them. As hard as it is, we have to accept the historical fact
as such and must continue our efforts to heal them.''

   The first contingent of 450 Cuban soldiers left Angola as part of
a U.S.-mediated agreement to remove foreign forces from that African
nation and bring independence to neighboring Namibia.
   The agreement requires 3,000 Cuban soldiers to be out of Angola
by April 1 and all 50,000 to be gone in 27 months. South African
forces withdrew from southern Angola into Namibia on Aug. 22. All
but 1,500 South African soldiers are to be out of Namibia in time

   In Hungary, Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Ferenc Karpati said
preparations for withdrawing some of the 62,000 Soviet Red Army
troops in Hungary were nearly complete.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised in a speech to the
United Nations last December to reduce military forces by half a
million in two years and pull 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks out of
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Neither Karpati nor Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz gave a
specific date, but Grosz said the Soviet pullout ``is to commence
within weeks.''

   The Kremlin's top envoy to Afghanistan, Yuli M. Vorontsov, said
there is ``serious danger'' the Soviets will not resume their
pullout of 50,000 soldiers remaining in Afghanistan in time to meet
the negotiated Feb. 15 deadline.
   In April 1988, the Soviets agreed to withdraw all troops and
announced last fall they had withdrawn the first half of their more
than 100,000 soldiers.
   Vorontsov's statement indicated the Kremlin may delay or freeze
its military withdrawal, but it was not clear whether it signaled a
change in Soviet intent, or was designed to pressure Moslem
guerrillas to accede to peace proposals floated by the Kremlin.

   At least 20 people were killed in fighting
between pygmies and other ethnic groups in southwestern Uganda, the
government newspaper New Vision reported Tuesday.
   It said pygmies, complaining of discrimination, set up roadblocks
in the forest southwest of Rukingiri town and shot at non-pygmies
with bows and arrows, killing five people.
   They vanished into the forest when soldiers arrived, and members
of other tribes, angered by the army's failure to capture them,
pursued the pygmies and killed 15 with machetes, spears and clubs,
the paper said. Its report said the fighting occurred three weeks
ago.
   New Vision quoted a pygmy spokesman identified only as Mushoro as
saying: ``A pygmy living in this part of the country cannot have
land on which to settle. A pygmy cannot go to the bar and have a
beer.
   ``When someone's goat gets lost, they claim it was stolen by us.
Aren't we people like others? Why do they hate us when even some of
them have married our daughters?''
   Pygmies arrived in the 1970s from Rwanda, Uganda's southern
neighbor. Like kinsmen in neighboring Zaire, their height averages
about 3 feeet and they usually live in forests, eating meat, roots
and wild fruit.
   The paper said Mushoro was hired by the Forestry Department
because of his knowledge of the bush.
   He was quoted as saying the pgymies had called upon kinsmen in
Zaire to help fight ``enemies'' in the area about 280 miles
southwest of Kampala, capital of Uganda.

   Arctic air dropped temperatures to 45 degrees below zero in
Minnesota on Tuesday, the cold mark for the nation so far this
winter, while parts of the central Rockies had springlike weather.
   In northwest Minnesota, readings included 45 degrees below zero
at Roseau and 43 below zero at Warroad. As late as 11 a.m., the
temperature at Roseau was only up to 34 below zero.
   In North Dakota, the temperature fell to 32 below zero at Devils
Lake and to 31 below zero at Williston and Bismarck.
   The arctic air prevailed over the upper Mississippi Valley and
northern Plains Tuesday, but relatively mild temperatures dominated
Tuesday afternoon in western portions of the northern and central
Plains. Readings included 46 degrees at Douglas, Wyo., and 54
degrees at Denver.
   Along the eastern slopes of the Wyoming Rockies, winds gusted to
64 mph at Casper and to 52 mph at Douglas.
   A small tornado touched down just south of Salt Lake City Tuesday
morning, causing minor damage to houses, uprooting fences and
toppling trees. There were no injuries reported.
   Rain fell in southeast Virginia and eastern North Carolina, with
scattered rain from Georgia to the central Gulf Coast region.
   In the Pacific Northwest, 2 inches of snow fell at Mount Vernon,
Wash., but most coastal sections had rain. Inland, 11 inches of snow
fell overnight at Rendezvous Peak in Wyoming and more than a foot
was reported in Snoqualmie Pass in Washington's Cascades.
   Snow also fell in the northern Great Lakes region. Heaviest
snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST was 4 inches at
Pellston, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 24 below
zero at Roseau, Minn., to 83 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla. The low in
the nation Tuesday morning was 45 degrees below zero at Roseau.
   For Wednesday, the National Weather Service forecast light snow
over much of the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern half of the
Great Plains, the central Rockies and the central Plateau region.
Snow showers were predicted to be scattered over the northern
Rockies and rain showers were to be scattered across southern
California. Showers and thunderstorms should reach from eastern
Texas across Louisiana to southern Arkansas. Rain was forecast to
occur over much of Missouri and from Mississippi to portions of the
Carolinas. Widely scattered rain showers were forecast over Florida.
   High temperatures will be in the single digits and teens from
northeast Montana across much of the Dakotas and Minnesota to
northern portions of Wisconsin and Michigan. Temperatures should
reach the 50s and 60s from portions of California across the desert
Southwest, much of New Mexico, the southern Plains, lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys to Georgia and the Carolinas.
Temperatures should reach the 70s and 80s over the Florida
peninsula. Over much of the rest of the nation highs were expected
in the 20s, 30s and 40s.

<HEAD>Canadians in Furor Over Refugee Plea of Ex-Nazi Mouthpiece</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>

   His lawyer said Tuesday that Vladimir Sokolov
faced death if denied refugee status, but a major Jewish
organization argued Canada should not be a haven for ``Nazi
collaborators ... fleeing U.S. justice.''
   Sokolov, 75, a former Yale University lecturer, was found this
week to have fled to Canada after being stripped of U.S. citizenship
in 1986 and threatened with deportation when his World War II Nazi
propagandist background was uncovered.
   Immigration authorities reported that Sokolov arrived in Canada
last March and later applied for refugee status, claiming his life
would be in danger if he was forced to return to his native Soviet
Union.
   Roger White, a spokesman for the federal Immigration Department,
said in a phone interview from Ottawa that Sokolov ``appeared at an
immigration center in Montreal in August and indicated he wished to
make a refugee claim. ... He'll be processed as a backlog claimant
and he'll eventually appear before a panel which will hear his
case.''
   Sokolov's lawyer, Julius Grey, said his client cannot be sent
back to the United States because he is no longer an American
citizen. U.S. authorities said Sokolov concealed his Nazi past when
he entered the United States in 1951 as a displaced person.
   ``The United States doesn't want him,'' Grey was quoted by the
Canadian Press as saying in an interview. ``I'm sure they'll say no.
And if they say yes it'd only be for the purpose of removing him to
the Soviet Union,'' where he could be executed.
   ``According to their law he collaborated with the enemy in
wartime so it's a serious matter. But we just don't return people
for that reason. ...
   ``Treason is not something that we can allow other countries to
enforce within Canada.''
   The news agency quoted Jack Silverstone, national executive
director for the Canadian Jewish Congress, which represents over
300,000 Jews in Canada, as saying in an interview, ``Canada cannot
continue to be a haven for Nazi collaborators who are fleeing U.S.
justice.
   ``Had he indicated that (Nazi) activity to the U.S. authorities
when he applied he would not have been eligible for a visa.
   ``We regard this as an abuse of the refugee process and ... we
obviously would hope that the Canadian authorities would take prompt
action and have him returned to the United States where he faces
U.S. proceedings.''
   Sokolov failed to appear at a U.S. deportation hearing in July in
Hartford, Conn.
   From 1942-44, Sokolov was a writer-editor on a Russian-language
newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of Orel, 210
miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared under his name.
   He went to the United States in 1951, became a citizen in 1957
and in 1959 began lecturing on Russian language and Soviet dissident
literature at Yale. Yale's student paper later found out about his
wartime activities and he quit his job. U.S. officials later began
proceedings against him.
   Grey said Sokolov is in poor health and is staying in a house in
Montreal. He would not reveal the address.

   Libya and the non-aligned nations offered a
watered-down resolution Tuesday deploring the United States for
shooting down two Libyan fighter jets, but they continued to blast
Washington in their speeches.
   Britain and the United States have indicated they will veto any
resolution that criticizes the U.S. Navy, which they say acted in
self-defense.
   ``It will not be passed, that is what will happen,'' vowed
Herbert S. Okun, the second-ranking U.S. ambassador. ``It will not
be adopted, you can be sure of that.''
   Third World nations backed off from the harsh rhetoric that
followed the Jan. 4 downing of the Libyan jets. Their latest draft
resolution toned down its criticism in a campaign to isolate America
and its steadfast ally, Britain, on the council.
   Originally condemning the incident and later strongly deploring
it, the latest version of the U.N. Security Council resolution
``deplores'' the shoot-down. It also dropped the reference to an
``unprovoked attack.''
   ``It is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned; they
have inserted some fig-leaf language,'' said Okun.
   Formal introduction of the resolution and a vote, originally
planned for Tuesday evening, were postponed after 11 members asked
to speak before the 15-member body.
   Decrying the use of force and U.S. intentions toward Libya were
speakers from East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yemen,
Malta, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, the Islamic Conference, and
two South African liberation groups, the African National Congress
and the Pan Azanian Conference.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali A. Treiki told the council the U.S. 6th
Fleet told Libya aviation authorities it planned more aerial
maneuvers near Libya Jan. 16-17.
   Okun said he was unaware of such plans but afterward told
reporters: ``I don't think it would be strange, not in international
waters. The Mediterranean is a very big place.''
   The United States has said the two Libyan MiG-23s were armed and
closing in an attack approach on two U.S. warplanes on routine
patrol with the U.S. Navy in international waters in the
Mediterranean off Libya.
   Washington asserts the MiGs changed course five times to
intercept the U.S. F-14 Tomcats before the American pilots shot them
down.
   The U.N. Charter permits nations to use force in self-defense.
   Libya says the MiGs were unarmed reconnaissance planes. On
Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters showed the Security
Council photographs of one of the MiGs, which appeared to have
missile pods on it.
   Libya's envoy, Ali Sunni Muntasser, claimed the photographs were
retouched to add the armaments.
   On Friday, a first draft of the anti-U.S. resolution would have
had the council members ``condemn'' America for the ``unprovoked
attack,'' and call for the U.S. Navy to leave the Mediterranean.
   The latest draft diluted the criticism to having the council say
it ``deplores the downing of the two Libyan reconnaissance planes''
and call for the U.S. Navy to suspend its maneuvers off Libya.
   It dropped the previous demand that the Navy leave international
waters, because French envoy M. Pierre Brochand made clear in a
speech Monday that France could not accept the abridgement of free
passage in international waters. France borders on the Mediterranean.
   The softened language of the resolution is an attempt to win over
France and other wavering members of the council that might
otherwise abstain, such as Canada, Brazil and Finland.
   The five permanent members of the council, who hold veto power,
are the Soviet Union, China, Britain, France and America. The
Soviets and Chinese intend to vote in favor of a critical resolution.
   The non-permanent members of the council are Canada, Finland,
Brazil, and the non-aligned movement nations of Colombia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Ethiopia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Officials: City Manager Got Hired With Phony Resumes, Bogus References</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Donald James said he was suspicious
of Carl Keyser Jr. shortly after Keyser took over as city
administrator of the southeast Alaska town of Kake.
   ``I could never trust him,'' James said Tuesday. ``I even told
him myself. I told him there's something there that's just not
right.''
   James' suspicions proved correct.
   ``Nearly every aspect of his resume was not true,'' District
Attorney Mark Ells said.
   Officials filed a first-degree theft charge against Keyser last
week, alleging Keyser falsified his resume and obtained about
$28,000 in salary, moving, travel and other work-related expenses
from the town.
   Keyser, a Huntington, W.Va., native, was being held Tuesday in
lieu of $10,000 bail at the jail in Petersburg, south of Kake.
   The City Council hired Keyser in early October based on glowing
recommendations from references on his impressive, four-page resume.
   Two months later, officials learned Kake was just the latest and
most remote stop in Keyser's cross-country government career, a
career officials say was based on phony resumes and bogus reference
calls.
   Kake is a fishing and timber town of 665 residents, mostly
Tlingit Indians, about 75 miles south of Juneau on the northern tip
of Kupreanof Island. It is about as far as Keyser could have gone
from his last job, a six-day stint as city manager of Pikeville,
Ky., and remain in North America.
   Keyser left the Kentucky post in August after the news media
uncovered discrepancies in his resume. Kake officials hired him in
October, unaware he was wanted on a fugitive warrant from Pikeville.
   They also did not know Keyser had pleaded guilty last January to
a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying in sworn statements while
applying for police chief in Oak Hill, Fla.
   Among the references Keyser listed on his resumes was Al Haines,
city manager of Beaumont, Texas. Haines said he knew little about
Keyser and did not recall Keyser asking him to be a reference, nor
did Kake officials call him.
   James said he called the references listed on the resume, but he
now thinks the people answering the calls were impostors arranged by
Keyser.
   ``It seems like it was set up,'' he said.
   Keyser, 34, declined a request for an interview. However, in a
tearful interview two weeks ago with Petersburg radio station KFSK,
he maintained his innocence and suggested he was a victim of a
conspiracy in Pikeville.
   ``It's a situation where the press and some of the officials
there want to make some type of example of me,'' he said.
   Pikeville charged Keyser with theft by deception for failure to
reimburse the city for $697 in travel expenses. He said he would
have returned the money had officials asked.
   Keyser's resume listed master's and bachelor's degrees in public
administration from La Salle University in Philadelphia. He also
listed experience as a consultant to the International City Managers
Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
   Officials say there is no record that Keyser attended the
university or worked for the associations. In October, the city
managers' group issued a warning about Keyser in its newsletter,
urging members to investigate applicants' resumes.
   It was that warning that led Kake officials to investigate. He
was fired and arrested on theft charges in December.
   James said many were suspicious soon after Keyser took the
$44,000-a-year administrator's job. After the City Council
authorized Keyser to buy a residence for him, his wife and four
daughters, he bought a luxurious $66,000 double-wide mobile home
that was more than the council expected.
   He aroused further suspicions by buying two rifles and ammunition
with city funds and refusing to publicly release his resume,
authorities said. More than 200 residents signed petitions asking
for his removal.
   ``Carl just seemed to be living beyond our means,'' resident Mike
Jackson said. ``A lot of people were concerned about that because
the city has had real financial problems.''

<HEAD>Researcher Says Hepatitis Strain Eludes Screening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to a third of those who contract non-A,
non-B hepatitis may be infected with mutant strains of hepatitis B
that elude blood donor screening, an expert on the virus reported
Tuesday.
   Girish N. Vyas, professor of laboratory medicine at the
University of California at San Francisco and head of the
Transfusion Research Program, based his finding on a study of blood
donors on the Italian island of Sardinia.
   Non-A, non-B is a catch-all term for any hepatitis that can't be
identified as A or B. Officials at blood banks around the country
say at least 3 to 5 percent of blood product recipients in the
United States get hepatitis; 90 percent of the post-transfusion
hepatitis is non-A, non-B.
   Chronic hepatitis is primarily B and non-A, non-B. It is the
major cause of liver disease around the world and the main reason
for liver transplants.
   The study showed two of 618 donors had no immunologic or other
markers to indicate hepatitis B infection, although they had genes
from the virus in their blood. Only one of them had antibodies to
hepatitis B core proteins and would have been screened out in the
United States.
   The research was detailed in Tuesday's edition of the journal
Blood.
   Vyas said the mutant hepatitis B strains apparently make altered
surface proteins that can't be recognized by the body's immune
system and so they don't stimulate production of antibodies against
it.
   Current blood screening tests for hepatitis B don't recognize the
altered proteins and can't detect the B-like virus.
   American blood banks also screen for the presence of antibodies
to proteins in the core of the virus, and for high levels of the
enzyme ALT for signs of liver damage. But some mutant hepatitis B
viruses also fail to stimulate antibodies to core proteins, so they
can be detected only by time-consuming DNA analysis tests looking
directly for hepatitis B genes.
   Doctors quoted in last month's journal Lancet said there was a
test to screen for the non-A, non-B hepatitis, but it takes at least
12 hours.
   UCSF spokesman Robert Sanders also said there are other tests
that look for indications of related problems. But he said the test
mentioned by doctors in Lancet are too expensive and time-consuming.
   Vyas is working on developing a test for the mutant strains,
Sanders said.
   Sanders said that all the evidence points to the mutant strains
seen in the Sardinian study also existing in the United States.
   Vyas participated in the Sardinian study along with colleagues at
the University of Cagliari. The study was supported by a Transfusion
Medicine Program project grant by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
   Vyas first suggested in 1981 at the International Symposium on
Viral Hepatitis in New York that genetic mutants of hepatitis B
could be responsible for some cases of non-A, non-B.
   He and Dr. Herbert Perkins, director of San Francisco's Irwin
Memorial Blood Bank, originally observed non-A, non-B
post-transfusion hepatitis in San Francisco as early as 1973. Their
observations were published as preliminary evidence in 1982 and in a
definitive report involving a Sardinian study in 1983.

   The government on Tuesday said it
lacked evidence backing U.S. allegations West German companies
helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, but it proposed tougher
export laws for chemical and nuclear techology.
   Italy, Libya's biggest trading partner, said it still has no
proof the Libyan plant can make chemical weapons. Libya says it will
make pharmaceuticals.
   But an Israeli expert said the plant in Rabta, 60 miles southwest
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is near completion and time is
running out to destroy it before it starts producing poison gas.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in an interview with a
leading West German newspaper, Die Welt, was quoted as saying
Tuesday that he was disturbed by the handling of the U.S.
accusations.
   ``I think it's unbearable if someone puts the Germans in the
defendant's docket without us having the possibility of seeing the
evidence. That is not how friends treat each other,'' Die Welt
quoted Kohl as saying in an interview to appear in the paper's
Wednesday editions.
   Kohl told his Cabinet on Tuesday the government will continue to
pursue any evidence linking West German firms to the Libyan plant,
said chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost.
   Ost said a group of German experts will fly to the United States
on Wednesday to ``exchange information over this issue with American
experts.'' He released no details on the participants or the planned
talks.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann unveiled a new package of
measures aimed at cracking down on anyone who tries to evade the
country's export control laws.
   ``In the sensitive areas of chemical and nuclear technologies we
will be strengthening our control methods with more qualified people
and through the doubling of penalties,'' Haussmann told reporters.
   ``No German should be allowed to participate in activities in
other countries that are an endangerment to peace.''
   The new package, subject to approval by Parliament, calls for
raising the maximum fine for violations of the export law from
$277,000 to $555,000 and the maximum prison sentence from three
years to five.
   In a related development, a high-ranking government official
indicated a West German company had planned to export chemical
equipment ``components'' to Libya but that the deliveries would not
be allowed if deemed illegal.
   ``It has been ensured that there will be no rash deliveries
without examination,'' said Lorenz Schomerus, head of foreign
economic policies at the Economics Ministry. He refused to name the
company or identify the ``components.''
   West Germany says Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and the Hamburg-based
Pen Tao medical material company have been cleared of any wrongdoing.
   The Italian government said Tuesday it has not yet received
conclusive evidence that the Libyan plant can produce chemical
weapons.
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti and Defense Minister Valerio
Zanone said the government is still seeking ``all the elements''
about the nature of the factory in the former Italian colony.
   Andreotti stressed that if the U.S. accusations are true, ``We
will not hesitate to condemn (Libya) and take the necessary
consequent steps in our relations (with Tripoli).''
   An Israeli expert said Tuesday the United States will have to
bomb Libya's Rabta plant soon if it wants to stop leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi from stockpiling chemical weapons.
   President Reagan in December said he was considering bombing the
plant.
   ``They will have to do it as soon as possible because the plant
now is reaching a critical situation. It is on the eve of starting
production,'' Aharon Levran, a former deputy chief of military
intelligence told a government-sponsored briefing.
   Once production started, the Libyans could begin storing the
weapons in despersed locations that would make it harder to knock
out Libya's chemical weaspons stock, said Levran, co-author of The
Middle East Military Balance, an annual study produced by Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center For Strategic Studies.

   President Reagan will deliver his farewell
address, billed as a ``very personal'' review of his presidency, by
television from the Oval Office on Wednesday night.
   The speech is scheduled for 9 p.m. EST and will be carried live
by the television networks. It is expected to last about 20 minutes,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   He said Reagan has spent several hours working on it this week.
   ``We expect it to be a very personal kind of look at what
President Reagan tried to do, and what he sees as his
accomplishments, and the problems ahead,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It will be an opportunity for him to talk directly to the
American people as he has done so often in the last eight years.''
   A few of Reagan's notable previous speeches from the Oval Office
included:
   _ July 27, 1981, in which he used charts and a pointer to make
his point that the administration's tax reduction plan was more fair
than that proposed by the Democrats in Congress. He prevailed, with
Congress passing a plan along the lines he had proposed.
   _ March, 23, 1983, in which he took some of his own key advisers
by surprise by announcing he was ordering a study of the then
little-known concept of building a system to defend against missile
attack. The idea came to be known as Star Wars and became a subject
of domestic dispute and of contention with the Soviet Union.
   _ Jan. 28, 1986, often cited as one of his most memorable, in
which, within a few hours of the explosion that killed the seven
members of the space shuttle Challenger crew, he mourned their loss
but vowed that the U.S. space program would go on.
   _ Nov. 13, 1986, generally regarded as one of his least
persuasive, in which he tried to deflect criticism of his
administration's sales of arms to Iran, denying they represented an
attempt to swap arms for American hostages.
   Reagan, a former movie actor and radio announcer, came to the
White House better equipped with television-related skills than any
of his predecessors.
   In addition to his career as an entertainer, he had made a splash
in 1964 with a speech on behalf of Republican presidential candidate
Barry Goldwater that set him on the way to a new career in politics.
   Wednesday night's speech will follow a tradition of farewell
addresses that has included many previous presidents, from George
Washington to Jimmy Carter.
   Washington's farewell address, attacking ``the spirit of party''
and warning against foreign entanglements, has become a classic
which is still read annually in Congress on the first president's
birthday.
   The most celebrated previous presidential address of the
television era is Dwight Eisenhower's on Jan. 17, 1961, warning
against ``the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought
or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.''
   Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, both former congressional
leaders, chose to make their final speeches in the form of State of
the Union addresses to Congress, as some other presidents have done.
   Carter spoke from the Oval Office on Jan. 14, 1981, six days
before Reagan took office, promising his successor his support ``to
the very limits of conscience and conviction'' and warning of the
need to reduce the ``horrifying danger'' of nuclear arms stockpiles.

   Investigators said Tuesday that one engine of a
crashed Boeing 737 had fire damage, while the other was inexplicably
shut down before the aircraft plunged into a highway embankment,
killing 44 people.
   The pilot of the British Midland Airways jet told ground control
the fire was in the undamaged right engine, which was shut off,
Transport Secretary Paul Channon said. The fire was in the left
engine, but it remained in operation before the crash.
   Aviation experts thought it unlikely the captain could have
confused the two engines, and one pilot said the fire warning system
may have been at fault.
   Asked on Independent Television News whether pilot error might be
involved, Channon said: ``I don't rule that out, but ... it would be
unwise of me to speculate on that until we've got more information.''
   He also said he would not rule out sabotage, but he said it was
not ``very likely.''
   The jet, flying from London to Belfast, Northern Ireland, crashed
beside England's main M1 north-south highway Sunday night after
reporting engine trouble. It undershot the runway while attempting
an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport in central England,
but 82 passengers and crew, including pilot Kevin Hunt, survived
with injuries.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said investigators believe they
know what caused the disaster, but were not yet ready to publish
their conclusions. There was no word on what caused the fire.
   Reporting to Parliament and then speaking on TV, Channon said the
pilot reported an engine on fire, and when asked by ground control
which one, replied ``starboard.''
   But when the engines were examined at the crash site, it turned
out that the starboard engine had been shut down before the crash
and investigators found no evidence in it of a fire or mechanical
flaw.
   The port engine did contain fire damage, said chief investigator
Eddie Trimble.
   He told reporters the starboard engine had been shut down not
shortly before the crash but ``at a previous point in the flight.''
He said it would be premature to speculate about the reason before
the engines were stripped down for laboratory scrutiny.
   Capt. John Guntrip of the Guild of Air Pilots said it was
``highly improbable'' that the pilot confused the two engines
because the pilot and co-pilot ``are trained very carefully to
monitor each other's actions.''
   Asked if the system could go wrong, Guntrip said: ``It is
possible. It has been known in the past. There have very
occasionally been false fire warnings on aircraft.''
   Another guild member, Group Capt. John Tritton, said, ``I find it
unbelievable'' that the pilot identified the wrong engine on fire.
   ``When a fire occurs in an engine, the master caution light comes
on, there is audio warning and there is a light in the handle, the
fire handle for that particular engine, indicating which engine it
is,'' he told BBC-TV.
   Ham radio operator Mervyn Solloway, who picked up cockpit
transmissions shortly before the crash, has said he heard the pilot
report engine trouble, then say it was under control.
   But later, he says, he heard a frantic voice say, ``We've got
problems with the other engine.''
   Aviation experts say the odds on double engine failure on a
two-engined Boeing are astronomical. They theorized blame could lie
with impure fuel, faulty maintenancing, an explosion in the engine's
combustion chamber or a mechanical fault.
   The plane broke into three main sections. Heavy lifting equipment
was moved to the site to remove debris.
   The ``black boxes,'' which record cockpit flight data and
conversations, were taken on Monday night to the government Air
Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough, outside London, for

   Police and soldiers scoured the area for wreckage fragments.
Boeing officials flew here and joined British investigators.
   A 20-foot-high scaffold and tarpaulin were erected to screen the
wreck from highway traffic.
   Investigators will interview the crew members, who survived.
   Pilot Hunt, 43, broke his back and it was uncertain whether he
would walk again, doctors said Tuesday. He has been hailed as a hero
for managing to miss the town of Kegworth and avoid landing on
highway traffic.
   Channon said the three other Boeing 737-400s operated by British
airlines were grounded.
   In the United States, Cincinnati lawyer Jim Helmer is suing the
airplane engine's maker, alleging the engine contains improperly
tested parts. Helmer identified the parts as timer valves, but told
The Associated Press he didn't know if they could have caused the
crash.
   The CFM56 engines were made jointly by U.S.-based General
Electric and SNECMA of France. GE spokesman Dwight Weber said Monday
night that timer valve failure would not have caused an engine to go
out.

<HEAD>DA Issues Arrest Warrant In Cruise Ship Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>

   A district attorney issued an arrest
warrant for an Arab accused of taking part in a cruise ship attack
in July that left nine dead, a spokesman for his office said Tuesday.
   Piraeus District Attorney Giorgos Vlassis issued the arrest
warrant for Mohammed Adnan Zozad, 21, on Monday, said the spokesman.
   But a report drafted by port authority officials and submitted to
the district attorney on Dec. 23 said Zozad, a Lebanese national,
was killed by an explosion aboard the liner, the City of Poros.
   Police said after the attack that they found remains of a leg
they believe belonged to Zozad.
   The spokesman did not explain why the district attorney issued an
arrest warrant for a person believed dead.
   Ninety-eight others were injured in the July 11 gun and grenade
attack as the ship steamed toward a suburban Athens marina after a
one-day cruise through the Saronic Gulf islands.
   A Frenchman who died in the attack and was later implicated in
the assault against the passengers is not mentioned in the arrest
warrant, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The port authority report said Laurent Vigneron, 23, was one of
two men identified by witnesses as firing a weapon on the ship. It
did not include any other evidence linking Vigneron to the attack.
   Greece's merchant marine minister said eight eyewitnesses
testified the Frenchman was one of the attackers.
   The charge triggered a diplomatic row with France, which denied
Vigneron was a terrorist and said he had been on vacation.
   Greek police have identified four Arab terrorists involved in the
attack. They named the ringleader as Hejab Jaballa, a Libyan
passport holder later identified as Mohammed Khadar.
   Khadar, 40, the alleged operations chief for the Abu Nidal
terrorist organization, is said to have died in a car bomb that
apparently detonated prematurely at an Athens suburban marina a few
hours before the cruise ship was to dock.
   Authorities believe the attackers wanted to free an alleged Abu
Nidal terrorist held by Greece and deported to Libya last month.
Abdel Osama Zomar was to have been extradited to Italy for his
alleged involvement in an October 1982 attack against Rome's main
synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy.
   Zomar had been jailed in Greece since his November 1982 arrest at
the Greek-Turkish border driving a car loaded with explosives.

<TEXT>
   A judge convicted state NAACP President
Thomas Reed and 13 black lawmakers Tuesday on misdemeanor
trespassing charges in their bid to remove the Confederate battle
flag flying over Alabama's Capitol.
   Montgomery County District Judge Craig Miller fined each of the
14 defendants $100 plus court costs. The maximum each could have
received was three months in jail and a $500 fine.
   Reed, who led the Feb. 2 protest and later last year was
convicted in an unrelated case of extortion, said he was surprised
by Miller's verdict in the non-jury trial.
   ``I knew we did not violate any state law. In fact I dissuaded
the people who were with me from breaking state laws. I pleaded with
them not to. We followed every command that was given us,'' Reed
said in a telephone interview from his Tuskegee home.
   Reed would not comment on the legal aspects of the case, but an
appeal is expected to be filed in circuit court, where the group
could request a jury trial.
   ``I will talk with my lawyers at the appropriate time about it.
I'm going to take direction from our lawyers,'' he said.
   More than 11 months ago Reed and the others marched to Alabama's
Capitol and tried to climb a chain-link fence surrounding it in a
symbolic effort to remove the flag from the Capitol dome. They never
got into the Capitol grounds, closed off during restoration work,
and were arrested when each put a hand on the fence. The flag
continues to fly on a staff atop the dome, third in line below the
American and state flags.
   Miller agreed with state attorneys who argued that the mere act
act of Reed and the others curling their fingers through the fence
was enough to constitute trespassing.
   Reed said if that was enough to be found guilty of trespassing,
``You'd probably have to go back and arrest thousands of people,
because I have seen many people'' touching the fence.
   Earlier Tuesday, a copy of Gov. Guy Hunt's sworn testimony in the
Confederate flag case was made public. In it, Hunt, a Republican,
said he believes he has the authority to remove the Rebel banner
from the Capitol but feels it is better for the state that it not be
taken down.
   On several previous occasions, Hunt has said he would not take
down the Rebel banner without instructions to do so from the
Legislature.
   Hunt has said the flag is a historic relic that is properly
displayed at the Capitol. Reed has described it as a symbol of
bigotry and oppression against blacks.
   The Capitol protest followed meetings between Hunt and Reed in
which attempts at compromise failed.
   Months after the protest, Reed was convicted in a federal
extortion case and automatically was expelled from his seat in the
Alabama House. Reed, sentenced to four years in prison, has blamed
his federal prosecution on his attempts to remove the Confederate
flag from the Capitol.
   He remains state president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and is free pending appeal.
   The NAACP has sued in federal court to try to get the flag taken
down. Last Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Varner refused to
dismiss the federal court lawsuit. A pre-trial conference is
scheduled for next month.

   The head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency
will be replaced within several days after more than six years in
the post, Israel radio reported Tuesday.
   The director, whose name was not given in keeping with security
regulations, will be replaced by another senior Mossad official or
by a ``senior personality from outside that organization,'' the
radio reported.
   It said that during his years in service the intelligence agency
suffered some failures, among them the discovery of false passports
used by Mossad operatives in West Germany and the expulsion of
Mossad agents from Britain several months ago.
   Before taking effect, the new appointment must be approved by
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the hard-line Likud bloc, and
Finance Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   It was one of the conditions in the agreement between the two
parties to form a coalition government, the radio said.
   The report followed a Supreme Court ruling Tuesday allowing an
Israeli newspaper to publish an article that criticized the outgoing
Mossad chief and stated that he is to be replaced in the near future.
   But the Supreme Court upheld the military censorship order that
the Tel Aviv-based weekly Ha-Ir (The City) cancel all descriptions
of the Mossad chief in person.
   The article, to be published on Friday, was first submitted to
the military censor last August and has since been rewritten four
times, the local news agency Itim said.

<HEAD>`For Dear Life,' A New Play by Susan Miller, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``We're a generation completely confused about
our psyches,'' confesses an aging baby boomer in Susan Miller's
tedious new play, ``For Dear Life.'' Not only about their psyches,
but about cholesterol, calcium, oat bran muffins and human
existence, too.
   These are some of the many topics touched on in Miller's numbing
drama of self-absorption that opened Tuesday at the New York
Shakespeare Festival Public Theater.
   The play examines the marriage of Jake, a disc jockey who loves
and plays the pop standards of the 1930s and '40s, and Catherine, a
film critic who thinks she ought to be doing some ``real work''
instead _ like hauling water. Then she could ``fall into bed at
night with legitimate fatigue.''
   Baby boomers and the yuppie generation _ not exacty the most
popular people in America _ can be treated with some intelligence,
wit and even sympathy on stage. Two recent examples include
``Eastern Standard'' by Richard Greenberg and ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' Wendy Wasserstein's look at one woman's odyssey
through feminism and beyond. Their much more carefully defined
characters may not be likable, but at least they are believable,
interesting and occasionally funny.
   Miller doesn't have much luck with her creations or their
conversation. Her dialogue is arch and more than a tad pretentious.
``I like your marriage. It works for me,'' admits Catherine's best
friend, a would-be filmmaker.
   Unfortunately, the marriage doesn't work for the playwright or
the audience. Miller tells her tale in a strange manner, setting the
play's first act in the present, and the other two at various points
in the future. Nobody appears to age and the sets don't change,
although in Act 2, Sam, the couple's 16-year-old son, appears. It's
an awkward device.
   The son isn't any more interesting that his parents, particularly
in Stephen Mailer's irritating and unconvincing performance. None of
the actors has a particularly successful time at it, and the rest of
the cast includes such usually fine performers as Laila Robins, Tony
Shalhoub, Christine Estabrook and Joseph Lambie. They are stranded
here, and Norman Rene's static direction doesn't help.
   The play has several fleeting moments of pleasure, particularly
when Jake is lost in reverie with those classic pop tunes he plays
on his radio show. When the voice of Fred Astaire or Ethel Waters or
Ella Fitzgerald fills the theater, you keep wishing that Jake would
just spin those wonderful old records and forget about ``For Dear
Life.''

<HEAD>Five Accused of Plot to Steal Corneas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five people are accused of obtaining corneas
from 47 corpses, then selling them for profit as far away as Saudi
Arabia in a case a prosecutor describes as ``bizarre and perhaps
macabre.''
   In opening arguments in a Hillsborough Circuit Court trial
Monday, a prosecutor charged that two former employees of the
Florida Regional Bone and Tissue Bank Inc. sold corneas supplied to
Florida Regional through another eye bank, University Ophthalmic
Services Inc., set up by their wives.
   Robert and Irene Fisher of Hillsborough County and Robert and
Gailya Grant of Largo, in Pinellas County, each are charged with 47
counts of grand theft and one count of conspiracy. Also charged with
conspiracy is Charles Lee Gloss, who worked at Florida Regional, a
private, non-profit business.
   A sixth defendant, Judith Sawyer-Ackerman, pleaded no contest to
48 charges Friday and agreed to testify against the others. She will
be sentenced next month.
   Medical examiners supplying the corneas _ the transparent tissues
that cover and protect the eyeball _ assumed they were going to
Florida Regional, but the corneas were sold by University
Ophthalmic, many to a Saudi Arabian hospital for a $650 processing
fee each, according to prosecutors.
   Assistant State Attorney Judy Hoyer told jurors in her opening
presentation Monday that University Ophthalmic was ``the entity they
created in order to steal.''
   But a defense attorney told jurors that his clients ran a
non-profit business, and are in trouble because Florida Regional did
not like the competition.
   ``From the evidence, you're going to see Florida Regional getting
mad at University Ophthalmic and these people because Florida
Regional thought they were stabbing them in the back,'' said the
Fishers' attorney, Marc Lubet.
   Robert Fisher, 40, Robert Grant, 45, and Gloss, 29, worked for
Florida Regional in March 1986 when Irene Fisher, 38, and Gailya
Grant, 45, founded University Ophthalmic. Robert Fisher was Florida
Regional's director and Robert Grant was the program director in
Pinellas County.
   The Pinellas County Medical Examiner's Office was the University
Ophthalmic's best source for corneas.
   Directors at the medical examiner's office dealt exclusively with
Florida Regional and didn't suspect the corneas were being sold
instead of being turned over to the legitimate organization, the
state said.
   Gloss discovered the operation and confronted Robert Fisher, his
boss at Florida Regional, Hoyer said. Gloss accepted a check for
$200 and didn't tell anyone about the scheme, she said.
   The trial continued Tuesday and was expected to last for several
days.
   Florida Regional and the Florida West Coast Organ Procurement
Foundation Inc. sued the Fishers, Grants and Gloss in March 1987, a
month before the state filed criminal charges. The suit has not been
resolved.

   A Marine sergeant pleaded innocent
Tuesday to military charges stemming from the abandonment of a
19-year-old Marine who died after being left in a California desert.
   Lance Cpl. Jason Rother was posted alone as a nighttime guide on
Aug. 30 for trucks carrying Marines to a major training exercise in
the Mojave Desert at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif. He
was mistakenly left behind at the conclusion of the exercise.
   The Minneapolis native was reported missing 40 hours after he was
last seen, and his skeletal remains were found Dec. 4 _ three months
and three major searches later.
   Sgt. Christopher P. Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and
with disobeying an order not to allow special liberties without
prior approval of the battalion commander.
   He is accused of granting a special liberty to Sgt. Thomas
Turnell, Rother's squad leader, who is scheduled for a Jan. 24
court-martial on charges of dereliction of duty and unauthorized
absence in the case.
   Jury selection began later Tuesday. The presiding judge, Maj.
Kent Smith, estimated the trial will last two to three days.
   Company commander Capt. Michael Henderson and Rother's platoon
leader, 1st Lt. Christopher Johnson, were relieved of their commands
and reprimanded. Those officers are not facing courts-martial.
   Col. J.W. Ripley, the commanding officer of the 2nd Marine
Division, announced Tuesday that Lt. Col. E.J. Robeson, the
commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, and Major T.L. Holm, the
3rd Battalion's executive officer, would be reassigned. The
announcement said the reassignments came after an investigation of
the death of Rother, who was in the 3rd Battalion.

<HEAD>Court Approves US Request To Question Ex Officials in Letelier Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday approved a
U.S. request to question seven former officials of the military
government in connection with the 1976 assassination in Washington
of a former leftist Chilean Cabinet minister.
   The court of six justices gave unanimous approval to the request
and immediately transferred the documents to a Santiago lower court.
Judge Carlos Banados will carry on the questioning in connection
with the slaying of Orlando Letelier. No date was set.
   Letelier and an American aide, Ronnie Moffitt, were killed Sept.
21, 1976 by a bomb that destroyed their car as they rode on Embassy
Row in Washington.
   A Supreme Court secretary, Carlos Davila, was quoted by the
official news agency Orbe as saying the Court approved all questions
the U.S. Justice Department submitted for the interrogations.
   The court rejected a U.S. request that a U.S. representative be
present during the questionings, saying it was against Chilean law.
   The court also ruled that two of the seven former officials will
be allowed to answer the questioning in writing because they were
military officers. The other five, all civilians, will be questioned
in person at the court's building.
   The seven Chileans to be questioned are Gen. Odlanier Mena,
ex-head of the secret police; Miguel Schweitzer, former foreign
minister; Gen. Enrique Montero, former interior minister; three
former ambassadors to Washington _ Jorge Cauas, Jose Miguel Barros
and Manuel Trucco _ and Tomas Amenabar, who was at a time the charge
d'affaires in the embassy. Cauas, after leaving the embassy, was
appointed finance minister.
   Former ambassador Barros is now a prominent dissident and has
been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate in the election
scheduled for Dec. 14 this year.
   Letelier, an avowed foe of Chile's military President Augusto
Pinochet, waa a Cabinet minister and ambassador in Washington during
the leftist government of President Salvador Allende in the early
70s. Allende was overthrown in the bloody 1973 coup that brought
Pinochet to power.
   A former Chilean army major, Armando Fernandez Larios, who
slipped out of Chile and surrendered to U.S. authorities in 1987,
provided American investigators with information that led to the
request for the new questionings, according to papers filed in
November in Washington by a prosecutor in the case, David P.
Geneson. Fernandez admitted to a lateral role in the plot that led
to the Letelier killing.
   Fernandez and two other high-ranking Chilean army officers had
been indicted in the late 1970s in the United States in connection
with the assassination, but the Chilean Supreme Court turned down a
request for their extradition. The two others were Gen. Manuel
Contreras Sepulveda and Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, the two top
officers of the secret police at the time of the slaying.

   The Pentagon is investigating the loss of a
flight data recorder from a long-range atomic missile test in 1987
and there is a possibility the Soviets may have recovered the
device, the Pentagon said Tuesday night.
   The recorder would contain valuable information about the
performance of the Minuteman 2 missile, according to the CBS Evening
News, which first reported the story.
   The recorder was part of a July 7, 1987, test shot, said Army
Maj. Bill O'Connell, a spokesman for the Defense Department.
   The missile, which carried a dummy warhead and not an actual
atomic weapon, was launched from California toward Kwajalein Atoll,
a coral-ringed atoll in the Marshall Islands which the United States
uses to test the accuracy of its strategic atomic weapons. The atoll
is in the western Pacific Ocean, about 5,000 miles from the United
States.
   U.S. officials recovered 400 pounds of debris from the bottom of
the lagoon the next morning and shipped it back to the United States
for analysis, CBS said. But the 45-day long analysis turned up no
sign of the flight data recorder.
   ``Part of the payload form the dummy warhead which splashed down
in the atoll was lost,'' said O'Connell. ``It is unlikely that the
Soviets recovered it in the hours between splashdown and the first
search, but that possibility cannot be ruled out.''
   ``There are many possibilities that might account for the loss,
including accidents during the handling of the recovered debris,
poor record-keeping, and problems in shipping,'' he said. ``None of
these possibilities has been ruled out and the investigation is
continuing.''
   The recorder was not classified, O'Connell noted, but its
recovery ``would be useful to our missile testing efforts and five
searches have accordingly been mounted to find it.''
   The Soviets may have grabbed the recorder with a mini-submarine,
CBS said. A Soviet trawler was about 50 miles away from Kwajalein,
the network reported.
   O'Connell refused to say if a Soviet sub had been detected in the
area. ``There have been a number of reports of Soviet submarine
sightings and these reports are not being ignored,'' he said. ``I
cannot, however, confirm that there was Soviet submarine activity in
or near Kwajalein.''
   But he did confirm a CBS report that Soviet personnel may have
landed on Kwajalein, which is supposed to be uninhabited.
   U.S. officials have found ``vodka bottles, cigarettes, bug spray
and a few technical items of Soviet manufacture that could not have
floated ashore and would have been unlikely to have been left ashore
purposefully,'' he said.
   The test shot came nine months after the Soviets had ended a
fishing agreement with Kiribiati, the island nation next to the
Marshalls, O'Connell noted. If the fishing agreement had still been
in effect, the Soviets would have had support capabilities to try to
take the payload by sub, he said. But in July 1987, the Soviet
fishing fleet only had access to Vanuatu, over 2,000 miles from
Kwajalein.
   O'Connell said in a statement that ``clandestine Soviet landings
in the Marshall Islands are illegal and a clear infringement of the
sovereignty of the Marshall Islands, in addition to being a
challenge to the security of the U.S. testing programs.''

   Soldiers stormed the fortified home of the oil
workers' union chief Tuesday, fought a gun battle and arrested him
and 17 other leaders of the nation's strongest and allegedly most
corrupt union, officials said.
   A federal agent was killed in the gunfight between security
forces and Joaquin Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards in the oil city of
Ciudad Madero in northeastern Mexico, Attorney General Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo said.
   Union members, among Mexico's highest paid workers, walked off
the job at six of the nation's nine oil refineries after the raid.
   ``This is not an attack on a union,'' Alvarez told a news
conference. ``It is the prosecution of crime committed by
individuals.''
   ``We had to move to clean up things,'' a presidential source said
on condition of anonymity. ``They had a plan to destabilize the
country by taking over some of the oil installations. They knew this
was coming.''
   Hernandez Galicia's power stems from the symbiotic relationship
between the unions and the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which
has ruled Mexico for 60 years. It is a relationship in which power
and profit are exchanged for votes and peace in the workplace.
   Challenging the union leader, who commands the loyalty of
hundreds of thousands of workers, is a bold move for President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and a test of his vow to modernize
politics and the economy.
   The government news agency Notimex said soldiers sealed off the
area around Hernandez Galicia's home, fired into the air and blew
down the door with a bazooka shot.
   Alvarez said 16 more people were arrested later on illegal
weapons charges.
   He said police confiscated 200 Uzi submachine guns, 16 other
high-caliber weapons and 250,000 rounds of ammunition at Hernandez
Galicia's house.
   The attorney general said the Treasury Department had
investigated Hernandez Galicia and his associates for months and
that additional charges of murder and tax evasion would be filed.
   The union's nominal leader, Secretary-General and former Sen.
Salvador Barragan Camacho, was also wanted for questioning, Alvarez
reported.
   Salinas met with his defense minister, attorney general, navy
secretary and labor secretary ``to take measures to guarantee the
security of the Pemex installations and the supply of gasoline,''
the source reported.
   An estimated 6,000 oil workers and their supporters quit work in
Mexico City, headquarters of the state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos
Mexicanos, called Pemex. They marched to Zocalo Plaza shouting
``Freedom for Joaquin!''
   They were joined by busloads of workers from the refinery in
Tula, to the north, and more from other cities, workers said. Buses
arrived all afternoon carrying workers to demand freedom for ``La
Quina,'' the diminutive by which Hernandez Galicia is known.
   The 15,000-strong workforce at the Pemex refinery and
petrochemicals plant in the northern border city of Reynosa also
struck, said Gerasuro Salinas, editor of the newspaper El Manana.
Troops guarded installations but Salinas described the situation as
calm.
   Pemex accounts for 40 percent of Mexico's revenue and about half
the federal budget. It has 180,000 employees, most of them union
members.
   All 8,000 workers struck at the Pemex refinery in Salina Cruz in
Oaxaca state on the Pacific coast, said Lorenzo Jaime, editor at the
newspaper El Imparcial de Oaxaca. The refinery processes about
70,000 barrels of crude daily and serves as embarkation point for
crude shipments to the Far East, he said.
   Notimex said partial shutdowns hit refineries in Ciudad Madero,
Salamanca, La Cangrejera and Cadereyta. Troops occupied Pemex
facilities in Villahermosa, capital of oil-rich Tabasco state in the
southeast.
   Pemex said production was not affected in the Bay of Campeche,
Notimex reported. The oil monopoly appealed to the public to avoid
panic buying of gasoline, saying it had adequate inventories to meet
demand.
   Augustin Jimenez, editor of the newspaper Sol de Tampico, said
oil workers blocked all major highways leading into Tampico, but no
violence was reported.
   Soldiers occupied Pemex installations at Tampico and Ciudad
Madero, 220 miles northeast of Mexico City and 250 miles south of
Brownsville, Texas.
   At Pemex headquarters, spokesman Francisco Casanova Alvarez
reported work stoppages at Mexico City's Azcapotzalco refinery and
the refinery at Tula. At least two refineries continued operating,
he said.
   Former union Secretary-General Jose Sosa was among those arrested
with Hernandez Galicia, the attorney general's office said.
   Fidel Velazquez, head of the Mexican Labor Federation, the
country's largest, told a news conference: ``I am worried,
disgusted. ... I can't allow this to happen in Mexico.''
   A federation statement described the arrest as ``arbitrary and
with excessive display of force.''
   ``We reject what has happened because, if is not corrected, it
could open a stage in the life of the country no one wants: the
stage of authoritarianism that could lead, in turn, to anarchy and
reactionary violence,'' it said.
   Velazquez met with Salinas later to pledge his support and
guarantee labor peace, the presidential source said.
   A veteran journalist in Tampico said Hernandez Galicia declared
the union would act if government-owned petrochemical industries
were sold to private owners. Salinas, who took office Dec. 1, has
said he will continue a program of selling or closing unprofitable
and non-strategic state industries.

   Central American immigrants streamed
through southern Texas on Tuesday, as a court order blocked the
federal policy that had kept those applying for asylum from going on
to their U.S. destinations.
   ``This morning when we opened up there were a lot of people in
line,'' said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Harlingen District at the southern tip of
the state.
   ``I'd estimate there were between 600 and 800 people in line when
we opened up shop.''
   She said the crowd was one of the largest the Harlingen INS
office had seen, and was ``reminiscent of the last days of the
amnesty program'' last year when undocumented aliens, primarily
Mexicans, received legal status under a landmark immigration-reform
law.
   The asylum-seeking immigrants Tuesday were taking advantage of a
three-day temporary restraining order issued Monday by U.S. District
Judge Filemon Vela that blocks an INS procedure that kept them from
leaving the area.
   Greyhound Lines tripled its normal Houston-bound passenger loads
Tuesday on the morning and afternoon buses from Brownsville and
Harlingen, a company spokesman said.
   ``Most of the people, about 75 percent, are going to Miami,''
said George Gravley, Greyhound spokesman in Dallas.
   Gravley said similar heavy loads were expected for Wednesday.
   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz said meanwhile that asylum-seekers who
remain in southern Texas will receive federal humanitarian relief _
possibly shelter _ while their cases are decided.
   Ortiz, a Democrat from Corpus Christi, joined a special Justice
Department team Tuesday in taking a first-hand look at the
immigrants' needs.
   ``What makes it a crisis is ... this county doesn't have the
money or the infrastructure to provide the services, '' Ortiz said
Tuesday after meeting with officials from the Justice Department's
Community Relations Service.
   ``The county has been impacted by a federal policy and we ought
to do something about it,'' the congressman said.
   He said the three-person Justice Department team probably would
stay in southern Texas for two or three days observing and meeting
with local and federal officials.
   Ortiz said he expected the federal team to recommend food,
shelter and medical assistance. The group was unavailable for
comment, he said, explaining that the team wanted to avoid publicity.
   The problem of homeless immigrants worsened here after the INS on
Dec. 16 adopted a procedure designed to keep asylum-seekers in the
lower Rio Grande Valley during the 30 days or more it would take to
decide their claims for refugee status.
   Hundreds of Central Americans, no longer able to travel to their
U.S. destinations to seek asylum, began camping in empty lots and
condemned buildings.

   A wealthy writer-producer was beaten
and robbed of $500,000 in jewelry and cash by four masked gunmen who
tied up his butler and the servant's wife and waited hours for him
to arrive, police said Tuesday.
   Frank Alesia, 45, needed 37 stitches to close head wounds
suffered when the gunmen pounded his head on the floor to force him
to say where valuables were located, said Lt. Robert Curtis.
   The gunmen on Monday night stole a 1983 Toyota Tercel when they
made their getaway. The robbers wore ski masks and gloves, Curtis
said.
   Alesia wrote for the ``Laverne and Shirley'' television show, was
a producer and writer for the ``Captain Kangaroo'' show and has been
associated with the production of 16 feature films, said business
manager Ralph Goldman.
   Goldman did not know the titles of the features.
   Alesia, whose wife was out of town at the time, did not struggle
with the gunmen, the business manager said. ``It was just a
gratuitous beating,'' Goldman said.
   The other victims were identified as Wayne Welch, 41, the butler,
and his wife, Judith, 41, Curtis said.
   The butler took the dog for a walk Monday evening and when he
returned was confronted by a masked man who put a gun to his head,
police said. The masked man was joined by three other gunmen, Curtis
said.
   Alesia came home about 10 p.m. and was confronted by a gunman at
the door.
   Alesia eventually told the gunmen where the valuables were,
Curtis said. Most of the estimated $500,000 loss was in jewels.
   The robbers left shortly after 11 p.m. but it apparently took
some time for the victims to free themselves. Police were alerted by
a screaming woman who called on the emergency line at 12:24 a.m.
Tuesday.

   President Reagan's critics say his proposed
cuts in Medicaid and Medicare would curtail health care for the 56
million elderly, disabled and poor Americans and could drive up
state taxes.
   Public policy analysts, members of Congress and state officials
all rejected Reagan's claim that the cuts will simply force states,
hospitals and physicians paid under the programs to be more
efficient.
   The giant federal health-care programs have been the fastest
growing segments of the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the largest federal agency, spending 37 percent of the
government's entire budget.
   Reagan's spending proposal for fiscal 1990 would trim Medicaid
growth chiefly by cutting grants to states by 3 percent and reducing
payments to hospitals and physicians serving Medicare patients.

   The Supreme Court's decision to consider a
request that it reverse its 1973 decision legalizing abortion is
setting off alarms with women's rights groups while lifting the
hopes of their anti-abortion adversaries.
   The justices said Monday they will study a federal appeals court
ruling that struck down key provisions of a Missouri law regulating
abortions.
   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve
the Missouri controversy without disturbing the 1973 decision. But
Missouri officials and Justice Department lawyers are urging the
justices to use the case to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade
ruling.
   ``Women's lives are literally on the line'' if the court reverses
its most famous abortion ruling, said Eleanor Smeal, president of
the Fund for the Feminist Majority.

<HEAD>The Credit Card Debt Riddle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Do credit card users simply not care about income
taxes?
   A curious turn of consumer events is developing, and it might
take the insight of a psychologist, rather than an economist, to
explain it. Rather than falling, as anticipated, credit card debt is
rising sharply.
   The consequences are costly: With borrowing rates rising,
interest on that debt will, of course, be more costly. But perhaps
even more important, taxes on that debt will be much higher this
year than last.
   Nevertheless, borrowers went on a binge in November, adding $4.5
billion more in consumer debt. Revolving credit, which grew more
than 20 percent, accounted for $3.1 billion _ made up increasingly
of credit card activities.
   Last year, 40 percent of interest paid qualified for deductions
on income tax returns. This year, the total is cut to just 20
percent, a preliminary step toward eliminating the deductibility
altogether.
   The rise in consumer indebtedness doesn't necessarily mean that
otherwise conservative individuals have decided to let go. It's more
a reflection of the increase in the number of people working, which
is the primary ingredient of so-called consumer confidence measures.
   But the continued rise is a puzzle to those analysts of the 1986
tax changes who argued that one way to keep spending in bounds was
to remove the tax benefits. Some even contended that the heyday of
credit cards was ended.
   One explanation now is that the phenomeon is a result not just of
growing consumer confidence but of an actual need to use credit.
That is, individuals with insufficient cash for their needs are
reluctantly resorting to borrowing.
   Another possibility is the marketing efforts of the credit card
people, who offer various incentives and prizes based on a
customer's continued use. Habit, convenience and some vendor
insistence on cards tend to solidify usage.
   Changes in tax deductibility were imposed as part of the Tax Act
of 1986. By 1991 that deductibility will be phased out altogether,
after dropping to 10 percent in 1990.
   Included in the phaseout is interest not just on credit card
charges, but financing charges and revolving charge account charges,
cash advances, personal and automobile loans, student loans,
insurance loans and tax deficiencies.
   Still another expense is added to those using many bank cards.
This is the annual fee, which some banks have added and others
increased over the past year or more. Such membership fees generally
are not tax deductible.
   In December of 1986, after the tax bill was passed, the Federal
Reserve reported that consumer installment debt amounted to $594.9
billion. At the end of November 1988, the same debt category totaled
$665.51 billion.
   While much of that increase can be explained in terms of a
growing economy, it also suggests strongly that many people _ by
choice, need, indifference or ignorance _ haven't been scared off by
tax and other credit expenses.

<HEAD>James Brolin and Son Josh Star in Movie About Steroids</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incredible pressure to win, from his
father, from his coach and from himself, forced runner Glen
Shrevelowe to take steroids.
   This timely story, told in the movie ``Finish Line'' on Turner
Network Television, reflects events at the Summer Olympics that are
allegedly occurring in locker rooms around the world.
   ``He was pushed from every side,'' said Josh Brolin, who stars as
the young runner. His father is played by his real-life father,
James Brolin. Their appearance in tonight's movie is their first
together.
   ``He had always been the faster runner, but now that he was going
for the Olympics, he ran into the really fast runners. He needed an
extra boost. Ben Johnson needed that extra boost to beat Carl
Lewis,'' the younger Brolin said, referring to the Canadian and U.S.
sprint stars.
   The movie was in production in Eugene, Ore., when Johnson lost
his Seoul Olympics gold medal in the 100-meter race after traces of
steroids were found in urine tests.
   James Brolin plays Martin Shrevelowe, an architect and former
track star who wants his son to excel in college track and field.
Glen's earliest memories are those of his father's embrace and
praise after an athletic event. He learned early that winning
pleased his father.
   ``He put too much emphasis on winning,'' said the elder Brolin.
``The son became neurotic. In fact, they were both neurotic. It's
passed on from generation to generation. When does it stop?
   ``Josh had his point of view about how it should be done. I had
mine. I think the best movies are when everyone sits down to discuss
it and everyone disagrees on the interpretation. Then each person
can bring a uniqueness to his role. Too often the players merely
become an extention of the director's vision.''
   Glen is a top sprinter in high school, but he finds fierce
competition on the collegiate level and for the Olympic tryouts.
Steroids seem to be the answer. He becomes a winner. But the drugs
kill him.
   ``In a survey they asked 1,000 athletes would they take steroids
if it guaranteed victory but would kill them in five years,'' Josh
said. ``Eighty-five percent said yes. But steroids are so prevalent,
it's not just athletes. Kids on the beach who want to look good take
them. It pumps up the muscles and makes you look macho. It's so sad
because nobody knows what the long-term effects are.''
   The movie, which also stars Mariska Hargitay, was written by
Norman Morrill and directed by John Nicolella. It's from
Guber-Peters-Barris Productions.
   The toughest part for Josh was getting in shape for the running
scenes.
   ``I'm not a runner,'' he said. ``I had to give up smoking and
start running. It's really painful. I don't understand why people do
it. You're supposed to get a high, but I never found it. It's hard
for me to run because I have a long body and short legs.
   ``Running the 400-meter run was the hardest. You have to run a
quarter of a mile. My best time was 59 seconds.''
   ``Although people have suggested other projects, this is our
first time together,'' said James Brolin. ``We were looking for
something meaningful. I feel this is Josh's picture. I felt I was
just there. Then when I saw it I realized how important my role was.
Before we made it I kept saying I didn't know if this is the one.''
   His son added: ``We waited such a long time to work together. We
wanted to do something substantial, not just another episode of
`Hotel.'''
   The reference is to James Brolin's former ABC series, ``Hotel.''
Josh was in the NBC series ``Private Eye'' last year. Their series
were both canceled on the same day.
   The elder Brolin laughed when he remembered the opposite
reactions.
   ``You were shocked,'' he said of his son's series fate. ``I was
overjoyed. I've got my eyes open for another series. I'm not in a
hurry. `Hotel' was never my favorite, but I knew it was going to
last for a long time. I thought we were going to break out of the
Aaron Spelling mold. Then `The Love Boat' shut down and they brought
in that crew. After the first year it got watered down.''
   James Brolin also recently completed a role in the miniseries
``Voice of the Heart,'' based on the book by Barbara Bradford
Taylor. Josh was going to New York to look for work on the stage.

<HEAD>Mayan Medicine Thrives; Scientists Studying It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN CHAMULA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are studying the
traditional Mayan medicine still practiced by thousands of Indians
in Mexico's southern highlands, some of whom speak to the gods from
sacred hilltops.
   There are yerberos, or experts in medicinal herbs; parteras, or
midwives and pediatricians; pulsadores, who diagnose by reading the
pulse, and hueseros, who set bones and act as the rough equivalent
of chiropracters.
   Most exalted are the curanderos, also called shamans or rezadores
de los cerros: those who know how to speak to the gods.
   Among them is Sebastian Gonzalez, who lives in Chamula, a town in
the highlands of Chiapas state near the Guatemala frontier.
   ``My grandfather was a curandero amd I've been a curandero since
I was 8 years old, when I began to dream about people with big
baskets of flowers,'' said Gonzalez, 48.
   Those dreams led a pulsador to declare that the boy was a
curandero. At first Gonzalez worked with candles, a key element of
religious ceremonies that mix ancient pantheism with the Roman
Catholicism brought by Spanish conquerors.
   ``When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I began to ask my
grandfather about plants,'' Gonzalez said.
   Dr. Brent Berlin, a linguistic anthropologist from the University
of California at Berkeley, leads a joint U.S.-Mexican project to
compile an encyclopedia of contemporary Mayan medicine in several
languages, including Tzotzil, which is spoken in Chamula.
   ``If you could look inside a Mayan Indian's head, about 80
percent is going to have something to do with the world of plants,''
he said. ``They are very close to the earth. These people have been
agriculturalists for thousands of years.''
   Herbal medicine is taken seriously in Mexico. People in all walks
of life and every part of the country use the cures.
   Government health agencies enlist the aid of practitioners and
are studying the plants many of them use.
   Gonzalez, president of the state Organization of Indigenous
Doctors, says about 7,000 curanderos practice in Chiapas. He said he
has learned how to use about 300 medicinal plants, each of which has
special rules for preparation and use.
   ``There are plants that can't be picked by men; there are plants
that can't be picked by women,'' he explained. ``There are plants
that must be used dry and others that must be used fresh.''
   He said the compass points are important when a shaman prays on a
sacred hilltop.
   A curandero known as Don Antonio said he made his reputation in
1926, at age 19 or 20, after a villager was hit by a truck and
suffered a nosebleed that would not stop. Don Antonio said he
stopped it after a week with tree bark and prayers.
   A grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation in late 1986
allowed Berlin to start the ambitious project of cataloging
contemporary Mayan medicine and its array of herbs.
   Researchers have collected 1,500 species of medicinal plants and
identified 98 percent of them, Berlin said, and compiled the Mayan
names of almost 200 illnesses.
   He discourages the notion that miracle cures will be found and
said his team is not yet investigating active properties of the
plants.
   ``That's the second stage,'' he said. ``First you have to find
out what people think'' causes the cure.
   Some interesting discoveries have been made, however. Berlin said
solanum lancioflorium, an herb commonly called sosa, was found to
contain an antibiotic.
   Traditional medicine has a valid role, Berlin said, especially
among people like the Indians of Chiapas. He described them as a
``Fourth World population that does not have access to the
resources, the assets of the rest of Mexican society.''
   He pointed out that Mayan medicine does not involve expensive
doctors and the herbs are easily obtainable, either free or
inexpensive.
   ``This knowledge of the medicinal properties of the flora is
widely shared by the community,'' he said. ``What's not shared is
how to talk to the gods.''
   Modern and Mayan medicine have different definitions of diseases
and their causes, as well as different cures.
   ``The greatest dissimilarities are when the diagnosis is not
based on symptoms but on ideology,'' Berlin said.
   A physician might blame an ailment on a virus, he said, while a
shaman would trace it to an offense by the patient against the gods
or the ``evil eye'' of an enemy.

<HEAD>Bush Asks Nation's Churches To Join Him in Inaugural Devotions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush will culminate his
inauguration with prayers for God's guidance of the new
administration, stressing the importance of worship in his life.
   In an open letter mailed to nearly 300,000 American clergy _ all
those of any kind whose addresses could be obtained _ he asked that
they join in similar devotions across the country on that occasion.
   He also suggested nationwide ringing of church bells at the time.
   He said he and his wife, Barbara, ``believe it is most fitting
that the events of my inauguration as president conclude in an
ecumenical service of prayer and thanksgiving.''
   Such a service has been planned on Sunday morning, Jan. 22, at
the Washington Cathedral, the Episcopal center in the nation's
capital and the denomination of Bush and his family.
   Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant leaders are to participate,
including the head of Bush's denomination, Episcopal Presiding
Bishop Edmond L. Browning of New York.
   The service caps the weekend inaugural events following the
formal inauguration ceremonies of Jan. 20.
   ``Worship is basic to my own life,'' Bush said. ``Our family has
endeavored to uphold our faith by participation in the life of our
church.''
   He added that he was particularly pleased the inauguration ``will
end on a note of asking God's guidance on the new beginning which
opens before us.''
   Vice President-elect ``Dan Quale and I very much hope that this
service will be part of similar observances of prayer and
thanksgiving throughout our country. We ask that you join us ... by
using elements of the national service,'' Bush added.
   Copies of the Washington liturgy were sent to them in advance for
their use.
   Roy Pfautch of Washington, chairman of the ``National Day of
Prayer and Thanksgiving'' designated for the occasion, said the
affair was church-arranged to avoid any impression of ties to the
government.
   The service was scheduled at regular Sunday time of worship.
   Washington's Episcopal bishop, John T. Walker, who is host of the
event, issued invitations to particpants, including the Bush family.
A similar day of prayer and thanksgiving was arranged at Reagan's
second-term inauguration in 1985.
   Pfautch, a public affairs consultant and inactive Presbyterian
clergyman, said faith was ``definitely an emphasis in Bush's
election and he wanted it to be the culmination of the inaugural.''
   ``This is very much part of his thinking and of his family, that
faith is the foundation part of life, and he wanted it expressed in
the inauguration,'' Pfautch said.
   ``It's very fitting, and one of the beauties of the country, that
congregations of different kinds can come together in their own
churches, many using the same litanies and Scripture texts,
Catholic, Protestant and Jewish.''
   Bush, in his open letter, mailed to pastors throughout the nation
by the interfaith committee headed by Pfautch, said:
   ``We will be united in praise to God for the blessings which have
endowed our nation and in asking for leadership as we face the
challenges of the future ...
   ``As the bells ring across our land on Jan. 22, may their joyous
sound express our gladness for the blessings the Lord has given and
equally express our renewed commitment to seeking goodwill and peace
among all peoples.''
   In addition to the Episcopal bishops, Walker and Browning,
participants in the Washington service are to include leaders of
various U.S. denominations, with the following taking active roles
in the liturgy:
   _Cardinal James Hickey, Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington.
   _Archbishop Iakovos of New York, head of the Greek Orthodox
Church in North and South America.
   _Rabbi Matthew H. Simon of B'nai Israel Congregation in
Rockville, Md.
   _The Rev. Peter Gomes, minister of Harvard University's Memorial
Church.
   _Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, an Assemblies of God member whose
father is a clergyman of that denomination and educator who has
headed several denominational colleges.
   _The Rev. Stephen E. Smallman, pastor of McClain Presbyterian
Church in Washington, which is attended by the Quale family.

   A tendency to assume that religion is concerned
largely with salvation in the hereafter rather than with present
life was rebutted by a recent study.
   It found that religious bodies lead the field in charitable work
for others, surpassing foundations and corporations.
   Brian O'Connell, president of Independent Sector, a coalition of
660 corporate, foundation and voluntary philantrophic organizations
that sponsored the study, said:
   ``We realize more than we had expected how much the organized
neighborliness of religious organizations means to the kind of
caring society we are.''
   The study found that almost half of the $41.4 billion contributed
in 1986 to religion was used to support services to others. The rest
was spent on internal activities such as worship and religious
education.
   Pollster George Gallup, whose organization gathered the data,
said it showed churches are ``among our most cost-effective
institutions'' in philantropic work, with minimal administrative
overhead.

   Most failures of past plans to evangelize the
world for Christianity have resulted from ``internal problems within
the church and the Christian world,'' says a new book distributed to
a conference about such current efforts.
   The book, ``Seven Hundred Plans to Evangelize the World,'' by
researcher David Barrett and evangelical editor James Reapsome, says
failures of the plans can't be blamed on external circumstances.
   Numerous groups with goals of evangelizing the world by 2000 were
among about 300 participants in the meeting.

   Delegates to an assembly of Lutherans Concerned,
an organization of Lutheran homosexuals, expressed ``deep grief and
sadness'' that the denomination's churches have ``denied us full
participation.''
   They have ``permitted malicious, false and antiquated images of
lesbian and gay persons'' and ``abandoned us in the face of growing
homophopia, violence and oppression,'' the assembly said.
   It appealed for dialogue with church leaders, saying: ``The dream

   The theme for Roman Catholicism's 1989 National
Migration Week, observed across the country Jan. 9-14, was
``Migrants and the Blessed Mother.''
   In designating the theme, Pope John Paul II pointed out that the
Virgin Mary's ``earthly life was marked by a continual pilgrimage
from one place to another'' _ from Nazareth to Bethlehem and then in
flight to Egypt to save the child Jesus and later back to Nazareth.
   ``She shines as a sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrim
people of God,'' the pope said.
   The week was insituted by the U.S. National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in 1980 to emphasize commitment and service to
people on the move, including political refugees, economic migrants,
seasonal farm workers and displaced persons.

in Washington during Ronald Reagan's tenure.</HEAD>

   President Reagan, who came to Washington vowing
to cut the federal government down to size, slowed its growth and
trimmed its sails but fell short of many of his more ambitious goals.
   ``He hasn't done any of it,'' Melvin Laird, former secretary of
defense and White House counselor who served for years as a
Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an
interview.
   ``He hasn't done much to change the size of the bureaucracy,''
said Philip Buchen, White House counsel in the Ford adminstration.
   ``He promised more than he could deliver,'' said Charles W. Dunn,
professor of political science at Clemson University and a former
Republican congressional aide.
   ``He has punched at the marshmallow, and the marshmallow has
absorbed his punches pretty effectively,'' said Dunn. ``He has
changed the shape of the marshmallow a little bit but obviously not
as much as he wanted to.''
   ``I wouldn't call it a revolution; I would call it more of a
retrenchment,'' said Herman Belz, a neo-conservative historian at
the University of Maryland.
   That there has been a change and a retrenchment few deny.
   From 1958 to 1980, according to figures from the Office of
Personnel Management, the federal civilian work force, excluding
postal workers, increased by 420,000, or about 24 percent. Over the
past eight years, it increased by 33,000, or about 1.5 percent,
compared with an average population growth in the United States of
about 1 percent.
   ``So the change has been in the rate of the growth of government,
which essentially has stabilized in this period,'' said William
Norton, director of executive administration for the Office of
Personnel Management.
   ``I think what you can say about Reagan is that the size of the
domestic government is smaller overall than it would have been
otherwise,'' said John E. Chubb, senior fellow in governmental
studies at the liberally oriented Brookings Institute.
   In his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged to abolish two Cabinet
departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of
Education. Both are still in place and Congress, with Reagan's
support, created a new department by upgrading the Veterans
Administration to Cabinet status.
   Government ownership of Conrail, general revenue sharing and
urban development action grants were eliminated during Reagan's
administration. The Civil Aeronautics Board and Community Services
Agency also fell by the wayside, but both these were due to actions
in the Carter administration that took effect after Reagan became
president.
   The neo-conservative scholar Belz said one thing that ``made a
big difference'' was a Reagan executive order requiring agency
regulations to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
This, too, however, was a legacy of the Carter administration, an
outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act that Carter signed a few
weeks before leaving office.
   ``Rather than necessarily cutting down the number of agencies, he
has made what exists work better,'' said Barbara Clay, spokeswoman
for the budget office.
   ``Prior to this administration, there were something like over
400 financial accounting systems in the government and they were all
incompatible,'' she said. ``So what Ronald Reagan has done is to
install a governmentwide financial accounting system in order to
make sure that, for instance, Agriculture's numbers are comparable
to Commerce's numbers.'
   ``Overall,'' Ms. Clay said, ``what has happened is that we have
put in management tools and systems that didn't exist prior to this
administration.''
   In addition to such bookkeeping improvements and steps to share
power with state and local governments, Reagan gets credit for
helping, along with the staggering budget deficit, to make the
government establishment more cost-conscious.
   ``Everyone who has any say about the purse strings is conscious
that they have got to curtail the spending,'' said Buchen. ``It is
remarkable, it seems to me, that he has had so many converts among
the Democrats.''
   ``The results are pretty dismal, but the talk is much better than
it used to be,'' the former Ford White House aide said. ``Congress
was never even talking like that. Now at least they pay lip service
to the idea of cutting back.''
   Brookings' Chubb said: ``Since Reagan has been in office, the
agenda has really changed to what I would call an agenda of limited
government. Now we are really talking about what the government can
get out of, what the government can use the private sector to
accomplish, what the government can accomplish through state and
local government and so forth.''
   By Chubb's calculations, discretionary domestic programs such as
education, health and transportation have ``been, in real terms, cut
in half, and all of the slack has been picked up surprisingly by
state governments and to some extent local governments.''
   Vaughn Davis Bornet, a professor emeritus of history at Southern
Oregon State College who has written extensively on the Johnson
administration, said Reagan ``has essentially diminished the power
of the central government and given a lot of that power back to the
states, exactly what Johnson did in reverse.''
   ``Beyond that,'' said Bornet, who classifies himself as a
moderate Republican, ``if you look at the fine print _ expenditures,
war on poverty, education and so on _ it seems to me he has not
reduced the federal expenditures in this area or the bureaucracy
very much either.''
   Clemson political scientist Dunn, however, said Reagan's
``ideology and the symbols of his ideology have helped him shift the
tone of national debate. And that, in tandem with the budget
deficit, has forced liberal Democrats to be leery of proposing new
programs.''
   Chubb at Brookings said that as long as the budget deficit
endures, the pressures to hold down domestic spending will remain _
and he is not sure it is an accident.
   ``The budget deficit is Reagan's insurance policy,'' he said. ``I
don't know whether he took it out intentionally or inadvertently,
but it's the guarantee that we won't move in another direction or
develop another agenda until that's under control.''
   Although Reagan spoke out against a ``Washington colony'' of
entrenched Potomac veterans, old Washington hand Laird said he
believed the president fit comfortably into that scene himself in
contrast to Carter, who remained an outsider through his four years
in the White House.
   ``I think he has gotten along very well with the people who have
been around in government,'' the former secretary of defense said.
``He always acts as though he wants your help and counsel and
advice.''
   As to why Reagan did not move further to dismantle the federal
government he campaigned so hard against, Laird said, ``I think he
has found there was a place for it.''

<HEAD>Don't Take Randy Newman Too Seriously</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warning: The opinions expressed on Randy Newman's
records should not be taken too seriously.
   So don't be too offended when Newman urges the United States to
``drop the big one'' on its allies, or informs us that God considers
the human race to be little more than a source of amusement.
   He doesn't really mean it.
   But if you're a little sensitive, don't listen too carefully to
his new album, ``Land of Dreams,'' because you probably won't like
the song in which Newman abandons his wife and kids and tells his
despondent son, ``I want you to hurt like I do.''
   Those lyrics probably will get Newman in trouble. A press
conference will be hastily assembled and Newman will have to explain
his ``poorly chosen'' words.
   Don't laugh. It's happened to him before. Back in the 1970s,
Newman had a fluke hit single with ``Short People,'' which contained
the refrain ``short people got no reason to live.'' Listeners were
outraged at the ``bigotry'' of the 6-foot-plus Newman, causing the
song to actually be banned on some radio stations.
   ``It's amazing how sensitive people are about that thing. Billy
Crystal was supposed to be upset. You know what I think? It's pretty
clear,'' said Newman, who went on to let his offended listeners off
the hook. ``It's not really their fault; they're not used to irony
in songs. They're supposed to take the words at face value.''
   Newman, of course, isn't entirely blameless. Not that he really
dislikes short people, or believes that a poor, black child should
``roll with the punches'' as he sings on the new album.
   What gets him in trouble is he expresses the most controversial
opinions without a hint of distance. He doesn't sing about racism;
he sings as a racist.
   But Newman pleads artistic license: ``I'm not saying it. He's
doing it in the song, but I disagree.''
   Just as he disagrees with the obscene phone caller in ``Suzanne''
and the slave trader in ``Sail Away.'' But Newman can't deny a
certain affection for these and other sordid characters.
   ``You can laugh at some of these people,'' he said. ``They're so
insensitive. They lack such self-knowledge. The audience will laugh
becuase it's so hard, so rough. It's sort of a liberating thing.
Hopefully, we are better.''
   As sung in ``Dixie Flyer,'' the lead track of ``Land of Dreams,''
Newman was born in Los Angeles in 1943 and lived for a few years in
New Orleans. He came from a musical family _ movie music that is.
His uncle, Alfred, was a soundtrack conductor.
   Newman's own musical background was more contemporary. Fats
Domino was a favorite, so was Ray Charles. But Newman, a piano
player himself, was not looking to be famous.
   ``I never thought I'd be anything but a writer,'' Newman said.
``I never thought of performing or recording.''
   Newman got his first break in 1962 when his composition, ``They
Tell Me It's Summer,'' appeared as the B-side of a single by the
Fleetwoods.
   After having songs covered by such artists as the O'Jays, Little
Peggy March and Irma Thomas, his career received another boost in
1966 when Judy Collins performed his ``I Think It's Going to Rain
Today'' on her popular ``In My Life'' album.
   By 1968, the demand for Newman to make an album of his own had
become too strong to resist. John Lennon called him to say all the
Beatles had his demos, and Dusty Springfield included two Newman
songs on her classic ``Dusty in Memphis'' LP.
   ``I think A&amp;M and Warners had heard the demos,'' Newman said. ``I
was pulled into it rather than having any great ambition.''
   Warner Bros. won out and Newman's self-titled debut album came
out later that year. No one, not even Bob Dylan, could have prepared
listeners for a song like ``Beehive State,'' in which Newman, as the
representative of Utah at a national convention, pleads for his
fellow delegates to remember a whole country exists between Los
Angeles and New York.
   ``It was for people in the East,'' he said. ``In the West maybe
they don't know Delaware.''
   And in ``Davy the Fat Boy,'' Davy's only friend makes a deathbed
promise to the boy's parents that he will take care of their beloved
son, but proceeds to put poor Davy in a sideshow.
   Newman has made critically acclaimed albums such as ``12 Songs''
and ``Sail Away,'' but has failed to acheive major commercial
success.
   While it's no longer true that ``all combined, my records have
sold as many copies as James Taylor's last album sold in Des
Moines,'' as Newman once joked, his sales hardly come close to
George Michael or Whitney Houston.
   ``I wouldn't mind selling more records if it didn't change my
life enormously,'' Newman said. ``Why not a million instead of
300,000? But it might affect the nature of the audiences. When I
play a place much over 10,000, there's too much inattention.''
   He has never failed to be noticed by his peers, however. Newman's
songs have been used by Ray Charles, Linda Ronstadt, Art Garfunkel
and Etta James. Harry Nilsson recorded an entire album of his
compositions, and Newman's music was even used as the basis of the
off-Broadway show ``The Middle of Nowhere.''
   ``It's tremendously nice when someone good thinks that I'm very
good,'' he said. ``People who do this have always liked me, showbiz
folks. Harry Nilsson doing an album of my songs, it's what always I
wanted.''
   And Newman hopes listeners also appreciate his unique music.
   ``I'm interested in people who are a little off. Let the audience
figure out how I feel about them. Let them enjoy these people who
are worse off than we are.''

<HEAD>James Bond and the Actors of Giving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something there is about an actor who loves
the act of giving, so it was nice to find a bunch of ``Santa
Clauses'' running around the set of the new James Bond movie,
``License Revoked.''
   Timothy Dalton ``has been very giving as an actor,'' said Robert
Davi, forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends
the last part of the movie trying to grind Dalton-Bond into cocaine
dust.
   ``I don't think you can create anything if you don't give,''
returned Dalton, who manages to give Davi's character a hole in the
head.
   ``He's very professional, very focused,'' said Carey Lowell of
Dalton, shortly after saving Bond from a fate worse than coke.
``It's better than working with somebody who doesn't give a damn.''
   Seriously, now.
   ``I would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing
with each other,'' said Dalton. ``I think it is a two-way process.
It is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it
back at you.''
   In other words, these actors say, this is how they work. They
have nothing to give but themselves, and that can be scary. But if
an actor holds back, if nothing is given, nothing can be thrown back.
   ``It's probably true that some actors see it as a competition,
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the
tools with which to work,'' Dalton said. ``I think if you look at
any really good actors, you'll find them all very giving.''
   Lowell, whose face has decorated the covers of Vogue and
Mademoiselle, understands that concept as one of the differences
between modeling and acting.
   ``It's different from modeling because you don't have to give to
the camera. You give to the actors instead,'' she said. And if you
give only to the camera? ``In a film, if you're static it shows
immediately. It's difficult.''
   To hear these people talk, you'd think making moving pictures was
fun, not long hours of work, intense concentration, weird
situations. Just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a
conveyor belt, waiting to be ground (almost) to magnesium dust
(that's what they use as a stand-in for cocaine).
   ``When you're in the thick of it you have to think of what to do
in the scene. You've got to be on form and on key and
concentrated,'' said Dalton.
   The effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set.
   ``If you can't get it right you don't get a moment to do it
again,'' he said. ``You just don't get a moment to do it again.''
   Now let's back up. The film is ``License Revoked,'' and it is due
for release in the summer. James Bond loses his license to kill and
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend, CIA agent Felix
Leiter, who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of ...
   Franz Sanchez (Davi), an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, de facto ruler of Panama who has been
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is
foiled with the help of ...
   Pam Bouvier (Lowell), a former pilot for the CIA who worked with
Leiter and who saves Bond and helps gift-wrap Sanchez at Mexico
City's Churusbusco Studios under the direction of John Glen.
   Dalton, 42, is a classically trained actor who has established
his ability to play all kinds of roles _ everything from
Shakespeare's ``Richard II'' to the male lead opposite Mae West in
``Sextette.''
   That range is the envy of Lowell and Davi, who would like to have
the opportunity to show that they, too, can change their spots.
   ``Unfortunately, I always have to play a beautiful girl. Now I
want to do something less stylish,'' the 27-year-old Lowell said.
   Davi, 35, would like to go up the style scale, not down, and to
that end he's trying to push the envelope on the Bond villain bit.
   ``This guy could be a friend who you think it'd be nice to have a
drink with, but after the last sip he stabs you. It kind of makes
him fun to play,'' said Davi.
   ``I want to make my mark in film,'' he said. ``I want to be an
international star. I want to get the girl without putting a gun to
her head. I'm looking for Mister Good-Guy.''
   Dalton thinks they've both got a chance:
   ``Everyone has to be good, because you want a good movie. It
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative, giving actor.
It's how we work together.''

   If Robert Davi ever gets tired of being a
villain on film, he can always try opera. That's how he got his
start in show biz, and when he talks about a character it can sound
a bit _ well, operatic.
   ``I was a high baritone, loved Verdi,'' said Davi, who plays drug
lord Franz Sanchez in ``License Revoked,'' the latest James Bond
movie due out in the summer. ``I sang for the Lyric Opera of Long
Island.''
   Davi, 35, did that when he was 19. He even studied with Tito
Gobbi, one of the great voices of Italy.
   ``If I was still singing I wouldn't be doing any of this now,''
he said, waving at a Bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that
destroys the villain's laboratory.
   ``I wouldn't be smoking cigars or drinking. And I'd get out of
this air (Mexico City's world-record pollution). I wouldn't even be
talking. I would be totally crazy.
   ``After I'm established as an actor I'd like to spend six months
and work on the voice. Now the voice is getting the black mark.''
   Timothy Dalton, who plays Bond, had proposed that Davi play
Sanchez as an opera buff: ``I suggested to him that he had to find a
moment where he sang a bar or two. Probably at an odd moment right
after or just before he killed somebody, whistle or sing a couple of
bars.''
   ``We thought about it when we first met,'' Davi said. ``Timothy
wanted me to try something, but I decided I better not. I did the
same thing in `Goonies,' sort of played a frustrated opera singer. I
didn't want to do the same thing as I did in the Spielberg film,
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies. I want to be
remembered for something else in this film.''
   But Dalton said he didn't see why Davi should worry about that,
``if it's a good idea.''
   ``All actors have good ideas. But they're not always germane to
the piece,'' said Davi, more diplomatic than Sparafucile, the hired
killer of Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
   But Sanchez, ``seductive, charming, and totally immoral,'' as
Davi conceived him, might be able to hold his own with many another
opera bad guy.
   ``The most difficult was when I walked through that house in
Acapulco that was supposed to be the house I owned. A $30 million
house. I don't have $30 million,'' Davi said.
   ``You know, a lot of actors when they play something like that
you see them in the house but you don't really believe that they own
it. I had to go through that house and feel like I owned it.''
   Then he bursts into a snatch of ``Va, Tosca,'' a solo in which
the evil Scarpia boasts that he's infected Tosca's heart with
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling
around.
   Watch out, Puccini.

<TEXT>
   Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and
clear mountain views, fast-growing Seattle has become a metropolis
with the usual smog and traffic jams. Some people are starting to
protest.
   A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to
limit the height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is
gearing up before a vote this spring.
   The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in
the past decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently
imposed six-month moratorium on downtown growth.
   The 55-story Washington Mutual Tower was completed last year,
bumping the 50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No.
1 is the West Coast's tallest building, the 76-story black-glass
Columbia Seafirst Center built in 1985, before downtown zoning went
into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 stories or more, and all
but three were opened in the 1980s.
   The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and
shoppers, make downtown Seattle a lively place.
   Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants
compete shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place
Market.
   Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the
downtown retail core, with major flagship department stores and a
variety of small businesses, recently settled one 30-year-old
land-use debate with the opening of Westlake Center, a new mall of
expensive shops and a 24-story office tower.
   Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown
Development, or CAP, say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more
pollution as more people commute by car and more box-like apartmnt
buildings replace single-family houses and dilute the flavor of old
city neighborhoods.
   CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the
office district. New office floor space would be limited to 500,000
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet
a year from 1995 through 1999. After that, the ceiling would be
lifted unless re-imposed by the City Council.
   By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office
space is newly completed, under construction or has received city
permits, said Virginia Galle, a City Council member and CAP
supporter.
   At the present rate of growth, in 10 years some 67,000 new office
workers are expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000
more car trips daily into downtown, she said.
   There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A
building's size is worked out according to a formula based on the
size of the site, with extra height allowed in exchange for such
amenities as plazas, retail space and day care centers.
   CAP supporters insist they want growth, but not at a high cost to
the environment and the neighborhoods.
   ``We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense,'' says Patrick
Strosahl, a jeweler and president of Vision Seattle, which supports
CAP. ``We're really much more into shaping growth so that it
produces and accentuates the livability of the city.''
   Some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs
controls that are more lenient than the CAP initiative.
   Mayor Charles Royer presented a plan of his own that would limit
office towers to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code,
but not as much as CAP would.
   Royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow
developers to build higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the
bonuses from street-level amenities to housing, human services and
open space.
   The Downtown Seattle Association, a group of developers and
business executives, contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough.
   John Gilmore, president of the association, says downtown growth
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and
suburbs. A downtown provides a focal point for a rapid-transit
system, something Seattle needs, he said. And Seattle must grow, he
contended. ``We're having childen like every other part of the
country and there's got to be jobs.''
   Folke Nyberg, a professor of urban planning and architecture at
the University of Washington, agreed Seattle's location on the
Pacific Rim means it will grow, but disagreed that concentrated
downtown growth is good.
   Seattle has an ``hour-glass'' figure, squeezed between Puget
Sound and Lake Washington, he said. ``So there are some very limited
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen,
and this was not done.''
   A better way to grow, Nyberg said, would be in decentralized
clusters throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would
live near their jobs and go to downtown Seattle mainly for
conventions and cultural events.
   Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality,
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of
afforable housing, he said.
   Seattle, which ``has been a very livable city,'' he said, failed
to learn from other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied, ``It's
all greed.''
   The growth-control initiative goes before voters in the spring,
but a date has not been set.
   Gilmore, of the Downtown Seattle Association, said that the
city's 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and City
Council votes. The American Institute of Architects' local chapter
agrees.
   CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely.
   According to Strosahl, San Francisco needed to enact stiffer
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long, until the cost
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed.
   San Francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between
1979 and 1984. The high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in San
Francisco's financial district.
   San Francisco's voter-approved plan limits new office space to
475,000 square feet for several years for a city with a population
of 690,000. That compares with CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city
of 490,000.
   Gilmore suggests people who signed CAP did not really want to
limit growth, but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state
convention center. The initiative text was long and complicated, and
people probably did not read it, he said.
   What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it
needed.
   Strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a
highly financed campaign against it.

<HEAD>Talk Show Host Arsenio Hall Looking for Cross Section of Guests</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's called ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' but its
star suggests it should be called ``The Rainbow Coalition Talk
Show.''
   The syndicated late-night talk show was recently launched into
competition on more than 135 stations against NBC's Johnny Carson
and David Letterman and fellow newcomer Pat Sajak on CBS.
   Not since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when all three networks
fielded talk shows, has there been such yakking at the witching
hour. In addition, about a dozen other syndicated or cable talk
shows, with stars from Kenny Rogers to Joan Rivers, are in
production or waiting in the wings.
   ``Everybody's talking about the new talk shows,'' said
comedian-actor Hall, 29. ``I think Pat Sajak should call his show
`A.M. Sajak.' I think the people he attracts will be asleep by 11:30
at night. Letterman's basically a comedy show. I don't care who the
guests are. I tune in to watch David. And Johnny's a legend. He'll
be around as long as he wants.
   ``I think the problem with most talk shows is that they're
`Caucasian Boys Clubs.' My show is going to be more reflective of
America. America's a melting pot and that makes for an interesting
mixture. I don't see that on the other shows. You can tune in every
night for a month and not see a black person.
   ``People will say I'm the black talk show host,'' he said. ``I
say ignore my color. If I'm good, watch it. If I'm not good, don't
watch it. Talk is what I do best and most. I think God put me here
to be a talk-show host.''
   A few days before ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' premiered on Jan. 3,
Hall was feeling the tension. His office at Paramount Studios had
the look of a showroom for Toys R Us.
   ``I'm trying to control the stress level,'' Hall said. ``I can't
move to an island, so I'm discovering adult toys.'' At the moment he
was manipulating the radio control for a racing car that was
speeding around the outer office. In one corner was a basketball
hoop. There was also a table tennis set.
   His private office had enough doodads to please a bored child on
a rainy day. Hall settled behind the big U-shaped black desk. He was
wearing a Cleveland Indians warmup jacket and hat perched backward
on his head.
   Hall is not new to the talk show format. A year and a half ago he
took over ``The Late Show'' on Fox Broadcasting Co. not long after
the departure of Joan Rivers. The ratings began to improve, but Hall
left to co-star with Eddie Murphy in the film ``Coming To America.''
   It was while he was a guest on ``The Tonight Show'' promoting the
movie that Hall made up his mind to accept Paramount's offer for a
new talk show. ``I made the decision during a commercial break,'' he
said. ``I'd told Paramount no at first. I didn't want to play
against Johnny Carson, the idol who had made me want to do what I
do. But I can't sit on the sidelines and be a fan all my life. I
can't live my life through Johnny Carson. If I fail, I fail. I'd
feel even worse if I'd never tried.''
   Although the talk shows are on the air at the same time in many
cities, Hall said he doesn't think they are competing for the same
audience.
   ``I don't think competition is a problem,'' he said. ``My show's
a different kind of show. My demographics are different. My job is
not to cure racism. My job is to present entertainment. It's not an
issue of blacks and whites. Sometimes it's between the young and the
old. I may not get Dolly Parton, but maybe I'll get the next Dolly
Parton.
   ``But this is not a minority talk show. I'm not doing `Soul
Train' at late night. I just want to be first with some new talent.
Something `new wave' with a cutting edge. It's a talk show for
people who don't have a talk show now. Johnny has his loyal fans,
but those fans have kids and maybe they'll watch me.''
   Hall tapes his show late every afternoon at Paramount Studios and
it's sent out by satellite. Paramount distributes ``Entertainment
Tonight'' in a similar manner.
   Hall started performing early in his hometown of Cleveland, and
at the age of 12 told his mother he wanted to do what Johnny Carson
does. His parents, however, insisted he go to college. ``I thought
it was a waste of time,'' he said, ``but now I see it's really
helped me.''
   He worried that he had missed his shot by going to college. ``I
saw Letterman get his show,'' he said. ``I saw Garry Shandling get
his break. Then Jay Leno took me under his wing. He was a great
inspiration for me.''

<HEAD>Budget Time at USDA Includes Lots of Fine Print</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm price supports, rural development
programs, food stamps and school lunches are big-ticket budget
categories where President Reagan hopes to save money in the
Agriculture Department.
   But some of the fine print bears a closer look. Screwworm
control, for example, and the ever-present fire ant. And don't
forget USDA's battalion of economists and a pressing need to upgrade
their fearless predictions.
   Some of what was in Reagan's final budget sent to Congress last
week will probably be reworked by the incoming Bush administration,
but a lot will be rubber-stamped as is _ before Congress has its say.
   So far, congressional farm leadership has reacted grumpily to
Reagan's USDA budget plans. Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, D-Texas, said the Reagan spending
blueprint probably had been dead for some time before it even got to
Capitol Hill.
   Overall, the Reagan budget calls for USDA spending in the 1990
fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1 to be about $42.4 billion,
down 19 percent from $52.1 billion this year.
   Most of the $9.7 billion in cuts would come from commodity price
support operations and various other programs lumped under small
community and rural development. A number of other categories would
be cut, too, but some would get increases.
   Among the department's marketing and inspection programs, for
example, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service would be
able to boost its services to a ``program level'' of $353 million
from an estimated $333.8 million this year. The agency's cash
outlays, however, would decline to $296 million from $341 million
this year.
   Program level represents the total financial value of benefits
provided to the public, while ``outlays'' are actual spending _ the
amounts the Treasury pays to carry out various programs.
   As used by USDA, program levels include the value of professional
services such as research or technical assistance activities, or
in-kind benefits such as government-owned commodities.
   The agency, APHIS, would hold brucellosis eradication at $55.8
million in the 1990 budget, unchanged from this year. Under this
program, the agency works with state, industry organizations and
individual livestock herd owners to control and eliminate the
disease.
   Screwworm control, another APHIS function, also would remain at
the current level of $32 million. The control effort is aimed at
curbing the screwworm fly, which produces the larvae, or maggot,
that injures and sometimes kills cattle, sheep and other
warm-blooded animals if not treated.
   The 1990 funds would enable APHIS to continue its operations in
Mexico and Guatemala to prevent the northward movement of the flies.
   Other APHIS activities include programs to control cotton boll
weevils, medflies, grasshoppers and fire ants and certain predators,
mainly coyotes, that prey on livestock.
   An agency that looks out for the welfare of the consuming public
is the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which was proposed to
operate at a 1990 program level of $424 million, up from an
estimated $406 million this year, the same as its outlays.
   Inspection at livestock and poultry slaughter plants is expected
to account for $242.2 million in 1990, up from $231.6 million this
year. Inspection at processing plants would rise to $98.8 million
from the current operating level of $96.8 million.
   In the Agricultural Marketing Service, regulatory operations
would be programmed at $171.1 million, only slightly above this
year's $170.8 million. Outlays are expected to rise to $127 million
from $113 million this year.
   User fees would support 81 percent of the agency's 1990 budget,
according to the Reagan plan, including $12.5 million in new user
fees to cover postage, printing and handling of tobacco market news
reports and several other operations.
   Other marketing and inspection agencies include the Federal Grain
Inspection Service, the Office of Transportation, Packers and
Stockyards Administration and the Agricultural Cooperative Service.
   Another USDA group involves economics and statistics, which
provide so much of the grist that goes into the making of farm
policy, in Congress as well as within the administration.
   The outlays for this group would increase to $123 million from
this year's spending of $114 million, approximately the combined
program levels for two agencies, the Economic Research Service and
the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Department budget officials said the ERS is seeking an additional
$2.4 million to collect and analyze data on pesticide and chemical
use in agriculture. The NASS wants an increase of $7.4 million to
improve crop yield estimates and to upgrade information processing
systems in state offices of the agency.
   Another category in the budget is ``departmental activities,''
sort of a catch-all item with 1990 spending pegged at $117 million,
down from this year's $120 million. Included are operations of the
office of the secretary of agriculture, the USDA's inspector general
and general counsel, and various administrative offices.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Faron Young Pretends He's 75</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NS1 of Jan. 9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans think country music singer Faron
Young, who has had top billing over Elvis Presley and sold more than
30 million records, is more than 70 years old because he's been a
show business fixture for almost four decades.
   He's really just 56.
   ``I've been around so long that when I tell people I'm 56 years
old, they laugh and say, `And how many more?' The best thing is to
say you're 75 and then they say, `You look good for your age.'''
   Young has been singing about sin and sentimentality in a belting
baritone since 1951. He's released 60 albums and had classic country
music hits such as ``Hello Walls,'' ``It's Four in the Morning'' and
``Sweet Dreams.''
   His recording career tailed off in the mid-1980s. But he's back
again with the album ``Here's to You.'' He's also on the road
performing about 150 days a year and he appears regularly on The
Nashville Network on cable TV.
   Young, a swashbuckling whippersnapper in the mid-'50s, feels no
jealousy toward younger country stars such as Randy Travis and
George Strait who reign over the music charts like he did 30 years
ago.
   ``When those kids hit (it big) today, they ain't hurting me a
bit,'' Young said in an interview. ``They are widening the spectrum
of country music. The U.S. Mint runs 24 hours a day printing money.
There's plenty of it for all of us.''
   In his long career, Young has been brash and irreverent with a
turbulent private life rivaling that of rock 'n' roll pioneer Jerry
Lee Lewis. He's been arrested on charges including driving while
intoxicated, indecent exposure, assault and reckless driving.
   His more madcap song titles that fed his image as a wind-him-up,
irrepressible party-lover include ``Live Fast, Love Hard, Die
Young'' and ``I've Got Five Dollars (and It's Saturday Night).''
   He once said the secret of his success was ``drinking expensive
whiskey.''
   ``I don't drink like I used to, just two-three drinks a day,'' he
said recently. ``Now if I just behave myself ...''
   Just as Presley was coming on the national scene in the mid-'50s,
Young was the star of a music tour that included Presley as one of
the lesser known talents.
   ``He wasn't making but $100 a day, so when I checked into the
motel I'd give him the high sign and he'd come stay in my room with
me,'' Young recalled. ``He really couldn't afford it.''
   Years later, Presley called him and offered to take him on tour
at double Young's normal booking fee.
   ``I asked why and he said, `Because you helped ME one time.' So
then I opened HIS shows.''
   Young, a native of Shreveport, La., was the first singer to have
a hit with ``Sweet Dreams,'' a song closely associated with the late
country queen Patsy Cline who recorded the song, as did Emmylou
Harris.
   ``People say to me, `Boy, you really sing that Patsy Cline song
good,''' Young said. ``It was a well-written, tear-jerking country
song, and the melody was outstanding.''
   Similarly, Strait's recent record ``If You Ain't Lovin', You
Ain't Livin'' was a hit by Young 30 years ago.
   Besides being a country music trailblazer, Young has helped some
of the biggest stars in music get started. He loaned Willie Nelson
$1,500 when Nelson was a struggling, little-known songwriter. He
loaned Roger Miller the money to buy drums. He made Charley Pride a
part of his concert entourage when blacks were not welcome in
country music. He hired a young carpenter named Kris Kristofferson
to panel his office walls.
   Young thought about leaving the road in 1985, but a divorce
settlement required him to pay his wife of 30 years $3,400 a month
in alimony.
   Young, known as ``the singing sheriff'' because of a role in the
Western movie ``Hidden Gun,'' has no regrets.
   ``I came off a dairy farm and came into this industry and this
industry has been good to me. I'll never forget where I came from
and the people who helped me make it,'' he said.
   ``I couldn't have done anymore than I've done, really. I've made
motion pictures, had hit records, done TV. If I did it over, I
wouldn't change a thing. I've been good to everybody. I've got a big
mouth and I say what I think. But I'm the first guy to apologize.''
   How would he like to be remembered?
   ``I did the best I could.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Boost''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1960s and '70s, Jack Lemmon was an ace at portraying the
American male struggling maniacally under the pressures of modern
society. James Woods seems to have inherited Lemmon's mantle. While
he lacks Lemmon's leavening humor, Woods packs greater intensity
into his characterizations of tormented souls of the '80s.
   In ``The Boost,'' he tries to cope with life in the fast lane and
fails. What defeats him are booze, cocaine, uppers and downers, as
well as his own foolhardiness and misguided pride.
   Woods is a small-time hustler barely earning a living in the New
York financial world. His wife, sensitively played by Sean Young,
works as a paralegal to help support their modest lifestyle, and she
pumps his sometimes flagging spirit with jolts of confidence.
   Applying for a corporate job, he nearly blows the chance with his
radical ideas. But executive Steven Hill is impressed, and he brings
the young man to Los Angeles to sell tax shelters. Woods is a whiz,
and soon he acquires the trappings and habits of the fast set in Los
Angeles _ meaning homes with views and pools, fast cars and cocaine.
   When the government clamps down on tax shelters, Woods' bubble
bursts. To pay his debts and cocaine bills, he steals $20,000 from
his boss. The rest is all downhill, husband and wife together. They
try to go straight, hiding out in Santa Cruz. But Woods returns to
his old habits, and the downward slide continues.
   Daryl Ponicsan's well-crafted script certainly underscores the
folly of drug addiction, and Harold Becker's direction spares none
of the sordid details. It is a grim tale but not totally convincing.
Questions: Is cocaine still the casual Hollywood party recreation,
as depicted in ``The Boost''? If Young loved her husband so much,
why didn't she fight harder to save him? Why did it take so long for
Woods to achieve success in business?
   Woods fascinates throughout; you watch him like an undetonated
bomb. Sean Young, Gene Hackman's mistress-victim in ``No Way Out,''
is impressive once more, in a role with less definition. Steven Hill
manages to add substance to every film in which he appears.
   ``The Boost'' is a Hemdale release produced by Daniel H. Blatt
with Mel Howard as coproducer. The rating is R for repeated drug use
and language. Running time: 95 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``The Blob,'' ``Midnight Crossing,''
``And God Created Woman.''
   
   ``The Blob'' (RCA@Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, 89.95. Rated R)
   
   It's back! Yes! The Blob is back! That pulsating pool of pulsing
protoplasm.
   Talk about sentimental journeys! Now's your chance to scream out
warnings to the poor folks on your videocassette player:
   ``Watch out, Mister! Don't touch that thing with a stick!''
(Shhhhhlurp!)
   ``Watch out, lady! Don't get in that telephone booth!''
(Sssssssuhhhhk!)
   YOW!!!
   ``Watch out, kids! Don't neck in lovers' lane!'' (Ssshhhlurg!)
   YOW!!!
   This affectionate remake pays homage to the Original, an obscene
black, viscid ooze that gobbled up everything and everybody. Cripes,
it came off the movie screen in the town movie house. Talk about
your last picture shows!
   Formless, fatal and yucky, ``The Blob'' was a perfect symbol for
the era's angst, before we stopped worrying and learned to love the
Bomb. And, of course, a Misunderstood Teen-ager (young Steve
McQueen) saved the day.
   This time, the viscous visitor from space is an errant biological
warfare experiment by wicked scientists. It's a Miami Vice pink, for
some reason. And it falls on you from above and snags you with
tentacles _ a metaphor for the 1980s.
   Kevin Dillon gives a nicely controlled performance as the
Misunderstood Teen. The utterly perky Shawnee Smith is the
homecoming queen. The vastly talented Jeffrey DeMunn and Candy Clark
play the compassionate sheriff and the big-hearted waitress, both
horribly wasted (heh, heh) in their roles.
   ``The Blob'' should be a gory delight to the blood-thirsty
pre-teens that are its obvious target. But it's great fun for the
over-30 crowd who ought to know better. Trash it may be, but it's
really well-done trash.
   Welcome back, big feller.

   ``Midnight Crossing'' (MCA Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated R)
   
   Flashback: Castro is coming out of the Cuban highlands and
Batista's casino operators are moving their cash out of the country.
Somehow a bunch of U.S. Navy men get hold of $2 million of it and
stash it on this island.
   Cut to the present: Daniel J. Travanti was one of the sailors.
The other one who knew where the treasure is has died, so Travanti
wants to go back and get it. (Why did they wait 20 years? Good
question.)
   His wife, an eye doctor played by Faye Dunaway, is blind. (``I
specialized in eye diseases. So how did I get glaucoma?'' Good
question.)
   He charters the yacht of his suspiciously deceased shipmate's son
(John Laughlin), whose perky, pouty wife (Kim Cattrall) works in
Capt. Frank Furillo's insurance agency. (Why? Good question.)
   By this point you've sunk 45 minutes in this loser and nothing's
happening.
   Wait a second! ... Hey, isn't this the perfect bunch to erupt in
jealousy, lust, murderous intrigue and pistols and spearguns and all
kinds of neat-o bloodiness played out beneath a cruel, cruel
Caribbean sun? Good question.
   Travanti sleepwalks through his role. Dunaway is at her most
brittle, shrewish and shrill. The juve leads are bland as custard.
Phony tension, childish intrigue, unbelievably stupid plot tricks.
Worse, the venerable Ned Beatty is written into the plot _ and just
as quickly written out.
   How did all these clever, handsome people make this bad movie?
Good question.

   ``And God Created Woman'' (Vestron Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated
R)
   
   ``And God Created Woman'' was a naughty 1957 New Wave movie by
Roger Vadim, who 20 years later has remade it. It was a long lunch.
   It's too bad, because the original had some heat to it. Sex
kitten Brigitte Bardot undressed en route to superstardom. These
days she's a recluse who campaigns for kindness to animals. There is
a lesson in this for us all.
   The new version stars the lithe and perky Rebecca De Mornay as a
jailhouse queen, a bloated Frank Langella as political aspirant and
Vincent Spano as a bewildered plot device who marries her to get her
out of prison.
   ``Sure,'' you say as the credits roll and dumb things start
happening, ``this guy slams the movie, but I bet it's going to get
plenty steamy with Miss De Mornay taking her clothes off and stuff
every other minute.''
   No such luck, pilgrim. Get over it. Vadim without an idea in his
head has tackled a vaguely feminist message and been trampled to
death by it. No wonder Jane Fonda divorced him. There is no
intelligence at work here whatsoever.
   Miss De Mornay gets 3.2 nude scenes on which to base her
character _ sort of a fallen woman with a heart of gold. Langella
tries to get elected. Vincent Spano wakes up and wishes it was all a
dream.
   What a waste of time. Bring back Bardot.

   Symphony No. 6; overtures ``Egmont'' and ``Coriolanus,'' by
Ludwig van Beethoven (L'Oiseau-Lyre) _ The Academy of Ancient Music,
conducted by Christopher Hogwood
   
   Christopher Hogwood's original instrumentalists provide a
thoroughly fresh look at a programmatic favorite, Beethoven's
Pastoral Symphony. This is not a performance out of the academy but
a bright, brisk and pungent reading.
   The musicians play original instruments or accurate
reproductions, as the linear notes nicely point out in a welcome
list of personnel. The familiar lyrical themes of hill and dale and
storm and stream are heard anew. The strings have a vivid bite and
the winds provide a beautiful variety of tones. Loud chords are
punched out, violin trills shimmer.
   Hogwood conducts with a beautiful attention to detail and takes
generally brisk tempos. One wished for a greater sense of sweep,
however, and less abrupt transitions between passages.
   If you're looking for sheer sonic beauty, this orchestra does not
have the rich sound of a Berlin Philharmonic Pastoral Symphony. The
violins in the first movement on occasion blared in loud passages,
and the valveless horns in the third movement sounded blatty in loud
chords. But if nothing else, this recording is plain interesting.
   It could also help make a case for how original instruments
clarify musical figures. The storm rumblings of the celli and basses
in the fourth movement sounded more ominous because the bowing was
more incisive and therefore easier to hear. Sixteenth note trills in
the last movement were extremely accurate. The instruments had less
decay, reducing overlap between chords.
   Hogwood rounds out this fine compact disk with rhythmically
propelled renditions of the ``Coriolanus'' and ``Egmont'' overtures.

   ``American Dream'' (Atlantic) _ Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young
   
   Rock reunions are usually depressing reminders of the ravaging
effects of age. David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil
Young are the latest to prove that most memories should stay
memories.
   ``American Dream,'' their first album together in 18 years, is a
disaster of fairly epic proportions. It's boring enough to make one
forget the joyful sounds produced when these four voices meshed two
decades ago.
   The harmonies appear sporadically throughout ``American Dream,''
but they dress up a startling lack of worthwhile material.
   The inner jacket photo shows Young sitting down in the studio,
looking cranky as his three colleagues share a microphone. Even on a
bad day he's the most interesting of these four songwriters, but the
picture betrays a strange detachment from this project.
   Young's material highlights his lighter, more reflective side,
except for the title cut, which explores the world of television
evangelists. That's easily the most overdone song topic of 1988.
   But at least he's in this decade. Topics tackled by some of the
others include the Vietnam War and the environment, as well as the
old standby of ``loving the one you're with.''
   Nash is insufferable. When he isn't being preachy, he's
subjecting us to tedious, overwrought ballads. Stills is to be
commended for the pretty ``That Girl,'' the only worthwhile cut
among this record's 14.
   Crosby's long-awaited ``Compass,'' about the drug addiction that
landed him in jail, is simply excruciating. Check out this line: ``I
have seized death's door handle, like a fish out of the water
waiting for the mercy of the cat.'' Huh?
   Maybe with advancing age and declining careers these guys needed
the money. Don't give them yours.

<TEXT>
   The play ``Torch Song Trilogy'' began its
award-winning history 10 years ago and only now is reaching movie
screens? Why did it take so long?
   The best explanation comes from Harvey Fierstein, who won two
Tony awards in 1982 for writing and starring in the play: ``I wanted
to wait until it could be done right. It took finding the right
producer, which I did about five years ago. Since Howard Gottfried
had done Paddy Chayefsky films like `Hospital' and `Network,' I felt
that if Chayefksy could work with him, so could I.
   ``Then my brother (Ronald, who is executive producer of the film)
and I went around to the studios looking for financial support that
would give us artistic control. Then we found New Line Cinema, which
agreed to give us that control.''
   Three more years passed before Fierstein found the director he
wanted, ``a director that had the humor as well as the drama and the
sensitivity for the story. A lot of directors were very frightened
of male-to-male intimacy, and they felt you either had a drama or a
comedy and you don't have big laughs in the middle of a scene where
the audience is also crying.''
   During his quest he discovered that the major studios did not
have much interest, even though ``Torch Song Trilogy'' has been an
international stage success.
   ``They liked the play, but they were afraid of the length; it ran
four hours in the theater,'' Fierstein said. ``They were scared that
it might become an `art film.' That's not what I wanted to make. I
wanted to make a `movie movie.'''
   With its unabashed treatment of gay lives, ``Torch Song Trilogy''
created a sensation from its birth at New York's La Mama Etc. in
1978. Fierstein took the leading role of Arnold Beckoff, a
homosexual seeking respect from the heterosexual world, including
his mother.
   Spurned by his bisexual lover (Brian Kerwin), Arnold enters into
a relationship with a young model (Matthew Broderick). They marry
and decide to adopt a troubled gay teen-ager (Eddie Castrodad), a
role Broderick originated on Broadway. All hell breaks loose when
Arnold's mother (Anne Bancroft) arrives from Florida.
   The play dealt with Arnold's promiscuity. But how could that be
treated in the era of AIDS?
   ``Obviously AIDS is something I thought about, especially since
my co-star for three years had AIDS and we lost five cast members of
`Torch Song' through AIDS.
   ``I didn't want to pay short shrift to AIDS, just shove it off.
But `Torch Song' has nothing to do with AIDS. I also wanted to make
sure that some of the issues in the movie didn't get clouded. ... I
wanted the mother to deal with her real feelings about her son and
the issue of his homosexuality without a virus clouding it.''
   Fierstein was only 24 when he started his career with ``Torch
Song Trilogy.'' Some aspects of the play are autobiographical: He
was performing drag at 16, when he weighed almost 250 pounds (he is
now 170). At his parents' insistence, he went to Brooklyn's Pratt
Institute, but he quickly returned to the theater after graduating.
   ``Torch Song'' emerged from one-act plays that eventually reached
five hours. The play almost folded off-Broadway until a New York
Times review saved it. Fierstein followed his two Tonys with another
for the book of ``La Cage aux folles.'' He also wrote ``Safe Sex,''
vignettes about AIDS, as well as the book for Peter Allen's new
musical ``Legs Diamond.''
   How closely does Arnold Beckoff follow the life of Harvey
Fierstein?
   ``There's no such thing as fiction,'' he said. ``There is some me
in Arnold and Arnold in me. There is a little bit of me in all the
characters. ... It all gets mixed up; you steal from all your
friends. You go into your friends' lives and you pull out what you
can use.''
   But Fierstein does not parallel Beckoff in one respect:
opposition of his family.
   ``My family has always known about me,'' he said. ``I came out at
13. I must be close to my brother; he's executive producer on this
film. My mother and I are very close. We don't have the problem that
Arnold has with his mother.
   ``We discuss everything. In fact she just called from Florida,
and what did she want? She wanted to know what to get my boyfriend
for Christmas.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Chinese Art Exhibit Is Big Success</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SE1 of Jan. 9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Son of Heaven'' exhibition of Chinese art
was a major cultural success for Seattle and will now be seen by art
lovers in Columbus, Ohio _ the only other stop for the historic
display in the United States.
   The exhibition, one of the largest displays of Chinese art and
artifacts to be seen in this country, includes more than 225 items
associated with the kings and emperors of China.
   The displays include 2,500-year-old ceremonial cooking vessels
and temple bells, full-size terra-cotta warriors and horses from the
tomb of China's first emperor, delicate scroll paintings from the
15th century and an exquisitely carved and lacquered 18th century
throne and accessories.
   The show, a collaboration of the Chinese government and a U.S.
organizing committee, opened in Seattle on July 28 and closed Jan.
8. It begins a six-month run in Columbus on March 1.
   About 500,000 people attended the exhibit at the Seattle Center,
and exhibition president Larry Childs estimated the show made more
than $400,000 above its $5 million in expenses.
   Before the show opened, organizers had forecast attendance at 1
million. Childs and others say that was far too optimistic.
   ``Even though we had that ghastly 1 million number, we really
feel good about what we've been able to accomplish,'' said Claudia
Johnson, the show's marketing director.
   The exhibition frequently has been compared to the ``Treasures of
Tutankhamun,'' which drew 1.3 million to the same exhibit hall here
10 years ago. But Johnson notes ``Tut'' had been to four other
American cities as part of a four-year U.S. tour before coming to
Seattle, with a tremendous buildup of publicity.
   The Seattle run hasn't been entirely smooth. Childs and other
show officials acknowledged some disorganization before the
exhibition's start, including not having a marketing budget set
until two weeks before the opening. In August, there was a messy
firing and replacement of the show's executive director, Harvey
West. At the time, West said he had disagreed with Childs over some
aspects of the show's operation, and Childs said West had trouble
delegating authority.
   Later, there was a flap over waiving admission charges during the
Seattle Center's free Labor Day weekend arts festival, Bumbershoot.
``Son of Heaven'' officials eventually agreed to the free admission.
   There also were numerous small changes in lighting and other
presentations of the exhibits and in hours of the show.
   Childs said many of the changes were the type any show goes
through when opening. The Ohio exhibition, he said, will benefit
from what was learned during the Seattle run.
   For example, he said, advertising began in November, with special
efforts to target nearby cities, senior citizens groups and
students. More emphasis will be placed on the gift shop, which
turned out to be a strong moneymaker, and on sales of T-shirts,
hats, books and other ``Son of Heaven'' merchandise in department
stores.
   Because of the exhibition's size and the cost of staging it,
Seattle and Columbus have been the only cities to sign up as hosts.
But Childs says he's received a number of inquiries, including ones
from Denver, Baltimore, Toronto and Florida's Epcot Center.
   No negotiations are under way for further sites, he said, adding
that the Chinese haven't decided whether they want their treasures
to remain longer in this country.
   Costs for the Columbus exhibit have been estimated at $6.35
million, including remodeling Central High School, where the show
will be held. The Columbus Museum of Art will produce and manage the
exhibition.
   Proceeds from that show will go to the ``Son of Heaven''
Foundation, a non-profit organization, while proceeds from the
Seattle exhibition will be shared by two charities, the Resource
Center for the Handicapped and Vesper Society Group.
   Childs estimated the two Seattle charities will split $1 million
once the profits are divvied up at the end of the Columbus run.
   ``It's going to depend on how the show does in Ohio,'' he said.
``If nobody shows up in Ohio, it's going to be kind of interesting.''

   Marriage, fatherhood and his work with Live Aid
have changed Midge Ure. The evidence is in his latest album,
``Answers to Nothing.''
   ``The last few years have changed my life,'' said Scottish-born
Ure, 35. ``I think about more serious things now. Being a father,
I'm more concerned about the world my daughter will grow up in, so
that comes out in the songs I write.'' Songs on the album include
``Take Me Home,'' ``Sister and Brother'' and his latest single,
``Dear God.''
   The new material is spare, low-key and focused around his guitar
_ a radical departure from the synthesized orchestration of
Ultravox, his former group.
   ``Dear God'' was inspired by a pop magazine that asked him to
list his Christmas wish. The song asks God for ``love for the
lonely, food for the hungry and peace in a restless world.''
   The lyrics sum up Ure's status as one of the outstanding pop
artists who have put rock in the service of good causes _ the Band
Aid hit single ``Do They Know It's Christmas,'' the Live Aid concert
extravaganza for African famine relief and most recently the London
birthday rockfest for South Africa's jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela.
   Ure got into charity work with the Prince's Trust, Prince
Charles' organization which helps young unemployed people. But he is
best remembered for his work with Bob Geldof raising funds for
Ethiopian famine victims.
   ``He thought we should write a Christmas record, but we were only
a month away from Christmas at the time,'' Ure said in an interview
at his London record company office.
   The result was ``Do They Know It's Christmas.'' Geldof wrote the
lyrics and organized the performers, while Ure wrote the music. The
1984 record and the July 1985 Live Aid concert in London and
Philadelphia raised more than $110 million.
   However, since this summer's Mandela concert he has devoted
himself to family life with his wife, Annabel, and their
18-month-old daughter, Molly.
   ``There are a lot of great causes, but I don't think a concert is
always the answer,'' Ure said. ``People begin to think you're doing
it for the attention. You can't expect the music industry to keep
doing it, and the public gets tired of it as well.''
   Following Live Aid, Ultravox released its final album. ``I
realized at that time that my heart just wasn't in the band,'' Ure
said. ``To make a band work, you have to compromise. I didn't want
to become a dictator and tell everyone what to do, so I just bowed
out. Then everyone else decided not to carry on.''
   The new album, he insists, is more true to himself.
   ``A lot of Ultravox's vast pomposity wasn't me _ all that
overblown synthesizer stuff and massive orchestration. I'm a
guitarist, so this is more what I want.''
   With a wife and child to support, he's more aware of having to
make a living from music.
   ``It would be nice to have the sort of ideals where you don't
care if you sell records. But the unfortunate truth is, if you don't
sell any, your record company drops you and you don't get to make
any more records,'' he said.
   ``There's a fine line between commercial success and musical
success. I've been fortunate in that I've never had to compromise
one for the other. I'm artistically fulfilled, and people still seem
to want to buy my records.''
   While Ure said he missed the camaraderie of a group, working
alone allows him to keep his own schedule. ``I couldn't keep a
schedule like I used to _ working from midday to midnight. I like to
spend time with my daughter now.''
   The one love song on the LP, ``Just for You,'' is about his
daughter.
   ``Being a father is fantastic,'' Ure said. ``Getting your hands
dirty changing nappies (diapers) and all. ... It brings you right
back down to Earth with a bang.''
   Ure agreed that his experiences over the last few years have made
his latest album more mature. ``I followed my own ideas to their
ultimate conclusions in the songs. They are more mature, because my
worries are different than they used to be. I think I must be going
through male menopause. I'm only 35, but I feel like I'm 60.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Frightening Memories of McCarthyism</HEAD>

   When George Bush labeled campaign rival Michael
Dukakis a ``card-carrying'' member of the American Civil Liberties
Union, frightening memories flooded back to Howard Fast.
   In the 1950s, Sen. Joseph McCarthy achieved notoriety for his
purges of suspected Communists, brandishing a piece of paper in his
hand and charging that he had a list of ``card-carrying'' members of
the Communist Party.
   Fast was one of those members. He confronted McCarthy at a
hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and
went to jail in 1950 for refusing to submit names of alleged
``subversives.'' Thirty-eight years later, Fast has reconstructed
that time in a novel, ``The Pledge'' (Houghton-Mifflin, $18.95).
   ``Bush's campaign had something of the same feeling. That
`card-carrying ACLU' device was worked out very precisely,'' said
Fast, author of ``The Dinner Party,'' ``Citizen Tom Paine'' and
other works.
   ```Pledge' is based on a part of my life that was a great time of
fear in the United States, and this generation should learn that
this happened. None of them know,'' he said in an interview.
   ``The Pledge'' begins in post-World War II India and centers on a
war correspondent, Bruce Bacon, who has reason to believe that the
British government played a role in the famine then sweeping
Calcutta. His actions come to the attention of the British and U.S.
governments and he is ultimately forced to leave the country.
   Back home, Bacon resumes his job as a prized newspaper reporter
for the New York Tribune, but his world becomes unraveled.
Determined to pursue his theory of British collusion in the famine,
Bacon attracts the attention of the FBI and is subpoenaed by HUAC.
   He is asked about his alleged ties with members of the Indian and
American Communist parties and also about his love relationship with
Molly Maguire, a writer for the Communist Party's newspaper. He
angrily refuses to answer any questions about Maguire, lashes out at
the committee, is removed from the hearing room and goes to jail for
contempt of Congress.
   ``This has nothing to do with democracy,'' Fast said. ``It has
nothing to do with the United States. This book is a true book.
Eighty percent of it happened to me. What didn't happen to me
happened to people I know.''
   Fast was born Nov. 11, 1914, in New York, the son of a factory
worker. His first published novel, ``Two Valleys,'' appeared in
1933. Four years later the success of his novella, ``The Children,''
enabled him to write full-time.
   Like many liberals in the 1930s, Fast was a bitter opponent of
Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and later joined the Communist
Party as a way of fighting fascism. His books were written from a
decidedly left-wing point of view.
   ``I've run into kids who told me I have taught them American
history. I have educated them in the best meaning of the United
States. I would like to have millions read `Pledge,' but that's not
too likely.''
   During World War II, Fast was a member of the overseas staff of
the Office of War Information and in 1945 went to Europe as a
correspondent for ``Esquire'' and ``Coronet'' magazines.
   ``I discovered one interesting thing in World War II,'' Fast
recalled. ``For most people involved in a war, it's a picnic, a
holiday. A way to break up a bad marriage.
   ``To me, war is unspeakable. It's murder condoned. You are
murdering a human being who has not harmed you, who you don't know
and will never know.''
   After his prison term he ran for Congress in 1952 as a candidate
for the American Labor Party.
   ``I had a sense of outrage after being released and I did
something that I would advise no writer to do,'' said Fast, easily
defeated in the election. ``I based my campaign on ending the war in
Korea.''
   Fast left the Communist Party in 1956, and even wrote a book,
``The Naked God,'' about his disillusionment, but remains a
committed liberal. He is currently working on a new novel, based on
the story of a priest murdered in Honduras.
   ``I feel an unending sense of horror of what people do to each
other. I once saw (the novelist Theodore) Dreiser down on Park
Avenue South and tears were rolling down his cheeks. He said, `I was
just looking at people, looking at the street. I could not stand the
way things were.' It broke my heart.''
   In ``The Pledge,'' Maguire repeatedly teases Bacon about his
``innocence,'' his endless disbelief that people are capable of such
evil. Fast, despite his war experiences and his time in prison,
considers himself an ``innocent'' as well.
   ``If you have a conscience instilled in you, you have to begin to
ask yourself certain questions. Millions of Germans are asking
themselves, `How could we do it?' It comes at different stages to
different people,'' he said.
   ``I feel it all the time, but this is my own pain and I don't
wish this on everyone else.''

   President Reagan sent Congress his final
budget, a $1.15 trillion plan to continue military growth and
squeezed social programs with optimism the federal deficit will
disappear without a major tax increase.
   President-elect Bush praised the effort, but reiterated Monday
his intention to alter its design within weeks.
   Like his eight others, Reagan's ninth budget is out of balance.
But this deficit, at $92.5 billion, would be the smallest since the
year he took office.

for the first time it does not have enough money to bail out the
troubled industry.
   The administration, in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990,
outlined plans Monday to spend $64 billion from the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. from 1989 through 1994.
   But the budget document acknowledged ``these proposals will not
resolve the entire problem'' and said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady is working on a plan, ``including identifying additional
funding sources for FSLIC,'' to be presented to Bush within 60 days.

   Energy futures prices are continuing an upward
trend, helped by investor expectations that OPEC is abiding by its
production accord.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
settled 17 cents higher at $17.72 a barrel Monday. On Friday, the
contract closed up 13 cents at $17.55 following a volatile week.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, domestic heating
oil futures ended Monday higher. The February contract settled at
54.15 cents a gallon, up 0.55 cent.
   Meanwhile, unleaded gasoline futures closed mixed, with the
February contract up 0.24 cent at 47.96 cents a gallon.
   Energy analysts said bullish sentiment about OPEC's agreement to
cut production continued to push prices higher. The 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced in November
it would reduce its output to 18.5 million barrels a day starting
Jan. 1 from an amount estimated at more than 22 million barrels.
   Since then, prices have risen approximately $5 a barrel.
   Traders said futures prices got a lift Monday from reports that
most OPEC countries are abiding by the accord and have drastically
reduced their production. At least two reports suggested that Saudi
Arabia, the cartel's largest producer, cut its output by more than 2
million barrels a day the first week in January.
   ``Whichever (report) you take, the figures show they're down.
It's the direction that helped out,'' said Bob Baker, a futures
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Prices also got a lift from reports of continuing problems in the
North Sea following a fire in an oil facility there late last year,
traders said.
   ``Prices are moving up because it's a bull market and there is no
bearish news,'' said Jim Fiedler, an oil broker with E.D.&amp;F. Man

<HEAD>Survey Finds Americans Ambivalent About Materialism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working Americans ages 25 to 49 say they would
like the nation to return to a simpler way of life, but their own
concern with material success has not declined, a survey released
today shows.
   The telephone survey of 1,001 people who work full-time outside
the home was commissioned by Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons Inc. on behalf
of its Chivas Regal brand of liquor.
   Seventy-five percent of the respondents said they would ``like to
see our country return to a simpler lifestyle, with less emphasis on
material success.'' Only 17 percent disagreed.
   But in another question, only 16 percent said they themselves
were less concerned with material success than they were five years
ago. Thirty percent said they were more concerned, while 53 percent
said there was no change in their attitude.
   ``There's got to be some nostalgia going there,'' said Frank
Walton, president of Research &amp; Forecasts Inc., the New York-based
firm that prepared the survey, explaining the seeming contradiction
in the answers.
   ``People think, `I wish things were simpler. But if that means
less material rewards in my life, I'm not so sure,''' Walton said.
   All but 31 percent of the respondents said they had been involved
in some kind of public service work over the past five years.
Thirty-four percent claimed they donated 10 percent or more of their
income to charity in the previous year.
   Walton said it is likely that some people exaggerated how
charitable they were. But he said it nevertheless appeared from the
survey that Americans are somewhat more public-spirited than in
1978, when a Lou Harris poll found that 49 percent of Americans did
not claim involvement in community volunteer work.
   More than a third of the respondents said they thought they would
spend more time on public service in the next few years, while only
about a tenth thought they would spend less time.
   ``Clearly, there's a reservoir of good intentions that hasn't
been tapped,'' Walton said.
   The survey was conducted in mid-October. The margin of error on
most questions was about 3 percent.

   A wage and price freeze succeeded last year in
reducing inflation to 51.7 percent, a two-thirds drop over the 1987
rate, according to Mexico's central bank.
   The Bank of Mexico noted in Monday's announcement that consumer
prices rose by 159.2 percent in 1987.
   On Feb. 29, the government froze the peso's exchange rate against
the dollar, the federal daily minimum wage and prices for
government-regulated goods and services. It pressured independent
producers and retailers to follow suit, fining companies it
determined were exceeding official price guidelines or publicizing
their names.
   On Dec. 13, newly-inaugurated President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
announced he was extending the program through the first half of
1989.
   Effective Jan. 1, the government instituted a 7-month gradual
peso devaluation against the dollar, averaging one peso per day. The
exchange rate Monday was 2,280 pesos to the dollar.
   The devaluation will make Mexican products cheaper abroad,
helping to offset Mexico's staggering $106 billion foreign debt.
   The government also granted workers an 8 percent increase in the
minimum wage and forbade employers from passing along the added
labor cost to consumers. The maintained freezes on some essential
goods and services, including domestic gas, electricity and gasoline.

<TEXT>
   Japan expects to export 2.2 million cars to the
United States in the fiscal year ending in March, 100,000 cars below
a self-imposed annual quota, and the government Tuesday said it
would continue the restraint.
   ``If we removed the quota, we are concerned'' Japanese companies
would push for more U.S. sales and aggravate trade tensions with the
United States, said Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the minister of international
trade and industry.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States in 1987 was $59.8
billion, the largest chunk of the $171.2 billion U.S. trade deficit.
   Mitsuzuka, in a news conference, was asked about complaints from
some U.S. lawmakers that Japanese cars built in the United States
should also be counted as U.S. imports. He replied that by 1991, the
local content of U.S.-made Japanese cars would be 75 percent, ``and
we regard them as American-made cars.''
   Japanese automakers produced 733,000 cars in the United States
from January to November, up 23.2 percent from the same period in
1987, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   News reports said the Trade Ministry had been expected to lift
the export quota last year, but sentiment was reversed because of
concern over giving the wrong impression at a time of rising
protectionist sentiment in the United States.
   Some Japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated on economic
grounds. Since 1985, the yen has doubled in value against the
dollar, wiping out the price advantage Japanese cars had.
   In fiscal 1987, which ended last March, 2.21 million cars were
exported to the United States, and Mitsuzuka said shipments in the
April-November period were 10.4 percent below a year earlier.
Nevertheless, he predicted sales of 2.2 million for this fiscal year
also.
   The United States has taken a neutral position on renewing the
quota, a U.S. diplomatic source in Tokyo said on condition of
anonymity.
   The quota began in 1981, when Japan was under strong pressure
from the U.S. government and American automakers to cut the Japanese
inroads in the U.S. auto market. Japan agreed to limit its annual
exports to the United States to 1.68 million vehicles through 1983,
then to 1.85 million in 1984.
   When President Reagan decided not to ask for continued restraints
in 1985, Japan set the ceiling at 2.3 million and has kept that
figure.
   Now the Japanese, led by Honda, which has the most sales in the
United States, are trying to penetrate the U.S. luxury car market.
Toyota and Nissan _ the Japanese ``Big Two'' carmakers _ both are
introducing cars costing $20,000 to $40,000 in an attempt to lure
Americans away from Jaguar, Mercedes and BMW models.
   Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan, said that while ``free trade is
desirable'' and the quota had lost its original significance, the
matter still has ``to be studied in the frame of U.S.-Japan
relations as a whole. ... We believe the government made its
conclusion taking this into consideration.''
   Japan imported 133,583 cars in 1988, the Japan Automobile
Importers Association said Tuesday. West Germany's Bavarian Motor
Works, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz were the most popular carmakers,
it said.

<HEAD>Democrats Give Short Shrift to Reagan's $1.15 Trillion Budget</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with comments from Sasser, Panneta;

   The Democratic chairmen of Congress'
budget-writing committees said today that President Reagan's
farewell, $1.15 trillion spending plan is a dead letter and that
President-elect Bush must submit a substitute reflecting his more
moderate policies.
   ``This Reagan budget is a continuation of what we've seen for the
past eight years _ increased spending in defense, cuts in domestic
spending and a lot of red ink. And George Bush needs to reverse that
trend,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee.
   Joining Sasser on NBC-TV's ```Today'' show, House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., added: ``These kind of
budgets have been overwhelmingly rejected by Republicans and
Democrats on Capitol Hill.
   ``So if (Bush) wants a budget that no only goes someplace on
Capitol Hill but also reflects some new priorities for this country,
then he's got to change the budget that was presented yesterday.''
   Sasser said Bush must cut defense spending in favor of restoring
funds for domestic programs that were slashed under Reagan.
   The president's fiscal 1990 budget, submitted just 11 days before
he retires, would produce a deficit of $92.5 billion, within the
$100 billion target mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law.
   If achieved, that figure would be a dramatic decrease from the
worst of the Reagan era shortfalls, but drastically higher than the
red ink run up by any previous president.
   Besides challenging the spending blueprint's priorities, the
Democrats criticized what they called its unrealistically optimistic
economic assumptions.
   Even congressional Republicans conceded Monday that Reagan's
submission is little more than a starting point for Bush's budget
efforts.
   ``This is obviously Ronald Reagan's book,'' said Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee. ``George Bush and the Congress will write the final
chapter.''
   As if to symbolize the Reagan plan's lack of significance,
Domenici was in Albuquerque, N.M., and his House counterpart, Rep.
Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., was in Europe.
   Bush, who takes office Jan. 20, is not required to submit a
spending plan of his own. But his aides have indicated he will
propose revisions to Reagan's plan after his inauguration, and the
president-elect distanced himself slightly from it Monday, saying he
``agrees with its intent.''
   Congressional Democrats are eager for Bush to submit a detailed
proposal of his own because they are skeptical he can do everything
he has promised: reduce the deficit without raising taxes while
still diverting federal resources to child care, education,
environmental cleanups and other priorities he proclaimed during his
presidential campaign.
   Reagan's budget would collect $1.059 trillion in revenues and
spend $1.152 trillion, leaving a $92.5 billion imbalance. That would
be the lowest deficit since the $73.7 billion shortfall of fiscal
1981, which was under way when Reagan took office.
   But Democrats say Reagan's budget plan masks the true amount of
red ink by overestimating the economy's likely strength next year,
adding more revenue on paper but with no guarantee the money will
actually be there.
   The federal deficit reached its all-time high of $221 billion in
1986. Under Reagan, the total federal debt has so far soared to $2.6
trillion, almost triple the $914 billion the government owed before
he took office. The government will have to spend $170 billion this
year just to pay interest on that debt.
   The administration says it expects the current year's imbalance
to total $161 billion.
   Reagan would boost military outlays in the next fiscal year by $5
billion to $303 billion. His proposed Pentagon spending authority of
$315.2 billion, which includes some outlays for years beyond 1990,
reflects an increase of 2 percent more than inflation over this
year's levels.
   The increases would include boosting spending on the Star Wars
missile defense system from $4.05 billion to $5.9 billion, setting
aside $94.6 million for a sea-based anti-satellite system, and
starting production of the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The president would devote $3 billion to clean and modernize the
nation's nuclear weapons plants, a task the government has estimated
could cost $128 billion over two decades.
   He would earmark $16 billion this year and $9 billion next year
to help the country's failing savings and loan institutions, a job
that could ultimately cost $100 billion or more.
   Reagan also called for a $160 million increase, to $1.4 billion,
for AIDS research; adding $1.8 billion to the current $9.9 billion
space agency budget; and beefing up the government's $4.4 billion
anti-drug efforts to $5 billion. Spending on aviation, including
hiring additional air traffic controllers, would grow from $5.7
billion to $6.6 billion.
   To pay for this generosity, many domestic programs would be
slashed. He proposed killing 82 federal programs, many of which
Congress has refused to eliminate in the past, such as mass transit
assistance, aid to the Amtrak commuter rail service, and subsidies
to the postal service. Overall, $4.9 billion would be saved next
year.
   He would also reduce the growth of Medicare spending for the
elderly and disabled by $3.2 billion and cut projected increases in
Medicaid for the poor by $1.7 billion, mostly by restricting
payments to doctors and hospitals. In recent years, health care
costs have grown much faster than inflation in general.
   More savings would come from reducing agriculture spending by
$9.7 billion to $42.4 billion, mostly in cuts in price supports to
farmers and in child nutrition programs.
   There would be no cost-of-living increases next year for retired
federal workers, but Social Security would not be touched.
   The government would raise $6 billion from selling various
federal assets, and pocket another $1 billion by raising various
fees, such as charging $25 annually for boat owners who use waters
patrolled by the Coast Guard, and boosting charges paid by veterans
getting home loan guarantees by 1 percent.
   Unless Congress votes to block it, one part of Reagan's budget
would grant a 50 percent pay raise to the cabinet, members of
Congress, judges and the federal government's top managers. Another
proposal, which requires congressional approval, would grant a 2
percent pay increase to rank-and-file federal workers and 3.6
percent to the military.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Dismantling Foreign Currency Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed Tuesday to
dismantle its foreign currency regulations ``to fully expose the
Swedish market to foreign competition.''
   The proposal in the 1989-1990, budget presented to parliament by
Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt, was expected to open Swedish
banks to foreign competition.
   The proposed budget of about $60.5 billion, which also included a
controversial spending cut for schools, was the first with a budget
surplus since 1962.
   The deregulation will remove the final barriers for the movement
of foreign currency, which the government has been gradually
relaxing for several years, and bring Sweden into line with Europe's
plan to eliminate currency restrictions by 1992.
   But transactions would be monitored through a foreign exchange
bank to prevent tax evasion by investing in foreign markets,
according to the budget proposal.
   Under current restrictions, Swedes cannot hold foreign real
estate worth more than $136,000 or acquire other foreign holdings
worth more than $40,000 without special government permission.
   Feldt told a news conference he hoped the move to end those
restrictions would lead to higher efficiency in the Swedish economy,
in which the public sector accounts for about 60 percent of the
gross national product.
   ``In the long term it is deeply worrying that Sweden's economic
growth is not higher, despite the fact that the economy is running
full and there is a lack of labor,'' Feldt said.
   The growth rate in other Western nations has been about 4 percent
in the past five years, but it has been running between 2.5 percent
to 3 percent in Sweden, he said. Feldt predicted 1.7 percent growth

   It was not clear when the deregulation would take place. Feldt

<HEAD>Wrigley And California Company Try To Extend Life Of Gum Flavor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Your chewing gum might not lose its flavor on the
bedpost overnight now that California-style high tech has joined
forces with the world's largest gum producer.
   The Chicago-based William Wrigley Jr. Co. announced it will work
with Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc., of Redwood City, Calif., on a
project to develop a chewing gum that keeps its flavor for longer.
   William Piet, a Wrigley vice president, said Monday that the key
is a new technology that ``enables timed release of flavor oils,''
   The technology, patented by Advanced Polymer Systems, uses
microscopic sponges, he said. The companies said the Microsponge
systems could also be used to extend the life of food flavorings and
food preservatives.
   ``By using these sponges, instead of gum releasing all the flavor
at once, it will hold onto the flavor and release it in a sustained
manner,'' said Sergio Nacht, Advanced Polymer's vice president of
research and development.
   ``It (flavor) will have to last significantly longer than it does
now for people to perceive the difference,'' he said.
   Piet said approval from the Food and Drug Administration would be
needed before gum using the sponges could be sold. He said he did
not know how long it would take to develop the product and get
approval.
   Nacht predicted it could take 18 to 36 months before the new gum
hits store shelves.
   Advanced Polymer uses its sponge technology in aftershave lotion
and in various women's cosmetics, Nacht said.
   The process has also been used in topical drugs, such as
ointments for sore muscles, he said.
   ``They hold a patented process that's a good one,'' Piet said.
``We're confident this is a technology that can be applied to food
products. That's why we entered into this agreement.''
   In food, the new technology would incorporate millions of
microscopic, nontoxic ``sponges,'' and the little containers would
release the flavor when the food is chewed.
   Under the gum agreement, Advanced Polymer will receive a small
royalty from the sale of Wrigley products that are made with the
Microsponge system, he said.
   Wrigley will get a small percentage of the revenue Advanced
Polymer gets in other food applications of the technology, Piet said.
   Advanced Polymer developed the Microsponge technology in the
early 1980s.

<HEAD>World's Largest Port Fighting To Stay On Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From atop his mammoth crane, Jan de
Jong lifts a 25-ton container from a freighter with a fiddle of his
joystick, punches a code on a computer screen and delivers the cargo
to a railway car 200 yards away.
   ``It's quite a change compared with 20 years ago,'' the
49-year-old De Jong mused. ``Getting 25 tons of cargo from the hold
would take us all day. Now it's just a matter of minutes.''
   The change in De Jong's workday routine reflects the 1980s
transformation of Rotterdam, the world's biggest and busiest port,
from a labor-intensive harbor operation into a digitalized logistics
center, where fewer people handle ever more cargo.
   City officials say the change has begun just in time to fend off
the rival ports of Antwerp, Hamburg and Le Havre. All are preparing
for the cutthroat competition expected throughout Western Europe
after national trade barriers are removed as part of the 1992 market
integration of the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   The Dutch government's plan is to make the Netherlands the main
trading center and transit point for goods entering and leaving
northwest Europe. It has begun a large program of subsidies and tax
breaks to attract European headquarters and distribution operations
of multinational companies.
   The Dutch scored a major success earlier this month when the
Japanese automaking giant Nissan announced plans to locate its
European headquarters in the Netherlands.
   The city of Rotterdam plans to invest about $500 million by 1992
to upgrade the 5,306-acre port's traffic radar and
telecommunications network, as well as build new container terminals
and additional railway yards leading to the port's 25 miles of docks.
   ``We need to put ourselves on the map again as a sophisticated
link in the transport chain, especially in our main market areas _
Latin America, the United States, and the Far East,'' Rotterdam
Mayor Bram Peper told The Associated Press.
   ``In the 1970s, complacency set in. The prevailing opinion was
that we were the biggest and the best _ a God-given fact that wasn't
believed subject to any change,'' said the mayor in an interview.
   Paradoxically, that period of smugness coincided with the
worldwide economic slump that followed 1973's sharp rise in oil
prices.
   Because of its huge volume of operations, Rotterdam, where the
Rhine and Maas rivers flow into the North Sea, suffered less from
that recession than other European ports.
   But another recession in the early 1980s brought a Western
European industrial retrenchment and radical changes in transport
needs that brought Rotterdam's traditional bulk handling operation
to the verge of obsolescence.
   ``There is a marked shift in the economic activity of Western
Europe, a shift not only in what is being produced, but also in
where it is being manufactured,'' said Ron van Harten of Rotterdam's
municipal Port Authority.
   From 1945 until the mid-1970s, Rotterdam's biggest single
customer was West Germany's Ruhr area, where steel mills and huge
chemical plants consumed vast quantities of iron ore, coal, and
petroleum shipped through Rotterdam.
   But West Germany's economic center of gravity has been drifting
southward toward Bavaria's new computer and component factories.
   Those high tech sectors require quicker handling and delivery of
small containerized loads, instead of the huge but slow bulk
freighter shipments that made Rotterdam's worldwide reputation,
according to Van Harten.
   The new high-tech industries are particularly sought after by
this small nation eager to avoid worsening its environmental
problems with pollution-generating heavy industry.
   ``We're planning to lure high-tech industries to Rotterdam with
our all-in-one package _ transport, a sophisticated service sector
such as banking and insurance, a good cultural environment,'' Mayor
Peper said.
   Heavily damaged by Nazi bombing during World War II, Rotterdam
arose from the rubble of 1945 with a massive buildup of the port's
transit facilities, mainly for handling petroleum and chemicals.
   The rapid reconstruction of the bomb-damaged city and the
extension of the port earned Rotterdam the accolade ``Dynamo of the
Dutch Economy.'' In less than 20 years, the city surpassed New York
as the world's busiest port. Last year, it handled 250 million tons
of freight, more than 15 times its 1948 total.
   The port city sees another challenge in the English Channel
tunnel, which will become a major transport route between Britain
and southern Europe upon completion, scheduled for 1993.
   Experts predict the tunnel _ and the new road-and-rail
infrastructure linking up to it _ will shift European transport
patterns southward. The tunnel's continental end is near the French
port of Dunkirk, 124 miles south of Rotterdam.

<UNK>Japanese Banks to Lend 5.1 Billion Dollars for Nabisco Buyout</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten Japanese banks will lend a total of $5.1 billion
to help finance U.S.-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc., a bank official said Tuesday.
   The loan, believed to be the largest ever by Japanese banks for
such a transaction, was in line with industry expectations.
   The official who provided the figure insisted not being
identified by name or bank, although his bank is one of the 10
involved in the deal.
   KKR will be using a total of $14 billion in bank loans to finance
its record $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco.
   Henry Kravis, principal of KKK, has been meeting with several
large Japanese banks here and in the United States over the past few
weeks.
   Most of the 10 Japanese banks that will participate in the
worldwide bank consortium reportedly approved their loans by Jan. 6,
the deadline for receiving higher incentive returns.
   Mitsubishi Bank confirmed it had notified KKR by Jan. 6 of its
intention to offer a loan, but a bank official, speaking on
condition that he not be named, declined to specify the amount.
   Officials at other banks said they do not ordinarily provide
details about their loan contracts.
   One banking source said: ``Each bank is directly in contact with
KKR.''
   Published reports have said 10 Japanese banks including Sanwa,
Mitsubishi, Daiichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sumitomo, Japan Industrial Bank
and Mitsui Trust Bank had notified KKR by Jan. 6 of their intention
to offer loans for the buyout.
   Each agreed to lend between $350 million and $600 million, with
the total reaching an estimated $5.15 billion, said the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, a leading economic newspaper.
   In its Saturday edition, it said a few other Japanese banks,
including the Bank of Tokyo and Taiyo Kobe Bank, were expected to
approve loans and notify KKR by Jan. 17, the final deadline.
   Participation of the second group would bring the total amount of
Japanese loans to KKR to almost $6 billion, Nihon Keizai said.

<HEAD>Chinese Exports Hit Record $40 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese exports topped $40 billion in 1988,
setting a record and far exceeding official targets, the People's
Daily reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper quoted preliminary figures released by the Ministry
of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade as showing exports totaling
a record $40.1 billion, with nearly 70 percent coming from
industrial finished products.
   The ministry said the figure was not final and likely would go up
slightly when more information came in from remote areas. It also
said import figures were not yet compiled.
   The preliminary export total is up more than 16 percent from
1987's $34.6 billion. Although the increase is higher than planned,
it is sharply lower than the 1987 increase of 28 percent.
   However, the official China Daily newspaper quoted an
unidentified ministry official as saying China's export performance
was remarkable in view of increased competition on the world market.

   Growers in central Taiwan, long the major chrysanthemum suppliers

<HEAD>Saudi Oil Reserves Estimated At 252 Billion Barrels, 50 Percent Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arabian American Oil Co. said
Tuesday that Saudi Arabia's estimated oil reserves are more than 50
percent higher than previously estimated.
   Aramco said that a new study estimates Saudi Arabia's recoverable
crude oil reserves at 252.38 billion barrels. That's about
one-fourth of the world's total known reserves and significantly
higher than the 171.5 billion barrels previously estimated.
   Aramco, based in the capital of Saudi Arabia's oil-producing
eastern province, also estimated Saudi gas reserves at 177.294
trillion cubic feet, up from approximately 141.80 trillion estimated
a year ago.
   The Aramco report, distributed by the official Saudi Press
Agency, said that untapped reserves could raise the estimates to 315
billion barrels of oil and 253 trillion cubic feet of gas.
   By comparison, the United States has estimated oil reserves of 27
billion barrels and the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil
producer, some 63 billion barrels.
   The new estimates followed six years of intensive study by a
computerized engineering center in Dhahran manned by the world's
largest grouping of oil experts and engineers with the most
sophisticated equipment available, Aramco said.
   Saudi Arabia and neighboring gulf countries sit on two-thirds of
the world's oil proven reserves. Saudi Arabia is the largest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
the world's largest oil exporter.
   Other members of OPEC also recently have increased their
government estimates of proven reserves in what some analysts say is
part of an ongoing power struggle within the cartel.
   Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, all OPEC countries,
each have reported estimated reserves of around 100 billion barrels.
The amount of reserves a country has are believed to be one factor
used by OPEC to establish production quotas.
   The Arabic-language report did not use the word ``proven'' for
the latest estimate, but it was implied through the comparison with
the untapped resources. Proven oil reserves are those that can be
produced at current prices with current technology.
   King Fahd, who is currently visiting the eastern province, last
week chaired a cabinet meeting that ratified Saudi Arabia's 1989
budget which showed a deficit for the sixth straight year because of
weak oil prices.
   The kingdom drew on its reserves to cover the earlier deficits.
But the dwindling coffers forced it to resort to public borrowing
through treasury bonds of $8 billion last year and $6.7 billion this
year.

<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites thruout to include Cooke Cablevision deal. No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cooke Cablevision Inc. and the New York Times Co.
have agreed to sell their cable television systems in separate
transactions valued at around $2 billion.
   The New York Times Co. said Monday it is selling its system in
southern New Jersey for $420 million to a venture that will be
managed by a minority investment group.
   Investor Jack Kent Cooke, who controls Cooke Cablevision,
declined to reveal the sales price of his cable systems. But the
Wall Street Journal quoted sources in the purchasing group as
putting it at $2,100 to $2,200 per subscriber, or about $1.5 billion.
   The purchasers of Cooke Cablevision are seven cable companies led
by InterMedia Partners of San Francisco and Tele-Communications Inc.
of Denver. Cooke's 700,000 properties are scattered over 19 states,
including Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina and Alaska.
The separation of the properties held down the price fetched per
subscriber.
   The price in the New York Times deal amounts to nearly $2,600 per
subscriber, which industry analysts said made it one of the more
expensive recent cable system sales.
   Because the sale was to a minority-managed venture, the deal
announced Monday may also qualify for tax advantages that would
boost its effective value to the Times.
   Parties to the transaction also said it would be the nation's
biggest cable television system with sizeable minority ownership.
   J. Bruce Llewellyn, who heads a soft-drink bottling concern in
Philadelphia and is one of the nation's top black business
executives, will head the minority group being assembled that will
manage and have at least 20 percent interest in the new cable
venture.
   The other investors, which will split evenly the remaining
ownership in the venture, are a pair of cable TV companies based in
the Philadelphia area, Comcast Corp., the nation's fourth-largest
cable operator, and Lenfest Communications Inc.
   The system being sold is NYT Cable TV of Cherry Hill, N.J., which
serves 162,000 subscribers in 59 communities in southern New Jersey,
a suburban area that analysts said should prove attractive to
advertisers.
   The Times had put the cable system up for sale in late October,
saying it wanted to concentrate on its core businesses that include
newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and forest products. It bought
the system in 1981 when it had about 72,000 subscribers.
   David Gorham, chief financial oficer for New York Times Co., said
that, as a result of the minority group's involvement in the
purchase, the Times requested that the Federal Communications
Commission grant a tax certificate in connection with the sale that
will entitle the Times to defer payment of about $138 million in
taxes on the transaction.
   The tax-deferral provision was created by Congress in 1978 to
encourage minority ownership of communications companies. The
minority group must be the managing partner in order for the deal to
qualify.
   Gorham declined to estimate how much the deferral would mean to
the Times, but others familiar with the negotiations said the Times
had put a value of $55 million on it, which would boost the value of
the deal to the Times above $2,900 per subscriber.
   Gorham said the Times expects to record an after-tax gain of
about $183 million, or $2.34 per share, on the sale. The deal is
expected to close in the second quarter after various federal
regulators complete their review of it.
   Paula Greer, who works for the media research firm Paul Kagan
Associates Inc. in Carmel, Calif., said the price-per-subscriber
that the Times stands to receive would put it among the top 10 cable
deals of the past year, which included a handful of sales valued at
more than $3,000 per subscriber.
   Llewellyn has not finished lining up the minority investors who
will join his group, and until he does the percentage of the company
that his group controls will not be decided, according to Julian
Brodsky, vice chairman of Comcast.
   Llewellyn, who could not be reached for comment on the deal, is
chairman, chief executive and majority stockholder of Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc., which was listed by Black Enterprise
magazine last year as the nation's third-biggest black business.
   He is also chairman and a major stockholder in the Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, Inc., and of Queen City
Broadcasting Inc., which owns and operates WKBW-TV, the ABC
affiliate in Buffalo, N.Y.
   He lives in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., a New York suburb.
   InterMedia, a media investment partnership put together by former
Chronicle Publishing Co. chief financial officer Leo J. Hindery Jr.,
said it will purchase Cooke systems serving about 215,000
subscribers in partnership with San Francisco media executive Frank
Washington.
   Tele-Communications will acquire systems serving about 200,000
subscribers, and TCA Cable TV Inc., based in Tyler, Texas, will get
about 90,000 subscribers. The balance of the Cooke systems will be
divided between Chambers Communications Corp. of Eugene, Ore.;
Falcon Cable TV, based in Los Angeles; Hawke Cable, a joint venture
of Adelphia Communications Corp., based in Coudersport, Pa., and
Goshawk Corp. of Hanover, N.H.; and Rock Associates Inc. of Seattle.

   Peter R. Fink, former president and chief
executive officer of R.P. Scherer Corp., has formed a new investment
company that could try to buy the capsule manufacturer, he said
today.
   Quantum Corp., an investment and management concern, was not set
up specifically to acquire R.P. Scherer, said Fink, who will be
president of the company.
   ``However, at this point, I would not rule out participation in
an endeavor of that type,'' he said.
   Fink resigned from R.P. Scherer in November after opposing the
sale of the company in an unsuccessful proxy battle with heirs of
the founder. He had been president and CEO since 1979.
   He will continue on the Scherer board of directors.
   Quantum is evaluating a range of investment opportunities,
including acquisitions and leveraged buyouts, Fink said. It also
will offer strategic management services, he said.
   The Scherer board had voted in September to consider a number of
financial alternatives including sale of the company.
   The proxy battle at R.P. Scherer pitted Fink against his
estranged wife, Karla Fink, daughter of the founder, and her
brother, John S. Scherer. The two are directors who control about 38
percent of the company between them.
   Karla Fink led the dissident shareholders ``Committee for the
Sale of R.P. Scherer Corp.'' It successfully backed election in a
proxy vote Aug. 17 of two new board members who favor considering
the sale of the company.

million plant in southern Italy to make computer chips.
   Construction of the plant, to be located about 60 miles east of
Rome in Avezzano, will begin by midyear, the head of Texas
Instruments Italy, Roberto Schisano, said at a news conference.
   Initial production is scheduled to begin in late 1990 and
full-scale production by mid-1991, he said.
   ``This initiative will embrace not only Italy, but the entire
European electronic market of the 1990s, which will become one of
the keystones of the development of industrial economic activity in
the community,'' he said.
   The factory will produce 4 million-bit D-RAM computer memory
chips and will also be capable of making logic chips. Silicon wafers
produced in the plant will be shipped to another plant in Rieti for
assembly and testing.
   The factory, which will employ more than 500 people, will be the
company's third in southern Italy.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with little fresh news to
influence the markets.
   Analysts said some of the early losses reflected follow-through
selling after Monday's steep decline in the soybean market, which
was linked to forecasts for rain in Argentina, the world's
fourth-largest soybean producer.
   But the showers there overnight were lighter than expected, said
Jerry Gidel, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller
division of the British-owned trading company LIT America Inc.
   ``There was some rain but it wasn't fantastic,'' Gidel said.
``Right now the grain markets are kind of sitting here trying to
figure out if the rain in Argentina is any big deal or not.''
   Gidel said the markets would soon begin focusing on the upcoming
crop report from the Agriculture Department. Friday's report will
include final 1988 crop production figures, estimates for 1989
planted acreage and new supply and demand statistics.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.47 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to \ cent lower with March at $2.89\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to
1{ cents lower with March at $2.36{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent
lower to { cent higher with January at $8.06 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent higher with February at
73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent higher
with January at 85.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower
to .03 cent higher with February at 46.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent to .20 cent lower with February at 42.25 cents
a pound.
   Livestock futures closed mixed on Monday while pork bellies
finished sharply lower.

   A unanimous Supreme Court today upheld a 5
percent tax that Illinois imposes on all telephone calls charged to
in-state numbers.
   The court, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said the
tax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce.
   ``The tax at issue has many of the characteristics of a sales
tax,'' Marshall said. ``It is assessed on the individual consumer,
collected by the retailer and accompanies the retail purchase of an
interstate telephone call.''
   Two Illinois residents, Jerome F. Goldberg and Robert McTigue,
challenged the tax in a class-action lawsuit filed four years ago in
Chicago. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. joined the case later,
seeking to recover taxes already paid.
   From Sept. 15, 1985 to July 1986, GTE Sprint paid $2.6 million in
taxes under the challenged Illinois Telecommunications Excise Tax.
   Lawyers for the National Conference of State Legislatures and
other governmental groups told the justices that Illinois collects
$10 million a month under the disputed phone tax.
   The tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls, intrastate and
interstate, charged to Illinois service addresses.
   Writing for the court today, Marshall acknowledged that some
interstate telephone calls could be subject to multiple taxation if
some other state also imposes a tax on them.
   ``This limited possibility is not sufficient to invalidate the
Illinois statutory scheme,'' Marshall said. ``To the extent that
other states' telecommunications taxes pose a risk of multiple
taxation, the (Illinois law's) credit provision operates to avoid
actual multiple taxation.''
   Using a test the Supreme Court devised in 1977 to judge state
taxes challenged as unconstitutional, Marshall said the Illinois law
``is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate
commerce and is fairly related to services which the state of
Illinois provides to the taxpayer.''
   The vote upholding the law was 9-0, but Justices John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia did not join
Marshall's opinion in its entirety. The three wrote separate
concurring opinions.
   The case is Goldberg vs. Sweet, 87-826.

   A Chicago bank that was the goverment's biggest
target of racial and sexual discrimination charges has agreed to pay
$14 million in back pay, the largest such settlement ever obtained
by the federal government, the Labor Department said today.
   The settlement also requires the Harris Trust and Savings Bank to
revise its affirmative action policies, provide training and other
assistance to women and minority workers and file periodic reports
with the government documenting its compliance with
anti-discrimination laws.
   The $14 million in back pay Harris Trust agreed to pay is the
largest such settlement ever obtained by the government from a
single employer. It was not immediately clear how many current or
former bank employees would share the award.
   The agreement ends a controversial dispute with the government
that dates back to 1977 and involved a 1965 presidential order
requiring federal contractors to refrain from discrimination against
minorities and women in their hiring, promotion and wage policies.
   ``What we have announced here today is a pure business
decision,'' B. Kenneth West, Harris Trust chairman and chief
executive officer, said in Chicago.
   ``We are not at all pleased at handing over $14 million _ as a
matter of principle, we would have preferred to end this case with a
definitive verdict, not a negotiated settlement,'' he said.
   ``But by the same token, we wouldn't be pleased to fight this to
the end _ even if the end were in our favor _ at what we are
convinced would be a far greater cost in money and internal stress.''
   A sidelight to the case was an unsuccessful 1985 effort by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce to convince President Reagan to repeal the executive order.
They argued that requiring affirmative action goals and timetables
to make amends for institutional bias amounted to reverse
discrimination.
   An administrative law judge in 1981 found that Harris Trust had
discriminated against women and minorities and awarded $12.2 million
in back pay to plaintiffs in a class-action suit against it. But
then-Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan set aside the decision, saying
the bank had been wrongly denied an opportunity to present
statistical studies in its defense.
   The case was then reheard. In 1986, Administrative Law Judge
Nahum Litt again ruled that the bank was liable for back pay to
women and minority employees on its payroll from 1974 until Dec. 22,
1986, unless it could prove it ceased the discriminatory practices
before that date.
   Today's settlement expanded that time period, forcing the bank to
distribute back pay to women and minorities in its employ from May
1974 through December 1988.
   In an additional ruling in the case, Litt said the awarding of
back pay should be treated as a class action _ a decision that meant
each alleged victim would not have to prove he or she was
individually subjected to discrimination.
   George Salem, the Labor Department's solicitor, speculated last
March that the back-pay award might exceed $20 million. But at the
same time he confirmed the department was attempting to negotiate a
settlement with the bank.
   The bank maintained throughout the 11-year case that it had not
discriminated against any of its workers.
   The settlement order issued by the Labor Department today
requires the bank to immediately cease any existing discriminatory
policies and to refrain from such practices in the future.
   It also requires that Harris Trust establish programs to assist
women and minorities in job advancement and develop an affirmative
action policy that meets government standards.
   In addition to being the largest back-pay award the federal
government ever has obtained from a single employer, Salem said it
was the largest settlement any government had received under the
presidential order, which was issued in 1965 then-President Johnson.
   ``This settlement represents a major step forward, not only for
the present and former employees of the Harris bank who will benefit
from it but also for all women and minority group workers in the
American labor force,'' the Labor Department's Salem said. ``It is a
major civil rights victory for the federal government.''
   He said the department will supervise the search for former bank
employees entitled to share in the settlement.

   The stock market slipped lower today in active
trading after having posted gains in the previous four sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which edged above the
psychologically important 2,200 mark in the first half-hour of
trading at 2,204.29, quickly retreated and was off 5.71 at 2,193.75
at noon on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumber advancing ones about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 530 issues higher, 706 lower and 566 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.83 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street, up from 68.78 million at the same time Monday.
   Analysts said stock traders were keeping a close eye on the
behavior of the bond market and the currency market. Bond prices
were unchanged to slightly higher in early trading today, while the
dollar remained stable in the foreign-exchange market.
   The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still
trying to digest a large set of stocks dumped on it Monday in a sell
program coordinated by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said Philip Puccio,
manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Puccio said that according to one estimate, the sell program
accounted for about a third of the volume of trading Monday, or
about 55 million shares.
   But the asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance
Investment Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its
involvement.
   ``We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things
beyond the power of mortal men at times,'' said Frank Terrizzi, the
firm's president.

   An Eastern Airlines executive said the company may
have to speed up planned sales of assets after the chairman of the
National Mediation Board halted talks between the carrier and its
largest union.
   ``Clearly, the happenings of this last weekend will make us move
forward faster on some asset sales than perhaps we would have done
otherwise,'' Joseph B. Leonard, Eastern's senior vice president and
chief operating officer, said Monday.
   ``The end of talks is certainly a major disappointment with
serious implications about Eastern's future,'' he added.
   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan charged the
company sabotaged the mediation session with news leaks and was
``determined to force a strike.'' He called management actions
``unethical, without principle, deceptive.''
   Mediation Board Chairman Walter Wallace abruptly ended the talks
Monday and returned to Washington. He said today he stopped the
sessions because the failure to keep negotiations secret undermined
the collective bargaining process.
   ``Media in a fish bowl yields nothing,'' Wallace said in a
statement issued in Washington. ``In such situations, the parties
tend to make proposals and statements aimed at public relations
objectives rather than the bargaining process.'' He did not lay
blame on either side.
   ``The board will continue its efforts to bring the parties
together under proper circumstances where a solution of the labor
dispute can be achieved,'' he said.
   There was no indication of when more talks might be scheduled.
   Meanwhile Monday, the Internal Revenue Service gave Eastern until
Sept. 15 to make $105 million in payments to employee pension plans
that had been due last Sept. 15. Leonard said the company would
finance the payments by pending asset sales.
   Wallace had arrived Friday for the talks in Key Largo aimed at
ending a 15-month contract stalemate that has clouded the future of
the airline, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., which
also owns non-union Continental Airlines.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Miami television stations
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them Friday.
Matell said employee bulletins about the talks that were put out
daily by Eastern and were obtained by reporters weren't a violation
of the news blackout.
   Leonard blamed the breakdown on the union's refusal to set a
deadline for negotiations. Eastern, which says it is losing $1
million a day, has been pressing for a federal declaration of an
impasse that would begin a 30-day cooling-off period. After that,
the union could strike and the company could impose its own work
conditions on the union members.
   ``These talks have dragged on ... draining Eastern's strengths
with each passing day. We desperately need the government to provide
a process to resolve this dispute within 30 days,'' Leonard said.
   The union has claimed Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can
try to bust the union. The machinists also have opposed attempts to
sell parts of the airline, such as the recently agreed $365 million
sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to businessman Donald Trump,
saying the sales also are aimed at breaking the union.
   The machinists, representing 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground service workers that make up more than one-fourth
of Eastern's employees, were seeking a raise of $50 million a year.
The airline was seeking $150 million in concessions, mainly from
non-mechanics.
   Leonard said the machinists were seeking an 8 percent raise,
while Eastern had offered a job-security program guaranteeing no
layoffs and offering job training to enable the non-mechanics to
gain better-paying jobs.
   Bryan said the company's proposals were unchanged, while the
machinists' offer totaled only a 1.9 percent raise over three years.
He said work-rule changes offered by the union would save the
company money overall.
   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three
quarters of 1988.

   The incoming Bush administration gave the
go-ahead today for a high-level advisory panel to begin work in
earnest on a plan to eliminate the huge federal budget deficit.
   Leaders of the National Economic Commission said they had
received word from Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that the
bipartisan panel should plan on meeting a March 1 deadline for
submitting its report.
   Commission co-chairman Drew Lewis made the announcement as the
14-member advisory panel began an open hearing on the deficit
problem.
   There had been discussions with top Bush officials about whether
the president-elect might postpone the commission's report until
Sept. 1. Today's announcement is an apparent indication that Bush
intends to take the panel's recommendations seriously and will give
them weight in his own negotiations with Congress.
   The commission was created by Congress after the October 1987
stock market crash with supporters hoping that the panel, composed
of leaders from government, business and labor, would be able to
break the seven-year deadlock over the federal budget deficit.
   While Bush derided the commission during the presidential
campaign as a stalking horse for a tax increase, his comments since
winning the election have been more favorable, and he has emphasized
he considers reducing the budget deficit as his No. 1 economic
priority.
   Bush's two appointees to the commission, former Sen. Paul Laxalt,
R-Nev., and former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio, a longtime friend,
both attended today's meeting.
   Lewis and commission co-chairman Robert Strauss also met today
with President Reagan at the White House to discuss the panel's work
to date.
   Lewis, a former transportation secretary in Reagan's Cabinet,
said Brady told him that the commission should plan on meeting the
March 1 deadline unless it hears otherwise from Bush once he takes
office Jan. 20.
   While the panel, made up equally of Republicans and Democrats,
has had sharp disagreements over whether taxes need to be raised,
Lewis said he felt it would be able to reach agreement on a deficit
reduction plan by March 1.

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy E. Disney's investment company said
Tuesday it has appealed a Delaware court ruling that dealt a serious
blow to Disney's hostile $2.6 billion effort to buy Polaroid Corp.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc., the investment vehicle for the Disney
family, appealed Monday to the Delaware Supreme Court a Chancery
Court decision upholding Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan.
   The lower court ruling last Friday was seen as a setback to
Disney's takeover effort because the ESOP holds 14 percent of the
instant-camera company and workers have announced their opposition
to the buyout bid. Management also has resisted Disney's advances.
   The matter is before the Delaware courts because Polaroid, while
based in Cambridge, Mass., is incorporated in Delaware.
   Disney, nephew of the late animator Walt Disney, owns 6.8 percent
of Polaroid and has been pressing a hostile buyout offer since July.
Disney's Shamrock is offering $42 dollars a share for Polaroid
stock, or a total of $2.6 billion.
   That offer, which has been extended periodically as the companies
wrangled in court, was extended again on Tuesday, until 5 p.m. EST
Jan. 19.

<HEAD>Economists: Role of U.S. Dollar Shrinking, Yen's Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar's predominance in global financial
dealings is falling as growing economic interdependence within Asia
and other regions increases reliance on the Japanese yen and other
currencies, economists said Tuesday.
   The yen may not replace the dollar as the international official
reserve currency, but trends point to greater use of the yen and
West German mark and a commensurate decline in the dollar's
importance, David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial
Services Inc., said.
   ``There are very compelling arguments why the yen should become
an important international reserve asset,'' Hale said. ``There is a
tremendous mismatch between the yen's importance and the role it
plays in the world economy.''
   Contrary to expectations, Japan has continued to run huge trade
surpluses in spite of a doubling of the value of its currency in
dollars since early 1985. On Tuesday the yen traded at about 126 to
the dollar.
   Japan's $3 trillion gross national product in 1988, the $4
trillion capitalization of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and
international bank assets estimated by the Bank of International
Settlements at $625.8 billion, compared to U.S. assets of $492
billion, are evidence of the dramatic growth in Japan's relative
economic power, Hale said.
   The emergence of Asia as a major region of economic growth is one
reason for the dollar's declining importance as a foreign reserve
currency, said economists attending a conference entitled, ``Task
Force on Pacific Rim Strategies.''
   Trade within the Asian region is growing so quickly that it will
soon overtake trade across the Pacific, said Takashi Hosomi,
chairman of NLI Research and former Finance Ministry adviser.
   ``Trade volume in East Asia totaled $84 billion in 1987 and it is
growing faster than trans-Pacific trade, which totaled $104
billion,'' Hosomi said.
   Japanese banks are increasingly using the yen in international
lending _their foreign loans in yen are estimated at 13 trillion yen
($104 billion), Hale said.
   Japan is the largest lender to a number of Asian countries and
yen loans account for 30 percent of Malaysia's and Indonesia's
foreign debt and 40 percent of Thailand's, he said.
   Growing investment by Japanese firms in factories, office
buildings and other properties in Asia is also expanding the yen's
zone of influence.
   ``It would be logical to expect in the 1990s a regional economic
bloc to emerge around Japan,'' Hale said.
   Economists attending the conference predicted that changes in the
relative importance of the yen and the dollar would be gradual.
   ``I don't think the yen will take the position of the dollar, but
will function to supplement the dollar,'' said Yasuo Kanzaki,
executive vice president of Nikko Securities Co.
   Instead, a number of currencies may be used.
   ``The staggering growth in the volume of international capital
flows makes it much more difficult for a single currency to play
such a significant role as in the past,'' said Lawrence Summers,
economics professor at Harvard University.
   ``I think in the future there will be no reserve currency as we
have known it in the past,'' said Tone Grant, a member of the board
of directors of the Futures Industry Association.
   At the end of 1987, the dollar accounted for 67 percent of
official worldwide foreign exchange reserves, down from 70 to 80
percent in the 1970s, the International Monetary Fund says.
   The yen accounted for 7 percent of world official reserves and
the West German mark for 14.7 percent. The British pound, which
before World War I accounted for 38 percent of official reserves,
now accounts for 2.6 percent.
   ``The yen is likely to reach 14 to 15 percent (of worldwide
official reserves) by the mid-1990s,'' Hale said.
   But a number of factors limit the yen's viability as a reserve
currency, including limits on the number of investment opportunities
in Japan's financial markets and exchange rate volatility, which
discourages the use of yen-denominated contracts in foreign trade,
Hale said.
   More than 35 percent of Japan's export contracts are
yen-denominated, up from 17.5 percent in 1975, and nearly 10 percent
of its import contracts are yen-denominated, up from less than one
percent in 1975, he said.
   But in Britain and West Germany, 80 percent of their exports and
40 percent of their imports are denominated in their own currencies,
Hale said.
   The dollar ``allows better control of risks,'' said Makoto
Utsumi, director general of the Finance Ministry's International
Finance Bureau. He noted that there was no particular reason not to
use the dollar in transactions.
   Utsumi and other Japanese officials were unenthusiastic about the
yen's potential as a reserve currency, explaining that the dollar is
supported by both military and economic power.
   ``The yen's vulnerability is that Japan's strength lies only in
economic power because it lacks a defense capability and natural
resources,'' Hosomi said.
   Nations accumulate international reserves when the combination of
the balance of payments and short-term capital movements is in
surplus. The reserves are used up when the balance of payments and
capital transfer go into deficit.

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner
earned $40.2 million in 1988, mainly in profits from a stock-option
plan, according to company proxy material.
   The disclosure Monday shows that Eisner remains one of the
nation's highest paid executives.
   Eisner realized a $32.6 million profit from the company stock
options program last year and a $6.8 million bonus in addition to
his $750,000 salary, the proxy statement said. Eisner's 1987 bonus
was $6 million.
   Disney also provides Eisner with $3 million in life insurance.
   The studio executive was given the option to purchase up to 2
million Disney shares at $14.54 per share when he joined the company
in 1984. The stock is currently trading above $65 a share.
   The proxy material disclosed that Eisner purchased 683,857 shares
of Disney stock last year. Of that total, he sold 330,390 for a
profit of $32.6 million. He still holds options to purchase an
additional 948,143 shares.
   Eisner now holds 353,467 Disney shares directly, or less than 1
percent of the outstanding shares. His wife and children hold an
additional 28,800 Disney shares.
   Under Eisner's leadership, Disney has enjoyed a string of hit
movies and increased revenues at its theme parks.

   The stock market slipped lower today in fairly
active trading after having posted gains in the previous four
sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which edged above the
psychologically important 2,200 mark in the first half-hour of
trading at 2,204.29, quickly retreated and was off 7.41 at 2,192.32
at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumber advancing ones about 11 to 8 on the
NYSE, with 570 issues higher, 787 lower and 555 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 103.44 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said stock traders were keeping a close eye on the
behavior of the bond market and the currency market. Bond prices
were unchanged to slightly higher today, while the dollar rose again
in the foreign-exchange market.
   The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still
trying to digest a large set of stocks dumped on it Monday in a sell
program coordinated by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said Philip Puccio,
manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Puccio said that according to one estimate, the sell program
accounted for about a third of the volume of trading Monday, or
about 55 million shares.
   But the asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance
Investment Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its
involvement.
   ``We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things
beyond the power of mortal men at times,'' said Frank Terrizzi, the
firm's president.
   RJR Nabisco topped the list of most active issues on the New York
Stock Exchange, rising | to 94~.
   Eastman Kodak was down [ at 44], General Electric was down ] at
44\ and NWA, the parent of Northwest Airlines, was up 1\ at 54~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.42 at 157.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.13 at 312.41.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf &amp; Western Inc. said Tuesday its profit rose
11 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter and 8 percent for the year,
paced by record performances in its finance and
publishing-information businesses.
   The company, which also owns Paramount films and has sizeable
television operations, said it earned $144 million, or $1.21 a
share, in the three months ended Oct. 31 compared with $130 million,
or $1.05 a share, in 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter edged up 2.1 percent, to $1.49 billion
from $1.46 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, the company earned a record $384.7 million, or
$3.21 a share, from $356.1 billion, or $2.88 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 8.5 percent, to $5.1 billion from $4.7
billion in 1987.
   Chairman Martin S. Davis said the company's finance arm,
Associates Corp. of North America, had record earnings for the 12th
consecutive year reflecting higher finance charge revenue, an
increase in mortgage lending and increased sales of insurance
products.
   Operating income also rose from publishing and information
services because of advances in consumer publishing and
international operations. The company owns Simon &amp; Schuster,
Prentice-Hall and Pocket Books.
   He said educational publishing matched last year's performance
despite higher development costs for new products aimed at the
secondary and elementary school markets. Operating income from
higher education rose because of strong sales of college textbooks.
   Entertainment operations contributed significantly to the
company's 1988 results, Davis said.
   Gains in television operations and higher box office results from
its Canadian theater chain more than offset a drop in motion picture
earnings and lower exhibition income resulting from the sale of a 50
percent interest in its U.S. theater operations, he said.
   He said the films ``Coming to America'' and ``Crocodile Dundee
II'' posted strong domestic box office performances, while foreign
film revenue rose as a result of the success internationally of the
films ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``The Untouchables,'' ``Beverly Hills
Cop II'' and ``Crocodile Dundee II.''

   Share prices finished slightly higher Tuesday on
the London Stock Exchange after an uneven day that saw sharp
movements in several speculative stocks.
   Dealers reported a good level of business, despite a significant
leveling off of excitement after Monday's rally, which was fueled
mostly by speculation of an imminent bid for Britain's General
Electric Co. PLC.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended with a
gain of 4.5 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,836.0.
   At its lowest level in the session, the 100-share index was down
2.9 points at the beginning of the day but by midafternoon had risen
to show a 6.1 point gain.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 1.5 points at 1,503.5
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.33 points
to close at 1,033.53.
   Volume declined a bit to 563.5 million shares from Monday's 589.7
million shares.
   The potential bid for GEC, estimated at around 7 billion British
pounds, or about $12.4 billion, would be the largest takeover ever
seen on London's Stock Exchange.
   The bid speculation gained force over the weekend when Lazard
Brothers and Co. revealed a company had been formed to devise a
proposal ``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC. Plessey
Co., itself the target of a 1.7 billion pound ($3 billion) bid from
GEC and West Germany's Siemens AG, is believed to be participating
in the consortium.
   GEC fell 1.5 pence (3 cents) to finish at 219.5 pence ($3.89) on
Tuesday. Plessey was unchanged at 226 pence ($4).

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished higher against most major
currencies in hectic European trading Tuesday as the market shrugged
off reported light central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the
European day, after opening at lower levels in the wake of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German
Bundesbank on Monday.
   Traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 1.8300 West German
marks for most of the day, but gathered their courage late in the
European session after noting that the Bundesbank had been absent
from the open market.
   The dollar's rise above 1.8300 marks was met by Fed intervention
at around the 1.8315-mark level, dealers said. They said the
intervention was largely ignored because it was followed by comments
from Beryl Sprinkel, the White House chief economic adviser, who
questioned the validity of central-bank intervention.
   ``People are seeing the Fed intervention as a market challenge,
rather than a barrier,'' said one trader.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 125.70. Later, in London, it
was quoted higher at 126.30 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7643 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7650 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8355 West German marks, up from 1.8245; 1.5645 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5555; 6.2555 French francs, up from 6.2300; 2.0589 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0575; 1,338.50 Italian lire, down from 1,339.75;
and 1.2012 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1955.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $404.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $402.75.
   In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid $405.10 an ounce,
compared with $402.75 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 5 cents to close at a bid
$407.23 an ounce.
   Silver bullion in London to a late bid price of $5.98 a troy
ounce, compared with Monday's $5.94.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Recommends Curtailing Deposit Insurance</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: DELETES last 2 grafs pvs, which were mistakenly attributed to

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration today recommended
curtailing deposit insurance for bank and savings and loan accounts
and said the public will have to bear much of the estimated $100
billion cost of restoring the S&amp;L industry to health.
   The White House Council of Economic Advisers, in President
Reagan's final economic report, said reducing protection for
depositors would cause them to more closely ``monitor the financial
health'' of the institutions holding their money.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is working on an
S&amp;L plan for the administration of President-elect Bush, said in a
statement released through Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, senior
Republican on the House Banking Committee, that ``curtailing deposit
insurance is not an option and will not be considered.''
   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said a
gradual reduction in the $100,000 insurance limit may be considered
as part of the overall solution to the thrift crisis. However, he
added, ``lowering the amount of deposit insurance is a very serious
matter, not a matter to be thrown out as a trial balloon.''
   Although Reagan's report did not address the question, Beryl W.
Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said that as part
of the insurance curb, institutions should be required to publicly
disclose more information about their financial condition.
   The administration also sharply criticized S&amp;L regulators for
``postponing the day of reckoning'' in their rescues of failed
institutions.
   But the top regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, defended his agency's year-end spree of
savings and loan bailouts as cheaper than shutting the failed
institutions down and paying off depositors.
   Wall, a Reagan appointee, said at a briefing outlining his
testimony today before the House Banking Committee that his agency
rescued 75 institutions in December at a cost of $16.3 billion to be
spread out over 10 years.
   Tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the government an
additional $4 billion over 10 years.
   The alternative to the rescues _ liquidating the S&amp;Ls and
shutting them down _ would have required $47 billion in ``up-front
cash,'' far more than is available immediately to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Wall said.
   By selling off the property of the failed S&amp;Ls, regulators
eventually would have recouped all but $22.8 billion on the December
transactions, he said.
   The board supervises nearly 3,000 federally insured S&amp;Ls.
   Both banks and S&amp;Ls are failing in numbers not seen since the
Great Depression. Reagan's report noted that the problems will be
``one of the major challenges for the next administration'' under
President-elect Bush.
   While Reagan placed much of the blame on regulators, the
administration's own record has come under fire as well. Critics
point out that the administration refused to pay for additional S&amp;L
examiners while the problem was developing.
   In the final Reagan budget, released Monday, the administration
called for spending $64 billion on S&amp;Ls through 1994 and
acknowledged for the first time that it does not have enough money
coming in to handle the cleanup.
   Citing the 1980 decision by Congress to boost the limit on
deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000, Reagan's economic report
said reducing the ceiling ``would restore much-needed discipline to
the system.''
   ``The scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantly
curtailed,'' it said. However, it did not recommend a specific
limit, nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply to
existing deposits or only to future deposits.
   Deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individuals
with a safe place for their money, but it ``also dramatically
reduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financial
health of their bank,'' the administration said.
   It was particularly critical of regulators' de facto policy of
guaranteeing deposits above the insurance limit in large
institutions.
   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, said her organization does not support rolling back
limits on deposit insurance, but believes the current $100,000
ceiling should be enforced to expose depositors to some risk.
   With virtually all deposits now protected, ``the depositor has no
incentive to be careful with his or her dollars,'' she said.
   ``The system has become a license for abuse for some financial
managers,'' she added. ``Before we change the current system ... we
should try to make the current system work efficiently by allowing
greater market discipline.''
   Jon Brown, director of the Ralph Nader-sponsored consumer group
Bank Watch, said rolling back insurance limits would encourage more
discipline in the system,but should be part of a broader program to
more strictly regulate banks and savings and loans.
   The recommendation contradicts a study released last week by the
FDIC, which concluded that deposit insurance should be preserved at
current levels. FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said regulators
have been unwilling to tolerate the risk to the banking system of
forcing losses on depositors at large institutions, even those whose
funds exceed the insurance limit.
   Noting estimates of the S&amp;L problem ranging up to $100 billion,
the Council of Economic Advisers said ``a large portion of the
payment of this bill will need to come directly from the public.''
The rest will be levied indirectly on consumers through fees charged
banks and S&amp;Ls, it said.
   It also said ``most regulatory actions taken so far merely serve
to postpone the problem ... (and) will sharply increase costs to the
general public.'' S&amp;L regulators' practice of guaranteeing new
owners of rescued S&amp;Ls against losses for up to 10 years weakens the
incentive to manage efficiently, it said.
   Wall, at the briefing Monday night in advance of his testimony
today, cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreading
out the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money for
liquidations.
   First, he said, the bank board stops the operating losses at the
rescued institutions. Second, it eases the need for the institutions
to pay above-market interest rates to attract depositors. That in
turn eases the pressure on still-healthy S&amp;Ls to compete by raising
their rates.
   Wall said the December spending spree left the FSLIC board with
$3 billion at yearend. He said the insurance fund would maintain a
balance of $1 billion to $3 billion through 1989, but he revealed
that a crunch, requiring additional borrowing, may arise in less
than two years.
   In 1987, Congress authorized the bank board to borrow $10.6
billion by selling bonds through September 1990. It has borrowed
about half that so far.
   When the remaining bond authority runs out and if Congress does
not provide alternate funding, Wall said the bank board may have to
issue special ``premium anticipation notes,'' which will be paid off
with revenue the board expects to collect over the next 30 years.
   Including the December pledges, the bank board last year
committed more than $38 billion to resolve the cases of 205
institutions. Wall declined to say how much more his agency had left
to promise, but he said, ``We could do another $16 billion
comfortably.''

<HEAD>Indonesian minister says possible overproduction not a problem yet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overproduction by some members of OPEC
has not become a problem yet as the cartel voluntarily cuts output
to raise prices, Indonesia's oil minister said Tuesday.
   Responding to press reports of alleged overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates, Ginandjar Kartasasmita said OPEC has not
confirmed that the UAE is violating its quota even though he said
the reports should be taken seriously.
   ``Some members may have a reason for overproducing and (cutbacks)
may have to be done gradually. This is permitted by OPEC. What is
not permitted is to put this (overproduction) on the market,''
Kartasasmita told reporters.
   He said a meeting of an eight-member subcommittee of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries charged with
monitoring compliance with the new quota system would be obligatory
if overproduction occurred, but he indicated a meeting would not be
held before February.
   ``We are barely two weeks into the accord and we cannot know what
production will be for January,'' he said.
   OPEC agreed last November to limit production to 18.5 million
barrels a day starting Jan. 1.
   A scheduled meeting of the subcommittee, to which Venezuela and
Indonesia both belong, is set for March.
   Kartasasmita said OPEC will seek cutbacks from a group of
independent producers in a joint meeting Jan. 26 that need not
amount to the 15 to 20 percent reduction OPEC is imposing on its
members.
   ``We don't ask for that much. It's up to them to decide how much
they want to cut. We are not demanding anything, but any cut will
help,'' the minister said.
   He said that OPEC would not be able to reach its price aim of $18
per barrel without total member compliance and without cooperation
from non-OPEC producers.
   He said Indonesia is estimating its average price this year at
$14 a barrel as part of a government policy to wean the island
nation from its dependence on oil income.
   Kartasasmita arrived in Caracas Monday for a five-day official
visit which has included talks with Venezuelan Energy Minister Julio
Cesar Gil and Venezuelan president-elect Carlos Andres Perez.
   He said Indonesia supports Perez' proposal for a summit of OPEC
heads of state in 1990, the year of OPEC's 30th anniversary.
   The two countries are exploring technical cooperation in oil
between the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina and Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. and increasing bilateral trade in non-oil goods.
   Kartasasmita plans to visit OPEC member Ecuador and independent
producers Colombia and Mexico following his scheduled Friday
departure from Venezuela.
   Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2, is scheduled to visit
Iran, Iraq and United Arab Emirates next week to drum up support for
an OPEC summit.

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. expects a more than tenfold increase
in two years in the number of autos it produces in the United States
and imports to Japan, Honda President Tadashi Kume said Tuesday.
   Last year, Japan's No. 3 automaker imported to Japan 5,385
two-door Accord coupes made at its Marysville, Ohio, plant. It was
the first time Honda imported cars it produced in the United States.
   Honda expects to import about 4,600 Accords this year from the
United States, ``but by 1991, when we plan to sell 800,000 autos in
the domestic (Japanese) market, we plan to import 50,000 cars from
Ohio,'' Kume told a news conference.
   Honda, which sells more cars in the United States than any other
Japanese manufacturer, will produce about 360,000 cars in the United
States this year, but increase production in Canada from 50,000 to
80,000, Kume said.
   Honda expects to sell 800,000 autos in the United States this
year, including imports, up from 769,000 in 1988, a U.S. spokesman
said.
   Japanese automakers still experience difficulties in selling cars
in the United States because of the high value of the yen, Kume
said. The yen has doubled in value against the U.S. dollar since
1985, making Japanese products more expensive overseas.
   Kume said Honda would increase the number of dealerships in the
United States to 1,300, but did not give the present number.
   Honda's total auto production in Japan this year is expected to
be 1.41 million, up 8.3 percent. About half of those are exported,
and this year Honda expects to sell 685,000 cars in Japan, 10.9
percent more than last year.
   Production of the five-door Concerto developed jointly with
Britain's Austin Rover Group will begin this fall, and the cars will
be sold in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, Kume said.
   He said the Japanese government's decision Tuesday to continue
limiting auto exports to the United States would not affect Honda,
which fell short of its quota last year.
   ``Whether (the quotas) are continued or abolished, I don't expect
a change in the number of vehicles shipped to the United States,''
he said.
   Honda is Japan's third-largest automaker after Toyota and Nissan.
Toyota produced 4.22 million cars in Japan and abroad in 1988 and
expects to make 4.41 million this year. Nissan produced about 2.73
million autos last year and plans to make some 2.91 million this
year.
   Honda, the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles, began
making motorbikes in 1948 and diversified into building cars in
1963. Last year was also the first time Honda began importing to
Japan the 1,500-cubic centimeter Goldwing motorcycles it builds in
Marysville.
   It will sell 1 million motorcycles in Japan this year, up 9.8
percent, and export 560,000, a 12 percent increase, Kume said.

<HEAD>NY Financial Sector Jobs Decline First Time in Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jobs in financial services, one of the engines of
growth in the metropolitan economy, declined in New York City for
the first time in more than a decade during 1988, according to a
yearend review that shows the nightmare of Black Monday has yet to
fade in the Big Apple.
   The area encompassing New York City and northeastern New Jersey
experienced job growth in almost all other industries, but at the
slowest rate in the past six years, the federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported Tuesday.
   Between December 1987 and October 1988, the region added 99,000
jobs for a total of 8.22 million, said Samuel I. Ehrenhalt, regional
commissioner of the bureau.
   The increase represented an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent,
compared to the national growth rate of 3.4 percent, he said.
   New York City's overall gain was less than 1 percent in 1988, or
23,000 new jobs _ proof that the city's ``economy has clearly lost
momentum in the aftermath of the (October 1987) stock market
crash,'' Ehrenhalt said.
   ``Jobs on Wall Street declined by 12,000 after adding an average
of 11,000 jobs a year in the prior five years, a period in which the
securities industry accounted for a fourth of all job growth in the
city's private economy.''
   But area unemployment rates were mostly lower than the national
average, according to Ehrenhalt's review.
   Joblessness in the region was 3.9 percent for the first 10 months
of 1988, down from 4.5 percent the previous year.
   Only Hudson County in New Jersey, with 6.4 percent, was higher
than the national rate of 5.6 percent.
   Eight of the 23 counties of the region were below 3 percent
unemployment and three of them _ Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset in
New Jersey _ were below 2{ percent.
   New York City showed an 18-year low in joblessness, 4.9 percent
for the first 11 months of 1988. The decline was across the board,
reflected in better figures regardless of race, sex and age.
   But Ehrenhalt added that the lower rates ``primarily reflect
cutbacks in the number of job seekers.''
   Nationally, about 66 percent of the working age population is
active in the job market, but in New York City the figure is only 55
percent, he said.
   Another exception to the general job expansion in the region was
blue-collar factory work. Manufacturing here continued its
decades-old decline, falling to a post-World War II low of 1.17
million jobs in the 23-county metropolitan area, Ehrenhalt said.
   The slowdown in growth was least pronounced in the New Jersey
portion of the metropolitan area, Ehrenhalt said.
   In northeastern New Jersey, private sector employment increased
by 2.1 percent last year, compared to 3 percent the previous year,
but it still amounted to 42,000 added jobs. Public hiring also
picked up slightly.
   Long Island and the suburban counties north of the city added
16,000 jobs, a 1.1 percent increase, but far below the growth of the
previous four years.
   The region covered by Ehrenhalt's report takes in the five
counties of New York City and the New York state counties of plus
Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam, plus the
New Jersey counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex,
Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union.

   An attorney for Sam Walton, the nation's
richest man and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., on Tuesday sought
to repeal an $11.5 million fine against his client in connection
with a personal injury suit.
   The motion filed in 352nd District Court argues that the
sanctions violated a stay issued by the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals
and Walton's constitutional rights of appeal.
   ``This unreasonable ruling must be reversed. When a judge enters
an order so patently wrong, the party suffereing the abuse should be
vindicated at the very first opportunity,'' attorney Vic Anderson
said in the motion.
   The issue surfaced this summer when Walton was asked to give a
deposition in a lawsuit filed by Andrew Carrizales of Houston
against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand. Carrizales claims that
while shopping at the company's Sulphur Springs store in 1986 he
slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on the floor.
   When Walton failed to provide testimony, former 352nd District
Court Judge John Street ordered him to appear in Fort Worth for a
deposition. But the Texas Supreme Court said Street's ruling was a
clear abuse of discretion.
   Street modified his order and required Walton to submit to a
videotape deposition at the company's headquarters in Bentonville,
Ark. Walton refused and Street imposed sanctions against him for
violating the modified order.
   Fines began at $10,000 on Nov. 28 and reached $1.28 million
before dropping back to $1 million a day. Walton eventually showed
up for a deposition in Fort Worth on Dec. 15.
   However, Anderson says the 2nd Court of Appeals in Fort Worth
granted a stay of Street's order five days after it was issued Nov.
18. The stay dissolved on Dec. 12 and Walton showed up two days
later.
   Walton is currently listed as the nation's richest man by Forbes
magazine, with a net worth of about $6.7 billion.

   The stock market slipped lower today in active
trading after having posted gains in the previous four sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which edged above the
psychologically important 2,200 mark in the first half-hour of
trading at 2,204.29, quickly retreated and was off 7.67 at 2,191.79
an hour before the close.
   Declining issues outnumber advancing ones about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 560 issues higher, 848 lower and 531 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 119.77 million shares as of 3
p.m. EST.
   Analysts said stock traders were keeping a close eye on the
behavior of the bond market and the currency market. Bond prices
were unchanged to slightly higher in early trading today, while the
dollar remained stable in the foreign-exchange market.
   The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still
trying to digest a large set of stocks dumped on it Monday in a sell
program coordinated by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said Philip Puccio,
manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Puccio said that according to one estimate, the sell program
accounted for about a third of the volume of trading Monday, or
about 55 million shares.
   But the asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance
Investment Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its
involvement.
   ``We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things
beyond the power of mortal men at times,'' said Frank Terrizzi, the
firm's president.
   Among active issues on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR Nasbisco
was up | at 94~, International Business Machines was down | at 121],
Eastman Kodak was unchanged at 44{ and NWA, the parent of Northwest
Airlines, was up 1{ at 55[.
   Sun Microsystems was among the most active over-the-counter
issues, declining } to 16. Digital Equipment unveiled workstations
that compete with Sun's.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.53 at 157.62. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.26 at 312.28.

<TEXT>
   Business executives expect profits to fall during
the first quarter of 1989, with retailers in particular less
optimistic about sales following the lucrative holiday season,
according to a survey released Tuesday.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., a leading business-information marketer,
said its quarterly poll of 1,500 executives found expectations about
the economy were lower for the first three months of the year than
the last quarter of 1988 and the same period a year earlier.
   But Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician
for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, said the current outlook is better than it
appears.
   ``Expectations for first-quarter sales are down only slightly and
we are coming off a 4-year high in terms of expectations for higher
profits,'' Duncan said.
   ``Our fourth-quarter survey ... indicated that retailers were
looking ahead to a strong holiday sales period, so the current
results suggest they expect consumers to take a breather after the
Christmas selling season.''
   Duncan added that among manufacturers, sales expectations
remained at historically high levels as companies continue to
benefit from opportunities in export markets.
   The latest survey was conducted in November.
   Overall, the report said Dun &amp; Bradstreet's sales optimism index
fell slightly for thefirst quarter, to 68 from 70 in the fourth
quarter of 1988. But among retailers, the index plunged to 57 from
72.
   The index of expectations for higher profits among retailers also
fell sharply to 53 from a 4-year high of 69 in the fourth quarter.
The overall index declined to 60 from 67.
   In the category for prices, the overall index declined one point
to 41. However, wholesalers indicated they planned to raise prices
in the first quarter, with the index rising to 45 from 37.
   The overall employment expectations index rose to 24 from 22,
largely due to a modest gain among manufacturers. Expectations among
retailers and wholesalers remained essentially unchanged.

   Wheat and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower while corn futures finished narrowly mixed Tuesday in a quiet
session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The markets opened mostly lower, then rallied early in the
trading session in reaction to lighter-than-expected rain in
Argentina, the world's fourth-largest soybean producer.
   ``But that (rally) kind of faded as the day went on,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of the
British-owned trading company LIT America Inc. ``It was a very, very

   Gidel said he expected traders to begin focusing Wednesday on the

report will include final 1988 crop production figures, estimates
for 1989 planted acreage and new supply-demand statistics.
   At the close of trading, wheat was \ cent to 2 cents lower with

<HEAD>Digital Unveils New Workstations, PCs, And Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. rolled out a
long-expected line of computer workstations and personal computers
Tuesday, including the first high-powered machine that does not
belong to its Vax line.
   Analysts said the most significant product was the DecStation
3100, a fast workstation for scientists, engineers and financial
analysts that will compete with models from Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Apollo Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and others.
   The DecStation 3100 is a breakthrough because of its speed and
because it cannot run software written for Digital's Vax computer
line. It runs a version of Unix, an industry-standard operating
system.
   ``Up until this point they have maintained that the Vax
architecture is the be-all and end-all of the computer world,'' said
Gregory Cline, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ``I
think it's a smart move,'' Cline said.
   The DecStation 3100, which Digital billed as ``the world's
fastest desktop workstation,'' begins at $11,900. Cline and other
analysts said Digital's leadership claim is probably valid, but said
Digital could itself be leapfrogged soon by companies such as Sun.
   Digital also introduced a line of slower workstations that do run
its Vax operating system and a line of industry-standard personal
computers made to its design by Tandy Corp. However, the personal
computers are not capable of using DEC Windows, so programs that run
on the PCs will not look the same as programs running on other
Digital computers.

   The Consumer Electronics Show drew the curtain
on its winter show Tuesday after unveiling a dazzling array of
electronic gadgetry, releasing buoyant sales figures and fielding an
olive branch from the movie industry.
   ``Exhibitors tell us this was the most crowded show they've ever
seen,'' CES spokeswoman Cynthia Saraniti said. ``They're all happy.
They're all writing business. They think it's been a tremendous
success.''
   Ms. Saraniti said members of the industry see 1989 as ``a very
good year. The exhibitors are extremely optimistic.''
   The health of the industry is a reflection on the economy in
general since most of those exhibiting their wares here depend on
the discretionary income of consumers.
   Industry officials are predicting $31.645 billionin factory sales
in consumer electronics goods in 1989, up 5 percent from 1988
figures.
   A record 1,430 exhibitors spent four days touting wares ranging
from camcorders and computers to TVs, video games and adult flicks.
   Attendance for the show is expected to range between 80,000 and
90,000, Ms. Saraniti said. Final figures are due Wednesday.
   Higher attendance figures have been announced in past years, but
Ms. Saraniti said this is the first year actual attendance has been
checked against pre-registration.
   Products at the 1989 show covered 776,000 square feet of display
space _ an area the size of 19 football fields.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, told the convention Sunday that the VCR industry, once
viewed as a virus by the movie industry, now is seen as a tonic.
   He called for ``cooperative collaboration'' between the movie and
electronics industry, and said the two should join in the fight
against film pirating.
   A major focus at this year's show was home automation, which
allows home electronics products and utilities to ``talk'' to each
other. The new system has been described as a ``communications
pathway throughout the home.''
   One scenario for the new system would allow a homeowner to check
electronically his or her home security system at night, locking
doors, turning off lights, turning down the thermostat _ all from
controls in the bedroom.
   ``We've developed a language which allows your appliances to
speak with and control one another,'' CES spokesman Tom Lauterback
said. ``Items such as cellular phones will allow you to start your
appliances at any time, any place,'' Lauterback said.
   Another highlight of this year's show was the growing home office
equipment industry.
   CES officials say 20 million Americans are working out of their
homes, bringing a boom in a wide range of products from facsimile
machines to telephones, copiers and other equipment.
   Industry officials say more than 26 million telephones were sold
in the United States last year.
   Murata, which hopes to capture 18 percent of the growing fax
market, showcased a number of machines _ pushing a model selling for
$899.
   Ricoh featured a hand-held copier, the MC50, that scans the
original and copies any point desired. A companion interface module
turns the MC50 into a facsimile transceiver, with the unit acting as
a scanner for the original material being transmitted or received
via telephone.
   Smith Corona featured a word processor with a feature known as
Address Merge, which enables the user to merge a list of names and
addresses with a standard letter.
   Franklin Computer featured an electronic dictionary, thesaurus
and phonetic spelling corrector including more than 83,000 words.
Known as the Language Master 4000, the user enters a word the way it
sounds. The unit then displays the definition of the word, the parts
of speech, hyphenation points and inflected forms of the word. The
unit also pronounces the word.
   Health and fitness continued to be a major interest at the show.
   Casio introduced what it called the world's first electronic
pedometer. The watch is touted to give accurate readings of caloric
consumption during workouts. Casio says that unlike mechanical
pedometers, the new EXW50 will automatically adjust to the type of
exercise being performed, such as jogging, aerobics, etc.
   Audio-video was again a big draw, with industry officials
predicting Americans would buy 20 million color TV sets in 1989.
   Companies went to great lengths to gain an edge with dealers and
distributors who will be putting their products on display shelves
this year. Pioneer showcased a $10,000 car audio-video system in a
$295,000 hand-built Gambella Avalanche sports car.
   Tyco introduced Hot Lixx, a computerized electric guitar that
allows players to use a series of buttons in lieu of strings,
creating their own musical sounds.
   Acclaim introduced a series of video games including Airwolf,
after the television series, and Nightrider, which involves
``driving'' a car to 20 different cities.
   Atari announced it would bring out 20 new game titles in the
first quarter of 1989.
   Nintendo Entertainment and Broderbund Software introduced
U-FORCE, a video game controller that eliminates all physical
contact between player and machine such as the traditional joysticks
or buttons.
   Saitek Industries, which has an electronic chess game, revived
another old standard, introducing an electronic checkers game.

   The stock market edged downward today after four
consecutive gains, falling short of the 2,200 mark on the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks.
   The Dow Jones industrials crept above 2,200 for a fourth
consecutive session before dipping below the psychologically
important mark.
   The strength of the dollar and the bond market continued to
provide some support to stocks.
   The U.S. dollar finished higher against most major currencies in
hectic European trading Tuesday as the market shrugged off reported
light central-bank intervention. Long-term bond prices were slightly
higher and yields on Treasury bills dipped.
   However, interest-bearing investments, especially in the
short-term money market, remain a strong competitive threat to
stocks because of their attractive yields.

<HEAD>IBM To Buy 25 Percent Of Fiber Optics Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. will buy 25
percent of a fiber-optics company owned by Corning Glass Works, the
companies said Tuesday in a signal of the growing importance of
fiber to the computing world.
   The value of the deal was not disclosed.
   PCO Inc., a 175-employee company based in the Chatsworth area of
Los Angeles, specializes in devices that convert electronic signals
to light and vice versa.
   Until now, fiber optics have been used mainly for long-distance
telephone lines. IBM's investment signals the company's idea that
the speed permitted by fiber optics will be useful in the computer
field, spokesman Paul Bergevin said today.
   Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., made an additional investment in
PCO and will keep a 65 percent interest in the company. The
remaining 10 percent will be owned by PCO employees, founders and
other individuals.
   Instead of using wires, computer users are beginning to connect
clusters of personal computers and workstations with high-capacity
fiber-optic cables, said John Kessler, president of Kessler
Marketing Intelligence in Newport, R.I.
   ``That market grew about 100 percent between 1987 and 1988 and
will continue very heavy growth over the next five years,'' Kessler
said.
   A longer-range goal is to use fiber optics inside computers to
connect chips, and even to use light signals on chips, but PCO is
probably not well-equipped in that area, Kessler said.

<HEAD>Compromise Predicted for Cable Operators, Local Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable operators and broadcasters, both fearing
phone company intrusion into their businesses, could reach a
compromise early this year on requiring cable systems to carry local
TV stations on their channels, the cable industry's chief spokesman
said Tuesday.
   ``The instant we get the signal from Congress, we will be at the
table, and we have every reason to believe the negotiations will not
need to be protracted,'' said James Mooney, president of the
National Cable Television Association.
   The Federal Communications Commission had required cable
operators to include all local broadcasters in their service areas
on their channels until 1985, when the regulations were struck down
by the courts as unconstitutional.
   At the time, some cable systems faced the prospect of having to
give up other programming because of a plethora of new broadcasters
consuming their channel capacity.
   The cable association and the National Association of
Broadcasters agreed on new ``must carry'' regulations that basically
would have reserved up to one-fourth of a cable system's channels
for local broadcasters, but it, too, was struck down by the courts.
   Because of the court's rulings and the FCC's reluctance to tackle
the issue again on its own, any compromise providing some kind of
legal mandate for cable access for local broadcasters will likely
require a congressional mandate, Mooney said.
   Legislation to do that was considered by the last Congress but it
ended up getting held hostage to President Reagan's vetos of bill
reinstating the ``Fairness Doctrine'' that the FCC repealed in 1987
and regulating the type and amount of advertising on shows aimed at
children.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, already has introduced a new bill to reinstate
the Fairness Doctrine requiring broadcasters to cover issues of
public importance and reflect differing views on those issues in
their programing.
   Dingell said last week that he also was willing to tackle the
``must carry'' issue again when Congress begins work after the
inauguration.
   However, it is not clear yet whether the ``must carry'' cable
measure that broadcasters want will be handled alone or as part of a
package that includes the Fairness Doctrine and restrictions on
children's advertising, both of which broadcasters oppose.
   Industry officials said Dingell and other lawmakers may try to
pass the Fairness Doctrine and children's advertising measures first
to see how President-elect Bush reacts before considering the cable
access issue.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC on Tuesday
completed its $5.7 billion acquisition of Pillsbury Co. and named
Ian Martin chairman and chief executive officer of the food and
restaurant company.
   Martin, who since 1986 has headed Grand Met's U.S. operations,
replaces Philip L. Smith, who has resigned from Pillsbury after
joining the company in August.
   With the completion the deal, Pillsbury becomes a wholly owned
subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan PLC, a distilling, gambling and
specialty products conglomerate. Martin will move to Minneapolis,
where Pillsbury will keep its downtown headquarters, according to a
statement from the British company.
   Grand Met on Oct. 4 launched a hostile $60-a-share tender offer
for Pillsbury, which resisted the buyout bid. The company's board of
directors also rebuffed a sweetened $63-a-share tender offer from
Grand Met and in December negotiated a friendly deal for $66 a
share, all cash.
   Martin is a director of Grand Met. Besides Pillsbury and its
Burger King subsidiary, Martin is responsible for Grand Met's
Express Foods Group International of London and Alpo Petfoods of
Allentown, Pa., the company said.
   Martin joined Grand Met in 1979 and was chairman of the company's
brewing and retailing division. He previously held executive
positions with the Timex Corp., PA Management Consultants and ITT in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.
   Smith was wooed to Pillsbury from the top post at General Foods
Corp. He departs Pillsbury with an executive compensation package
valued at nearly $8 million.

<TEXT>
   Japan will continue voluntary restraints in its auto
exports to the United States for the eighth straight year, the
Japanese trade minister said Tuesday.
   Although Japanese car exports to the United States have been
below the self-imposed quota of 2.3 million autos annually, Japan
will keep the restraints in place, Minister of International Trade
and Industry Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said.
   The government is not convinced that auto exports have
permanently declined, Mitsuzuka told a news conference.
   Japanese auto exports to the United States in fiscal 1987, which
ended in March 1988, were 2.21 million, and shipments from
April-November were 10.4 percent below a year earlier, Mitsuzuka
said.
   ``However, if we removed the quota, we are concerned that there
are companies which are aggressively marketing in the United States,
and a declining tendency doesn't seem to be stabilized yet,'' he
said.
   He left open the possibility that the quota could be removed in
the middle of the forthcoming fiscal year if the ministry decides
that the decline is not reversing.
   Japanese automakers had little reaction, saying tersely that they
would accept the measures.
   ``The decision to extend the voluntary restraints was made by the
two governments in consideration of current U.S.-Japan trade and
economic relations,'' said Shoichi Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor
Corp., Japan's largest automaker, and chairman of the Japan
Association of Auto Manufacturers. ``It is a decision we will abide
with.''
   Nissan and Honda, the country's No. 2 and No. 3 auto
manufacturers, have fallen short of their export quotas, but Toyota
has been fulfilling its estimated 450,000-500,000 car share annually.
   The automakers do not release their actual quota figures.
   Free trade is desirable and the quota system has lost its
original significance, but the matter must ``be studied in the frame
of U.S.-Japan relations as a whole. ... We believe the government
made its conclusion taking this into consideration,'' said Nissan
President Yutaka Kume.
   Some U.S. lawmakers insist that Japanese cars built in the United
States should also be counted as imports. But Mitsuzuka told
reporters that by 1991, the local content of U.S.-made Japanese cars
would be 75 percent, ``and we regard them as American-made cars.''
   Japanese makers produced 733,000 cars in the United States from
January-November 1988, up 23.2 percent from same period of 1987,
according to the Foreign Ministry.
   Last year Japanese news reports said the trade ministry would
lift the export quota because it was outdated, but that idea was
abandoned because of concern about giving Washington the wrong
impression at a time of rising protectionist sentiment in the United
States.
   The quota system dates from 1981, when Japan was under strong
pressure from the U.S. government and American automakers to cut
Japanese exports and allow the U.S. auto industry to retrench and
restructure. Japan agreed to limit its annual exports to the United
States to 1.68 million vehicles through 1983, then to 1.85 million
in 1984.
   When U.S. President Ronald Reagan decided not to ask for
continued restraints in 1985, Japan set the ceiling at 2.3 million
and has maintained that figure.

   The dollar finished higher Tuesday against most
major currencies in global foreign exchange trading despite what
dealers described as light dollar-selling by the Federal Reserve.
   Gold prices were mixed, falling in New York after rising in
Europe. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold as

late bid.
   Currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the
European day, after opening lower in the wake of central bank
intervention on Monday.
   Traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 1.8300 West German
marks for most of the day, but gathered courage late in the European
session after noting that the West German Bundesbank had been absent
from the open market.
   The Fed appeared to have intervened after the dollar edged toward
1.8325 marks late in the morning session in New York and reappeared
to sell dollars again at midafternoon when the currency drifted up
to about 1.8375 marks, according to Daniel Holland, vice president
at Discount Corp. in New York.
   ``The move was not concerted because the other central banks had
already gone home for the day,'' Holland said.
   But he said the market wanted to know whether the Fed wanted to
curb a rise in the dollar and found, ``The Fed does mean to be
here.''
   The dollar's rise also was encouraged by reports of comments by
Beryl Sprinkel, the White House chief economic adviser, who
questioned the validity of central-bank intervention.
   Holland said the dollar's rise came mainly on speculative
activity by professionals traders buying to cover earlier promises
to sell the dollar rather than ``real corporate demand for the
dollar.''
   ``We have some people throwing in the towel here, saying it
doesn't look like it's coming down,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.39 yen to 125.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar
was quoted at 126.30 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 126.325
yen from 125.975 yen on Monday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound, which
fell to $1.7643 from $1.7650 late Monday. The dollar also rose
against the pound in New York, where sterling fell to $1.76475 from
$1.77325 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.83525 West German marks, up from 1.82025; 6.2505
French francs, up from 6.2420; 1.5650 Swiss francs, up from 1.54995;
1,344 Italian lire, up from 1,335; and 1.20285 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.19935.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday,
included: 1.8355 West German marks, up from 1.8245; 1.5645 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5555; 6.2555 French francs, up from 6.2300; 2.0589
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0575; 1,338.50 Italian lire, down from
1,339.75; and 1.2012 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1955.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $1.10 to $403.80 a troy ounce.
   Earlier in the day, gold rose in London to $404.75 a troy ounce
from $402.75 late Monday; climbed to $405.10 an ounce in Zurich from
$402.75 late Monday; and edged up 5 cents an ounce to $407.23 in
Hong Kong.
   Silver for current delivery slipped 4.7 cents an ounce to $5.916
an ounce on the Comex in New York. Earlier in London, silver rose to
$5.98 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $5.94.

   Stock prices edged lower Tuesday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks crept above the 2,200 barrier for a
fourth straight session only to finish below the mark again.
   The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2,193.21, a decline of 6.25
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
621 up, 816 down and 543 unchanged.
   Traders said the market seemed to be catching its breath after
having advanced in every session of 1989 except the first, setting
three post-crash highs in the process.
   The stock market is only slightly below where it stood right
before the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. The session before
its 508-point plunge, the Dow Jones industrial average had closed at
2,246.74.
   There was no major economic news affecting the stock market
Tuesday, although stocks got continued support from bonds and the
dollar.
   The dollar rose in spite of reports of continued dollar-selling
by the Federal Reserve, which is trying to restrain the currency's
rise. The dollar's strength helped buoy bonds, which finished
slightly higher.
   Nevertheless, high interest rates, particularly for short-term
instruments, remain an attractive alternative to stocks.
   The Dow Jones industrials cracked 2,200 during the trading day on
Thursday, Friday, Monday and again Tuesday before retreating each
time.
   ``There's always been a slight tendency of the market to view
century marks as psychological barriers,'' said Robert S. Robbins, a
market strategist and technical analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in
Atlanta.
   The stock market was somewhat sluggish because it was still
trying to digest stocks dumped on it Monday in a big sell program
coordinated by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said Philip Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   The asset manager rumored to be behind the sale, Renaissance
Investment Management Inc. of Cincinnati, declined to comment on its
involvement.
   ``We are variously accused or ascribed as having done things
beyond the power of mortal men at times,'' said Frank Terrizzi, the
firm's president.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.42 million
shares, down from 163.18 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.10 million shares.
   Among active issues on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR Nasbisco
rose | to 94~, International Business Machines fell ~ to 121[,
Eastman Kodak was unchanged at 44{ and NWA, the parent of Northwest
Airlines, rose 1} to 55].
   Sun Microsystems was among the most active over-the-counter
issues, declining { to 16\. Digital Equipment unveiled workstations
that compete with Sun's.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the overall market fell $5.200 billion, or
0.19 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.30 to 157.85.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.71 to 324.33, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell 0.60 to 280.38.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.69 to 384.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 312.95, down 0.59.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Dive On Arbitrage and Harvest-Linked Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices dropped sharply Tuesday on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid heavy arbitrage selling and
rumors of large export shipments from the Ivory Coast, the world's
largest cocoa producer.
   On other markets, coffee futures rallied; precious metals
declined; energy, grain, soybean, livestock and meat futures were
mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Cocoa settled $56 to $73 lower with the contract for delivery in
March at $1,352 a metric ton.
   The decline _ the fourth in as many sessions _ was partly a
result of arbitrage selling linked to the dollar's gain in value
against the British pound, analysts said.
   When the dollar increases in value against the pound, as it did
on Tuesday, cocoa traders can profit by selling cocoa futures for
dollars in New York and buying the same amount of cocoa futures for
pounds on the London Terminal Market.
   Further selling was prompted by rumors of a large number of
shipment declarations by the Ivory Coast, which until recently had
been withholding its top-quality cocoa from the market in hopes of
forcing prices higher, analysts said.
   ``The market turned bearish on sentiments that near-term
availability of Ivorian cocoa could be up substantially from what it
has been recently,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in New York with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   She said the world cocoa harvest was at its peak with production
expected to outweigh demand for the fifth straight year.
   A rumored deal among the Ivory Coast, the French government and a
large French trade house to withhold Ivorian cocoa from the market
is increasingly being perceived as a bearish factor, since it will
only add to the surplus overhanging the market, analysts said.
   New York Coffee futures managed a modest rally after two days of
steep losses. Coffee settled 1.98 cents to 2.59 cents higher with
March at $1.5048 a pound.
   Gold futures extended their slide to five days and silver made
new life-of-contract lows on New York's Commodity Exchange in quiet
selling linked to the dollar's strength.
   But analysts said gold's refusal so far to test the
psychologically important level of $400 a troy ounce was encouraging
for bullish players. Gold for spot delivery on the exchange finished
the day at $403.80.
   ``With the market that close (to $400), it would be easy enough
to challenge it,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Gold futures settled $1 to $1.10 lower with February at $405.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.7 cents to 4.8 cents lower with March at
$5.995 a troy ounce.
   Wheat and soybean futures ended mostly lower while corn futures
finished narrowly mixed in a quiet session on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   The markets opened mostly lower, then rallied early in the
session in reaction to lighter-than-expected rain in Argentina, the
world's fourth-largest soybean producer.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2 cents lower with March at $4.46} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.89{
a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March at
$2.39 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 4 cents lower with
January at $8.02{ a bushel.
   Energy futures finished narrowly mixed amid a lack of new
supply-demand developments on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower
with February at $17.69 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent lower to
.03 cent higher with February at 53.86 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .06 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at
47.91 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
buoyed by higher cash markets, while pork futures finished mixed in
a choppy session marked by weakening supply-demand factors, analsyts
said.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent to .47 cent higher with February at
74.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .65 cent higher
with January at 85.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower
to .43 cent higher with February at 46.17 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.10 cents lower to .15 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lower at 283.20. Each point is
worth $500.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. may announce the winning bid for its
lucrative Canadian subsidiary, Texaco Canada Inc., as early as this
week although company officials continued to refuse comment on the
deal Tuesday.
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri said the company could neither
confirm nor deny that Monday was the closing date for accepting bids.
   Analysts have said the sale of Texaco Canada could fetch up to $4
billion for its parent company, or more than $5.5 billion if an
offer is made to all shareholders. Texaco owns 78 percent of Texaco
Canada, the fifth-largest oil company in Canada.
   Maneri said the company had signed an agreement to keep the
bidding confidential and could not disclose details of the proposed
sale.
   ``We have said the bidding is progressing satisfactorily,''
Maneri said. ``But we're not confirming or denying anything else.
We're just not commenting.''
   Among the Texaco Canada assets up for sale, according to Texaco
Canada spokesman Brian Hay, are approximately 100,000 barrels per
day of natural gas and crude oil properties mainly in Alberta; a
95,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Nanticoke; a 15,000 barrel-per-day
refinery in Halifax; and 1,800 service stations located across
Canada with 10-12 percent of the retail market.
   On Tuesday, Texaco Canada shares closed at $38 a share in
composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, down slightly from
$38.25 on Monday. Last Thursday, Texaco Canada's stock reached the
$38 mark, its highest level in a year, after climbing 87{ cents.
   Meanwhile on the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco Inc.'s shares
closed at $53.12{, up from $53 on Monday.
   Texaco began accepting bids for the Toronto-based oil company
last August. Analysts speculate that since then the field of
possible bidders has narrowed considerably.
   Imperial Oil of Toronto, owned 69 percent by Exxon Corp., has
been widely named as a possible bidder. Calgary-based Husky Oil _
jointly controlled by petrochemical giant Nova Corp. of Calgary and
Union Faith of Hong Kong _ has a long-standing interest in Texaco
Canada. Neither company would comment on whether a bid was made.
   Bond Corp., owned by Australian tycoon Alan Bond, and Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of the Netherlands have also been touted as
possible suitors.
   ``Any of the national oil companies of other countries
(Venezuela, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) that are being talked about
might be a fit,'' said oil analyst Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co. in
Calgary.

<HEAD>TW Services Rejects Coniston Offer to Ease Conditions of Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TW Services Inc. said Tuesday it had rejected an
offer by Coniston Partners to ease the conditions on Coniston's $1.4
billion bid for the food services company.
   TW Services said its chairman, Frank L. Salizzoni, sent a letter
to the New York-based investment firm, refusing to take any action
on the company's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense and refusing
to waive a requirement that a takeover must be approved by the TW
Services board.
   Last week, Coniston said it would no longer insist on winning
approval from the board before continuing with its offer if TW
Services dropped the poison pill, either voluntarily or by court
order.
   In his letter, Salizzoni reiterated TW Services' skepticism about
the sincerity of the Coniston bid and said the company would not
consider any action on the poison pill ``until such time as your
`offer' has become firm and it is absolutely clear you are committed
to acquiring the company.''
   Augustus K. Oliver, a principal of Coniston, called TW Services'
response ``an unfortunate continuation of the same attitude that the
board has expressed so far to our offer.''
   ``It's something we find very difficult to understand,
particularly in the fact that almost 88 percent of the stock has
been tendered to us,'' Oliver said.
   ``It doesn't stop us from proceeding,'' he it
considers the embargo to have been broken. This paper has told AP it
plans to release its story for Wednesday AM editions.
   Thus we are making the story, AM-Smoking Report, available for
immediate release. It will move shortly.

<HEAD>K mart Loses $73 Million Breach of Contract Judgment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discount retailer K mart Corp. breached
its contract with a wholesaler clothing buyer and must pay $73
million in damages, a federal jury decided Tuesday.
   After four months of testimony, the six-person jury deliberated
for 8{ hours before returning the verdict to U.S. District Judge
Ronald R. Lagueux.
   ``We were disappointed,'' said Robert Stephenson, a spokesman at
K Mart headquarters in Troy, Mich. ``We plan to appeal the verdict
on the basis that the judge made a number of substantial errors in
judgment during the trial.''
   Fashion House charged that K mart ignored a 1983 agreement
requiring the retailer to purchase 85 percent of its name brand and
designer label apparel through the wholesaler.
   K mart canceled the four-year contract in April 1986, shortly
after Fashion House filed suit against it for unpaid commissions.
   Robert W. Steele, a K Mart attorney, told the jury the contract
was canceled not because of the impending lawsuit, but because
Fashion House repeatedly failed to obtain the name brand merchandise
the retailer wanted.
   He said the stock K mart received came in broken lots, odd sizes
and unattractive colors, and that the retailer lost $45 million in
its Designer Depot stores, which Fashion House stocked almost
exclusively.
   Fashion House attorney Richard Sharfman said that by 1984 K mart
had already begun to ignore the terms of the contract and was
purchasing more than 15 percent of its clothing directly from
manufacturers.
   Steele did not address the argument of K mart's breach of
contract by buying directly from the manufacturers, but called the
plantiff's request for $80 million in damages ``an outrageous
exercise in greed.''
   The jury awarded Fashion House $30.7 million for unpaid
commissions, $28.7 million for wrongful termination of contract, and
ordered K Mart to pay $13.6 million in interest on the award.
   ``The jury has vindicated Fashion House'', Sharfman said.
   He had argued that his client's buying acumen helped turn K mart
around in the early 1980s, bringing in the brand names that helped
boost apparel sales and profits.
   K Mart had $25.6 billion in sales in fiscal 1987. In late
December it owned 2,265 K Mart stores, 1,231 Walden Books, 266
Payless drugstores and 133 Builders Square stores.
   The Pawtucket-based Fashion House, which dealt almost soley with
K Mart, went out of business in 1986, Sharfman said. At its peak in
1983, it had $188 million in sales and 100 employees in New York and
Pawtucket.

<HEAD>Pan Am Puts Profitable Unit Up for Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp., strapped by losses from its main
airline subsidiary, announced Tuesday that it has put another,
profitable unit up for sale.
   Pan Am said its board of directors has decided to sell the
company's World Services subsidiary, which markets security,
maintenance and other services to government agencies and other
airlines.
   World Services had revenue of $550 million and pretax profit of
$23 million in 1987, Pan Am said in a statement. Financial analysts
estimate the unit's potential sale value at around $200 million.
   The flagship airline unit, Pan American World Airways, continues
to drain the company's finances. World Airways' net loss of $54.7
million in the first nine months of last year contributed heavily to
the parent's net loss of $21 million on revenue of $3.2 billion in
the same period.
   The sale of World Services ``will sharply improve Pan Am's
working capital position,'' said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst
for investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``This is their
negative cash flow period.''
   Pan Am's Northeast shuttle service and Pan Am Express, a commuter
airline, also are considered profitable operations. But they are
more closely tied to World Airways than is the World Services unit.
   Eastern Airlines recently sold its shuttle service, which
competes with Pan Am's, to real estate developer Donald Trump for
$365 million in cash.
   Some analysts wondered whether the World Services move
represented a new Pan Am strategy to sell performing assets rather
than strip away parts of loss-making World Airways, such as routes
and airport facilities.
   But Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler said the decision to sell
the unit is based on the recognition that ``our primary business is
the airline business.'' The company considers the Pan Am Shuttle and
Pan Am Express to be part of that business, he said.
   Kriendler said the sale of World Services has been under
discussion by Pan Am management for several months, as a way to help
finance its planned investments for the near future. Those
investments include $61 million for improvements at World Airways'
main terminal at Kennedy International Airport in New York, $25
million for refurbishing aircraft interiors, $20 million for
improvements in information systems and other programs, Pan Am said
in the statement.
   To finance the projects, Pan Am also will use the $115 million
payment it got recently from Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft
consortium. Pan Am decided to scrap a firm order for 16 Airbus A320s
in exchange for the payment.
   The 16 planes originally intended for Pan Am were included in a
$3.5 billion deal announced last Wednesday by regional airline
Braniff Inc., which will acquire 50 A320s and take options on 50
more. The deal nearly tripled the size of Braniff's fleet.
   Analysts expect potential buyers of World Services to be service
companies rather than airlines, with aerospace company Lockheed
Services rumored to be one of the interested parties.
   Last July, United Airlines sold its United Airlines Services
Corp. to Flight Safety International, which runs training programs,
for an undisclosed amount.
   ``It's a wide open kind of thing; there are lots of concerns that
could be interested,'' said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   Kriendler confirmed that the World Services unit would likely be
sold to a non-airline company.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the National Mediation Board on
Tuesday blamed news leaks for scuttling the talks he led between
Eastern Airlines and its largest union.
   However, Walter C. Wallace wouldn't say what he'll do about
company calls for an impasse declaration or a warning from the
international Machinists president of a potential ``nationwide
disruption of service.'' Wallace also didn't lay blame for the end
of the talks.
   Wallace abruptly left Key Largo, Fla., Monday on the fourth day
of intense talks he set in hopes of resolving a 15-month-old
contract dispute between Eastern and its 8,500-member Machinists
union.
   In a statement from Washington, Wallace said he stopped the
sessions ``because the prearranged conditions planned and necessary
to the success of such talks were compromised, undermining the
collective bargaining process and mediation by the (National
Mediation Board.)''
   Wallace said bargaining ``in a fish bowl yields nothing. In such
situations, the parties tend to make proposals and statements aimed
at public relations objectives rather than the bargaining process.
The board will continue its efforts to bring the parties together
under proper circumstances where a solution of the labor dispute can
be achieved.''
   Mediation board officials declined comment, but gave no sign they
would declare an impasse. That would start a 30-day deadline, after
which the union could strike and Eastern could impose its own work
conditions.
   Union leaders charge that Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it
can try to break it and bust the union. Eastern says deadline
pressure is needed to get the negotiations moving.
   The mediation board, which received the case in January 1988,
could schedule more talks, declare an impasse, or ask both sides to
submit to binding arbitration. Both sides would have to agree to
arbitration.
   Machinists District 100 leader Charles E. Bryan on Monday charged
that the company sabotaged the talks by refusing to make any new
offers and by putting out what he called deceptive employee
bulletins that were easily obtained by the news media.
   Eastern officials denied they had done anything wrong.
   Meanwhile, reporters obtained a Jan. 3 letter to Wallace from
William W. Winpisinger, Washington-based international president of
the Machinists.
   Winpisinger's letter complained about the pressure being put on
the mediation board by Eastern, its Texas Air Corp. parent and
Eastern supporters. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, the Greater Miami
Chamber of Commerce and editorials in leading newspapers have called
for declaration of an impasse.
   Winpisinger countered by saying the international union would
support Eastern Machinists, if necessary, with ``self-help against
Eastern Airlines and ... secondary activity against a number of
other major carriers.
   ``...The responsibility for a nationwide disruption of service
will be laid at the doorstep of Eastern Airlines and its allies in
this dispute because it has adamantly refused to make any
counteroffer whatsoever to the proposals of the IAM,'' Winpisinger's
letter said.
   The Machinists represent workers at Trans World Airlines, USAir,
United Airlines and Northwest Airlines. Winpisinger was out of town
Tuesday and couldn't be reached for comment.
   Eastern, meanwhile, reportedly has been trying to sell some of
its planes, its airport gates in Philadelphia and some Canadian
routes, on the heels of the recent sale of its Northeast shuttle
service to developer Donald Trump for $365 million in cash.
   ``Clearly, the happenings of this last weekend will make us move
forward faster on some asset sales than perhaps we would have done
otherwise,'' Joseph B. Leonard, Eastern's senior vice president and
chief operating officer, said Monday.
   Also on Monday, the Internal Revenue Service gave Eastern
permission to reschedule $105 million in pension payments due last
Sept. 15. Eastern now has until Sept. 15 of this year to finish
making periodic payments into the employee pension plans. Leonard
said the payments would be financed by pending asset sales.
   Eastern, saying the money-losing carrier's survival is threatened
by failure to reach a settlement with the Machinists, again called
for declaration of a 30-day deadline. The company estimates losses
at $1 million a day.
   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, have
been some $200 million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500
mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground service workers, or
more than one-fourth of Eastern's employees, were seeking a $50
million raise, the company said.
   Eastern was seeking $150 million in concessions, mostly from the
non-mechanics, but said it was offering job security and training
programs.

   Holly Farms Corp. said Tuesday it was
extending indefinitely its previous deadline of Wednesday for
receiving new bids from two companies that have offered to buy the
food processor.
   Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark., has been trying to take
over Holly Farms since October and has offered $60 a share for Holly
Farms stock.
   Holly Farms has tried to resist Tyson's advances by agreeing to a
merger with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., but that agreement has been
put on hold by a Delaware court.
   Holly Farms announced last week that its board of directors would
consider additional offers from Tyson and ConAgra at a meeting
Wednesday. Other bidders are free to make offers too, but Holly
Farms said no others are expected.
   Ted Bailey, a Holly Farms spokesman, said consideration of new
bids has been delayed because of request by Tyson for additional
business information on Holly Farms.
   ``A revised schedule for the submission of final bids will be
announced after the (board) meeting,'' Bailey said.
   Tyson's latest bid is worth some $1.06 billion in cash, while
Holly Farms' proposed merger with ConAgra calls for a stock swap
worth about $1 billion.
   ConAgra has refused to say if it will counter Tyson's bid.
   Tyson Foods is the nation's largest poultry processor while Holly
Farms is a diversified company depending heavily on fresh fryer
sales.

<HEAD>Settlement: People Express Agrees to Pay Former Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said Tuesday it would settle
a class-action lawsuit against its People Express unit by paying
more than $8.5 million to former shareholders of the discount
airline.
   The lawsuit charged that People Express expanded recklessly, then
concealed its deteriorating operating and financial condition from
investors.
   People Express was bought by Houston-based Texas Air Corp. in
early 1987 and was merged into the Continental Airlines unit of
Texas Air, which also owns Eastern Airlines.
   People Express no longer exists except for legal and financial
purposes.
   The settlement calls for lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court
of Chancery and in federal court in New Jersey to be dropped,
Continental spokesman Dave Messing said.
   The lawsuits were brought on behalf of all people who purchased
or otherwise acquired securities of People Express Inc. or People
Express Airlines Inc. from Sept. 1, 1984, through Dec. 30, 1986.
   Class members will be paid out of a fund consisting of $5 million
in notes and $3.5 million in cash plus interest on the cash accrued
since Aug. 17, 1987.
   The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including the
entry of a final order from the federal court, which will review the
fairness of the settlement.

<HEAD>Cable TV System Sales Show Demand Still Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estimated $2 billion price being paid for two
large cable television systems shows the market for cable remains
surprisingly strong despite the recent spate of systems for sale.
   Media analysts and brokers say the market is likely to remain
bullish because the industry's days of heaviest construction
spending are over and deregulation has given cable systems more
freedom to raise basic rates.
   Also supporting system prices is the trend of advertisers
spending more on cable and the expectation that more homes will sign
up for cable service.
   For the moment, these concerns appear to be outweighing the
perceived risks that telephone companies may be allowed to compete
in the cable business and that Congress could step in to break up
the bigger cable system operators.
   Some of the new owners are also bringing a new frame of reference
to the cable business that is likely to fuel more efficient growth,
analysts say.
   ``We have a business that was driven by engineers that is just
now starting to be run by managers and marketers,'' said John Waller
III, president of the media brokerage firm Waller Capital Corp.
   That is likely to be a plus, he said, especially as systems make
technological improvements that make it easier for subscribers to
take additional services, such as pay-per-view programming.
   In the latest deals in the cable business, Cooke Cablevision Inc.
and the New York Times Co. announced separately Monday that they
have agreed to sell cable television systems in transactions
estimated to value nearly $2 billion.
   The New York Times Co. said it is selling its system in southern
New Jersey for $420 million to a concern that will be managed by a
minority investment group. With 162,000 subscribers, the price came
to about $2,600 per subscriber.
   Investor Jack Kent Cooke, who controls Cooke Cablevision,
declined to reveal the sales price of his cable systems, which have
about 700,000 subscribers and are being sold to a consortium of
cable companies.
   But published reports citing unidentified sources in the
purchasing group put the sale price at $2,100 to $2,200 per
subscriber, or about $1.5 billion.
   The reason Cooke got less per subscriber for his holdings than
the Times did, analysts said, is that his properties are scattered
over 19 states.
   The number and value of cable system sales has risen as the
industry consolidates and some owners capitalize on the values being
placed on systems.
   Paula Greer, who works for the media research firm Paul Kagan
Associates Inc. of Carmel, Calif., said 407 deals were announced in
the first 11 months of 1988 worth $13.2 billion, up from 399 deals
worth $9.5 billion at the same point in 1987.
   The average price per subscriber was $1,971 in the 1988 period,
up 16.5 percent from the $1,692 per subscriber average reported in
the same 1987 period, she said.
   Ms. Greer said the market for cable systems appears to have
leveled off at a price-per-subscriber of between $2,000 and $2,500
for the better systems.
   ``We have reached a plateau and probably will stay there halfway
through next year as people get comfortable with it,'' she said.
   Michael Kupinski, media analyst for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, said the industry can look forward to revenue growth of
12 percent a year over the next few years with 5 percent coming from
higher rates, 5 percent from subscriber growth and 2 percent from
growth in ancillary services, such as advertising.
   He said basic rates rose by an average of 18 percent in 1987 and
11.5 percent in 1988, the first two years since deregulation. But he
said operators are apt to limit future rises because of ``public and
congressional concern over dergulated cable rates.''
   Nielsen Media Research estimated that 53.8 percent of the 90.4
million American television households subscribed to cable last
November.
   Kupinski said ``although the easy subscriber growth from wiring
the nation is behind the industry,'' operators should be able to
expand the number of subscribers further with more aggressive
marketing.
   Kupinski said advertising on cable systems rose 41 percent to
$230 million in 1987 from the previous year, and said cable's low
cost relative to commercial television, improved ratings and its
attractive audience makeup should push ad revenue up 25 percent a
year to nearly $1 billion by 1993.
   On the downside, the analysts say, are uncertainty about whether
the former Bell System telephone copmpanies will be allowed to
compete in the cable business, creating more competition for cable
systems.
   They also said it is uncertain whether a consumer backlash over
higher rates will prompt Congress to require some of the bigger
multi-system owners to divest some of their holdings.
   But Kupinski noted even if size limits on cable companies were
introduced, ``cable companies would be expected to seek acquaitions,
concentrating on properties near existing operations.''

<HEAD>Hasbro Agrees to Sell Competitor's Toys Overseas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc.'s agreement to market a
competitor's toys overseas is a case where everybody wins, a toy
industry analyst says.
   Hasbro and View-Master Ideal Group announced an agreement this
week under which Hasbro will sell View-Master products in most of
Western Europe, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.
   ``It's one of those rare deals where no one is the loser,'' said
Sean McGowan, toy industry analyst for Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. of New
York.
   The agreement probably will yield less than $10 million this year
for Hasbro, which has annual sales of about $1.3 billion, said
Alfred J. Verrecchia, executive vice president.
   Although it is a very small proportion of Hasbro's business,
``It's added sales volume without any real increase in cost,''
Verrecchia said. ``It should be profitable for us.''
   View-Master benefits from Hasbro's broader overseas sales force,
which should boost its revenues while helping the company cut costs
to reverse losses, said Marvin Schmalzreid, View-Master's chief
financial officer.
   View-Master, based in Beaverton, Ore., lost almost $7 million, or
$1.48 a share, in the nine months ended last Sept. 30.
   Under the deal, Hasbro will distribute the Magna Doodle magnetic
drawing toy, which is View-Master's most popular product, and gets
to choose what other product it wants to distribute, Schmalzreid
said.
   View-Master makes the View-Master 3D Viewer, a staple of the toy
industry for 50 years. It also makes chemistry sets, Dunk-It
child-sized basketball sets and various games.
   The agreement comes almost a year after both companies briefly
discussed a merger, then broke off talks.
   Under the deal, Hasbro will buy View-Master products and resell
them. Hasbro will make additional payments based on sales volume.

<HEAD>Unisys Indictment Charges Dismissed, Predecessor Sperry Charges Remain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed charges
holding Unisys Corp. responsible for a predecessor's actions but
retained the case against the original firm, Sperry Corp., and a
retired Air Force colonel, according to documents filed Tuesday.
   The charges against Unisys were dismissed by the U.S. District
Court in Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 29, two months after Unisys and
Sperry were indicted.
   The government alleged the former Sperry Federal Information
Systems Division had falsely billed the government for $501,600 for
work that was never performed as part of a eight-year, $526 million
contract to modernize the Air Force's computer network.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina left intact the indictment
against Sperry and retired Ar Force Col. Robert L. Hedges, 51, of
Montgomery, who oversaw the computer project for the Air Force
before his retirement in 1984.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Al Agricola said federal prosecutors were
unsure how to prosecute Sperry because the company no longer exists,
having been absorbed in a 1986 merger with Burroughs Corp.
   The court noted that although Unisys will not be held liable for
Sperry's actions, the company may have to pay fines.
   Hedges is charged with negotiating a consulting job with Sperry
while he was overseeing the contract from Gunter Air Force Base in
Montgomery, according to U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson.
   Hedges, who was under contract to Unisys at the time of the
indictment, is no longer employed by the company, according to
company officials.
   Unisys spokeswoman Charlotte LeGates said the corporation was
``gratified that the court confirmed the important distinction
between Unisys and a predecessor company in connection with events
that preceded the merger.''
   A copy of the court's opinion dismissing the Unisys charges was
filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according
to LeGates.
   ``In this case, Unisys Corp., which was not even formed until
over two years after the alleged criminal conduct, could not be
culpable therefore and, thus, should not be held criminally
liable,'' the judge ruled.
   The judge said Sperry was incorporated in Delaware and, under the
laws of that state, Sperry ``would survive the merger for purposes
of pending criminal actions.''
   LeGates said company officials were unclear as to the amount of
fines and whether Unisys would have to pay a fine levied against
Sperry.
   She said Unisys would continue to contest the federal charges,
but Rod Nachman, a Montgomery attorney representing Unisys, said
Dubina's order closes the case as far as his client.
   Agricola said the statute of limitations has expired in the case
and no new indictments can be issued. He said Sperry has not been
arraigned and no trial date has been set.

   Wrapping up a 2{-month labor racketeering trial,
a federal prosecutor argued Tuesday that Teamsters union President
Jackie Presser and two associates embezzled $700,000 to pay
``friends or cronies'' who did no union work.
   In closing arguments to jurors in U.S. District Court, prosecutor
Stephen Jigger stressed the role of Presser's associates in the
alleged embezzlement scheme. Presser died in July, more than two
years after his indictment in the case.
   Harold Friedman, a Teamsters international vice president and
Ohio's most powerful Teamster, and Anthony Hughes, Teamsters Local
507 recording secretary, have been on trial since Oct. 24.
   An attorney for Friedman argued that his client is a dedicated
labor leader who would not participate in such a scheme.
   ``The defense would have you believe all this was Jackie
Presser's responsibility,'' Jigger said. ``Poor, powerless Harold
Friedman, living in the fear of Jackie Presser. I submit to you that
the evidence in this case indicates not only what Jackie Presser did
but also what Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes did.''
   The trial included testimony from 80 witnesses, many of whom were
asked detailed questions about day-to-day Teamsters operations.
   Pretrial documents included revelations about Presser's role as
an FBI informant, saying he provided the bureau with information
about the union and alleged links to organized crime.
   Presser was the fourth of the last five Teamsters international
presidents to be indicted; he had inherited the job from Roy
Williams when Williams was sent to prison for conspiring to bribe a
U.S. senator.
   But his declining health caused repeated postponements of the
trial, and his death from brain cancer left only Friedman and Hughes
as co-defendants.
   Friedman, 66, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering,
two of embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the Labor
Department. He is president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters,
leader of Teamsters Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio and president
of both Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery Workers Local 19 in Cleveland.
   Hughes, 52, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and
one of embezzlement. The government contends Hughes was a ``ghost
employee'' at Bakery Workers Local 19, which is affiliated with
Teamsters Local 507 and shares an office with it.
   The case will go to the jury after closing arguments are
completed and U.S. District Judge George W. White issues
instructions on the law.
   ``The evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by Harold
Friedman, Anthony Hughes and Jackie Presser for the benefit of their
friends and cronies in the amount of $700,000,'' Jigger said.
   During the trial, Friedman testified that Presser had
unquestioned power at Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland, where he
served as secretary-treasurer even while he was international
president.
   Defense lawyer Paul Cambria, representing Friedman, said in his
closing statement that Friedman puts in long hours of work for his
members and that his participation in a scheme to embezzle members'
money ``just doesn't make any sense.''
   ``I ask you not to be misled,'' Cambria said. ``You must
determine whether my client was a thief. Jackie Presser is gone.
Whether it had a lot to do with him or not is another story. My
client is on trial, not Jackie Presser.''
   Friedman said Presser hired John A. ``Jack'' Nardi Jr. and George
Argie, who were portrayed by the prosecution as ``ghost employees''
who did no union work.
   ``Now he (Friedman) would have you believe all that power resided
in a dead man and that he was a powerless subordinate,'' Jigger
said. ``You can't blame Jackie Presser when it's your job, your
responsibility and you knew it.''
   Jigger reviewed the testimony of three of the alleged ``ghost
employees'' _ Allen Friedman, no relation to Harold Friedman; Argie
and Nardi. Each testified he was paid and did little work, if any.
   The defense contended that Nardi and Argie were hired by Presser
and did whatever he wanted them to do; that Hughes worked; and that
Allen Friedman often was too ill to work.
   Jigger noted that Nardi was the son of a reputed organized-crime
figure in Cleveland with labor union ties, that Argie was a known
gambling figure and a Hughes acquaintance, and that Allen Friedman
was Jackie Presser's uncle.
   John R. Climaco, Presser's former attorney, has said that
Presser's defense, had he lived to stand trial, would have been that
the FBI authorized him to hire the ``ghost employees'' to enhance
and protect his status as an FBI informant.
   But government prosecutors contend Presser couldn't have been
authorized to hire ``ghost employees'' because they were working as
early as 1972 and Presser didn't become an FBI informant until 1977.
Harold Friedman's attorney said last week that Presser was a
government informant in 1963.
   The prosecution called former FBI agent Robert S. Friedrick, who
was Presser's contact at the agency, but he was jailed for contempt
of court after refusing to testify.

<TEXT>
   Residential Resources Mortgage Investments Corp.,
a real estate investment trust, filed for reorganization under
federal bankruptcy laws Tuesday and announced the resignations of
its top officers.
   The filing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankrupty code allows
Residential Resources to reorganize its finances while being
protected from creditors' claims.
   The firm, which went public in late June, ran short of cash
because of rising interest rates and shackles imposed under certain
loan agreements, according to a statement issued by Morgen-Walke
Associates, a public relations firm representing Residential
Resources.
   The release said Residential Resources fell $13 million behind in
the collateral requirements of one lender and suffered a $6 million
loss when another lender sold part of the collateral for its loan
agreements with Residential Resources.
   Edward Nebb, a Morgen-Walke employee, declined to identify the
lenders.
   All of Residential Resource's top executives have resigned, and
the company is being run by an outside board of directors, Nebb said.
   The firm's officers were: chairman and president James C.
Marshall; vice president Joseph M. Corrigan; and chief financial
officer Roger F. McMahon.
   Residential Resources' stock was traded on the American Stock
Exchange. Based on Monday's price of about $7.50 per share,
Residential Resources was worth about $50 million. However, the
Washington-based National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts said the firm had a book value of $800 million, with
shareholders' equity worth $68 million.
   A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is an investment vehicle
in which small investors participate in a portfolio of real estate
assets managed by a trust such as Residential Resources.
   Residential Resources sidestepped the usual investment pattern
for a real estate trust firm, said Chris Lucas of the association.
   Lucas said the Arizona company had invested in the residual
interest in collateralized mortgage obligations and the equally
risky, principal-only, mortgage-backed securities.
   ``They did a lot of different things than even the REITs that
invest in CMO-residuals do, and Residential Resources has been much
more highly leveraged than most CMO-residual REITs,'' he said.
   CMOs are bonds secured by collateral on pools of home mortgages.
   ``They are a volatile instrument,'' Lucas said. ``Potentially,
they return big yields, but along with that comes a higher risk.''

<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., citing a $2.8 billion
restructuring plan it adopted to fight a hostile takeover bid, said
Monday its 1988 third-quarter earnings dropped 75.8 percent.
   Interco reported net earnings for the three months ending Nov. 30
of $10.5 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with $43.4
million, or $1.05 per share, for the same period the previous year.
   The furniture and apparel retailer and manufacturer said its
pretax earnings were reduced by $21.8 million in interest charges
and $14 million in restructuring costs.
   Interco has estimated that costs associated with the
restructuring _ undertaken to thwart the hostile takeover bid by
brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington, D.C. _ will exceed
$65 million.
   The company said its sales from continuing operations totaled
$683.3 million, compared with $680.8 million a year earlier.
   Interco, which last week sold its Londontown Corp. clothing
subsidiary for $178 million, still holds 10 apparel companies, five
retail stores, four footwear companies and four furniture
subsidiaries.
   The company plans to sell off all but its Converse Inc. and
Florsheim Shoe Co. subsidiaries, Broyhill Furniture Industries Inc.
and Lane Co. furniture companies and possibly the Central Hardware
home-improvement stores.
   Interco reported earnings of $76.08 million, or $2.02 per share,
for the nine months ended Nov. 30, down from $108.39 million, or
$2.57 per share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales totaled $1.95 billion, up from $1.91 billion in the same
period of 1987.

<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. set a deadline of Wednesday
for bids for the company in hopes of ending the battle for the
chicken processor.
   In a letter to Tyson Foods Inc. and ConAgra Inc., Holly Farms
said its board would meet Wednesday to consider buyout offers and
make a recommendation to stockholders.
   Ted Bailey, a Holly Farms vice president, told the Omaha
World-Herald in a story printed Monday the deadline was an effort
``to bring this process to a conclusion.''
   ConAgra, of Omaha, and Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., have made
separate proposals for Holly Farms.
   Last fall, Tyson offered to buy Holly Farms for $54 a share, or
$977 million. Later, to ward off the hostile offer, Holly Farms
agreed to be acquired by ConAgra in a stock swap valued at $1
billion.
   Tyson increased its offer Friday to $60 a share, or $1.06 billion.
   The winner would emerge as the nation's top chicken processor.
Tyson holds the lead, with 14.1 percent of the market, and ConAgra
is second, with 9.5 percent. Holly Farm's share is 6.6 percent.
   Under Holly Farm's agreement with ConAgra, the Omaha company
would exchange between 1.875 and two shares of its stock for each of
Holly Farm's common shares. The proposal is valued at $59.25 a share.
   ConAgra also would have been given the opportunity to buy nearly
half of Holly Farm's assets _ a transaction valued at more than $400
million _ if the acquisition were not completed.
   Tyson filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court last month
challenging that provision, called an asset lockup option. The court
agreed with Tyson, blocking the asset lockup, as well as $15 million
Holly Farms agreed to pay as a termination fee if the acquisition
weren't completed.
   In its letter, Holly said its board would consider Tyson's
$60-a-share offer ``together with any further proposal that either
Tyson or ConAgra might wish to make.''
   A spokesman for ConAgra in Omaha declined to say whether the
company will make a new offer.
   Holly urged stockholders not to make any decision until after its
board had met and made its recommendation.
   Bailey said companies other than ConAgra and Tyson ``would have a
right to make a legitimate offer,'' but he said he didn't expect any
other offers.

<TEXT>
   PacifiCorp announced the completion of its
merger with Utah Power &amp; Light, saying UP&amp;L shareholders would be
notified next week about swapping their shares for stock in the new
company.
   The merger announced Tuesday creates the third largest electric
utility west of the Mississippi River. PacifiCorp will now have two
energy services division _ Pacific Power &amp; Light Co., headquartered
in Portland, and UP&amp;L, headquartered in Salt Lake City _ serving
about 1.2 million customers.
   The cost of the merger is between $18 million and $20 million,
but PacifiCorp estimates it will save more than $50 million the
first year and $500 million in the first five years of combined
operation.
   The two companies first announced their intentions to merge Aug.
12, 1987. Final regulatory approval, needed from the seven Western
states they serve and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was
received Dec. 19.
   ``We haven't been standing still during the months it's taken to
complete the merger,'' said Gleason, adding the new utility would
``hit the ground running.''
   During the 18-month effort to combine the two companies,
employees from both worked on 16 separate task forces to streamline
the organizations and lower costs, said David Bolender, president of
PacifiCorp's existing electric utility, Pacific Power &amp; Light Co.
   Calculating the average price per share during a 10-day span from
Dec. 19-Jan. 3 at slightly more than $35.71, Utah Power shareholders
will receive 0.909 shares of PacifiCorp stock for each Utah Power
share, the statement said.
   Instructions on the exchange process will be sent to Utah Power
shareholdrs beginning next week, according to the statement.
   Pacific Power will retain its name in the six states it serves:
Oregon, California, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington and Montana. UP&amp;L
will continue to operate under its own name in its present Utah,
Wyoming and Idaho service areas.
   Together, the utility businesses will contribute annual revenues
in excess of $2 billion, or about 70 percent, to PacifiCorp's
consolidated revenue.
   Gleason said PacifiCorp, which was an early leader in electric
utility diversification, will continue to expand into other
businesses. Other activities with which PacifiCorp has become
involved since the 1970s include mining, telecommunications and
financial services.
